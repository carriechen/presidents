We appreciate the important role of Denmark, which has provided maritime assets to safely remove the chemicals from Libya, as well as the significant support provided by Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Finland. The United States helped organize and support this group - the same coalition that enabled the removal of Syria's declared chemical weapons in 2013 and 2014.

EARNEST: Good morning, everybody. A little piece of news before we get started. This morning, aboard Air Force One, the President telephoned FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate to discuss efforts to prepare for the arrival of hurricanes in Florida and Hawaii. In both states, FEMA officials have been working extensively over the last several days to mobilize resources in support of local efforts. The President asked Administrator Fugate to keep him up to date on response efforts and to alert him if there are any significant unmet needs.\nAs always, it is critically important for people in potentially affected areas to follow weather reports and to follow the instructions from state and local officials. But in each case, communities can take some confidence in knowing that local, state and federal officials have been working diligently to prepare for these storms and have resources on hand to respond to them as necessary.\nIn addition to that, I'm joined today by Brian Deese, the President's Senior Advisor who's been leading a lot of our policy issues when it comes to climate change and conservation. I thought I'd give Brian an opportunity to talk just a little bit about the Marine Monument Papah?naumoku?kea that we'll get a chance to see today. And then you guys can ask him questions about that or anything else that may be on your mind today.\nSo, Brian, why don't you get us started?\nMR. DEESE: Good. Thanks. I'll be really brief, but just a little bit of context. By now you've all seen the announcement on the monument expansion and the basic details. But I wanted to put it in a little bit of a context in terms of the way the President approaches these types of conservation efforts.\nI think there's at least three things that are distinct about the President's approach. The first is grounding these efforts in science. If you look back at the stakeholders that spoke up in favor of this monument expansion, it's notable that of the many stakeholders there was a letter signed by 1,500 of the top scientists -- ecologists, biologists -- making the science-based case for expansion of the monument. And the science has developed in the years since President Bush initially designated the monument to both reveal additional deep-sea assets but also identify the connections between the existing monument and the expanded area.\nThe second component of the President's approach is seeking ways to elevate native voices in the management of conservation areas. And so, in this particular incident, it's significant that we will, and by now, committed going forward to entering into an agreement with the Hawaii Department of Natural Resources, the Office of Hawaiian Affairs -- they will be co-trustees in managing the monument going forward and so will have that more formal role in decision-making.\nAnd then the third component is the President spoke quite strikingly yesterday about the connection between conservation and climate change. And I think in this monument in particular, the expansion both in geographical scope but also in the protections afforded to the entire sea column from the deep sea assets and the coral assets, but all the way up to the shallow waters where different predators and others operate is critical to actually maintaining the resilience of this area to climate impacts.\nAnd so the two things we worry the most about are ocean acidification and temperature changes. We're already seeing extraordinary changes in this part of the world. We were just discussing that it's notable right now because of the hurricane activity that is facing Hawaii, but the fact of significant hurricane activity in Hawaii is unique and new; that several years ago there was less frequency of hurricanes in this region. And that is a function of changing climate, and that's a function of changing ocean patterns that fundamentally derive from the ocean. So we have focused this expansion on trying to enhance the climate resilience of this region.\nLast, two fun facts. The first is, to follow up on Josh's correct pronunciation of the monument. For those of you who are tracking this closely, the name Papah?naumoku?kea is actually an important symbol of Hawaiian native tradition. It's actually two components. Papah?naumoku is a reflection of Mother Earth in Hawaiian culture; W?kea is Father Air and Sky. And Hawaiian legend is that those two came together and the union of the two actually created the Hawaiian Island chain. So the full name is for Hawaiian native culture a reflection of the birth of the entire Hawaiian Islands.\nAnd on a less high-minded note, I will note that the Hawaiian name of Midway, where we are going, translates roughly into the Loud Din of Birds -- so that may also be a precursor for what we're about to experience. I'll leave it there.\nMR. EARNEST: That's good. Why don't we go to questions on climate or any of other topics that may be on your mind?\nQ: Can you explain a little bit what you mean by the connection between climate change and conservation? What evidence -- what does the scientific record say about the resilience of conserved ecosystems versus --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think there's a couple things. The first is that climate consideration affects the way you go about conservation. So if you are focused on enhancing climate resilience you want to look at conserving both land and water in a way that will actually optimize for that.\nSo, for example, in the ocean environment, one of the things that the science is increasingly pointing to is the fact -- is the need for scope and scale in conservation in order to actually enhance against the potential impacts of climate.\nAnd so, one of the maps that the Fish and Wildlife Service will have up on the wall, we anticipate, for the briefing today will be to actually show the scale of this monument. And this is a version of it. You guys may have seen this, but the expansion is roughly twice the size of the state of Texas.\nThe question gets asked, why protect such a large area? And one of the answers to that is the emerging climate science, that you actually need to create scale in order to create the ecosystem. I think that in the future, people will look at this and actually see it as a climate refuge because you have a protected space of sufficient scale to actually allow the natural features to become more resilient.\nAnd in the second piece -- and this is both about the marine environment but also land environment -- is that conservation areas can themselves become contributors in the fight against climate change. And that's true in the land sector in terms of carbon sinks. It's also true in the marine environment as well, in terms of helping to avoid an acceleration of ocean acidification or acceleration of temperature increase.\nSo these connections, we're increasingly learning more and more about them, but I think part of what the President was trying reinforce yesterday was that, going forward, we need to understand these two as linked, and we also need to understand the two efforts as going together -- that you can't be an ardent conservationist and stay quiet when it comes to the need for greater actions on climate change, and vice versa.\nQ: Brian, we're often advised not to -- by the administration or by others -- that it's risky to attribute any particular weather event to climate change. So then what is it that's different about these hurricanes where you're able to draw that connection a little bit more directly?\nMR. DEESE: Well, I think I just want to be really clear about what I said, was that we always do make that disclaimer, and it's important, but it's also important to look a trends. And what I was pointing to was that if you look in the Pacific, and you look at Hawaii, in general, the trend over time has been that they are now facing a longer and more frequent hurricane season than they have in the past. And that is something that you can connect back to changing weather patterns that is connected to climate.\nSo we always are very careful about that, but I think it's also important to be able to look at and highlight trends as we identify them.\nQ: Do you see this area as one that has already been measurably impacted by climate change? Have there been changes within either the original monument or the expanded area of the monument that you can see, where you can see changes that indicate that without protection this areas would deteriorate?\nMR. DEESE: Well, I think one of the things that the scientists that I mentioned at the top identified in their letter that they wrote in support of the expansion itself was the risk to the deep sea coral of increased ocean acidification if the boundaries of the monument were not expanded, and that there is a better case now than there was a decade ago that, in order to protect those assets that are on the bottom of the ocean you need to protect a broader area around them. And so that was one of the factors that went into the decision-making process, was that, again, scope is important in trying to avoid some these negative impacts\nQ: -- but there hasn't been any finding that they're actually already deteriorating?\nMR. DEESE: I think at risk is that best way of characterizing it\nQ: Can you explain in very simple terms that the average person might be able to understand the concept of a climate refuge and how that would work in this case?\nAnd, secondly, I understand that the island has been closed to visitors since 2012. I'm wondering whether the President feels that he would like to see more people be able to visit this space, or whether he would rather keep it -- keep tourists and kind of visitors away for the most part.\nMR. DEESE: So to your first question, as the oceans change and as temperatures increase and acidification increases, the risk is of increasing areas of the oceans that become uninhabitable, or less habitable, for all manner of species -- from endangered species like certain forms of turtles to sharks and whales and otherwise. And protecting large areas of the ocean in the way that the President has now done helps to ensure that there will be a large undisturbed area where those species will be able to occupy their current habitat. And that is -- when I say climate refuge, I think that that's what I mean in very practical terms.\nQ: And on people --\nMR. DEESE: I think that that's a decision -- those types of decisions are decisions that the Fish and Wildlife Service and the other agencies that manage this area principally look at based on impacts to the environment. And so I haven't spoken to the President about his personal view on the issue, but I think that we'll be guided by their recommendations going forward.\nQ: Brian, a broader question regarding national monuments. One thing that's come up with some of these recent designations, including the one in the North Woods of Maine, is the idea of private individuals making pretty substantial contributions to put these protected areas into a new status. And obviously there, you had $100 million gift from Roxanne Quimby and her family foundation. Some people have questioned the idea of specific individuals giving such large gifts because in some ways that might end up dictating some of the decisions that the President makes about what areas to safeguard or not. Can you talk about why that is becoming more common and how you navigate this new area?\nMR. DEESE: Sure. Of course, the idea itself is not new. The idea is as old as the concept of the National Parks System where lands held by private individuals have been a part of an effort to contribute to the National Parks System itself and monument designations.\nI think that the most important question I think for the purposes of the National Parks System is do we have smart, science-based management of these monuments going forward? And I think if you look at the type of arrangement that was worked out in the context of Maine and in other areas, the decision-making structures in place should give people confidence that the areas will be managed to the best interest of their public purpose.\nLook, I think that these models actually present real opportunities, because one of the arguments that was powerful in the Maine context was local chambers of commerce arguing that this could be an economic driver for local communities because you're going to increase tourist activity and otherwise. And having resources immediately available to try to invest in the types of assets that help make a place attractive for people who visit helps to make sure that that actually comes to pass.\nAnd so I think that these models are real opportunities, but we just need to keep an eye on making sure that they're managed effectively. And I think that if you look at the details of the way we've done this, I feel confident that that's the case.\nQ: A question about the impact assessment that you have on local fisheries in Hawaii. Where we've just come from, there are a lot of people very concerned that this could negatively affect their income and so on. How can you mitigate that? And do you have a kind of dollar figure for what will be lost in terms of fisheries?\nMR. DEESE: So, again, this one -- it's important to make sure we've got the context right, which is there's an area for small boat operators that is on the Southeastern side that is actually not included in the monument designation, so their activities will not be affected. And the monument designation does not affect recreational fishing or native fishing practices.\nThe key issues is the commercial longline industry, and the best estimate suggests that, currently, somewhere on the order of 6 percent of their catch comes from the area. So a question that gets raised is how is that going to actually affect their bottom line. I think if you look, historically, the best evidence suggests that they are well-positioned to make up that catch in other areas. Remember this is mostly swordfish and tuna. These are species that cover extraordinarily large areas.\nAnd if you look, for example, in 2014, we expanded the Remote Pacific Islands Monument. It was suggested at the time that roughly 5 percent of the longliners' catch came from that. The subsequent year, 2015, the industry had one of their best years ever, which suggests that they are well-positioned to make up their catch in other areas.\nBut, we certainly have heard those concerns and we've taken very seriously. In the pretty long process here of working to engage on the design of the monument, we've definitely heard that. And we are going to continue to work collaboratively on other issue because, for example, they raise, rightly, the concerns that illegal fishing by foreign vessels in a monument area could undermine their economic position but also --\nQ: -- which goes to the question about mechanisms of protection for such a vast area.\nMR. EARNEST: Right -- which is why we have -- in conjunction with this designation, we have a very aggressive interagency approach to try to use new tools to identify, detect, and deter, illegal fishing. And the good news in that case is that the detection technology is improving quite substantially. So we have tools that we didn't have before to actually detect at port and otherwise be -- the location of the catch.\nSo we're going to continue to work really hard on those issues. The interagency effort that's underway is pretty robust and we'll continue to work with the Hawaii longliners on that going forward as well.\nQ: Can we look forward to China a little bit, just to go through the three points that you've mentioned? The first, if you have any update on whether the ratification is going to happen when we get on the ground?\nThe second on the airline emission market -- if you could talk about if, in your discussions and conversations, it seems like there will be an opt-out for developing countries, including China and India, for the first five years of the voluntary period. Does that threaten to undermine the whole goals and is it going to make it harder to get Europe and Northern American allies on board with this agreement?\nAnd then, finally, on Montreal, any update on where China is with you guys on the amendment and whether they're going to be a partner in trying to get that passed -- or what your impressions were?\nMR. DEESE: So, on the first one, I don't have any update. I'll do your third one second -- on HFCs, this is a place where the U.S. and China have collaborated now for a number of years, and the President and Xi have discussed this issue at their level. The difference now is we're really in the final innings of this negotiation, and whereas last year, we were able to get agreement around a framework to bring this resolution in 2016, now we're at the point where the rubber hits the road.\nSo I anticipate that this will be a focus area for the conversation between the two Presidents, and it's an issue, as I said, that they're familiar with and have talked about before. And I think the conversation will about how our two countries can help constructively move toward what is a shared commitment of a successful outcome. We both have committed publicly to a successful outcome, but this is the time for us to get a little bit more concrete. So I anticipate that that will be part of the conversation.\nAnd then on the aircraft emissions front, the ICAO Assembly -- for those of you not following the ICAO Assembly breathlessly -- did report out an approach coming out of their last meetings which included a voluntary phase on the front end. And obviously when you're talking about a global industry, and you're talking about carriers, not countries, that are competing on similar routes, then you are going to need to have a mechanism where everybody is participating in and in the vote.\nThe voluntary mechanism has the potential to help move you into that position, but I think it is going to be important that, between now and when we get to the end, countries indicate their intention with respect to that voluntary approach. So I also expect that that's an issue that will be something that we'll be discussing as well.\nQ: Can you talk a little bit about the President's decision to visit Midway? Obviously, he wanted to do the monument designation, but is this a bucket list thing for him? And how did the idea of actually going and interacting with the wildlife, as you put it, come about?\nMR. DEESE: Sure, I'll go first. I think part of the President's broader approach on the question of climate change over the last couple of years has been to try to ask how he can use all the tools that he has at his disposal to try to raise the profile of this issue, and try to help more people both in the United States or around the world understand and appreciate and connect with the importance of doing more.\nAnd so that was a lot of the impetus that went into the President's Alaska trip last year, where he had raised the idea of wanting to do something like that in order to shine a spotlight on the fact that in America today, in clear and present terms, there are communities and there are areas and regions that are having to make really consequential decisions about their future based on a changing climate. And because the President has a spotlight, him actually going and visiting these places raises the profile in a way that might not happen otherwise.\nAnd so, as we thought about the ways of trying to elevate this question of conservation and the link between conservation and climate change, this monument expansion, what it means substantively -- as we were talking about earlier -- is obviously significant.\nAnd so I think in a similar vein, the President was interested in whether he could use a sensitive opportunity to shine a spotlight on an extraordinary place, an extraordinary part of America, and a case why these types of special and unique places deserve protection, and try to help more Americans and more people across the world see that in real terms.\nMR. EARNEST: I think the only thing that I would add, and as much as the President enjoyed his trip to Alaska last summer, this trip is more personal. This is the President's home state. The President has written extensively and beautifully about his connection to this land and these waters. And I think that's another reason -- Brian has walked through the scientific and historical context for this marine monument designation, but again, it's not a stretch to say that the President feels this personally. He has his own personal connection to this area of the world and this region of our country. And the opportunity to visit a different part of it and to enjoy the land and the waters is something that he's really, really looking forward to.\nWhat else?\nQ: -- what he'll do on the island? We'll see him, we'll be with him, we'll see part of what he does, but when we're not with him, can you tell us a little bit about you think he might be up to?\nMR. EARNEST: I think what I'll do is, on the flight back I'll just come back and tell you what he was -- I'll try to provide a readout of his activities where you're not around him on the way back. That way we can just give you a little more detail about what happens.\nQ: -- for filing purposes because we're not going to be filing -- we're going to be filing on the ground -- is it possible to say, in general terms, what you might be doing?\nMR. EARNEST: I think in general terms, it's fair to say the President's looking forward to spending a little time in the water. And hopefully the weather, when we get there, will cooperate and will allow that to happen.\nBut those of you who have traveled to Hawaii with the President over the holidays know that he really enjoys snorkeling, and there are some unique opportunities to do that out here. So, hopefully, he'll get that opportunity.\nQ: Josh, there's a report out this morning that suggests that the U.S. and world powers agreed to let Iran exceed some thresholds in the nuclear deal because it looked like they weren't going to be able to come into compliance by the date originally laid out in the nuclear agreement. Can you confirm that? And given the deep concerns that critics of this deal, both Democrats and Republicans, had about secret side deals and a lack of transparency about it, why would the U.S. have gone forward with this without disclosing it in a real public way?\nMR. EARNEST: Josh, you won't be surprised to hear me say that we obviously take significant exception to some of the details that are included in the report. It's a rather long report, so there are a couple of details that I can describe to you.\nThe first is with regard to implementation of the agreement, you'll recall that the agreement was reached in July, and the agreement was not implemented until January. The implementation date was not codified in that July agreement. The implementation date was driven by the ability of the IAEA to verify that Iran had completed the steps that they promised to take. The steps they promised to take were very clearly laid out and there were independent, international experts who were given unprecedented access to Iran's nuclear facilities to verify that they had lived up to their commitments.\nThat is what precipitated Implementation Day. Since then, Iran has been in compliance with the agreement. Right now, as we speak, Iran is in compliance with the agreement. That's not my opinion. That's not rhetoric. That's not conjecture. That is a fact that is verified by independent, international experts who, because of the agreement, no have the kind of access that's required to verify it.\nSo before this agreement even went in to effect, our critics said that Iran would never go along with the deal. They were wrong. Iran did sign onto an agreement July of last year. Critics then shifted to saying that Iran would never live up to the commitments that they made in the context of the deal. They were wrong about that. The IAEA has been able to verify their compliance with the agreement.\nThose steps include reducing their nuclear stockpile, their stockpile of nuclear material by 98 percent. They did that. We verified that they did that. The agreement required them to disconnect thousands of centrifuges, about two-thirds of the ones that they were operating. They did that. And those unplugged centrifuges are now under electronic seal so we can monitor their continued compliance with the agreement.\nOur critics said that they would never give up their capacity to use of a plutonium reactor. In fact, Iran followed through by filling the core of their plutonium reactor with concrete. Our critics also suggested that Iran would reap a significant windfall from this agreement. And we've discussed in some length in past about why that hasn't been true either.\nSo the truth is, time and time again, our critics have tried to tear down this agreement, but the facts are simply not on their side when they make this argument. And the report that we've seen and the rhetoric that it has prompted is entirely consistent with the failure of critics of the deal to tear it down.\nSorry for the long answer.\nQ: Just to button that up -- so on the substance of what they're saying, though, is it fair to read the way what you just said is it's not that the U.S. agreed that thresholds could be exceeded but simply allowed implementation to take place later than perhaps had previously been anticipated?\nMR. EARNEST: I do take issue with the implementation thing. Josh we said from the beginning -- and we talked about this a lot last July -- implementation was not going to start until we had verified that Iran had taken all the steps that they'd committed to take as part of the deal. And so there was never a date that we had identified -- there was never a deadline in terms of the calendar. The deadline was driven by Iran's compliance with the agreement, and the ability of the IAEA to verify their compliance with the agreement.\nThe built-in incentive that Iran had to try to live up to these commitments -- disconnect their centrifuges, ship out the nuclear material, render harmless their plutonium reactor -- was driven by their desire to get the benefits of sanctions relief. And we were resolute. The President was resolute in saying that Iran was not going to get any sanctions relief until we had verified that they had taken the necessary steps.\nThat's what Implementation Day was all about. Implementation Day was predicated on the verification of Iran living up to these commitments and the international community initiating steps to offer sanctions relief in exchange. That was Implementation Day. And that Implementation Day was not going to happen any sooner than the IAEA had been able to verify that Iran had complied with the agreement.\nSo I will acknowledge I haven't read the precise report, but the argument that somehow this agreement was implemented before Iran came into compliance is just not true. What we have indicated is that as Iran continues to comply with the agreement, we did establish an international body made up of signatories to the agreement to verify Iran's continued commitments, and as issues arose there would be an opportunity for the international community to sit around the table and work through them.\nBut as I stand here today, somewhere over the Pacific Ocean, I can tell you that Iran continues to be in compliance with the agreement. And there are regular meetings of the Joint Committee. We regularly notify all of you when those kinds of meetings are occurring. And there is a regular mechanism for the IAEA submitting reports to update the international community on the status of the implementation of the agreement.\nBut, look, Josh, this is consistent with the failed effort that we've seen time and time again of critics to try to tear down the deal. Are they doing that for politically motivated reasons? Are they doing that for ideological reasons? Are they doing that to try to explain why they were so wrong from the beginning? I don't know exactly what their motivation is. But when it comes to the core facts of Iran's compliance with this agreement, of Iran's cooperation with a set of historically intrusive international inspections, those facts are irrefutable.\nQ: -- the Russians are de facto rejecting the findings of the U.N. with regard to chemical weapons use in Syria. Given that they're stonewalling, what steps can the administration take to hold the regime accountable for the use of chlorine gas against civilians?\nMR. EARNEST: Andrew, we've expressed concerns for quite some time now about the Assad regime's weaponization of the industrial compound chlorine. In some cases, we've seen the Assad regime fill barrel bombs with chlorine, only making this indiscriminate violence more indiscriminate and more deadly. So we're deeply concerned about that. It is certainly the kind of tactic that has caused the Assad regime to lose legitimacy to lead that country. It has deepened divisions and deepened chaos inside of Syria and it has fueled extremism. And it is immoral for the Russians to provide international cover to the Assad regime as they engage in these kinds of disgusting tactics.\nBeyond that, beyond the questions of morality -- which are not insignificant -- but beyond questions of morality, there are also questions about the Russian strategy. The Russians themselves -- President Putin himself has told all of you that a political transition inside of Syria is necessary to address the many root causes of the situation there, and to provide cover to the Assad regime -- even in the face of the irrefutable evidence about their use of weaponized chlorine. It serves to shore up his ability, Assad's ability, to remain in power. And so there is a fundamental contradiction in their strategy. They say that a political transition is necessary, but yet they are taking steps in Syria and at the U.N. to allow him to cling to power.\nSo until Russia resolves that internal contradiction, it's going to raise questions about their integrity, about the Russian regime's -- the Russian government's integrity. It's going to raise questions about Russia's ability to use their influence with the Assad regime. And it's going to call into question their ability to effectively contribute to the situation in Syria. And we've expressed concerns in the past, and pointed out in the past, that Russia's deepening involvement in the situation is contrary to their own national security and homeland security interests.\nQ: Are the Russians (inaudible) war crimes?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what is true is that Russia has been involved in aiding and abetting that Assad regime's ability to carry out attacks against innocent civilians. The Iranians have been involved in those efforts as well. And that's deeply troubling. It raises questions about the Russian government's ability to wield influence with the Assad regime. It raises questions about the Russian government's integrity, because they make all sorts of claims that are inconsistent with those kinds of actions. And it certainly does raise questions about what kind of impact this is likely to have to Russian interests around the world, but also back at home.\nQ: Yesterday I asked about the concerns that you had gone over on the EU tax issue, and you had talked about maybe looking into it. I'm wondering if you have any information about what the next step might be for the United States t, sort of emphasize these concerns. Is it something that the President or his officials are going to bring up at the G20? And what more can be done to sort of make those points or do something about the issues that you've outlined?\nMR. EARNEST: Roberta, I was very focused in listening to your question, but I thought of one other thing I want to say in response to Andrew's question, which is that -- I do have an answer for you.\nBut, Andrew, I think the other thing to remember is there has been international interest in investigating questions about whether the Assad regime has committed war crimes at the ICC. The Russians have been part of the effort to block those kinds of investigations. So it certainly would raise legitimate questions about Russian complicity in those kinds of heinous acts when Russia is acting unilaterally to prevent an investigation of those acts.\nBack to Roberta's question. I do anticipate that the President will have a discussion -- in fact, lead the discussion -- at the G20 about combatting tax avoidance strategies that are implemented by some multinational corporations. There was a robust discussion at the last G20 meeting in Antalya about what's known as BEPS. This is base erosion and profit shifting, and it goes to the argument that I've made over the last several days which is that there is shared interest in the international community to prevent the erosion of tax bases in countries around the world.\nWe need to find a way to make the global system of taxation more fair -- more fair to countries around the world, particularly countries like the United States, of course. That also means more fairness for U.S. taxpayers.\nBut, look, we also need to find a system that is fairer to companies who are looking to do business around the world. And the U.S. government is not going to hesitate to speak out in support of U.S. companies that are looking to do business around the world. That's good for the U.S. economy, that's good for U.S. workers, but also benefits the international economy.\nBut we need to make sure that there aren't entities or countries acting unilaterally in ways that exacerbate inequities in the global tax structure. And again, the kind of unilateral approach that we have criticized stands in stark contrast to the multilateral approach that the President hopes to advance at the G20 in China.\nQ: Are you hopeful or are you expecting some kind of breakthrough on this at the G20?\nMR. EARNEST: I would be the first to acknowledge that discussions about these kinds of issues are a little esoteric and technical. So even though I know this is an issue that Reuters covers quite closely, and we're glad that you do, I don't know that there going to be any headlines out of the G20 conference in terms of progress that we've made on this issue. But I would anticipate that this is an issue that the President will engage in in the context of discussions at the G20.\nAnd we certainly will look for greater engagement and a greater commitment from countries around the world to engage in a BEPS discussion that could lead to a more fair and more efficient global tax structure.\nAll right?

The Commission's work to evaluate the Veterans Affairs health care system is important in ensuring we keep our promise to our veterans.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "note": "As prepared for delivery.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119196", "text": "Thank you all so much. What an honor and a privilege to speak today to the American Legion.\nI thank Commander Dale Barnett, your vice commanders, and your constitutional officers. You have all done such an incredible job.\nThe men and women of the American Legion represent the best of America. Strength, courage, selfless devotion. Your organization, and its members, have done so much to defend our country, our flag, and to advance the cause of Americanism – not Globalism.\nWe are in your debt.\nI will never let you down.\nTogether, we are going to work on so many shared goals. But I want to begin by discussing one goal that I know is so important to all of you: promoting American pride and patriotism in America's schools.\nIn A Trump Administration, I plan to work directly with the American Legion to uphold our common values and to help ensure they are taught to America's children. We want our kids to learn the incredible achievements of America's history, its institutions, and its heroes.\nWe will stop apologizing for America, and we will start celebrating America.\nWe will be united by our common culture, values and principles – becoming One American Nation.\nOne country, under one constitution, saluting one American Flag.\nThe flag all of you helped to protect and preserve.\nThat flag deserves respect, and I will work with American Legion to help to strengthen respect for our flag – and, by the way, we want young Americans to recite the Pledge of Allegiance.\nIn addition to teaching respect for the flag, we also have to make sure we give our military the tools they need to defend that flag and to deter violence and aggression from our foreign adversaries.\nWe will rebuild our depleted military, and pursue a state-of-the-art missile defense. We will do it based on those three famous words: Peace Through Strength.\nWe will make sure our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines have the best equipment, training and tools in the world – and we will ensure that they have the best medical care in the world, both in service, and when they return home as civilians.\nThat will require a total reform of the Veterans Administration.\nI've laid out a ten-step VA reform plan you can review on my website. Here are the basics:\nI will appoint a Secretary of Veterans Affairs whose personal mission will be to clean up the VA.\nThe Secretary's sole mandate will be to serve our veterans – not bureaucrats, not politicians, but veterans.\nI am going to use every lawful authority to remove and discipline anyone who fails our veterans or breaches the public trust.\nI will appoint a commission to investigate all the wrongdoing at the VA, and then present those findings to Congress as the basis for reforming the entire system.\nWe are going to ensure every veteran in America gets timely access to top-quality care, including the best care in the world for our female veterans.\nThe Veterans health system will remain a public system, because it is a public trust. But never again will we allow any veteran to suffer or die waiting for care.\nThat means Veterans will have the right to go to a VA facility, or the right to see a private doctor or clinic of their choice – whatever is fastest and best for the veteran. The Veteran will be in control.\nShould I have the honor of serving as president, we are also going to start facing the world with confidence again. We are going to uphold the laws of the nation and defend our sovereignty and security – and our border.\nI just came back from a great meeting with the President of Mexico, where I expressed my deep respect for the people of his country, and for the tremendous contributions of Mexican-Americans in our country – including to our Armed Services.\nI want to again thank him for his gracious hospitality, and express my belief that we can work together to accomplish great things for both of our countries.\nWe agreed in the meeting on the need to stop the illegal flow of guns, drugs, cash and people across the border and to take out the cartels.\nWe also talked about the importance of working to keep jobs and wealth in our hemisphere. A more prosperous Mexico means fewer illegal border crossings, and a better market for products made in the United States.\nWhen I am President, I am going to look at every trade deal we have across the world and see what steps must be taken to protect American jobs and create new opportunities for American workers. We will fight for every last American job.\nWe're going to show ourselves and the world again what a strong and growing American economy looks like.\nWe are going to give major tax relief to every worker and small business in this country, bring thousands of new companies and millions of new jobs back to our shores – and unleash an American Energy Revolution.\nWe will also be appointing justices who will defend our Constitution.\nI will nominate men and women to the court who meet the high standard of Antonin Scalia, judges who have the wisdom and integrity to follow the law and not just make it up.\nAbove all, these next four years, I will be uncompromising in the defense of the United States and our friends and allies. We are going to end the era of nation-building, and create a new foreign policy – joined by our partners in the Middle East – that is focused on destroying ISIS and Radical Islamic Terrorism. We will extend the hand of friendship to any nation that will work with us in good faith on this vital mission.\nAt the same time, we will change our immigration screening procedures to help keep terrorists and extremists out of our country. That includes stopping the influx of Syrian refugees. My opponent wants a 550% increase. I, on the other hand, want to build a safe zone overseas – and use the money saved to invest in America.\nIt is time to create a New American Future – for you, your children, and all American children yet to come.\nIn this future, we will have an honest government – and that includes an honest State Department, not Pay-For-Play. Government access and favors will no longer be for sale, and important email records will no longer be deleted and digitally bleached.\nWe will also have an efficient and responsible federal budget – no more waste, no more throwing away taxpayer dollars.\nOnce more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.\nIt will be an inclusive society, one that offers hope and opportunity to every part of this country – including our inner cities. We will ensure that every child in this land, including African-American and Hispanic child, is put on the American ladder of success: a good education, and a great job.\nWe will follow the noble example of our military men and women, working selflessly across all difference races and incomes and backgrounds, to achieve unity and accomplish amazing things.\nLadies and gentlemen of the American Legion, I ask today for the honor of your vote. Working in unison, we can deliver the real American change our country so desperately needs.\nWe will make America Strong Again.\nWe will Make America Proud Again.\nWe will Make America Safe Again.\nWe will Make America Great Again.\nThank you, and God bless.", "timestamp": "2016-09-01", "title": "Remarks to the American Legion in Cincinnati, Ohio"}

We are going to stop the foreign cheating.\nThe era of economic surrender is over.\nA new era of American Greatness is beginning.\nNo state has been hurt worse by the Hillary Clinton trade policies than Ohio.\nHillary Clinton backed her husband's NAFTA, she backed China's entrance into the World Trade Organization, she backed the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, and backed the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\nOne bad deal after another.\nHillary Clinton's donors own her, and she will do whatever they tell her to do.\nOhio has lost nearly 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, and nearly 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since China entered the World Trade Organization.\nOur trade deficit in goods with the world is now nearly $800 billion dollars. This subtracts directly from our growth – our economy grew only 1.1 percent in the last quarter, a total disaster.\nThis is the legacy of Hillary Clinton.\nI am promising a new legacy for America.\nWe are going to create a New American Future.\nBut to do that, we have to stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\nOur trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost the state of Ohio more than 100,000 manufacturing jobs last year. Imagine how many more jobs would be lost if TPP was actually approved.\nHillary Clinton, who called the TPP the \"Gold Standard\", would 100% approve it if she ever got in.\nWe won't let that happen.\nWe will win this election, and we will keep America out of the TPP.\nWe will defend our freedom, our jobs, and our economic independence.\nIt's going to be America First.\nMy economic plan is going to grow this economy, raise your wages, and create millions of new jobs.\nHere are a few of the things we will do:\nA massive tax cut for working Americans.\nWe are going to eliminate regulations that kill American jobs, and that includes getting rid of the Obama Administration's new anti-energy rules that will raise Ohio energy bills by more than 40 percent.\nHillary Clinton says she wants to \"put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.\" Just like she wants to put the steel workers out of business.\nWe are going to put the miners and the steel workers back to work – and we are going to get your energy bills down.\nWe are going to repeal and replace Obamacare, saving another 2 million jobs over the next decade.\nWe are going to create jobs for all of our people, and we are going to fight to ensure that every young African-American and Latino child is put on the ladder of American success: a good education, and a great job.\nAnother major part of our agenda is immigration security. We need to protect American jobs. We need to protect American safety.\nLast night, I outlined a detailed plan to provide jobs, safety and security to the American people with bold new immigration reforms.\nI had a great meeting yesterday with the President of Mexico where we both expressed our shared desire to secure the border, put the cartels out of business, and to keep jobs in our hemisphere.\nLet's also talk about government corruption.\nNo issue better illustrates how corrupt my opponent is than her pay-for-play scandals as Secretary of State.\nHere is one example of Clinton Corruption.\nAs Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton signed off on a deal allowing Russians to take an increased stake in a company called Uranium One, giving up control of about 20 percent of America's uranium supply to the Russians. Clinton's approval of the deal netted the owners of the uranium company millions of dollars. In exchange for signing off on the deal, some of the former owners of Uranium One gave the Clinton Foundation millions of dollars in donations. In addition, Bill Clinton received $500,000 for a speech to a Kremlin-backed investment firm that was a beneficiary of the deal.\nHere is another example of pay-for-play.\nIn 2009, Ericsson telecommunications came under U.S. pressure for selling telecom equipment to several oppressive governments – including Sudan, Syria, and Iran. Some these regimes used those technologies to monitor and control their own people.\nIn June 2011, Hillary Clinton's state department began adding goods and service to a list that might be covered under expanded sanctions on Iran and other state sponsors of terrorism.\nDuring that time, Ericsson sponsored a speech by Bill Clinton, paying him $750,000 – his highest paying speech.\nIn April 2012, the Obama Administration issued an executive order imposing sanctions on telecom sales to Iran and Syria –but those sanctions did not cover Ericsson's work in Iran.\nA Trump Administration will end the government corruption.\nNo one will be above the law.\nWe will have one set of rules for everyone. In Hillary Clinton's world, we have one set of rules for her – and another set of rules for everyone else.\nI am fighting for everyone who doesn't have a voice. The forgotten men and women of America.\nI am your voice.\nHillary Clinton's campaign is funded by Wall Street and hedge fund managers.\nMy campaign is powered by my own money, but also by small dollar donations from working people across this country who want their country back.\nNothing terrifies the ruling class more than when everyday working people give 5, 10, or 15 dollars to our campaign to help us take government away from the special interests and give it back to the voters.\nCome November 8th, we are once again going to have a government that serves you, your family, and your country.\nWe are going to rebuild our depleted military, avoid needless foreign wars, build new friendships overseas, and remember those three famous words: Peace Through Strength.\nWe are going to work with our allies to crush, defeat, and utterly destroy ISIS.\nWe are going to have a new immigration screening test to keep people out of our country who don't support our tolerant values.\nMy tax reforms will add millions of new jobs and thousands of new small businesses.\nMy energy reforms will create millions of new jobs and lower the prince of your energy bill.\nMy trade reforms will raise wages, grow jobs and add trillions in new wealth into our country.\nMy immigration reforms will protect your jobs and stop businesses from exploiting visas programs that hurt poor workers.\nMy infrastructure plans will rebuild your roads, bridges and airports.\nMy regulatory reforms will make it easier for African-Americans small businesses to thrive, and for young children to live out their dreams.\nMy promise of school choice, charter schools and merit-pay for teachers will help low-income students in our inner cities. Hillary Clinton discriminates against poor African-American children by opposing school choice.\nMy government reforms will make your voice heard – not the voice of the special interests.\nEvery insider, getting rich off of our broken system, is throwing money at Hillary Clinton.\nIt's the powerful protecting the powerful.\nInsiders fighting for insiders.\nI am fighting for you.\nEvery day you turn on the nightly news, you hear about how some self-interested banker or some Washington insider says they oppose our campaign. Or some encrusted old politician says they oppose our campaign. Or some big time lobbyist says they oppose our campaign.\nI wear their opposition as a badge of honor. Because it means I am fighting for REAL change, not just partisan change. I am fighting – all of us across the country are fighting – for peaceful regime change in our own country. The media-donor-political complex that's bled this country dry has to be replaced with a new government of, by and for the people.\nI will fight to ensure that every American is treated equally, protected equally, and honored equally. We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms, and seek a new future of security, prosperity and opportunity – a future built on our common culture and values as one American people.\nI am asking for your vote so I can be your champion in the White House.\nTo every parent who dreams for their children, and to every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I'm with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you.\nTogether, We Will Make America Strong Again.\nWe Will Make American Safe Again.\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\nThank you, and God Bless.", "timestamp": "2016-09-01", "title": "Remarks at the Roberts Centre in Wilmington, Ohio"}

So I want to bring out who's joining me, our guests today. And what we did is we took all the names of every Howard freshman and we randomly drew one, and it just turned out to be Nick Cannon. (Laughter.) Give it up. (Applause.)\nYou ready to do this?\nMR. CANNON: Let's do it. You all ready? (Applause.) You guys are overdressed. (Laughter.) My bad.\nMR. MEYERS: This is great. It's great to be out here with you. But I feel like -- should we bring one more person out?\nMR. CANNON: We got to, man.\nMR. MEYERS: Okay. Everybody, give it up for the First Lady. (Applause.) Wow. I have to be honest, I do not usually get standing ovations like that. Thank you.\nMR. CANNON: You all knew Nick Cannon didn't have no Secret Service. (Laughter.)\nMRS. OBAMA: You were a good decoy.\nMR. CANNON: Yes.\nMR. MEYERS: Very, very good decoy.\nMRS. OBAMA: You guys surprised? (Applause.)\nMR. MEYERS: Well, I want to get started. I want to ask you guys some questions. Mrs. Obama, I'm going to start from you and ask, what did you gain from your college experience? And then, Nick, what do you hope to gain for you upcoming college experience.\nBut we'll start with you.\nMRS. OBAMA: You know, what can I -- college was probably the most impactful thing that I have done in my life other than being the First Lady and having kids and marrying Barack Obama. (Laughter and applause.) But college did everything for me. I mean, it built my confidence, number one. It taught me that I could leave home and be successful away from home. It taught me how to open up, how to try new things that are scary, how to buck expectations and beat the odds, and all that good stuff.\nSo, I mean, this is one of the reasons why we promote Reach Higher and getting kids to own their future and go to college, if possible, because it changes your life. It just opens up a world of opportunity. And I hope that that is true for each and every one of you as you start -- many of you are starting your college careers here at Howard. Just try new things. Don't be afraid. Step out of your comfort zones and soar, all right? (Applause.)\nMR. CANNON: I get the question all the time. It's like, you're already established in your career, why go back to school? And honestly, I'm not here for a degree, I'm here because I have a real thirst for knowledge. And I feel like that's why we're all here in this room. But honestly, because I felt like I've done so many things in my career and I've always been the youngest and the first to do so many things in entertainment, but I always felt like people would surpass me that had the experience of college. And I was jealous of that. And then, obviously even once I became a father and I wanted to be an example for my kids, I was like, well, I'm always talking about being an advocate for education, I got to walk the walk. And that's why I'm here.\nMRS. OBAMA: So proud.\nMR. MEYERS: And you said you're often the first, but you actually have a sibling at school here.\nMR. CANNON: Yeah. I got -- my brother's here. He's a junior and he don't want to hang out with me because I'm a freshman. (Laughter.)\nMRS. OBAMA: He's embarrassed by you. (Laughter.) You're just a young freshman.\nMR. MEYERS: And so, Mrs. Obama, how would your peers have described you in college? What sort of college student were you?\nMRS. OBAMA: Oh, that's a good question. I should have called by old roommate. I think people -- my friends would say I was funny, kind of silly. You may have noticed that over the last eight years that I can be a little silly. But I took my education pretty seriously. I mean, I knew how much it was costing my parents to send me. I knew my father had taken out a loan, and he was a blue-collar worker, so I knew I had to get it together and make sure I was doing my best.\nSo I tried to be a serious student and not procrastinate, but I was still somebody that would be described as somebody who liked to have fun, too, and go to the occasional party, or two or three. (Laughter.) A little turn-up. So I don't think I was that much different than I am now. And that's why I think is important, is hold on to your authentic self, even in this experience, as you grow and achieve. It's like, remember who you always were, where you came from, who your parents were, how they raised you. Because that authentic self is going to follow you all through life, so make sure that it's solid so it's something that you can hold on and be proud of for the rest of your life.\nMR. MEYERS: When you walked into parties in college, did you get a standing ovation like you did today?\nMRS. OBAMA: No. (Laughter.) No, no.\nMR. MEYERS: It took a while. It took a while to develop that?\nMRS. OBAMA: No, no, no. No one knew me. (Laughter.) But I appreciate it now. I do, I do.\nMR. MEYERS: So, Nick, how did you choose Howard? And follow-up question, how are you going to manage to be a college student, considering you have nine jobs? (Laughter.)\nMR. CANNON: This is the mecca. There's no other place to be but here. (Applause.) When you think of such a prestigious institution, I mean, I'm a huge fan of so many of the alumni, like Paul Lawrence Dunbar, so many people that have really been impactful in our community throughout the years. This was a place where when I thought about school -- I mean, because there were even other opportunities, or people like, oh, you want to go here, well, you can be a part of this film program. I was like, nah, I have to go an HBCU and I have to go to the only one that really just inspired me from the beginning. (Applause.) SO H-U!\nAUDIENCE: You know!\nMR. CANNON: That's what I'm talking about.\nMRS. OBAMA: That was good! Do that again.\nMR. CANNON: H-U!\nAUDIENCE: You know!\nMRS. OBAMA: You just wanted to be close to me. (Laughter.)\nMR. CANNON: Very true. Very true. And at the same time -- and as a college student, I'm learning this even more -- it's all about time management. And to be able -- I'm pretty sure we have some athletes in here and people with other extracurricular activities. I just consider all my other jobs extracurricular activities. But school is first and foremost, and I'm building my schedule around my classes, and then everything else is --\nMRS. OBAMA: You know what, and this is what I want you all to think about, is Nick's got jobs. And you may have a job, like me -- I had work-study. So, I mean, many of us have jobs. But the notion that he can hold down full-time jobs and still get what he can get done, done, is a testament that you can do this, okay? I want to make sure you all know. It is time management. And that means that Nick, as an adult with kids and a job, he knows he just can't procrastinate, they every hour matters.\nBut you have more than enough time, let me tell you. What, you have a couple of classes a day over the -- a few days a week, not even every day, right? Right? Every day you guys have class? Maybe by sophomore year it will start -- but you all have time to get it done. That's what I want you all to tell yourselves. You have time to handle this, right? So just keep that in mind. It may feel overwhelming, and that's one of the reasons why we're here, because we want you all to be successful. You're that first class. We want you to get through. So when it gets tough, just understand -- pull back, just reorganize your time, and know that you can make it happen. And reach out for help when you need it, okay?\nMR. CANNON: And I'm in it with you all, so you all can help me too. We in this together. So I think it's probably --\nMR. MEYERS: But just because he's Nick Cannon don't let him cheat off your test or anything. (Laughter.)\nMR. CANNON: Aw, man.\nMR. MEYERS: What's your name, sir?\nQ: Chaz Westwick (ph), a sophomore information systems major from Gwinnett County, Georgia.\nMR. CANNON: Tell it all!\nQ: Yeah, I'm also a team leader here in SOB, and I'm also a Howard University campus (inaudible). But basically, I want to know, if you could change one thing about your freshman year, what would it have been?\nMRS. OBAMA: Change one thing? Oh, I probably would have tried more things. I mean, I don't know how many freshmen are in the room, but it takes you a second to get adjusted right? I mean, sometimes -- you know, you're still sort of wondering, should I make friends? Should I go out? Should I sign up for clubs? The answer is yes -- yes, yes, yes. I mean, you all, as freshmen, should not be spending time alone in your rooms, unless you're studying. And when you're not, get out there. Push past your comfort zone. Meet people. Introduce yourself to people. Don't think that people are going to come to you. And I wish I had known that, because I probably would have taken a few more risks and come out freshman year a little stronger, even a little more confident. So don't feel like you have to do this alone. And I wish I had come to that even earlier than I did.\nSo it's first semester? You guys have semesters, right? First semester, get out there. Just assume that everyone wants to know you, okay? Just assume that, right? (Laughter.) They want to know me. And don't worry about adjusting. You'll feel at home in a matter of weeks. Probably by October you will feel like this is your home.\nMR. CANNON: Awesome. Great advice. Great advice. Who do we have next? Do we have another question?\nQ: Hi, my name is Emanuela Haye (ph). I'm a freshman, international business major, French minor, from Wilma, Illinois. I was curious, what was your major in college? And did you major end up pertaining to your career?\nMR. MEYERS: Well, I was -- first of all, I went to North --\nMRS. OBAMA: Give real good advice, Seth.\nMR. MEYERS: -- I used to live in Wilma. So nice to see you.\nMRS. OBAMA: Hometown boy.\nMR. CANNON: You all cousins.\nMY. MEYERS: There you go -- we're cousins. I was lucky enough to know what I wanted to do. I knew my passion to some degree. So I was a radio/tv/film major in college. I thought I wanted to be a film director, and then I realized I didn't -- wasn't good at it. But I was lucky enough to know that that's what I wanted to do, and I studied things that I wanted to do. But I was very lucky. The most important thing that happened to me was an extracurricular activity, which is my school had an improv comedy troupe, which I ended up auditioning for and getting in that, and that ultimately set me up on my path to where I ended up.\nSo it's nice to both take classes you want to do. But speaking as well to the importance of extracurricular activities, sometimes that might be the thing that inspires your next chapter.\nMRS. OBAMA: Excellent.\nMR. CANNON: Next question. Or did you --\nMRS. OBAMA: I was a sociology major. And it had nothing to do necessarily with law, which is ultimately -- I went to law school. But what I tried to do was choose something that I was passionate about, or something that I cared about. Because you know with a major, by junior, senior year, that's what you're going to focus on. So you want to look over the courses of your major and figure out whether this is what you're going to be interested in doing. So it should be something that's going to give you joy. At my college, you had to write a junior paper and a senior thesis, so I knew that I needed a topic that I would want to write more than 100 pages about. So I was interested in the study of people and human behavior. That was something that interested me. And it was also good because I knew if I wanted to go to law school, I'd need to get good grades. And to get good grades, I'd have to study something I cared about instead of something people thought I should study. And it worked.\nMR. CANNON: Preach!\nMRS. OBAMA: It worked!\nMR. MEYERS: Nick, question for you. True story that you were buying books today?\nMR. CANNON: Uh, yes.\nMR. MEYERS: And you had to take an ID photo?\nMR. CANNON: I did. I got my ID. I'm official. And I did -- books are expensive. (Laughter.) Man. (Applause.) I'm in it with you all.\nAll right, so who else has a question for Seth or the First Lady?\nQ: Hi, I'm Shauntee Foctor (ph), a sophomore marketing major from Princeton, New Jersey. And my question is, what did your freshman year teach you about yourself?\nMR. CANNON: Great question.\nMRS. OBAMA: That's a good question. I need to think about that. Seth doesn't think before he answers. (Laughter.)\nMR. MEYERS: Yeah, I just answer and worry about I later. I learned a lot about hygiene. (Laughter.) For real. I think my first month of college I thought, this is the best, I don't have my parents.\nMRS. OBAMA: Were you the smelly freshman?\nMR. MEYERS: I was a bad -- yeah, I was not a jackpot roommate. And you realized, though, this is not -- I mean, that's a joke, but the truth is, you kind of have to take care of yourself. You have to figure out how to eat and how to do laundry, and you just realize -- I realized what an incredible support system, particularly my mother, had been in my life. And I remember -- well, this is a true story about you.\nWe sat next to each other at the White House Correspondents' Dinner in 2011, and my mother called me --\nMRS. OBAMA: He didn't smell.\nMR. MEYERS: I didn't smell. But my mother called me and said, \"Please, please use good table manners while you're eating next to the First Lady, because I will be devastated if you put your elbows on the table, or your pick up a pea with your fingers. I am your mother, and this reflects on me.\" So ultimately, the thing I would say I learned about myself is that you have a now personal responsibility to do a lot of the things that you took for granted that your parents did for you.\nMRS. OBAMA: That was good, wasn't it? Preach on being clean! (Laughter.) Do your laundry. Change your underwear. (Laughter.)\nMR. MEYERS: Unless they're lucky underwear and you have a test. I think that's very important.\nMRS. OBAMA: Well, for me, I think it taught me that I could pretty much do anything. Because I know I've told this story before, but when I applied to colleges I had people who told me that I was reaching too high, that the schools I was applying to were too much for me. And then I got there, and I looked around and I thought, I'm as smart as these people, what were they thinking?\nSo there are a lot of people who will try to step on your confidence based on their assumptions about who they think you are. And what you have to remember is that you are competent and capable and able to do it. And I learned that. After graduating from college, I really didn't feel like there was anything I couldn't do, because I was so worried that maybe they were right about me going to this college. They were so wrong. So completely wrong.\nSo for all of you sitting here with those doubts in your head, because those whispers of doubt, they stay with you for a very long time -- ignore them. Brush them off. And just do the work. Do the work. And it's the doing of the work that gets you through. It's not what other people think of you. And I still carry that with me today as First Lady of the United States, because there are people who don't think I should be doing that, either. And it's been about eight years now. (Laughter.)\nMR. MEYERS: I want to say that is so unfair that you made me go first, because I said I learned that I didn't know basic hygiene, and then you said I learned I could do anything. (Laughter.) Very unfair.\nMRS. OBAMA: I told you to think first.\nMR. CANNON: Wisdom, definitely. Do we have another question?\nQ: Hello. I'm Mark Witsmith (ph). I'm a legal communications major. I'm also part of the marching band, thanks to Nick Cannon.\nMR. CANNON: Hey!\nMRS. OBAMA: That's sweet. You watched Drumline?\nQ: Yes, that's why I joined.\nMRS. OBAMA: That's so cute.\nMR. CANNON: We're going to battle after this. (Laughter.)\nMRS. OBAMA: Yeah, we can do a battle. We talked about that.\nQ: Anyway, did you have any internship experiences? And did that help you get you to where you are now?\nMRS. OBAMA: I had to do work-study. And I know how many people have work-study. A lot of people here? Or was I the only one that had to work-study in college? Well, I had a work-study job because I had to help pay for my tuition. So you've got the work-study jobs that are like you sitting in the library doing security or, you know -- it helps you because you can study. I actually had a job that connected me to somebody who was my first, most important, mentor. I worked for the school's minority center, so I was an assistant, but the executive director of that center, she pushed me to think broadly about my experience. So, she helped me start an after-school program for kids of faculty and I travelled to New York for the first time because of her.\nAnd so I was fortunate to have a work-study job that actually taught me something. But if I hadn't had that, I don't about you, I couldn't afford to do free internships, which is usually what an internship is, because I had to go home and work and type and earn money.\nBut I would urge you all to think about internships. You know, even if you have to earn some money, figure out how you can do some of these things. Because it's the internships, as Seth said, it's the extracurricular activities that will give you a sense of what real life is like. You know, school is very theoretical and some people are good at that. But some people need more practical experience -- I know I did. And internships give you those opportunities to try some ideas for yourself on, to try some careers on.\nSo you want to think about how you use your summers and how you use your free time just -- because even if you have to work, maybe you have some spare time to do some community service. You all should be thinking about that, because it's also resume-building for what you want to do. Whether it's graduate school or whether it's work afterwards, it's the internships that will give you the things that you can talk about with the people who want to hire you. So keep that in mind.\nSeth, you had time to think about this one.\nMR. MEYERS: I did. (Laughter.) I did. Well, I would only say -- we have interns at our show. Every semester we have a different group of about 15 come in. And the only thing I would say is, when you do get those internships, you think you are invisible because you are the low man on the totem pole and people have you running around doing things that you will think is below your skill level. But I will tell you everyone is noticing how hard a worker you are. And not only do you have to present the best version of yourself here at school, but when you get out into the real world, you get an internship and it's hard because you know you're not getting paid, and you're thinking maybe I can go 80 percent. But I can tell you, that even as someone who hosts the show, I notice which interns are working harder, and that's such an important gateway to getting into the actual working world. So, take it seriously.\nMRS. OBAMA: Yeah, just to echo that, the person who is -- who are my key personal assistants as First Lady now, who are paid to do that work, they were interns first. So they were interns in the White House because they were good, they got noticed, they came up, and now they spend 24/7 with me. They tell me what to do, when to drink, when I can stand, when I can leave. And they are like young too, so my life in controlled by like twenty-something-year-olds. It's really annoying. (Laughter.)\nMR. CANNON: I think we have time for one last question. What's your name, sir?\nQ: Hi. Good afternoon. My name is Alfred (inaudible), freshman civil and environmental engineer, and future changer of the world --\nMRS. OBAMA: You are cute. (Laughter.) Ladies. (Laughter.)\nQ: -- from Prince George's County, Maryland. And my question to ask you today is, what are some constructive ways to de-stress from classwork?\nMR. MYER: Constructive ways to destress? Well, I have a way. (Laughter.)\nMRS. OBAMA: Constructive.\nMR. MYER: Constructive?\nMR. CANNON: That's the key word there.\nMR. MYER: I like to go into my -- I would go into my dorm room and I would turn all the lights off. And then I would just lie face-down on the carpet. (Laughter.) And I would whisper over and over to myself, \"You have to stop screwing up.\" (Laughter.) And then you would just do that until the sun comes up. (Laughter.)\nI found it helpful, but you just laugh it off. Whatever. I support your answers.\nMRS. OBAMA: You know, that was interesting. That was interesting. De-stress, it's like, this is where your friends come in, right? You know, I remember when I was in college, some of the best times would be just hanging out with the people that you love laughing. You know, finding some humor in this situation that is college and life, and doing it with a little music and some food.\nI still do that, you know. De-stressing now, it's like spending time with good friends to good music and laughter. Laughter is a huge de-stressor. So make sure you get that in.\nMR. MEYERS: And one of the places to get it is \"Late Night with Seth Meyers.\" (Laughter.) And again -- I just think -- (applause) -- NBC.\nMRS. OBAMA: Well done, well done.\nMR. CANNON: That was a great Q&A.\nMR. MEYERS: So you know, as we're wrapping up here, to both of you I would like to say, if the students can only remember one thing from this, that would be bad because they should be able to remember more -- (laughter) -- but if you could give them one thing to remember, what would you like to leave them with?\nMR. CANNON: Me? I'm a student. I shouldn't have to answer this.\nBut honestly, really just whatever you put your mind to, you can do it. I've always been taught that not only do you have to be a self-motivator, because there's going to be a lot of haters that tell you you can't do something and you -- so you have to motivate yourself. But on top of that, you've got to have a corresponding action and be a self-generator. And we live in a time when we can generate opportunities for one another. So whether it's networking, talking to people, whether it's creating your own ideas, it doesn't just start with \"yes, I can do it, yes, I can do it.\" It has to be, \"yes I can do it and I will do it.\"\nMR. MEYERS: Very good.\nMRS. OBAMA: He's pretty good for a freshman. (Laughter.)\nYou know, this is the thing I tell everybody, even my kids because I've got a young person heading off to a gap year because she's not going to college, so I'm feeling your parents' pain right now.\nOne thing I want you all to remember is that failure is an important part of success. Nobody up here went a straight line to success. There are bumps and slip-ups and embarrassments that you think you will never overcome. Everyone has had it, from the President on up or down, whichever way you look at it.\nThe thing that you can't do it hide from your failures and not seek help when you are struggling. And a lot of times, young people do that. They want to hide from their challenges as opposed to embracing them, and that's something that you learn when you grow up because you've had so many embarrassments, you're just used to being embarrassed and failing. So you're good at recovering from it.\nBut it's resilience that gets you through. The people who are successful aren't the people who succeed all the time, it's the people who can recover when they fail. And remember that. Remember that. There are people here who love you, who are here, they want you to succeed. Colleges want you to graduate. It helps them. Their attrition numbers improve because you graduate. So there are people all over the place that are waiting to just give you a hand if things start feeling a little hard.\nAnd that's not just academic, it's emotional, it's psychological. All of that is here for you. But you can't -- don't think you have to do this alone. Because nobody does anything hard or good or important alone. And that goes for getting through college.\nMR. MEYERS: How about a round of applause, everybody, for freshman, Nick Cannon, and the First Lady. Thank you all so much, have a great freshman year. (Applause.)\nMR. CANNON: H-U!\nAUDIENCE: You know! (Laughter.)\nMRS. OBAMA: You got it.", "timestamp": "2016-09-01", "title": "Remarks by the First Lady, Nick Cannon and Seth Meyers in a Discussion with Howard University Students"}

You can read the full post  HERE.\nPosted by Jason Goldman on September 1, 2016 at 7:30PM EDT\nSummary: On Monday, October 3, we're celebrating the spirit of innovation with the first-ever White House South by South Lawn.\nEarlier this year, President Obama traveled to South by Southwest in Austin for a conversation on civic engagement and to challenge creative thinkers and entrepreneurs from across the country to help tackle our toughest challenges. On Monday, October 3, we're celebrating that spirit of innovation with a White House event called South by South Lawn.\nSouth by South Lawn, an event inspired by South by Southwest, will bring together creators, innovators, and organizers who work day in and day out to improve the lives of their fellow Americans and people around the world.\nDo you know someone who's doing great work and should be there? You can nominate yourself or someone you know below.\nIn coordination with the American Film Institute (AFI), the President's Committee on Arts and Humanities (PCAH), and South by Southwest, the South Lawn event will be comprised of three parts:\n•      INTERACTIVE: Panel discussions throughout the day will explore topics like how to make change stick with organizers who are having an impact, as well as a discussion with influencers who are using their platforms to bring about positive change. Interactive booths will encourage attendees to engage with and learn about new technologies and innovations.\n•      FILM: The film portion features the 3rd Annual White House Student Film Festival in association with its founding partner, the American Film Institute.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122617", "text": "In celebration of today's opening of the World Conservation Congress, which the United States is hosting for the first time, President Obama last night addressed leaders from Pacific Island Conference of Leaders and the World Conservation Congress, and today he is traveling to Midway Atoll in the newly expanded Papah?naumoku?kea Marine National Monument.\nAt Midway, the President will discuss the fact that climate change is already altering the structure and function of ecosystems, changing the distribution and abundance of plants and animals, and in many cases limiting the ability of lands and waters to provide critical services to communities.\nAs part of this week's events, the Administration is announcing nearly $40 million in new programming to enhance resilience to climate change and advance clean-energy development by building regional, national, and local capacity in the Pacific Islands to prepare for and help mitigate the negative impacts of climate change. These steps come as sea level rise and the increased strength and frequency of catastrophic weather events pose an existential threat to places most vulnerable to their impacts, such as the Pacific Islands. In addition, and consistent with the theme of this year's World Conservation Congress, the Administration is announcing policies to promote conservation and combat climate change by protecting wildlife, oceans, and lands.\nThroughout the week, senior Administration officials, including Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell, are attending the World Conservation Congress to discuss these steps and hear directly from leaders in government, business, NGOs, Indigenous groups, and youth groups on a broad range of topics related to conservation and climate change.\nBuilding Regional, National, and Local Capacity to Prepare for Climate Change\nThe United States is announcing new investments over the coming years to build regional, national, and local capacity in the Pacific Islands to enhance resilience to climate change.\n•      Building Regional Capacity through the Institutional Strengthening in Pacific Island Countries to Adapt to Climate Change (ISACC) Program: Under this program the United States intends to invest up to $5 million to support regional organizations, which are critical to address the collective needs of Pacific Islands. The program will leverage the substantial regional expertise and professional networks of the Pacific Community (SPC), the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP), and the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat (PIFS). The program will embed climate-adaptation coordinators from the three partner organizations in eight Pacific Island countries to provide technical assistance and train key staff of national climate-change agencies.\n•      Building National Capacity through the Climate Ready Program: The United States will be launching a new program to enhance the resilience of Pacific Island nations. Under the Climate Ready program, USAID is announcing $9 million to help national governments develop and implement policies that promote resilience, enhance access to climate finance, and improve national capacity to manage and monitor adaptation programs. Climate Ready will engage in twelve Pacific Island nations: the Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.\n•      Building Local Capacity for Climate Change Adaptation: To enhance the capacities of communities and governments in the Pacific Islands to reduce the risk of disasters, the United States is announcing $15 million in disaster risk reduction programs next year, and will continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with Pacific Island countries to prepare for natural disasters in the face of a changing climate.\nIn addition, seven new local recipients have been awarded a total of over $1.7 million by the Pacific American Climate Fund, which overall has provided 22 grants valued at $9.5 million to civil- society organizations across the Pacific Islands, to help communities adapt to the impacts of climate change. Specifically, the grants will support community-based farmers in Fiji, a women's council in the Federated States of Micronesia, and vulnerable communities in Samoa, the Solomon Islands, and Palau.\nFinally, USAID will continue its ongoing community-based initiatives that help particularly at-risk communities better prepare for and respond in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. For example, in Vanuatu, USAID helped to reintroduce indigenous preparedness practices, such as safe water collection and food-preservation techniques that, in the wake of Tropical Cyclone Pam, enabled affected communities to survive until the arrival of international assistance. In Papua New Guinea, USAID supports community- and provincial-level DRR investments that enable community members and policy makers to identify and mitigate the increasing effects of climate-change-induced hazards. In Micronesia and the Marshall Islands, USAID trains school-aged children and community members in climate change and community preparedness. And across the Pacific, USAID is investing to develop strong, local Red Cross Societies to help countries better manage disasters and to ensure that community-preparedness work is sustainable and fully institutionalized.\n•      Contributing to the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment and Financing Facility: The United States will contribute $8 million to a World Bank multi-donor trust fund to support the creation of a disaster and climate risk insurance facility for Pacific Islands (\"the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative (PCRAFI) Facility\"). The PCRAFI multi-donor trust fund will establish a long-term, sustainable insurance facility to provide climate- and disaster-risk insurance products to the Pacific Islands countries. It will also support technical assistance to these countries and related regional organizations to bolster capacity to assess and manage climate and disaster risks, with the overall objective of strengthening the financial resilience of Pacific Islands to climate and natural disaster risks.\nExpanding Research on Climate Migration and Relocation\nThe United States is committed to engaging with the international research community to understand how to build a comprehensive approach to reduce the risk of climate-related displacement and manage the consequences of unplanned migration while also harnessing the opportunities of voluntary, planned migration and community relocation. This research can help facilitate migration and community relocation as effective adaptation and coping strategies to the effects of climate change.\n•      Symposium on Climate Migration: The Council on Environmental Quality, in collaboration with Hawaii and Alaska Sea Grant College Programs, the William S. Richardson School of Law at the University of Hawai'i Manoa, and the National Sea Grant Law Center, will host a Symposium on Climate Displacement, Migration, and Relocation in December 2016. The Symposium will provide an opportunity for stakeholders, researchers, policy experts, indigenous leaders, and local, State, and Federal, government officials to explore legal and policy opportunities and challenges arising from climate displacement. This includes questions about how to plan for and implement voluntary migration and community-led relocation as adaptation strategies to the impacts of climate change, both domestically and in the context of the Pacific Islands.\nFacilitating the Transition to a Cleaner Energy Future\nAlthough they are not large emitters of greenhouse gases, the Pacific Islands are committed to combating climate change and to making major changes in their energy profiles as part of their Nationally Determined Contributions within the Paris Agreement. The United States is committed to helping the Pacific Islands increase their resources and technical expertise in order to develop a comprehensive approach to energy transformation.\n•      Energy Excelerator Targeting Half a Billion Investment in Clean Energy: The Energy Excelerator, a public-private partnership financed through the U.S. Navy and located in Hawaii, is setting the goal of achieving half a billion dollars in total private, follow-on investment in companies in its accelerator program, including those developing clean-energy technologies for the Pacific Islands, by September 2017. This effort builds upon the $350 million already raised by the accelerator's 42 companies to create innovative clean-energy technologies to support Pacific Islands in transitioning to cleaner sources of energy, agriculture, and transportation. (Of the 42 companies, 23 are already actively deploying solutions in the Pacific Islands.)\n•      Developing a New Pacific Energy Transition Program: The U.S. Department of Energy and the State Department are announcing the creation of a new Energy Transition Initiative Pacific Program to assist Pacific Islands with their transition away from imported fuels. Building on U.S. government technical assistance delivered to Caribbean nations under the Caribbean Energy Security Initiative, and ongoing successful Energy Transition Initiative efforts in Hawaii and the U.S. Virgin Islands, this new effort will bring the lessons learned and technical assistance to the Pacific Islands, including those setting ambitious targets to deploy clean energy. To initiate this process, the Department of State, Department of Energy, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), and the Pacific Community (SPC) are announcing they will host a workshop to provide regional governments with concrete strategies for implementing an Energy Transition Initiative model in their countries, to identify specific areas for follow-on technical assistance and/or advisory support, and to facilitate access to Green Climate Fund and sources of finance for clean-energy projects. This workshop will support IRENA's Small Islands Developing States (SIDS) Lighthouses Initiative?.\nPromoting Conservation\nThe United States is continuing our leadership in addressing conservation challenges across the continent and globe, from the Hawaiian Islands, known as the \"extinction capital\" of the world, to Africa, where elephant poaching is a gruesome reality. New, innovative approaches to conservation, including conservation finance and mapping technology, are taking hold, alongside of long-tested strategies like land protection and smart public-land management.\nReleasing the State of Conservation in North America Report: The Department of Interior is releasing the State of Conservation in North America Report, which highlights progress in protecting 12 percent of all land in North America under the highest protection standards. The analysis and information in the report create a baseline for progress in protecting important ecosystems and can offer a catalyst for future conservation actions in the United States and with international partners.\nSigning an Arrangement with the Vietnam Biodiversity Agency: The United States Geological Service will establish a partnership and conclude an arrangement with the Vietnam Biodiversity Agency to offer scientific and technical support of their effort to revise the Vietnam Biodiversity Conservation Law. The arrangement will be a \"Project Annex\" to the 2010 MOU signed by DOI and the country of Vietnam's Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, which provided a framework for the exchange of scientific and technical knowledge with respect to earth sciences and effective management of natural resources.\nLaunching the Next Generation Conservation Ambassadors Program: The Department of Interior will also launch an international mentorship partnership, Next Generation Conservation Ambassadors, which will involve matching subject-matter experts from the Department of the Interior with young people working on various conservation-related topics in other countries. Topics may include but are not limited to water management, historical preservation, land management, relationships with indigenous people, climate change, wildlife monitoring, and habitat restoration. Mentors will provide input, counsel, and guidance for one year. This program will provide avenues to share our expertise and knowledge with emerging young leaders from other countries, furthering a vision for comprehensive, collaborative approaches toward addressing climate change.\nRestoring Humpback Whale Populations around the Globe: NOAA will announce its final decision to remove 10 populations of humpback whales from the endangered species list, including almost all the populations found around North America. This is continued evidence that U.S. efforts to protect and restore thousands of endangered animals and plants are working.\nSupporting the Expansion of Large-Scale Marine Protected Areas: In 2015, NOAA and partners launched a multi-year effort to provide a foundation of publicly accessible baseline data and information from the deepwater areas of central and western U.S. Pacific Islands marine protected areas (MPAs). Recent and planned expeditions using vessels such as NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer are informing priority MPA science and management needs such as the identification and mapping of vulnerable marine habitats like high-density, deep-sea coral and sponge communities. To continue to support the global expansion of large-scale MPAs, NOAA vessels in 2017 will total more than 200 days at sea; include complementary work across multiple research vessels;; and improve fundamental understanding of at least four existing MPAs.\nIssuing a Unified Strategy with the International Oceanographic Commission (IOC): NOAA's Ocean Service will later this month conclude a formal unified strategy with the International Oceanographic Commission (IOC), ensuring closer coordination between the U.S. Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON) and international ocean observing and data networks such as the Global Ocean Observation System (GOOS) and the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS). This will improve the acquisition, delivery and application of information on change in the marine environment, and support marine conservation and decision-making at the national, regional, and global levels.\nAnnouncing New Grants to Combat Wildlife Trafficking: USAID and partner organizations will announce the grand prize winners of the Wildlife Crime Tech Challenge, whose innovative technology has the best potential to strengthen forensic evidence, reduce consumer demand or address the corruption that fuels poaching and illegal trafficking. The Fish and Wildlife Service will announce $1.3 million in grant funding for combating wildlife trafficking. Up to 13 grants will contribute to efforts to reduce demand for illegally traded wildlife products. The grant program was developed as part of the Implementation Plan which resulted from President Obama's 2015 release of the National Strategy for Combatting Wildlife Trafficking.", "timestamp": "2016-09-01", "title": "Fact Sheet: Obama Administration Announces New Policies to Promote Conservation and Build Resilience to Climate Change, with a focus on Pacific Islands"}

In his remarks, he referred to Proclamation 9478, signed August 25, which expanded the existing Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118849", "text": "Well, let me start by saying that this is hallowed ground. As I said before, the Battle of Midway was a turning point in the battle for the Pacific and World War II. An incredible number of young men lost their lives here protecting our freedom. And for us to be able to visit this monument and remind ourselves of the sailors and airmen and everyone involved who were able to rebuff a Japanese force that vastly outnumbered them is a testament to their courage and their perseverance.\nIt is also spectacular as an ecosystem. And our ability to not just designate, but build on, this incredible natural beauty, which is home to 7,000 marine species, that sees millions of birds, many of them endangered, sea turtles, the Hawaiian monk seal, black coral—all sorts of species that in many other places we no longer see—for us to be able to extend that 550,000 miles in the way that we've done ensures not only that the Midway Atoll is protected, but that the entire ecosystem will continue to generate the kind of biodiversity. It allows us to study and research and understand our oceans better than we ever have before.\nIt's also critically important for us to examine the effects that climate change are taking here in the Pacific Ocean, the world's largest body of water. And as I said yesterday, there are countries that now are at risk and may have to move as a consequence of climate change. There are enormous effects on the human presence in the ocean that creatures are having to adapt to and, in some cases, cannot adapt to.\nAnd so for us to be able to protect and preserve this national monument, to extend it and, most importantly, to interact with native Hawaiians and other stakeholders so that the way we protect and manage this facility is consistent with ancient traditions and the best science available, this is going to be a precious resource for generations to come. And it's an example of the kind of visionary conservation measures that, although I'm the one who ultimately signs it, reflects the work of a lot of people and a lot of organizations and a lot of participation.\nSo we've very, very proud of what they've done. And I look forward to knowing that 20 years from now, 40 years from now, 100 years from now, this is a place where people can still come to and see what a place like this looks like when it's not overcrowded or destroyed by human populations.\nAll right?

Although rare, pediatric cancer is the leading disease-related cause of death among children. As we invest in cutting-edge research and work to advance medical treatments to beat childhood cancer, each of us can help carry our vision of a cancer-free future forward. Each September, we remember those who lost their lives to cancer far too young and honor the courageous children who bring unwavering strength and optimism to their fight against cancer every single day, and we refocus our efforts on striving to cure cancer once and for all.\nCancer affects children of all ages, generally without a known cause. Over the last half-century, as cancer research and treatment has advanced, the outlook for children with cancer has greatly improved. We have witnessed tremendous improvements in overall survival rates, and a larger number of long-term survivors now look forward to longer life expectancies. Unfortunately, many face chronic health challenges or complications after they beat their cancer. As a Nation, we must recognize that there is more we must do to better understand and treat pediatric cancer.\nMy Administration continues to invest in the critical research we need to defeat this devastating disease. In 2014, I signed the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act, which established the 10-Year Pediatric Research Initiative Fund and has already helped divert millions of dollars every year to advancing childhood cancer research. Through our Precision Medicine Initiative—a bold research effort to revolutionize our approach to treating diseases by personalizing treatment based on specific genetic characteristics—we are already making powerful discoveries for cancer patients and looking to transform the ways we treat many types of cancer. And earlier this year, I tasked Vice President Joe Biden with leading a new national effort to fight cancer. The White House Cancer Moonshot Task Force—a collaborative effort to make a decade's worth of progress in preventing, diagnosing, and treating cancer in just 5 years—is working toward an ultimate goal of eliminating cancer as we know it.\nTo give children with cancer the care they need and reduce the financial burden that falls on their families, we have worked to provide quality, affordable health care to all people. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has helped millions of Americans access medical care and enabled them to receive regular checkups, which can help detect cancer. Many children's cancer centers participate in clinical trials, which are partly responsible for much of the progress we have made in advancing treatment of childhood cancer; under the ACA, insurers can no longer drop or limit coverage because of participation in one of these trials. The ACA eliminated annual and lifetime limits on insurance coverage, and because the law prevents insurance companies from denying or limiting coverage for pre-existing conditions, children diagnosed with cancer now have a better chance at a healthy life.\nDuring National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month, let us tell the stories of the brave children who battle cancer every day and thank the loved ones, health care professionals, and communities who lift them up. Let us renew our commitment to prevent, treat, and cure childhood cancer, and together ensure that all children can experience the full and healthy upbringing they deserve.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2016 as National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. I encourage all citizens, government agencies, private businesses, non-profit organizations, and other groups to join in activities that will increase awareness and prevention of childhood cancer.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-09-01", "title": "Proclamation 9483—National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month, 2016"}

But the incidence of ovarian cancer, and its death rate, have fallen in recent years. Today, cancer research is on the cusp of major breakthroughs, and it is of critical national importance that we accelerate this progress and keep reaching for prevention, treatment, and a cure. Each September, in honor of the women who have been taken by ovarian cancer and the brave individuals still fighting this disease, we reaffirm our commitment to carrying forward this important work.\nIt is estimated that more than 22,000 American women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer this year, and due to a lack of effective screening tests and early warning signs, many of these cases will be caught at an advanced stage—making the cancer more difficult to treat, with a lower chance for recovery. Ovarian cancer is more common among older women and those who have it in their family history, but because most women are diagnosed without being at high risk, it is crucial that all women consult with their health care providers when experiencing some of its symptoms, which include pressure, swelling, and abdominal pain. I encourage everyone to visit www.Cancer.gov/Ovarian to learn more about the signs and symptoms of this disease.\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, annual and lifetime limits on insurance coverage have been eliminated, and critical preventive services like well-woman visits—which are now available without a copay or deductible—have been expanded for millions more women. The Act also prohibits insurance companies from denying coverage based on a pre-existing condition, including cancer, or from denying coverage due to a family history of cancer.\nEarlier this year, I announced a new national effort to cure cancer. Led by Vice President Joe Biden, the White House Cancer Moonshot Task Force is promoting research efforts and breaking down barriers to progress to eliminate cancer as we know it. With the help of a nearly $1 billion initiative to jumpstart this work, we are harnessing the spirit of American innovation to identify new ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat cancer. The Task Force builds on the important work that Federal agencies have already been doing throughout my time in office to fight ovarian cancer. The Department of Defense Ovarian Cancer Research Program is supporting high-impact, cutting-edge research where it is needed most and has helped push these research priorities forward. And the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has striven to raise awareness of the main types of gynecologic cancer, including ovarian cancer, and to encourage women to learn of warning signs and seek medical care.\nFor the mothers, sisters, daughters, partners, and families who face the pain and heartache of ovarian cancer, we must make America the country that cures cancer once and for all. During National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, as we recognize those in the medical community who work tirelessly to provide treatment and care and pay tribute to those who have lost their lives to this disease, let us resolve to increase awareness of ovarian cancer and shape a cancer-free future. Now, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2016 as National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month. I call upon citizens, government agencies, organizations, health care providers, and research institutions to raise ovarian cancer awareness and continue helping Americans live longer, healthier lives.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-09-01", "title": "Proclamation 9484—National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, 2016"}

As a country, we must do everything in our power to support men who are battling prostate cancer, deliver the care and treatment they need, and defeat this devastating disease. A cancer-free future is within our grasp—with bold vision and daring optimism, we are pioneering medical breakthroughs in research and seeking to discover a cure for cancer in our time. During National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, we remember all the men who lost their lives to this disease, and resolve to reach a tomorrow where prostate cancer is no longer a threat to our sons and grandsons.\nIn 2016, approximately 180,000 men will be diagnosed, and 26,000 men will lose their battle with prostate cancer. Incredible advancements have paved the way for better prevention, detection, and treatment of this disease, and over the past two decades, the incidence of new cases and mortality rates for prostate cancer have been steadily declining. Men who are African American, over the age of 65, or have a family history of prostate cancer are at higher risk and should be aware of risk factors and symptoms. I encourage all men to talk to their health care providers about how prostate cancer can affect them, and to learn more by visiting www.Cancer.gov/Prostate or www.CDC.gov/Cancer/Prostate.\nThe Affordable Care Act has ensured that more Americans have access to quality, affordable health insurance, and it prohibits insurance companies from denying coverage to someone simply because they have prostate cancer. The Act eliminates annual and lifetime limits on coverage and ensures individuals have the option to participate in clinical trials, which have proven helpful in advancing research of new treatment strategies and improving clinical care for men with prostate cancer.\nThis year, I asked Vice President Joe Biden to lead our Nation in a new effort to end cancer as we know it. The White House Cancer Moonshot Task Force is striving to make a decade of advances in cancer prevention, treatment, and care in just 5 years through the collaboration of Federal agencies, jumpstarted by a proposed nearly $1 billion investment. Additionally, the Department of Veterans Affairs is helping to introduce a series of pilot programs that will accelerate clinical research and care for veterans with prostate cancer using cutting-edge biotechnologies—they are also working to increase precision oncology research and strengthen personalized medicine for the treatment of prostate cancer among veterans. These efforts build on the goals of our Precision Medicine Initiative, which aims to deliver personalized care and apply medicine more efficiently and effectively based on genetics—and ultimately, to bring us closer to curing diseases like cancer.\nThis month, let us thank the countless researchers, medical professionals, and advocates who dedicate themselves to supporting survivors and beating cancer. Let us continue raising awareness of prostate cancer and renew our commitment to finding a cure once and for all. Now, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2016 as National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month.

Biden, Jr., President of the Senate.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118916", "text": "Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)\nMy Administration is committed to the ongoing transformation of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and I strongly support many of the recommendations and the underlying objectives offered by the Commission on Care (Commission) in its final report transmitted on July 6, 2016. These recommendations underscore the fundamental challenges that face the VA health care system, and the reforms needed to provide America's veterans with the high quality health care they need and deserve—both now and in the future. We have made great strides in delivering improved care to our veterans over the past 8 years, and we will continue to work tirelessly to uphold the solemn responsibility to ensure all our veterans are getting the care and benefits they have earned.\nI concur with 15 of the 18 Commission recommendations, many of which are already being implemented as part of the ongoing MyVA transformation that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (Secretary) has put in place. These include areas such as enhancing clinical operations, establishing a more consistent policy for appealing clinical decisions, eliminating disparities in how health care is delivered to veterans from different backgrounds, modernizing IT systems, and establishing new processes for leadership development and performance management. These reforms are steps in the right direction and will help put VA on a trajectory to ensure veterans continue to receive timely and high quality care, while strengthening the VA health care system that millions of veterans depend on every day. I appreciate and applaud the Commission for their work.\nOf particular note, I strongly support the Commission's principle that creating a high-performing, integrated health care system that encompasses both VA and private care is critical to serving the needs of veterans. In fact, my Administration outlined its approach to achieve this same goal in VA's Plan to Consolidate Community Care, submitted to the Congress in October 2015. While this approach must be implemented in a fiscally sustainable way, it builds on more than a decade of work with veterans, health care providers, and community partners, to streamline and enhance VA's capability to deliver services essential to veterans' health. VA's plan also recognizes the importance of strengthening VA's partnerships with other Federal health care providers, including the Department of Defense and Indian Health Service, as well as tribal health programs, academic teaching affiliates, and Federally Qualified Health Centers.\nAt the same time, it is critical that we preserve and continue to improve the VA health care system and ensure that VA has the ability to serve veterans. Research shows that in many areas, such as mental health, VA delivers care that is often better than that delivered in the private sector. VA also provides unique, highly specialized care for many medical conditions, such as spinal cord and traumatic brain injuries, which are simply not available to the same extent outside of VA. In addition, VA provides a comprehensive approach to wellness that includes the treatment of physical injuries and mental health. This multidisciplinary approach allows providers to address the full spectrum of veteran needs beyond medical care, including other VA benefits and services. For these reasons, I concur with the Commission's vision for creating integrated care networks that more tightly coordinate VA and non-VA care, but urge the Congress to act on this recommendation by enacting VA's Plan to Consolidate Community Care. The alternative approach outlined in VA's plan would achieve the goals of the Commission to create a veteran-centric approach to care that appropriately balances issues of access, quality, and cost-effectiveness. It would more clearly ensure the long-term viability and sustainability of the VA health care system, preserve VA's role as the primary coordinator of care for veterans, and safeguard its ability to carry out its other research, education, and emergency preparedness missions that are critical to our Nation's well-being. And it would ensure that veterans have access to the care they need—whether at the VA or out in the community—without forcing untenable resource tradeoffs that would limit the ability of VA to carry out other parts of its mission on behalf of veterans.\nWe must also ensure that VA has the ability to operate this integrated health care system in a rational, efficient, and dynamic way that best serves the interests of both veterans and taxpayers. For that reason, I have concerns with the Commission's proposed governance structure for the VA health care system. The proposal would undermine the authority of the Secretary and the Under Secretary for Health, weaken the integration of the VA health care system with the other services and programs provided by the VA, and make it harder—not easier—for VA to implement transformative change. Moreover, the Department of Justice has advised that the proposed recommendation would violate the Appointments Clause of the Constitution. I do, however, support portions of the recommendation that would establish a term appointment for the Under Secretary for Health, to ensure that position is removed from the turmoil and turnover of the political cycle.\nFor those recommendations I agree with and whose objectives are not yet achieved, I am directing the VA to develop plans to complete their implementation. Additionally, in recognition of the role of the MyVA initiative in transforming the VA as military service evolves, I have directed the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to incorporate the principles of the MyVA initiative into VA strategic planning, leadership training, and performance monitoring. In those areas where legislation is required, my Administration will work closely with the Secretary to transmit to the Congress the relevant legislative proposals, which I recommend be enacted without delay.\nImproving veterans' health care remains a critical issue of national importance, and my Administration will work with veterans and military families, the Congress, Veterans Service Organizations, and other stakeholders to ensure all our veterans are getting the care and benefits they need when they need them.\nSincerely,\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-09-01", "title": "Letter to Congressional Leaders on the Final Report of the Commission on Care"}

It was achieved by men and women who believed that living up to the promise of this Nation meant more than hoping for the best—it meant toiling in the day, working through the night, and proving that theirs was a future worth fighting for. On Labor Day, we celebrate the grit and resilience of America's workers and their families, and we recommit to reaching for a world in which they are afforded the rights and opportunities they deserve.\nAmerica celebrated its first Labor Day in the late 19th century, when a group of industrial workers in New York joined in common purpose to celebrate their contributions to our country. Growing in numbers by the thousands, they went without their daily pay to march for their cause—setting in motion a labor movement that has inspired generations of Americans since. Clear-eyed and persistent, these hardworking union members, and those that followed in the path they forged, helped secure privileges we now take for granted—not only for themselves, but also for their friends and loved ones and neighbors. Their efforts brought about weekends and 40-hour workweeks, overtime pay and a minimum wage, and the collective bargaining rights that have empowered so many. Because of the battles they waged, our Nation benefits from health insurance and Medicare, Social Security, and other retirement programs. Their legacy is one we will never stop striving to uphold.\nWhen I took office, our country faced the worst recession many of us had ever seen. But through the determination of our resilient workforce—the best workers on the planet—we have been able to lay a stronger foundation for our economy. Our auto industry has emerged stronger than ever, and the manufacturing sector, on the decline during the Great Recession and in its aftermath, has added over 800,000 new jobs. American businesses have added 15.1 million jobs since 2010. We are now in the middle of the longest streak of overall job growth on record, and wage growth has accelerated.\nMy priority since taking office has always been the well-being of the American people, and over the course of my Administration, I have taken steps to make sure everyone in our workforce is treated and compensated in ways that reflect the effort they put in. Whether by pursuing measures that can help ensure a fair day's pay for a hard day's work, updating occupational health and safety rules so that no one has to risk their life or health for their job, or working with State leaders to increase access to paid sick and family leave, we have made great strides on our journey to protecting and growing the middle class. We are working to increase and diversify apprenticeships as part of a job-driven skills agenda, and protect middle class savings by expanding retirement security. And by striving to close the gender pay gap, include more veterans and Americans with disabilities in our workforce, protect people who choose to organize a union in their workplaces, and prevent people from being denied opportunities because of who they are or who they love, we have moved closer to giving all our people an equal shot at making it in our global economy.\nOn Labor Day, we are reminded that jobs are about more than a paycheck. They afford us the ability to take care of our family, friends, and neighbors; to save for that well-deserved retirement; to give back to our communities and the country we would do anything for. Jobs allow us to dream, to look toward the future, and to encourage our children to do the same. Though there is much more to do until all our men and women have the rights and respect they need to thrive in their workplaces, on this occasion, let us recommit to standing together and resolving to create change. If we do, I am confident we can reach new heights for ourselves, for our children, and for generations to come.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 5, 2016, as Labor Day. I call upon all public officials and people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities that honor the contributions and resilience of working Americans.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-09-02", "title": "Proclamation 9486—Labor Day, 2016"}

Well, I just wrote this the other day knowing I'd be here. And, I mean it from the heart and I'd like to just read it and I think you'll understand it maybe better than I do in certain ways.\n\"For centuries, the African-American church has been the conscience of our country. So true. It's from the pews and pulpits and Christian teachings of black churches all across this land that the Civil Rights movement lifted up its soul and lifted up the soul of our nation. It's from these pews that our nation has been inspired toward a better moral character, a deeper concern for mankind, and spirit of charity and unity that binds us all together. And we're bound together and I see that today. This has been an amazing day for me.\n\"The African-American faith community has been one of God's greatest gifts to America and to its people. There is perhaps no action our leaders can take that would do more to heal our country and support our people than to provide a greater platform to the Black churches and church-goers. You do right everyday by your community and your families. You raise children in the Light of God; I will always support your church, always. And defend your right to worship . . . so important.\n\"I am here today to listen to your message and I hope that my presence here will also help your voice to reach new audiences in our country and many of these audiences desperately need your spirit and your thought. I can tell you that.\n\"Christian faith is not the past but the present and the future. Make it stronger. And we'll open it up to great, great leaders like Pastor Jackson, Bishop Jackson, Dr. Jackson, and so many others. And so many others actually sitting here. Darrell Scott, who is phenomenal, who has been with me for so long. So long. Omrosea, who is a very nice person and I don't want to say that. Because I'll destroy her image by saying that. She's actually a very, very fine person and pastor. And I want to thank all the folks and there is somebody that's been very special to me, Dr. Ben Carson who's been . . . Stand up, Ben. Come here, come here. Come here, Ben. This is a great man and great guy.\n\"So, as I prepare to campaign all across the nation, and in every community, I will have an opportunity to lay out my plans for economic change. Which will be so good for Detroit and so good for this community because we're going to bring jobs back. I will have a chance . . . Thank you. We're bringing them back. We're taking them from Mexico and everywhere else because they're gone.\n\"I will have a chance to discuss school choice. Its very important. And how to put every American on the ladder of success. A great education, a great job. But today, I just want to let you know that I am here to listen to you and I have been doing that. And we had a fantastic interview with Bishop Jackson. It was really an amazing interview. He is better than the people who do that professionally. I will tell you. It's true. It's true. It's true. He's better.\n\"And I didn't really know what I was getting into. I didn't know. Is this going to be nice? Is this going to be wild? He's a great gentleman and a very smart guy. I just hope you don't lose him to Hollywood. That's the only problem. And especially, and especially Dr. Jackson, she may be gone. Hollywood is calling. Look at all those television cameras back there. Look at all the television cameras. I'm sorry to do that to you, Bishop. Because, it's just one of those things, right?\n\"Our nation is too divided. We talk past each other, not to each other and those who seek office do not do enough to step into the community and learn what is going on. They don't know. They have no clue. I'm here today to learn. So that we can together remedy injustice, in any form. And so that we can also remedy economics so that the African-American community can benefit economically through jobs and income and so many other different ways.\n\"Our political system has failed the people and works only to enrich itself. I want to reform that system so that it works for you, everyone in this room. I believe true reform can only come from outside the system. I really mean that. Being a businessman is much different than being a politician because I understand what is happening. And we are going outside the establishment.\n\"Becoming the nominee of the Party of Abraham Lincoln — a lot of people don't realize that Abraham Lincoln, the great Abraham Lincoln was a Republican — has been the greatest honor of my life. It is on his legacy that I hope to build the future of the Party but more important the future of the country and the community.\n\"I believe that we need a Civil Rights agenda for our time. One that ensures the rights to a great education — so important — and the right to live in safety and in peace and to have a really, really great job. A good paying job and one that you love going to every morning. That can happen. We need to bring our companies back.\n\"It also means the right to have a government that protects our works and fights, really fights for our jobs. I want to help you build and rebuild Detroit. And we can do that especially with people like Bishop Jackson and Dr. Jackson. I mean that. It's been an amazing experience. It's been an amazing experience. Really.\n\"Nothing is more sad than when we sideline young black men with unfulfilled potential, tremendous potential. I met some people this morning that are incredible people and they're looking for jobs. These are incredible people . . . young people. Our whole country loses out when we're unable to harness the brilliance and the energy of these folks\n\"We're one nation and when anyone hurts, we all hurt together. That is so true. So true.\n\"We're all brothers and sisters and we're all created by the same God. We must love each other and support each other and we are in this all together. All together.\n\"I fully understand that the African-American community has suffered from discrimination and that there are many wrongs that must still be made right and they will be right. I want America prosperous for everyone. I want to make this city the economic envy of the world and we can do that. We can do that again.\n\"Factories everywhere, new roads and bridges, new schools — especially schools — and new hope.\n\"I have been so greatly blessed, and in so many ways, with no greater blessing than my family. I've had a great family.\n\"Nothing would make me happier and more fulfilled than to use what I have learned in business and in traveling all over the world — I've sort of seen a lot — to bring the wealth and prosperity and opportunity to those who have not had these opportunities before. And that's many, many people in Detroit.\n\"When I see wages falling, people out of work, I know the hardships this inflicts and I am determined to do something about it. I will do something about it. I do get things done, I will tell you. Some people have strengths, that's one of my strengths, I get things done. I'm going to get things done for you.\n\"Please know this, for any who are hurting, things are going to turn around.Tomorrow will be better. Much better. The Pastor and I were talking about, riding up the street, how we see all those closed stores and people sitting down on the sidewalk, and no jobs, and no activity. We'll get it turned around. We'll get it turned around, Pastor. Believe me.\n\"We're going to win again as a country and we're going to win again for all of our people. I want to work with you to renew the bonds of trust between citizens and the bonds of faith that make our nation strong. America has been lifted out of many of its most difficult hours through the miracle of faith and through people like Bishop Jackson and Dr. Jackson. So important. People have no idea how important they are.\n\"Now, in these hard times for our country, let us turn again to our Christian heritage to lift up the soul of our nation. I am so deeply grateful to be here today and it is my prayer that the America of tomorrow — and I mean that — that the America oftomorrow will be one of unity, togetherness, and peace. And perhaps we can add the word prosperity. Ok? Prosperity.\n\"I'd like to conclude with a passage from 1 John, Chapter 4. You know it? See, most groups I speak to don't know that. But we know it. If you want, we can say it together: 'No one has ever seen God, but if we love one another, God lives in us and His love is made complete in us.' And that is so true.\n\"Thank you very much. This has been such an honor. Thank you very much. Bishop, thank you sir. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\"", "timestamp": "2016-09-03", "title": "Remarks at Great Faith International Ministries in Detroit, Michigan"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122620", "text": "Today, the United States and China formally joined the Paris Agreement in a ceremony in Hangzhou, China. President Obama and President Xi deposited each country's official instrument to join the agreement with United Nations Secretary General Ban-Ki Moon. Today's announcement marks another milestone in President Obama and President Xi's legacy of climate leadership and represents a significant step towards the Paris Agreement entering into force this year. The leaders also affirmed their commitment to work together to reach successful outcomes this year in adopting an ambitious amendment to the Montreal Protocol to phasedown HFCs and on a market-based measure to reduce carbon emissions from international aviation, and announced continued bilateral climate cooperation and domestic action.\n•      Paris Agreement. Last December, more than 190 countries adopted the Paris Agreement, the most ambitious climate change agreement in history. In order for the agreement to take effect and enter into force, at least 55 countries representing at least 55 percent of global emissions need to formally join the Agreement. Today's action by the United States and China to formally join is a significant step towards entry into force this year with countries representing around 40 percent of global emissions having now joined and more than 55 countries having already joined or publicly committed to work towards joining the agreement this year. In addition, both sides stated their intention to prepare and publish their respective \"mid-century, long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies\" under the Paris Agreement. The United States has previously committed to publishing its strategy this year, and today, China committed to prepare its strategy as early as possible. And the two countries also announced that they will engage in technical collaboration and consultation on their strategies.\n•      HFC Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. President Obama and President Xi first underscored the need to phase down the consumption and production of super-polluting hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which can be up to 10,000 times more potent than carbon dioxide, in their meeting at Sunnylands in 2013. In their statement on March 31 this year, they called for a successful outcome in 2016 on an amendment to the Montreal Protocol to phase down the consumption and production of HFCs globally. Today, the United States and China are making their joint goal of a successful outcome more concrete by committing to work together to reach agreement this year on an ambitious and comprehensive HFC amendment with an early freeze date and ambitious phase down schedule, along with increased financial support to assist in implementation. An early freeze date is a critical determinant of an amendment's ambition, including whether it can avoid up to 0.5 degrees Celsius of warming by the end of the century.\n•      International Aviation Emissions. In March 2016, President Obama and President Xi committed to working together to reach a successful outcome this year on a global market-based measure for addressing greenhouse gas emissions from international aviation at the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). After close bilateral engagement between the United States and China, as well as constructive multilateral negotiations among ICAO's member States, the ICAO Assembly will consider the approval of such a measure when it meets in late September. Today, the United States and China are expressing their support for the ICAO Assembly reaching consensus on such a measure. The measure under consideration would be implemented with an initial period in which countries volunteer to join. The United States and China also announced that they expect to be early participants in the measure and volunteer to join, a clear demonstration of leadership by the two largest emitters of international aviation emissions and a signal to others to follow suit.\n•      Domestic Actions. As they did in the September 2015 announcement, the United States and China highlighted actions that each side is taking domestically to tackle climate change and promote the transition towards low-carbon and climate-resilient economies. The United States highlighted actions including the extension of the production and investment tax credits for wind and solar, which will deploy roughly 100 gigawatts of renewable energy over the next five years, new fuel efficiency standards for heavy-duty vehicles, and efforts to finalize 20 additional efficiency standards for appliances and equipment by the end of the year. Likewise, China highlighted plans to reduce CO2 and energy intensity by 18 percent and 15 percent, respectively, as well as to increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to 15 percent by 2020. China also noted its commitment to start its national cap-and-trade program in 2017 and to promote green power dispatch to accelerate the use of renewable energy.\n•      Continued Bilateral Cooperation. The United States and China committed to deepen and enhance their ongoing bilateral climate cooperation, which has been a core element of climate action by the two countries and has provided the foundation for leadership in the international climate arena. The two sides plan to continue this cooperation in the years to come through a number of frameworks, including the U.S.-China Climate Change Working Group, and the U.S.-China Clean Energy Research Center (CERC). Looking ahead the two countries look forward to the next U.S.-China Climate-Smart / Low-Carbon Cities Summit, to be held in Boston in 2017, as well as the Clean Energy Ministerial, to be held in China in 2017.", "timestamp": "2016-09-03", "title": "Fact Sheet: U.S.-China Cooperation on Climate Change"}

Before you fire up the barbecue for the long weekend, I want to talk a little bit about the reason we get to celebrate Labor Day, and that's the labor movement that helped to build this country and our middle class.\nFor generations, every time the economy has changed, hard-working Americans marched and organized and joined unions to demand not simply a bigger paycheck for themselves, but better conditions and more security for the folks working next to them too. Their efforts are why we can enjoy things like the 40-hour workweek, overtime pay, and a minimum wage. Their efforts are why we can depend on health insurance, Social Security, Medicare, and retirement plans.\nAll of that progress is stamped with the union label. All of that progress was fueled with a simple belief: that our economy works better when it works for everybody.\nThat's the spirit that's made the progress of these past 7½ years possible. We've rescued our economy from another depression, cut our unemployment rate in half, and unleashed the longest string total job growth on record. And we've focused on making sure that the gains of a growing economy don't just flow to a few at the top, but to everybody.\nThat's why we took action to help millions of workers finally collect the overtime pay they've earned. It's why I issued a call to raise the minimum wage, and when Congress ignored that call, 18 States and the District of Columbia, plus another 51 cities and counties went ahead and gave their workers a raise. It's why the very first bill I signed was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act why we gave paid sick days to Federal contractors, why we've fought for worker safety and the right to organize.\nAnd we've made good progress. For a few years after the recession, the top 1 percent did capture almost all income gains. But that share has been cut by almost half. Last year, income for everybody else grew at the fastest pace since the 1990s. And another 20 million Americans know the financial security of health insurance.\nI'm the first to say we've got more work to do in the years ahead. I know we're in the heat of a more raucous political season than usual, but we can't get so distracted by the latest bluster that we lose sight of the policies that will actually help working families get ahead. The truth is, that's what's caused some of the frustration that's roiling our politics right now: Too many working folks still feel left behind by an economy that's constantly changing.\nSo as a country, we've got some choices to make. Do we want to be a country where the typical woman working full time earns 79 cents for every dollar a man makes or one where they earn equal pay for equal work? Do we want a future where inequality rises as union membership keeps falling or one where wages are rising for everybody and workers have a say in their prospects? Are we a people who just talk about family values while remaining the only developed nation that doesn't offer its workers paid maternity leave, or are we a people who actually value families, and make paid family leave an economic priority for working parents?\nThese are the kinds of choices in front of us. And if we're going to restore the sense that hard work is rewarded with a fair shot to get ahead, we're going to have to follow the lead of all those who came before us. That means standing up not just for ourselves, but for the father clocking into the plant, the sales clerk working long and unpredictable hours, or the mother riding the bus to work across town—even on Labor Day—folks who work as hard as we do. And it means exercising our rights to speak up in the workplace, to join a union, and above all, to vote.\nThat's the legacy we celebrate on Labor Day. And I'm confident that's the legacy that we'll build upon in the years ahead.\nSo thanks, everybody. Happy Labor Day, and enjoy the long weekend.", "timestamp": "2016-09-03", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}

President Xi and Secretary-General Ban also made remarks, but no transcript was provided.

His remarks were joined in progress.]\nWe are here together because we believe that for all the challenges that we face, the growing threat of climate change could define the contours of this century more dramatically than any other challenge.\nOne of the reasons I ran for this office was to make sure that America does its part to protect this planet for future generations. Over the past 7½ years, we've transformed the United States into a global leader in the fight against climate change. But this is not a fight that any one country, no matter how powerful, can take alone. That's why last December's Paris Agreement was so important. Nearly 200 nations came together as a strong, enduring framework to set the world on a course to a low-carbon future. And someday, we may see this as the moment that we finally decided to save our planet.\nThere are no shortage of cynics who thought the agreement would not happen. But they missed two big things: The investments that we made to allow for incredible innovation in clean energy, and the strong, principled diplomacy over the course of years that we were able to see pay off in the Paris Agreement. The United States and China were central to that effort. Over the past few years, our joint leadership on climate has been one of the most significant drivers of global action.\nIn 2014, President Xi and I stood together in Beijing to announce landmark climate targets for our two countries to meet. That announcement set us on the road to Paris by jumpstarting an intense diplomatic effort to put other countries on the same course. In 2015, we stood together in Washington to lay out additional actions our two countries would take, along with a roadmap for ultimately reaching a strong agreement in Paris. This year, in 2016, we meet again to commit formally to joining the agreement ahead of schedule, creating the prospect that the agreement might enter into force ahead of schedule as well.\nThe United States and China are taking that step today, as our two nations formally join the Paris Agreement. Of course, we could not have done this extraordinary work without the strong support of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, who has been an outstanding leader on this issue as well.\nNow, just as I believe the Paris Agreement will ultimately prove to be a turning point for our planet, I believe that history will judge today's efforts as pivotal. For the agreement to enter into force, as has already been stated, 55 countries representing 55 percent of global emissions must formally join. Together, the U.S. and China represent about 40 percent of global emissions. So today we are moving the world significantly closer to the goal that we have set. We have a saying in America that you need to put your money where your mouth is. And when it comes to combating climate change, that's what we're doing, both the United States and China. We're leading by example. As the world's two largest economies and two largest emitters, our entrance into this agreement continues the momentum of Paris and should give the rest of the world confidence—whether developed or developing countries—that a low-carbon future is where the world is heading.\nOf course, the Paris Agreement alone won't solve the climate crisis. But it does establish an enduring framework that enables countries to ratchet down their carbon emissions over time and to set more ambitious targets as technology advances. That means full implementation of this agreement will help delay or avoid some of the worst consequences of climate change and pave the way for more progress in the coming years. This is the single best chance that we have to deal with a problem that could end up transforming this planet in a way that makes it very difficult for us to deal with all the other challenges that we may face.\nPresident Xi and I intend to continue working together in the months ahead to make sure our countries lead on climate. Three years ago, in California, we first resolved to work together to secure a global agreement to phase down the use of super pollutants known as HFCs, and we're now just 6 weeks away from final negotiations. We also have the chance to reach a global agreement to curb emissions from the global airline industry, one that actually has the support of industry. And today we're putting forward roadmaps to get both negotiations done this year.\nOn each of these issues, the United States and China have now developed a significant record of leadership on one of the most important issues of our time. Our teams have worked together and developed a strong relationship that should serve us very well. And despite our differences on other issues, we hope that our willingness to work together on this issue will inspire greater ambition and greater action around the world.\nYes, diplomacy can be difficult, and progress on the world stage can be slow. But together, we're proving that it is possible. And I was reflecting before we came in here with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon about the meeting that we had in Copenhagen in my first year of my Presidency, which was quite chaotic. And I think it is fair to say that if you had looked at the outcome of that meeting, the prospects of us being here today, the prospects of a Paris Agreement seemed very far away. And yet here we are, which indicates that where there's a will and there's a vision—and where countries like China and the United States are prepared to show leadership and to lead by example—it is possible for us to create a world that is more secure, more prosperous, and more free than the one that was left for us.\nSo to all of you that have participated in this extraordinary effort, thank you very much.

The United States also remains committed with other developed countries to the goal of jointly mobilizing 100 billion US dollars per year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries in the context of meaningful mitigation and adaptation action. This funding will come from a wide variety of sources, public and private, bilateral and multilateral, including alternative sources of finance. China is taking concrete steps to strengthen green and low-carbon policies and regulations with a view to strictly controlling public investment flowing into projects with high pollution and carbon emissions both domestically and internationally.", "timestamp": "2016-09-03", "title": "Joint Statement—United States-China Climate Change Cooperation Outcomes"}

Policies that lay the foundation for strong and sustainable growth in both economies are essential to improving the livelihoods of American and Chinese citizens, as well as countless others around the world. To this end:\no      The United States and China commit to use all policy tools – monetary, fiscal and structural – to foster confidence and strengthen growth. Monetary policy will continue to support economic activity and ensure price stability, consistent with central banks' mandates, but monetary policy alone cannot lead to balanced growth. Fiscal policy should be used flexibly to strengthen growth, job creation and household demand, and can complement and support the implementation of structural reforms.\no      The United States and China jointly reaffirm their G-20 exchange rate commitments, including that they will refrain from competitive devaluations and not target exchange rates for competitive purposes. China will continue an orderly transition to a market-determined exchange rate, enhancing two-way flexibility. China stresses that there is no basis for a sustained depreciation of the RMB. Both sides recognize the importance of clear policy communication.\no      The United States welcomes the commitments China has made on economic reform, especially on supply-side structural reform, and progress achieved so far, including efforts to strengthen the fundamental role of domestic consumption in driving China's economic growth. China commits to steadfastly advance supply-side structural reform, concentrating on cutting excess capacity, reducing inventory, deleveraging, lowering costs, and enhancing support for addressing weaknesses in economic and social development, to support China's transition to a more sustainable growth path. China commits to balance stable economic growth and structural adjustment, and expand domestic demand by increasing household consumption, increasing the service sector's proportion of the economy and ensuring investment is high quality and driven by the private sector. China will continue to simplify administrative procedures and transform government functions, press ahead with financial sector reforms to further enable the market to play a decisive role in credit allocation, open further the services sector to competition, and strengthen the social safety net.\no      The United States remains committed to promoting strong, sustainable and more balanced growth characterized by higher domestic investment, in particular infrastructure investment, and national savings. At the same time, the Administration continues to prioritize policies geared toward expanding access to education, reforming the immigration system, and improving the labor force participation rate and productivity.\no      China's fiscal policy has played a role in expanding domestic demand and supporting structural reform. Measures have included lowering taxes and fees, establishing a special fund to provide support for laid-off workers, reducing social security contributions of employers in a phased approach, strengthening the management of local government debt to address risks, and addressing shortcomings in economic and social development, including poverty reduction and ecological protection. Going forward, China commits to use proactive fiscal policy to promote structural reforms and expand demand as appropriate.\no      The United States recognizes the importance of predictability in the budget process and the impact budget uncertainty can have on the United States and global economies, and is committed to putting U.S. government finances on a sustainable path over the medium term.\no      China recognizes that one of the goals of supply-side structural reform is corporate deleveraging, including managing the corresponding challenges for the banking sector. Building on current progress, China is to deepen supply-side structural reforms with a comprehensive strategy, including state-owned enterprise (SOE) reform, giving full play to the role of the market and legal mechanisms, to reduce corporate debt, including SOE debt.\no      Acknowledging the sizable impact these reforms will have on China and ultimately on global growth, China reaffirms its commitment to further improve the transparency of economic and financial policies as well as the availability of data on economic activity to better inform regulators, policymakers, firms, and investors worldwide.\n•      The United States and China recognize that structural problems, including excess capacity in some industries, exacerbated by a weak global economic recovery and depressed market demand, have caused a negative impact on trade and workers. Both countries recognize that excess capacity in steel and other industries is a global issue which requires collective responses. Both sides recognize that subsidies and other types of support from governments or government-sponsored institutions can cause market distortions and contribute to global excess capacity and therefore require attention. The two sides commit to enhance communication and cooperation, and are committed to take effective steps to address the challenges so as to enhance market function and encourage adjustments. In this regard, the United States and China welcome the potential establishment of a Global Forum, with active participation of G-20 members and interested OECD members, as a cooperative platform for dialogue and information-sharing on global capacity developments and on policies and support measures taken by governments, to be facilitated by the OECD Secretariat.\n•      The United States welcomes China's supply-side structural reform program, which has cutting excess capacity as one of its key objectives. The United States and China recognize that due to a weak global economic recovery and depressed market demand, the excess capacity of the electrolytic aluminum industry has increased and become a global issue requiring collective response. Both countries are to work together to address the global electrolytic aluminum excess capacity.\n•      The United States and China recognize the importance of the establishment and improvement of impartial bankruptcy systems and mechanisms. China attaches great importance to resolving excess capacity through the systems and mechanisms relating to mergers and acquisitions; restructuring; and bankruptcy reorganization, bankruptcy settlement, and bankruptcy liquidation, according to its laws. In the process of addressing excess capacity, China is to implement bankruptcy laws by continuing to establish special bankruptcy tribunals, further improving the bankruptcy administrator systems and using modern information tools. The United States and China commit to, starting as early as 2016, conduct regular and ad hoc communication and exchanges regarding the implementation of our respective bankruptcy laws through forums or mutual visits.\n•      The United States and China remain committed to supporting an inclusive and resilient international economic architecture able to evolve with global realities, challenges and opportunities, including promoting comprehensive cooperation between the existing and new international financial institutions. The United States and China also share a commitment to upholding and further improving the high governance, environmental, and social standards of the existing international financial institutions, as well as in new and future institutions, consistent with the commitments made in September 2015. To this end:\no      The United States and China support a strong, quota-based and adequately resourced IMF at the center of the global financial safety net. The United States and China support maintaining the IMF's current lending capacity. The United States and China welcome that the 2010 IMF quota and governance reform have taken effect and are working towards the completion of the 15th General Review of Quotas by the 2017 Annual Meetings. The United States and China reaffirm that any realignment under the 15th review in quota shares is expected to result in increased shares for dynamic economies in line with their relative positions in the world economy, and hence likely in the share of emerging market and developing countries as a whole.\no      The United States supports the IMF's decision to include the RMB into the SDR currency basket on October 1st. Both countries support examination of the broader use of the SDR and exploring initiatives in this regard, including through broader reporting of accounts and statistics in the SDR and the issuance of SDR-denominated bonds.\no      The United States and China reiterate the importance of collaborating on the World Bank's shareholding review according to the roadmap and timeframe agreed by the World Bank Board of Governors. The United States commends China for its increased pledge to the Asian Development Fund-12 replenishment. The United States welcomes China's intent to meaningfully increase its contributions to the replenishments of the International Development Association and the African Development Fund in 2016.\no      The United States and China are to work together to support economic development in developing countries with the help of international financial institutions.\no      The United States and China reaffirm the Paris Club's role as the principal international forum for restructuring official bilateral debt and its discussion of a range of sovereign debt issues, and affirm that the Paris Club should keep pace with the changing landscape of official financing, including by expanding its membership to include emerging creditors. China will continue to participate in the Paris Club on a regular basis and play a more constructive role, including further discussions on potential membership.\no      The United States and China support efforts to incorporate the enhanced contractual clauses into sovereign bonds.\no      The United States and China welcome the completion of peer review reports under the G-20 on the fossil fuel subsidies of the United States and China, and applaud the positive impact of completed and expected reforms on efficient fossil fuel use and reducing emissions of greenhouse gases that cause climate change.\n•      The United States and China affirm that innovation is a critical driver of economic development, job creation, and shared prosperity and that innovation plays a crucial role in developing solutions to domestic, global, and societal challenges. Furthermore, each side recognizes that the ability for the United States and China to trade, do business, and innovate together promotes prosperity for the people of our two nations and contributes to the growth of the global economy.\nAs partners in the pursuit of these common goals and in view of the increasing importance of U.S.-China collaboration to the bilateral relationship, the United States and China recognize the importance of building and supporting the proper legal, regulatory, and policy frameworks necessary for fostering a healthy innovation ecosystem featuring robust investment in basic science and research and development, strong involvement by enterprises, and transparent policy design and implementation in our respective policies. The United States and China commit that their innovation policies are to be consistent with the principle of non-discrimination. The United States and China affirm the importance of developing and protecting intellectual property, including trade secrets, and commit not to advance generally applicable policies or practices that require the transfer of intellectual property rights or technology as a condition of doing business in their respective markets.\no      Both sides recognize the importance of the government's role in promoting a level playing field for foreign and domestic companies, and the importance of open and competitive markets, including in determining pricing of products and services, to drive innovation.\no      The United States and China recognize that the effective and balanced protection of intellectual property rights will be beneficial to promote innovation. Both sides are to continue to communicate and exchange views on relevant policies, such as protecting innovators from bad faith litigations.\no      Both countries affirm that access to a full range of global products, services and technology solutions ordinarily promotes the innovativeness and competitiveness of commercial enterprises.\no      Recognizing the importance of an interconnected global digital infrastructure, the value of innovative technologies, and technology users' security concerns, the two sides, consistent with WTO agreements, commit that their respective generally-applicable information and communication technology (ICT) security-related measures in commercial sectors (1) should treat technology in a non-discriminatory manner, (2) are not to unnecessarily limit or prevent commercial sales opportunities for foreign suppliers of ICT products or services, and (3) should be narrowly tailored, take into account international norms, be nondiscriminatory, and not impose nationality-based conditions or restrictions, on the purchase, sale, or use of ICT products by commercial enterprises unnecessarily.\n•      The United States and China recognize the significant progress of the ongoing Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) negotiation toward a high-standard treaty reflecting the shared objectives of non-discrimination, transparency, and open and liberalized investment regimes. The two sides have recently exchanged the third revised and significantly improved negative list offers and made further progress in all aspects of the negotiation. The United States and China commit to further intensify the negotiation with a view to concluding a mutually beneficial and high-standard treaty.\n•      Both sides highly value the important role the U.S.-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade (JCCT) plays in promoting bilateral economic and trade relations and expanding the mutually beneficial cooperation and high-level policy discussion, and commit to continue holding communication and dialogue under the framework of JCCT on the issues of interest to both governments and our stakeholders, work hard to seek solutions that meet both sides' interests, and work together towards the success of the 27th JCCT.\n•      Recognizing the important role U.S.-China trade and economic cooperation is playing at the subnational level, the United States and China are to further the implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) Between the Department of Commerce of the United States of America and the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China to Establish a Framework to Promote Cooperation at the Subnational Level on Trade and Investment between the United States and China signed by the two governments during 26th Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade, strengthen bilateral communication and coordination through China's Ministry of Commerce, the Chinese Embassy and Consulates General in the United States, U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Embassy and Consulates General in China, and other stakeholders to jointly support, where appropriate, the exchanges of the trade and investment groups and relevant promoting activities under the MOU framework.\n•      The United States and China commit to promote the dissemination of public-private partnership best practices to their respective subnational government entities and to further strengthen communication and information exchange in the area of public service facilities investment and operation.\n•      The United States reiterated its commitment to encourage and facilitate export of commercial high technology items to China for civilian end-users and for civilian end-uses. Both sides reiterated their commitments to continue detailed and in-depth discussion of export control issues of mutual interest through the U.S.-China High Technology and Strategic Trade Working Group.\n•      The United States and China reaffirm the central role of the WTO in today's global economy, and commit to enhance communication and coordination on WTO issues. Both sides remain committed to advance negotiations on the remaining Doha Development Agenda issues as a matter of priority and are determined to work together to further strengthen the multilateral trading system. Both sides also note that a range of issues, such as those addressed in various regional trade agreements and by the B20, may be of common interest and importance to today's global economy, and thus may be legitimate issues for discussions in the WTO, without prejudice to respective positions relating to possible negotiations in the future.\n•      Recognizing the importance of an efficient aviation system to the safe and secure transport of people and goods, and the strategic role that air transport plays in overall economic development, the United States and China commit to take individual and joint steps to address air transport system challenges. U.S.-China aviation cooperation should be based on mutual benefit and the whole-of-government approach established at the June 2016 Strategic and Economic Dialogue. The two sides commit to strengthen exchanges and cooperation on the following areas:\no      The two sides acknowledge the importance of safety oversight and economic regulation to the development of air transportation and commit to pursue activities related to new and enhanced cooperation in these areas by civil aviation authorities.\no      Building on existing civil aviation cooperation between the United States and China, the two sides commit to conduct exchanges and explore cooperation on priority topics of mutual interest such as enhancing the efficiency of civil aviation and development of general aviation under technical assistance provided by the U.S. Trade & Development Agency.", "timestamp": "2016-09-04", "title": "Fact Sheet: U.S.-China Economic Relations"}

I want to begin by saying what a pleasure it was for me to meet with Prime Minister May and congratulate her on becoming Prime Minister. We've had occasion to be together before in other settings, but this was the first time that I had a chance to address her as Madam Prime Minister. I'm glad that Theresa and I could meet early in her tenure. The Prime Minister continues to be a steadying influence during a time of transition.\nIt was a wide-ranging conversation, but it began with the basic premise that even as the U.K. pursues an orderly exit from the EU, together, we reaffirm the very special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom. It will not simply endure, but it will continue to grow stronger with time. The vibrant economic partnership between our countries will continue. As the U.K. gains further clarity on its new relationship with the EU, our two countries will be discussing ways in which we continue to sustain and strengthen our trade and investment ties. Here at the G-20, we will continue to pursue an agenda of inclusive and sustainable growth.\nWhen it comes to security issues, under Prime Minister May, the U.K. has reaffirmed its strong commitment to the transatlantic security architecture. We are NATO allies. We see the world in the same way. We will continue to oppose Russian aggression in Ukraine. We will continue to counter cyber threats. We will continue to work diligently to root out terrorist networks, and we'll work to destroy ISIL.\nAt a time when the international order is under strain, I also emphasized the degree to which United Kingdom's leadership on the world stage is essential. We are grateful for the U.K.'s indispensable role in achieving landmark agreements on climate change, on issues of energy security and global development. We will continue to count on being able to stand together, stand strong with our British friends to make sure that international norms and rules are enforced and are maintained.\nThe bottom line is, is that we don't have a stronger partner anywhere in the world than the United Kingdom. And despite the turbulence of political events over the last several months, we have every intention to making sure that that continues.\nAnd so I look forward to our partnership. This is my last G-20, Theresa's first. But the continuity of the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom, that stretches back many decades, and it will continue for many decades to come.\nTheresa.\nPrime Minister May. Thank you. Thank you very much. And I'm very pleased to be here at my first G-20 summit and pleased to have had the opportunity to meet you, Barack. And as you say, the United States is a special partner for the United Kingdom, a longstanding ally and a close friend. We share the same values of freedom, openness, and tolerance. We share intelligence and technology. Our troops train, fight, and recuperate together. And together, we do more together than any other two countries in the world. And I think that's as true now as it has ever been. And our discussions today have been wide ranging. We focused on Brexit, on the threat from Daesh, the situation in Syria, and on the need to do more to solve the migration crisis. I'd just like to say a few words on each of those.\nFirst, we have talked about Britain's decision to leave the European Union: the process now and what Brexit means for U.K.'s relationships with our European friends, but with other countries too. The U.K. has always been a strong partner for the U.S., and that will remain the case. We have a thriving economic relationship. British businesses export twice as much to the United States as they do to our next largest market, and the United States is the largest inward investor in Britain, with total American investments providing more than 1 million jobs.\nWe need to build on that strong foundation as the U.K. leaves the EU. We're both strong supporters of free trade, and today we've discussed how to take forward consultations to ensure that the U.K. and the U.S. have the strongest possible trading relationship. And this reinforces my belief that as we forge a new global role for the U.K., we can and will seize the opportunities that Brexit presents and make a success of it.\nWe've also discussed the threat from Islamist terrorism. The U.K. and the U.S. have been at the forefront of efforts to defeat Daesh in Iraq and Syria, and it's vital that we take action to degrade Daesh abroad to help keep the streets of Britain safe. And the coalition is making progress. Daesh is losing territory in Iraq and Syria. Its finances have been hit. Its leaders are being killed, and fighters are deserting. And in recent weeks, thanks to U.S. efforts, Daesh in Libya have been forced backwards too.\nBut we must not be complacent. We know these terrorists are intent on destroying our way of life, and the threat in the U.K. remains severe. So as we drive Daesh out of one area, we must be alert to the risk that they will seek a safe haven't elsewhere, and we must work internationally to defeat their ideology of hatred and murder. And we need to support other countries in the region, helping to protect them from the threat of Daesh and thereby protecting people home in Britain too.\nWe must also continue to strive for a political situation in Syria. The goal remains a negotiated settlement which delivers stability for all Syrians and a Government with whom we can work to defeat the terrorists. We welcome U.S. efforts to broker an end to the violence and to help protect moderate opposition forces. It's vital that humanitarian supplies get to innocent Syrians who are in desperate need. And this afternoon I will urge President Putin to do all he can to get the aid convoys in and to end the indiscriminate bombing of civilians. And next week, the Foreign Secretary plans to host the moderate Syrian opposition in London as we continue to support their hopes for a democratic, peaceful, and inclusive Syria.\nAnd finally, we discussed the global migration crisis. Across the world, there are now over 244 million migrants, 65 million displaced people, and over 20 million refugees. This growing crisis cannot be solved by the actions of one country alone. We need an international approach, which better identifies those refugees who most need support, deals more effectively with economic migrants, and does more to address the root causes of migration.\nThis issue will be top of the agenda at the U.N. General Assembly later this month, and I hope we can make concrete progress to stem the flow of migration and help people in their home countries and regions.\nSo we've had a productive meeting. It's been an opportunity to discuss how we respond to some of the great challenges we face. And I look forward to continuing our discussions at the summit, particularly on the global economy. We understand that many of our citizens are frustrated by the pace of globalization and feel they're not experiencing the benefits of international trade. We both believe this is an issue that we as G-20 leaders cannot afford to ignore. Instead, we must all work together to spur economic growth, to boost free trade and build a fairer economy that truly works for all.\nThank you.\nPresident Obama. So we're going to take a couple of questions, starting with Andrew Beatty of AFP [Agence France-Presse].\nSyria/Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) Terrorist Organization/The President's Overseas Travel/China-U.S. Relations/Press Freedom\nQ. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I had a question on Syria, first of all. It seems like there is a deal with the Russians within reach. I was wondering, do you not think there's a risk that there's another short-lived agreement that doesn't end the war, but which allows the Russians to deflect criticism at the G-20 here and at the U.N. General Assembly? And secondly, what do you make of the kerfuffle yesterday at the airport?\nAnd for the Prime Minister, you said that Brexit means Brexit, but I wonder if you could be a bit more specific. Could you categorically rule out the U.K. staying within the EU? Thank you.\nPresident Obama. Okay. With respect to Syria, we have long been interested in finding a way to reduce the violence, improve humanitarian access on the ground as a precursor for a political transition inside of Syria.\nNow, it is a very complicated piece of business. You have the Asad regime, which has been killing its own citizens with impunity, supported by the Russians and the Iranians. You have a moderate opposition that has continuously tried to consolidate a position that would lead to a inclusive and representative government, but is often outgunned. Then, you have ISIL, and you have Al Qaida in the form of Nusra on the ground as well and a range of other players from the Turks and the Gulf States to the Kurds. Trying to corral all of those different forces into a coherent structure for negotiations is difficult.\nBut our conversations with the Russians are key, because if it were not for the Russians, then Asad and the regime would not be able to sustain its offensive. And these are difficult negotiations. We have grave differences with the Russians in terms of both the parties we support, but also the process that's required to bring about peace in Syria. But if we do not get some buy-in from the Russians on reducing the violence and easing the humanitarian crisis, then it's difficult to see how we get to the next phase.\nSo John Kerry and his counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, have been working around the clock, as well as a number of other negotiators, to see what would a real cessation of hostilities look like that could provide that humanitarian access and provide people in places like Aleppo relief. We're not there yet. And understandably, given the previous failures of cessations of hostilities to hold, we approach it with some skepticism. But it is worth trying.\nTo the extent that there are children and women and innocent civilians who can get food and medical supplies and get some relief from the constant terror of bombings, that's worth the effort. And I think it's premature for us to say that there is a clear path forward, but there is the possibility at least for us to make some progress on that front. In addition, I should point out that the U.N. special rep, Staffan de Mistura, has been also coming up with a longer term structure for a political transition. We are supporting his efforts as well. And those two things, hopefully, can operate in tandem.\nAnd the last point I would make is that none of this is slowing down our very aggressive efforts against ISIL. As we've seen in recent weeks, not only have we been able to clear out ISIL from additional territory inside of Syria as well as Iraq, but we continue to systematically go after their leadership, including their head of external operations and probably the second most prominent person in the ISIL infrastructure. So none of this is slowing down a very aggressive effort to go after what I think we all consider to be a—the principal threat that's emanating out of Syria.\nAnd with respect to our visit here, so far, it's been extraordinarily productive. It is true that, not for the first time, when we come here there ends up being issues around security and press access. And part of the reason is, is because we insist on a certain approach to our press pool, for example, that other countries may not insist on. We think it's important that the press have access to the work that we're doing, that they have the ability to answer questions. And we don't leave our values and ideals behind when we take these trips. It can cause some friction. It's not the first time it's happened. It doesn't just happen in China, it happens in other countries where we travel. I think this time maybe the—as Josh put it—the seams are showing a little more than usual in terms of some of the negotiations and jostling that takes place behind the scenes. And in fairness, when delegations travel to the United States, sometimes, there are issues about our security procedures and protocols that they're aggravated with, but don't always get reported on.\nBut none of this detracts from the broader scope of the relationship. As we saw yesterday, President Xi and I continued what has been a historic joint project to elevate climate change issues. The bilateral discussions that we had yesterday were extremely productive and continue to point to big areas of cooperation. When I bring up issues like human rights, there are some tensions there that perhaps don't take place when President Xi meets with other leaders, but that's part of our job, that's part of what we do.\nAnd so I wouldn't overcrank the significance of it, because, as I said, this is not the first time that these things happened. And it doesn't just happen here. It happens in a lot of places, including, by the way, sometimes, our allies. Part of it is, we also have a much bigger footprint—[laughter]—than a lot of other countries. And we've got a lot of planes and a lot of helicopters and a lot of cars and a lot of guys, and if you're a host country, sometimes, it may feel a little bit much. [Laughter] I—you notice some chortling among the Brits; they probably find it a little overwhelming as well. [Laughter]\nSo I—but the one thing I will say is, we don't make apologies for pushing a little bit harder when it comes to press access, and that's been the case from my very first state visit here. And we don't always get everything that we'd like to see, but we think it's important for us to at least stand up for those values. Okay?\nPrime Minister May. And on the question you asked me about Brexit: Yes, Brexit does indeed mean Brexit. On the 23d of June, the people in the U.K. voted for the U.K. to leave the European Union. The Government respects that decision. We respect the wishes of the people, and we will put that into practice. So there will be no second referendum, no attempt to turn the clock back, no attempt to try and get out of this. The U.K. will be leaving the European Union. I think we have a question from Jason Groves from the Daily Mail.\nUnited Kingdom's Referendum Vote To Leave the European Union/United Kingdom-U.S. Trade Relations\nQ. Yes, Jason Groves from the Daily Mail. Mr. President, you came to London earlier this year and urged the British people not to vote for Brexit and warned them that they'd be at the back of the queue for a trade deal if they did. Do you guys think we got it wrong on Brexit? And do you regret making that threat, or are you really going to punish us for taking a democratic decision?\nAnd could I ask, just quickly——\nPresident Obama. Quite the editorial question.\nQ. I work for the Daily Mail. [Laughter]\nPresident Obama. Yes, I get it. [Laughter] That was quite clear.\nQ. And could I ask just quickly whether you've got any advice for the Prime Minister this autumn, when she's got the pleasure of hosting Donald Trump in London?\nPrime Minister, can I ask whether you've had any trade reassurances from the President about your place in his queue? And could I also ask you quickly about Hinkley Point, which you'll be discussing with President Xi tomorrow? You've said you'll look at all the evidence. Does that include getting the National Security Council to look at the potential security implications?\nPrime Minister May. On the first point that you've raised, Jason, I mean, we've had discussions about the importance of the trading relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States. As you know, I've been very clear that, following Brexit, we will be looking to establish new trading relationships around the globe. I think there are real opportunities for the United Kingdom; we will be going out and seizing those opportunities. But we have a very strong—as I indicated in my own statement with some of the figures that I gave—we have a very strong trading relationship with the United States, and we will be looking to ensure that we can maintain that strongest possible relationship into the future.\nAnd on the question that you ask about Hinkley Point, I will be doing exactly as you've said, indeed, in your question, Jason, which is, as you know, I'll be looking at all the evidence around the—this issue. I—the way I work is that I don't just take an instant decision; I actually look at the evidence, take the advice, consider it properly, and then come to a decision. And I've been very clear that I will be doing that and will be taking a decision sometime this month.\nPresident Obama. It is absolutely true that I believed pre-Brexit vote and continue to believe post-Brexit vote that the world benefited enormously from the United Kingdom's participation in the EU. But I also said at the time that, ultimately, this was a decision for the British people, and the British people made that decision.\nAnd I never suggested that we would quote, unquote, \"punish\" Great Britain. As you will recall, if you were at that press conference, I was asked about the viability of immediately negotiating a separate trade agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom, because I think the notion was that the consequences of Brexit would be minimal and we would just go ahead and start lining up a whole bunch of free trade agreements separate and apart from the EU relationship. And my simple point was, is that we've put great priority on, first, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which, now that we have an agreement, we want to put into force, that we are also negotiating effectively with the entire EU around the transatlantic trade agreement, or T-TIP, and those negotiations are proceeding.\nAnd so it would not make sense for us to put those efforts aside, particularly at a time when my working assumption was, is that if in fact the people of the United Kingdom decided to leave the European Union, their first priority would be to renegotiate terms of trade with the economic unit that they sell half of their goods to.\nSo that, in fact, is I think the approach that the Prime Minister is wisely taking—that in a prudent, well-informed fashion with consultations with businesses and stakeholders, as well as her counterparts across the Channel, they—the Prime Minister makes a determination about when to invoke article 50, how those negotiations should proceed. And we are fully supportive of a process that is as little disruptive as possible so that not just the people of the United Kingdom, but people around the world can benefit from continued recovery and economic growth.\nAnd what I've committed to Theresa is, is that we will consult closely with her as she and her Government move forward with the Brexit negotiations to ensure that we don't see adverse effects in the trading and commercial relationships between the United States and the United Kingdom. Obviously, we have an enormous amount of trade that already takes place. We have a lot of investment between British companies in the United States and U.S. companies in the United Kingdom, and that's not going to stop. And we're going to do everything we can to make sure that the consequences of the decision don't end up unraveling what is already a very strong and robust economic relationship that can become even stronger in the future.\nBut first things first. And the first task is going to be figuring out what Brexit means with respect to Europe. And our first task is making sure that we get, first, TPP done, but also that we move forward on the T-TIP negotiations in which we've already invested a lot of time and effort.\nOkay? Thank you very much, everybody.", "timestamp": "2016-09-04", "title": "Remarks Following a Meeting With Prime Minister Theresa May of the United Kingdom and an Exchange With Reporters in Hangzhou, China"}

In his remarks, he referred to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) terrorist organization, also known as \"Daesh.\" President Erdogan referred to Fethullah Gülen, a Turkish citizen living in exile in Saylorsburg, PA, whose followers were blamed by President Erdogan for the July 17 coup attempt; and Minister of Justice Bekir Bozdağ and Minister of Interior Süleyman Soylu of Turkey. He also referred to the Democratic Union Party (PYD) and People's Protection Units (YPG), Kurdish organizations based in northern Syria. President Erdogan spoke in Turkish, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118928", "text": "President Obama. This is the first opportunity that I've had to meet face to face with President Erdogan since the terrible, attempted coup that took place in July. By taking to the streets to resist the coup attempt, the Turkish people once again affirmed their commitment to democracy and the strength and resilience of the democratic institutions inside of Turkey.\nI indicated at the time the unequivocal condemnation of these actions and spoke personally to President Erdogan to offer any support that we might be able to provide in both ending the attempted coup, but also in investigating and bringing the perpetrators of these illegal actions to justice. And I've assured him that our Justice Department and my national security team will continue to cooperate with Turkish authorities to determine how we can make sure that those who carried out these activities are brought to justice and reaffirm our strong support for the Turkish people and Turkish institutions.\nI also had the opportunity to express my deepest condolences for those killed and wounded by recent terrorist attacks in Turkey, which sadly have become too common an occurrence, just as they have all around the world. And in the face of these savage attacks, not only do we stand with Turkey and the people of Turkey and express our sympathy for them, but more importantly, we want to take actions to ensure that together, we are defeating the scourge of terrorism.\nTurkey is a strong NATO ally, a critical member of the coalition against ISIL. Our military, our law enforcement and intelligence cooperation has helped push ISIL back, especially along the Syrian-Turkish border, but we now need to finish the job. And we discussed ways in which we can further cooperate in that regard.\nPresident Erdogan and I also agreed to continue pursuing a peaceful political transition in Syria, which is the only lasting way to end the terrible civil war there. And together, we'll keep working to ease the humanitarian suffering, make sure that Syrian civilians can once again live in security, and that we can stabilize the region as a whole.\nFinally, Tayyip, I want to thank you personally, as well as your Government and the people of Turkey for your exceptional humanitarian support of refugees. Turkey hosts more refugees than any country in the world, and it has been a key partner in providing aid and assistance to vulnerable citizens that have poured out of Syria as well as Iraq. We look forward to doing even more when we host a U.N. refugee summit in—later, at the margins of the U.N. General Assembly. And I—as I indicated to President Erdogan, this is not an issue in which Turkey should be carrying the burden alone. It needs support from all of us, and we intend to provide it.\nSo, Tayyip, once again, it's good to see you. We're glad you're here, safe, and that we are able to continue to work together to build on the strong alliance and partnership that we've established during the course of my Presidency.\nPresident Erdogan. President Obama, thank you. Barack, thank you. First, it's a pleasure for me to get together with you within the framework of the G-20 summit here in Hangzhou. In the aftermath of July the 15th failed coup, we've had a telephone conversation, and this is the first time we got together in order to see each other face to face. And I would like to thank you for your support against this coup attempt.\nOf course, Turkey and the United States had been a strategic partner and a very close ally. And with you, under your leadership, the alliance between our countries became a model partnership. And the relations between our countries are very special, and they are getting stronger as time goes by, especially the terrorist attacks and the failed coup followed one another, and it's a very meaningful time that we're going through.\nAnd against all of the terrorist attacks around the world, as NATO members, we have to embrace a common attitude. It is impossible for us to remain silent, vis-a-vis these attacks, and we have to embrace the same stance against all terrorist organizations around the world. All forms of terrorism is bad. All forms of terrorism is evil. There is no good terrorist or a bad terrorist; every terrorist is condemned. Every terrorist organization is doomed. And our stance against terrorism is quite obvious.\nAnd against these, especially the developments in Syria and Iraq are very concerning. Our fight against Daesh terrorist organization and other terrorist organizations, PYD, YPG, and our fight against these terrorist organizations will continue, as committed as they have ever been. I hope and pray that—which is—our hope is never to see a belt of terrorism, a corridor of terrorism emerging in or around our region. And in order for that to be eliminated, Turkey will forge a very close cooperation and a solidarity with the coalition forces, and we will prevail out of this cooperation, and we will be very victorious.\nAnd at the same time, with regards to the Fethullahist terrorist organization, our operations are underway within the framework of the rule of law. Against this terrorist, before the coup attempt, we had put together some documentation, amassed some evidence, which we have submitted to the United States. And the post-coup-attempt-related documentation and evidence therein will be amassed, and they will be submitted to our friends in the United States. The efforts are still underway.\nWe had welcomed a delegation from the American Ministry of Justice and a similar delegation from the Turkish Ministry of Justice will go to the United States. Our Minister of Justice and Minister of Interior will travel together to the United States, whereby they will concentrate their efforts on the elaboration of this evidence. And with this opportunity, I would like to underline once again that our solidarity and cooperation is most welcome, and this summit may be very auspicious for us all.\nThank you.", "timestamp": "2016-09-04", "title": "Remarks Following a Meeting With President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey in Hangzhou, China"}

The Office of the Press Secretary also released a Spanish language version of this letter.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118932", "text": "To America's hardworking men and women:\nWhen workers raise their voices for a fair wage and dignity in the workplace, they sustain the story of America: the idea that if you work hard, you should be able to get ahead, retire with dignity, and leave something behind for the next generation.\nAt the beginning of the last century, American workers came together to fight for dignity and justice in the workplace. They stood up, marched, and raised their voices for a 40-hour workweek, overtime pay, a minimum wage, and the right to organize for better pay and benefits. They fought to make dangerous jobs safer, whether working in a plant or fighting a fire. These hard-fought victories became the cornerstones of the greatest middle class the world has ever known.\nToday, we again face a changing economy. Since I took Office, we've made extraordinary progress together. We have steadily come back from the worst economic crisis in generations. But too many American families don't yet feel like they've gotten their fair share. That's why Americans need a voice at work.\nFor years, labor unions have been the driving force for raising that voice. But as union membership has fallen, inequality has risen. It's not hard to understand why. It might be easy to dismiss or even punish a lone employee coming forward and asking for a fair wage. But when folks come together—when it's not just one voice but a chorus—they're impossible to ignore. That's a key reason why Americans in unionized jobs still make roughly 26 percent more than their non-union peers.\nAs I've said before, if I were looking for a good job that lets me build some security for my family, I'd join a union. If I saw a problem in my workplace, I'd organize my coworkers to do something about it. Especially because today, more workers than ever need a stronger voice—from pipefitters and fast food workers to journalists and tech workers.\nSo in today's economy, we should make it easier, not harder, for you—America's workers—to make your voices heard. We know that when employees come together and start a conversation about how to build a better workplace, we all benefit. That's why whether you're a union member, an organizer, an activist, or just an employee ready to speak up, I'm proud of the work you do to continue and grow that conversation.\nYou have the right to join together, speak up, and win a seat at the table. You have the right to talk to your coworkers about how much you make or how you'd change your workplace, as long as you're not doing it while you're supposed to be working. And the law says an employer can't fire you, demote you, or change your shift because you're talking to colleagues about advocating for yourselves, whether that's through a union or through some other means.\nHistory shows that working families can get a fair shot in this country—but only if we are willing to organize and fight for it. So whether you simply talk to your coworkers or supervisors about what matters to you, or take the step of joining a union, the power ultimately rests with you. If folks like you keep up the fight, I have no doubt that America will always be a nation where if you work hard you can get ahead and build an even better life for your children. That's why I started my career as an organizer all those years ago—and it's why I believe in you.\nSincerely,\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-09-04", "title": "Letter to the Nation's Workforce on the Observance of Labor Day"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122619", "text": "President Obama participated in his 10th and final G-20 Leaders' Summit in Hangzhou, China on September 4-5. In 2009, President Obama proposed elevating the G-20 to be the world's premier forum for international economic cooperation, allowing leaders representing approximately 85 percent of global economic output to advance the shared objective of strong, sustainable, balanced, and inclusive global growth.\nThe G-20 from 2009 to 2016\nWhen President Obama traveled to his first G-20 Summit in London in April 2009, the global economy was, by several key measures, on a worse trajectory than was seen in 1929 at the outset of the Great Depression.\nThe G-20 played a vital role in responding to the global financial crisis and strengthening the global financial architecture. Starting in 2009, the G-20 mobilized trillions of dollars in fiscal stimulus, rebuilt confidence in the international financial system, and committed to prevent a retreat into protectionism and beggar-thy-neighbor policies. G-20 leaders also launched reforms that have made international financial institutions more reflective of a changing world, including the historic 2010 International Monetary Fund quota and governance reform package. The G-20 has taken steps to put in place financial regulations to prevent another financial crisis, enhance cooperation on tax issues and financial transparency, and tackle critical challenges like climate change and global health security.\nIn Hangzhou, G-20 leaders recognized that more work remains to strengthen growth, expand opportunity, and ensure the benefits of trade and open markets are widely felt. The G-20's track record over the past 8 years has laid a strong foundation for further progress.\nEnsuring a Level Playing Field in an Open, Integrated Global Economy\nIn Hangzhou, President Obama reiterated the United States' support for an open, integrated global economy, underpinned by a level playing field that gives workers and businesses a fair opportunity to compete. G-20 leaders built on the significant steps they have already taken to address corruption, tax evasion and avoidance, and other challenges that undermine the integrity of the global financial system.\n•      Resolving Global Excess Capacity in Industrial Sectors: G-20 leaders recognized that excess capacity in steel and other industries is a global issue that requires a collective response. The G-20 called for the formation of a Global Forum to take steps to address steel excess capacity and encourage adjustments, and to report back to the G-20 in 2017. Excess capacity is a global problem, and the Global Forum will provide an opportunity to help find a global solution. As the Forum prepares to launch, the United States will continue its efforts to address many of the trade-related challenges in the global steel industry. This includes enforcing 160 anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders on steel and steel-related products, tracking U.S. and global steel trade flows, working to address evasion of anti-dumping and countervailing duties and upholding U.S. rights under trade agreements.\n•      Refraining from Unfair Currency Practices: G-20 leaders reaffirmed their commitments to refrain from competitive devaluations and not target exchange rates for competitive purposes. These G-20 commitments complement a broader set of tools the Obama Administration has developed to address unfair currency practices.\n•      Environmental Goods Agreement: G-20 leaders welcomed the landing zone achieved in the World Trade Organization (WTO) Environmental Goods Agreement (EGA) negotiations and reaffirmed their aim to conclude an ambitious, future-oriented EGA that seeks to eliminate tariffs on a broad range of environmental goods by the end of 2016.\n•      Supporting a Modern, Fair International Tax System: G-20 leaders reiterated their support for international tax cooperation and called for timely, consistent and widespread implementation of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) package which will help ensure a fair and efficient global business taxation system. They also called for all relevant and interested countries and jurisdictions that have not yet committed to the BEPS package to do so and join the G-20/OECD Inclusive Framework on BEPS.\n•      Strengthening Global Cooperation on Anticorruption: Recognizing the detrimental effects of corruption and illicit finance, G-20 leaders reinforced a wide range of ongoing efforts through the adoption of a new two-year G-20 Action Plan. The G-20 called on relevant international organization to make recommendations to improve implementation of international transparency standards for the purposes of tackling corruption, tax evasion, terrorist financing, and money laundering. Consistent with these efforts, in May 2016, President Obama put forward a significant new package of proposals to bolster the transparency of beneficial ownership information in the United States.\n•      Moving Forward at the WTO: G-20 leaders called for all members to ratify the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement by the end of 2016. The agreement aims to eliminate bureaucratic delay for merchandise shipped around the world, stimulate trade growth, and contribute positively to other efforts, including on food security.\nStrengthening the Global Economy and Ensuring Inclusive Growth\nIn Hangzhou, G-20 leaders committed to use all policy tools – including fiscal policy – to achieve the common G-20 goal of strong, sustainable, balanced, and inclusive growth. G-20 leaders took stock of progress toward their 2014 commitment to lift G-20 output by an additional 2 percent by 2018. Recognizing that in the current environment much more needs to be done to boost growth and create broad-based opportunity, G-20 leaders also endorsed the following:\n•      Ensuring Sustained Wage Growth: G-20 leaders endorsed Sustainable Wage Policy Principles, which provide a new G-20 policy framework for improving the wages of low- and middle-income earners, setting appropriate minimum wages, promoting collective bargaining, supporting key labor market institutions, addressing the gender wage gap, and encouraging regular monitoring and reporting.\n•      Bolstering Labor Market Opportunities for Women and Youth: In 2014 and 2015, G-20 leaders adopted new targets for expanding labor market opportunities for women and youth. In Hangzhou, G-20 leaders committed to further develop employment plans to meet these commitments and monitor progress in a systemic and transparent manner. The G-20 also acknowledged the importance of supporting the entry of more women into science and technology fields and encouraging women and youth entrepreneurs to take advantage of opportunities in global value chains.\n•      Creating Opportunity through Apprenticeships: G-20 leaders recognized the need to address changing skills needs, including by endorsing the G-20 Initiative to Promote Quality Apprenticeship, which sets policy priorities to increase the quantity, quality, and diversity of apprenticeships. Since the President's 2014 State of the Union call to action, the United States has added almost 115,000 active apprenticeships, the largest increase in nearly a decade.\nPromoting Innovation and the Digital Economy\nBuilding on the G-20's major breakthrough in Antalya in 2015 to affirm important voluntary, peacetime norms of responsible state behavior in cyberspace, G-20 leaders this year made additional groundbreaking policy commitments aimed at promoting innovation and the digital economy as one of the most important drivers of global economic growth and development, including in the areas of:\n•      Free Flow of Data and Internet Governance: The G-20 endorsed a blueprint on innovative growth that affirms the importance of preserving the global nature of the internet as an engine for growth, and expressed the G-20's commitment to the free flow of information, ideas, and knowledge across borders, freedom of expression, and the multistakeholder approach to internet governance. The United States continues to promote policies around the world that support digital trade, stoke innovation, and empower and protect consumers and rejects approaches that would unduly limit growth, fragment global networks, or unfairly tilt the playing field. The United States also is working to fulfill its commitment to privatize the Internet domain name system, in cooperation with the global multistakeholder community.\n•      Broadband Opportunity and Net Neutrality: The G-20 called for policies to promote expanded broadband access for all citizens, in particular for education. The G-20 reaffirmed the goal of ensuring the next 1.5 billion people are connected to the Internet by 2020, a goal shared by the Global Connect Initiative led by the United States. Domestically, the United States is pursuing such policies under the Administration's ConnectED and ConnectAll initiatives. ConnectEd is on track to bring high-speed Internet access to 99 percent of America's schools by 2018, and has in just three years closed the connectivity divide in U.S. schools by half, while ConnectAll will ensure that 20 million more Americans have access to broadband by 2020 through modernizations to low-income support programs, digital literacy education, and other steps. The G-20 also endorsed a digital economy cooperation initiative which affirms the importance of creating the right conditions for expanded broadband access, including net neutrality policies to prevent anti-competitive blocking, throttling, or prioritization of data. The United States is at the forefront of a global consensus on the importance of such protections, as demonstrated by the Federal Communications Commission putting into place strong net neutrality rules.\n•      Protecting Intellectual Property and Cybersecurity: The G-20 recognized the key role of effective protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights to development of the digital economy and affirmed their 2015 commitment that G-20 members should not conduct or support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property. Building on these cyberspace commitments in Antalya, this year the G-20 committed to address security risks, threats, and vulnerabilities in the digital economy, including through application of risk-based cybersecurity approaches. The G-20's commitment echoes U.S. efforts to promote risk-based cybersecurity approaches through the President's Executive Order on Promoting Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity and the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity.\nAddressing Climate Change\nWith the official deposit on September 3 of the U.S. and Chinese instruments to join the Paris Agreement, countries representing around 40 percent of global emissions have now joined the Paris Agreement, and more than 55 countries have already joined or have committed to work to join this year, putting the Agreement's entry into force well within reach. In addition to working together to bring the Paris Agreement into force in 2016, G-20 leaders maintained strong momentum on climate action at the Hangzhou Summit:\n•      Promoting Energy Efficiency: The G-20 welcomed progress on international collaboration on energy efficiency, and highlighted efforts being taken to improve the efficiency of heavy-duty vehicles (HDV). The United States has chaired the G-20 Transport Task Group since its inception in 2014 and continues lead in this area, including by recently finalizing Phase 2 HDV efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions standards, which are expected to avoid 1.1 billion metric tons of carbon pollution while saving vehicle owners $170 billion dollars.\n•      Supporting Successful Multilateral Outcomes: The G-20 looked forward to successful outcomes in key negotiations at the Montreal Protocol and International Aviation Council Organization (ICAO). The United States intends to continue working with G-20 and global partners to adopt an HFC phasedown amendment to the Montreal Protocol, which could avoid a half-degree Celsius of warming by the end of the century, and to adopt a market-based measure to address international aviation emissions under ICAO.\n•      Working with the Private Sector to Address Climate Change: The G-20 also recognized the importance of collaborating with the private sector to scale up green finance. This complements ongoing work to improve climate financial disclosure.\nAddressing the Global Refugee and Migration Crisis\nIn Hangzhou, leaders acknowledged the historic numbers of people displaced around the world, and reaffirmed their call for global efforts in addressing the root causes and effects. In particular, leaders noted the World Bank's efforts to work with other international organizations and its shareholders to complete a global crisis response platform to provide support to refugees and host communities in both low and middle income countries. The platform will help to advance the aims of the Leaders' Summit on Refugees that President Obama, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, and the leaders of Canada, Ethiopia, Germany, Jordan, Mexico, and Sweden will co-host later this month at the UN General Assembly.\nPromoting Sustainable Development\nRecognizing the historic global consensus reached with the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2030 Agenda) and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda one year ago, G-20 leaders affirmed their strong commitment to implementing the 2030 Agenda. Leaders also endorsed the G-20 Action Plan on the 2030 Agenda, including the High Level Principles, which outline concrete collective actions that will advance global efforts to eradicate extreme poverty and build an inclusive and sustainable future. This work will complement actions the United States has committed to take to implement this Agenda at home and internationally.\n•      Advancing Global Health and the Global Health Security Agenda: Building on commitments made at the 2014 G-20 Summit in Brisbane to combat Ebola and enhance global health security, leaders recognized the threat posed by antimicrobial resistance and committed to take action to encourage antimicrobial stewardship and explore ways to promote research and development for new antimicrobials.\n•      Increasing Mobilization of Domestic Resources for Development: Leaders affirmed their support for the principles of the Addis Tax Initiative (ATI), a partnership launched in 2015 to help developing countries better mobilize and effectively use domestic resources to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by strengthening their capacity to finance their own development.\n•      Promoting Financial Inclusion: G-20 leaders endorsed a set of high-level principles and additional indicators for digital financial inclusion. Recognizing the potential impact on financial inclusion resulting from a decline in correspondent banking relationships which can limit the availability of banking services to businesses and communities, leaders also called on G-20 members, the IMF, and the World Bank to intensify their support for domestic capacity building to help countries improve their compliance with global anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism and prudential standards.\n•      Advancing Food Security and Nutrition: Leaders reaffirmed their commitment to continue to prioritize the G-20's work on food security, nutrition, sustainable agriculture and rural development. Leaders also welcomed the work of the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP), which promotes sustainable agriculture to reduce hunger and malnutrition in some of the world's poorest countries.", "timestamp": "2016-09-05", "title": "Fact Sheet: The 2016 G-20 Summit in Hangzhou, China"}

He also referred to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) terrorist organization.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118940", "text": "The President. Good evening, everybody. Well, let me begin by thanking President Xi and the people of Hangzhou and China for the hospitality in hosting this G-20 summit on the shores of beautiful West Lake. Thank you so much. Xièxie.\nNow, this visit offered the eighth opportunity for President Xi and me to meet. We agreed to advance our cooperation across a range of issues, including climate change, global health and development, peacekeeping, counternarcotics, and nuclear security. We also addressed our differences on issues like religious freedom, maritime security, and a level economic playing field, but we did so in a clear, candid, direct, and, I think, constructive way. That has helped us to manage problems, and it's consistently helped us to improve relations between the United States and China.\nThis has also been my 10th and final G-20 meeting. It goes by fast. And so, before I take your questions, let me put into context what we've done over the course of all these G-20 meetings.\nAnd I think back to April 2009, when hundreds of thousands of Americans were losing their jobs and their homes and their savings each month and unemployment was on its way to 10 percent. Around the world, for the first time in a generation, the global economy was contracting, trade was shrinking, and the international financial system was nearly frozen. By several key measures, the global economy was on a worse trajectory than it was at the outset of the Great Depression.\nBut the size and the scope of the crisis was not what made that London G-20 historic. What made it historic was the speed and magnitude of our collective response. One nation couldn't solve the problem alone, so together—developed and developing nations alike—took a comprehensive and unprecedented set of actions to prevent another depression and set the stage for recovery.\nMost important was to create jobs and growth by stimulating demand across our economies. And America led the way. By then, in just my first 10 or so weeks as President, we had already passed the Recovery Act, set in motion plans to rescue our auto industry, stabilize our banks, jumpstart loans to small businesses, and launch programs to help homeowners refinance and stay in their homes. And our G-20 partners would follow with similar actions.\nTo stabilize the global economy, we rejected the protectionism that could deepen the crisis. We cooperated to keep markets open and trade finance flowing and bolstered the international finance system's lending capacity to respond to countries that were hurting the most. And to prevent future crises, we took steps to reform our financial regulatory system, including the historic Wall Street reforms that we passed more than 6 years ago.\nNow, these were the actions we took in 2009. They were actions that prevented another depression, and created conditions for the global economy to grow by more than 25 percent over the past 7 years.\nWhat we also did though was to elevate the G-20 to become the world's premier forum for international economic cooperation. And that decision allowed us as the global recovery progressed, to take further actions to strengthen the global economy. And that's what we came to Hangzhou to do.\nWe've had long debates over the years about the best ways to promote sustained growth, but America's voice in the G-20 has always been one of bold action, and that stance has been backed up by our economic performance. Since job growth turned positive in early 2010, America's businesses have created more than 15 million new jobs. We've cut the unemployment rate in half. And so far this year, wages have risen by almost 3 percent, which is much faster than the pace of inflation.\nBut one of the things that we learned through the G-20 process is that, more than ever, our economies are interconnected, and we've got more work to do together to keep the global economy growing. We have to do more to grow wages faster, to shrink inequality faster, to give everybody a shot at opportunity and security in a changing economy. And that should be the way forward for the G-20: to make sure that the benefits of trends like globalization and technological progress are shared broadly by more workers and families who still feel like the global economy is not working for them.\nAnd that's what we did here at this G-20 summit. We committed to using all of our policy tools to promote robust, inclusive growth that creates opportunity for young people and the middle class that they're working to join. We focused on making sure that businesses can compete fairly and all working families can take advantage of the new prospects the digital economy creates. And we reaffirmed our commitment to support emerging economies through an array of development initiatives.\nWe also discussed ways to unlock the mutual benefits that trade provides while keeping it fair for our workers and the playing field level for our businesses. And that includes high-standard trade agreements that actually benefit the middle class, like the TPP. That includes working together to abstain from unfair currency practices and address corruption and global tax evasion. And it includes our agreement to establish a new forum to address some of the market-distorting policies in the global steel sector that have hurt workers and businesses.\nWe also added momentum to the fight to protect our planet for future generations. On Saturday, the U.S. and China formally entered the Paris Agreement. And today the G-20 welcomed efforts to enter the Paris Agreement into force by the end of this year.\nSo if there's anything that the past 8 years have taught us, it's that the complicated challenges of the 21st century cannot be met without coordinated and collective action. Agreement is not always easy, and results do not always come quickly. Respecting different points of view, forging consensus instead of dictating terms, that can sometimes be frustrating. But it is how progress has been won and how it will be won in the future. It's how we've come as far as we have in the 8 years since the crisis affected us all. And it's how the G-20 can make progress for all people in the years to come.\nSo with that, let me take some questions. And I will start with Roberta Rampton of Reuters.\nPresident Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines/Philippines-U.S. Relations\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to ask you about tomorrow, the next leg of your trip, a little bit. And tomorrow you're going to be meeting for the first time with President Duterte, and he's a leader whose war on drugs has led to the death of about 2,400 people in just the last 2 months since he took office. And today he said in a very colorful way that you'd better not bring this up. And I'm wondering, are you committed to raising this with President Duterte? And are you concerned that meeting him legitimizes his approach on this issue?\nThe President. Good. Well, I just came out of a long day of meetings—[laughter]—so I just heard about some of this. But I have seen some of those colorful statements in the past, and so clearly, he's a colorful guy. [Laughter] And what I've instructed my team to do is to talk to their Philippine counterparts to find out, is this, in fact, a time where we can have some constructive, productive conversations? Obviously, the Filipino people are some of our closest friends and allies, and the Philippines is a treaty ally of ours. But I always want to make sure that if I'm having a meeting, that it's actually productive and we're getting something done.\nWe recognize the significant burden that the drug trade plays just not just in the Philippines, but around the world. And fighting narcotrafficking is tough. But we will always assert the need to have due process and to engage in that fight against drugs in a way that's consistent with basic international norms. And so, undoubtedly, if and when we have a meeting, that this is something that's going to be brought up, and my expectation, my hope is, is that it could be dealt with constructively.\nBut I'll have my team discuss this. I've got a whole bunch of folks that I'm going to be meeting with over the course of the next several days. And as I said, historically, our relationship with the Philippines is one of our most important, and my relationship with the Philippine people has been extraordinarily warm and productive. So I expect that will continue. But I want to make sure that the setting is right and the timing is right for us to have the best conversation possible.\nQ. So you may not meet with him? You might—[inaudible]?\nThe President. Well, I'm—no. As I said, I'm going to just make an assessment. I just got out of these meetings. What is certainly true is, is that the issues of how we approach fighting crime and drug trafficking is a serious one for all of us, and we've got to do it the right way.\nMichelle Kosinski [CNN].\nRussia-U.S. Relations/Syria/Ukraine/Cybersecurity\nQ. Thank you. Same subject, I guess, of colorful guys. What can you tell us about this hour-and-a-half-long meeting you had with President Putin? The tone of it? Any progress that was made? And do you agree with him that the relationship between our two countries is now frozen?\nAnd on the cyber front, Senator Reid recently cited intelligence briefings when he was expressing his suspicions that Russia is trying to meddle in the election and may even have direct ties to one of the campaigns. What can you tell us? Do you think Russia is trying to influence the U.S. election through hacking?\nThe President. Yes. Well, President Putin is less colorful, but typically, the tone of our meetings are candid, blunt, businesslike, and this one was no different. We had a range of issues that we had to discuss, but the two most important were, as has been reported, discussions that have been taking place between Secretary Kerry and Russia's Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, about ways in which we can institute a meaningful, serious, verifiable cessation of hostilities in Syria, and our capacity to provide some humanitarian relief to families, children, women who are suffering enormously under the burdens of that war. As you'll recall, we had initiated a cessation of hostilities a while back. Initially, it did lessen some of the violence, and then, slowly, it unwound. And we're back into a situation in which Asad's regime is bombing with impunity. That in turn, we think, is actually strengthening the capacity of Nusra to recruit people who might not have initially been sympathetic to terrorism, but now view anyone who's fighting against Asad as legitimized. And that is a very dangerous dynamic.\nAnd so we have had some productive conversations about what a real cessation of hostilities would look like that would allow us both, the United States and Russia, to focus our attention on common enemies, like ISIL and Nusra. But given the gaps of trust that exist, that's a tough negotiation, and we haven't yet closed the gaps in a way where we think it would actually work. But my instructions to Secretary Kerry, and Mr. Putin's instructions to Mr. Lavrov, was to keep working at it over the next several days, because the faster we can provide some relief to folks on the ground, the better off we're going to be.\nAnd that then is a predicate for us to be able to transition into a serious conversation about a political solution to this problem that would involve all the parties that have either directly or indirectly involved themselves in the Syrian conflict.\nWe also spent time talking about Ukraine. There is a Minsk agreement that arose out of the Normandy negotiations between Russia, Ukraine, France, and Germany, but it hasn't been implemented. And I made very clear that until it is implemented, the United States is not going to pull down sanctions; that it is important for both sides to try to seize this opportunity in the coming weeks to finalize an agreement and to figure out a sequence in which that document is put into effect. And there was agreement not just between myself and Mr. Putin, but also with Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande, that that effort should increase in urgency over the next several weeks.\nAnd so that what was constructive, but not conclusive. And we'll have to see whether we can actually get this done, or whether, in fact, President Putin—despite talking about wanting a negotiation and a solution—in fact, is comfortable with this constant low-grade conflict along the Russia-Ukraine border.\nAnd finally, we did talk about cybersecurity, generally. I'm not going to comment on specific investigations that are still live and active. But I will tell you that we've had problems with cyber intrusions from Russia in the past, from other countries in the past. And look, we're moving into a new era here, where a number of countries have significant capacities. And frankly, we've got more capacity than anybody both offensively and defensively. But our goal is not to suddenly, in the cyber arena, duplicate a cycle of escalation that we saw when it comes to other arms races in the past, but rather, to start instituting some norms so that everybody is acting responsibly.\nWe're going to have enough problems in the cyberspace with nonstate actors who are engaging in theft and using the Internet for all kinds of illicit practices, and protecting our critical infrastructure, and making sure that our financial systems are sound. And what we cannot do is have a situation in which suddenly this becomes the Wild Wild West, where countries that have significant cybercapacity start engaging in competition, unhealthy competition, or conflict through these means, when, I think wisely, we've put in place some norms when it comes to using other weapons.\nSo that's been a topic of conversation with President Putin, as it has been with other countries. We've started to get some willingness on the part of a lot of countries around the world, including through our G-20 process, to adopt these norms, but we've got to make sure that we're observing them. All right?\nWilliam Wan [Washington Post].\nLaos-U.S. Relations\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President. Heading into Laos, what are the main things you can offer its leaders? And what do you plan to push for in return? On the offering side, for example, I'm wondering how you view U.S. responsibility for unexploded ordnance. On the asking side, what are you pushing for most? Is it human rights? Closer U.S. ties in the face of China? Improving their problems with governance and corruption? What's the priority?\nThe President. Well look, symbolically, this is important. I'll be the first U.S. President to visit Laos. And when you think about the history of the United States and Laos, I think it's useful to see what's happened in the evolution of our relationship with Vietnam, a country that I just visited recently.\nAt the outset, as we're trying to build trust, a lot of work can be done around war legacy issues. For the Lao, that involves dealing with unexploded ordnance, which is still plaguing big chunks of the countryside. And since Laos is still a relatively poor country that is developing, their capacity alone to clean that up is hampered by a lack of resources. We should help. And my expectation is, is that in our meetings over the course of several days, that we'll be able to provide some really concrete assistance that ensures that innocent kids who are running through a field or a farmer that's trying to clear a field or a business that's trying to get set up, that they're not endangered by the possibility of an explosion.\nLikewise, we have deep commitments to accounting for those who were lost during that war. And as was true with Vietnam—to the extent that we're able to find out more about our missing in action and our POWs—that not only provides enormous comfort and meaning for families and is consistent with our traditions, but it also ends up being a show of good faith on the part of the country and a way for us to move into a next phase of a relationship.\nAnd so a lot of the conversation, I think, will start there, but it doesn't end there. We've had an initiative, for example, helping all the countries along the Mekong Delta to find ways to harness development and deal with environmental issues. And that's something that we've been doing through ASEAN over the course of several years now. For us to be able to expand some of that work, I think, would be important. Establishing people-to-people exchanges is another area that historically has been important.\nI do think Laos, seeing the enormous economic progress that Vietnam and China and others have made, are going to be very interested in finding ways in which they can advance into the global economy and help themselves grow, and I think that we can be a useful partner there.\nSo I think there will be a broad-based agenda. But if you think about the visit I made to Ho Chi Minh City and driving through those streets and the enormous wellspring of good will that you saw, that started with some of the same kinds of steps that we're going to be taking with Laos. But I think we can, hopefully, do it faster, make more progress faster than we did over the course of 10, 15 years, because we've learned some things. And I think Laos is very eager to engage with us, and we're eager to engage with them.\nSo I look forward to visiting what I hear is a beautiful country. Christi Parsons [Chicago Tribune].\nTrans-Pacific Partnership/Quarterback Colin Kaepernick of the National Football League's San Francisco 49ers\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President. On the Trans-Pacific Partnership, how do you plan to sell this to these Asian leaders who still have work to do in their own countries, and with some political—you know, it's not—the politics aren't easy, and maybe they don't want to do that. So much of it seems like it—the future is rocky in the U.S. Can you—I mean the U.S. usually ratifies its trade deals. Do you plan to convey a sense of inevitability? Do you feel that for the lame duck session, even if it doesn't happen then, do you feel like it's inevitable anyway?\nAnd if I may, I wonder what you think about the silent protest of Colin Kaepernick? And I also wonder what you think about the public response to it, which is really divided? I mean, some police don't want to secure 49ers games, and many fans feel that he's giving voice to something they feel strongly. So I just wonder how you look at that.\nThe President. Okay. Well with respect to TPP, I don't have to sell it to Asian leaders here who were part of the negotiations because they see this as the right thing to do for their own countries. And when you look at the architecture, the structure of TPP, what it does is open up new markets for us that are generally closed. Our markets are more open than theirs for the most part, so we benefit from a reduction of—in tariffs and taxes that are already in place.\nBut for many of them, what they benefit from is, this trade deal is the spur, the incentive for them to engage in a whole bunch of structural reforms that they know, over the long term, will reinvigorate their economy.\nSo for example, Prime Minister Abe of Japan, yes, he's having to make some difficult decisions about opening up markets that previously have been closed, but he's also looking at a couple of decades of stagnation and anemic growth. And what he said to the Japanese people is, if we want to break out of this, then we're going to have to change how we do business, and this provides us a roadmap of how we can become more competitive on the world stage.\nVietnam, that for the first time is debating in a very serious way how they can provide protections to their workers and allow them to participate and have voice and bargain for wages, and, yes, that's tough politically for Vietnam. On the other hand, they recognize that if they want to move up the value chain in the global market that they've got to start abiding by basic norms.\nSo the good news is, they're ready to go. And what I'll be telling them is that the United States has never had a smooth, uncontroversial path to ratifying trade deals, but they eventually get done. And it's my intention to get this one done, because, on the merits, it is smart for America to do it. And I have yet to hear a persuasive argument from the left or the right as to why we wouldn't want to create a trade framework that raises labor standards, raising environmental standards, protects intellectual property, levels the playing field for U.S. businesses, brings down tariffs.\nIt is indisputable that it would create a better deal for us than the status quo. Nobody has been able to describe to me—with all the general criticism of trade that you hear coming out of some quarters—nobody is able to describe to me how this would not be a significant improvement for U.S. workers and U.S. businesses going forward compared to the status quo. And so I intend to be making that argument. I will have to be less persuasive here because most people already understand that. Back home, we'll have to cut through the noise once election season is over. It's always a little noisy there.\nAnd in terms of Mr. Kaepernick, I've got to confess that I haven't been thinking about football while I've been over here, and I haven't been following this closely. But I—my understanding, at least, is, is that he's exercising his constitutional right to make a statement. I think there's a long history of sports figures doing so. I think there are a lot of ways you can do it. As a general matter, when it comes to the flag and the national anthem and the meaning that that holds for our men and women in uniform and those who fought for us, that is a tough thing for them to get past to then hear what his deeper concerns are. But I don't doubt his sincerity, based on what I've heard. I think he cares about some real, legitimate issues that have to be talked about. And if nothing else, what he's done is, he's generated more conversation around some topics that need to be talked about.\nSo, again, I haven't been paying close attention to it, but you've heard me talk about in the past the need for us to have an active citizenry. Sometimes, that's messy and controversial, and it gets people angry and frustrated. But I'd rather have young people who are engaged in the argument and trying to think through how they can be part of our democratic process than people who are just sitting on the sidelines and not paying attention at all.\nAnd my suspicion is, is that over time, he's going to refine how he's thinking about it, and maybe some of his critics will start seeing that he has a point around certain concerns about justice and equality. And that's how we move forward. Sometimes, it's messy, but it's the way democracy works. All right?\nLast one. Angela Greiling-Keane of Bloomberg.\nInternational Corporate Tax Avoidance/Steel Industry/International Economy\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President. The G-20 group today discussed the importance of tax fairness and consistency among countries. For you, how much of that discussion was centered on the Apple case and the EU's decision? And how do you balance your efforts here to ensure global tax fairness with your need and desire to protect U.S. companies and their shareholders?\nThe President. Yes.\nQ. And if I may, on one other business topic, how would you assess the likelihood of the actions taken on steel today of making a difference in overcapacity?\nThe President. Good. No, those are both great questions. This issue of tax avoidance and tax evasion is something that we have actively promoted as an issue for the G-20 to tackle. We've worked with not only the G-20 countries, but also some of the multilateral organizations, like the OECD, to refine how we can approach these problems. It's a complicated piece of business.\nWe did not bring up the specific case of Apple, because as a general rule, I don't want to bring up a single case in a forum like this, where we're trying to shape broader policy. But at home, we have been focused—whether it's on the inversion rules that we put forward, the proposals that we put forward to define who the beneficiaries are behind the veil so that we can catch people who are avoiding their taxes—we're doing a bunch of stuff at home, and we want to coordinate better norms internationally. The one thing that we have to make sure we do is to move in concert with other countries, because there's always a danger that if one of us acts unilaterally, that it's not just a matter of a U.S. company being impacted, but it may also have an effect in terms of our ability to collect taxes from that same company. And so you might end up with a situation where they pay into Europe, and U.S.—the U.S. Treasury is shortchanged. So if there is not some coordination between various tax authorities, you get a problem there.\nIn the same way that we think there has to be some coordination about even some of our closest allies racing to the bottom in terms of how they enforce their tax policies in ways that lead to revenue shifting and tax avoidance in our country.\nSo this is not something that I think is going to be sorted out overnight. I do think that if we are to regain the trust of ordinary people that the system is not rigged and deal with these trends of inequality that have risen out of globalization and technological change, that we've got to make sure we tackle this issue in an effective way.\nAnd we've made some progress, but not as much as we need to. And my hope is, is that it's recognized that it's in the interest of all countries, whether they're developed countries or developing countries, to work together to put a stop to this. Because developed countries are losing revenue, and that erodes their tax base and their ability to educate kids and build universities and build infrastructure, but it also wallops developing countries because oftentimes, tax avoidance can go hand in hand with corrupt practices that impede development.\nIn terms of excess capacity, this is an issue that we wanted to get on the agenda. We got it on the agenda. In my bilateral conversations with President Xi, there was an agreement that we would make progress on dealing with steel overcapacity, which, by the way, is consistent with the plans that President Xi himself has had to reorient the economy so that it's not so heavily dependent on state-owned enterprises and an export model.\nSo we've made some progress—not as much as we'd like to see—but some progress on that front bilaterally. Multilaterally, the way this was resolved was, the G-20 agreed to put together an intensive process of gathering all the data, determining what the best steps are, which will then be reported in the G-20 in Hamburg next year. And I think there was a validation of the basic principle that, to the extent that overcapacity is the result not just of market forces, but specific policy decisions that are distorting a well-functioning market, that that needs to be fixed.\nAnd so it was one of a number of examples that aren't always sexy and don't attract a lot of headlines of where issues that we've raised in the G-20 get adopted, and then a bunch of work gets done, and the following year, you start seeing action, and slowly, we strengthen and build up international norms.\nIf you look at the issue of IT and the digital economy, we were able to get the G-20 to adopt a range of principles about an open Internet, net neutrality, making sure that businesses and vendors and providers aren't discriminated across borders, reflecting a lot of the foundational principles that have led to this digital revolution over the last several years.\nAnd that will, in turn, generate a bunch of new work. And there will still be conflicts about how people deal with censorship or how they deal with cybersecurity issues, but we chip away at it, and over time, what you get is sturdier international norms that everybody abides to and will help all countries grow and help people prosper. So I'm—my parting words at the G-20 were, having watched this process over the last 8 years, I think we all have to recognize, these are turbulent times. A lot of countries are seeing volatile politics. Sometimes, you read the headlines, and you can get discouraged about whether the international community and leadership are able to shape solutions fast enough for the scale of the problems, whether it's migrants and refugees or climate change or terrorism or making sure the international economy is working for everybody. But then, when you look back over the course of 8 years, actually, you find out, things have gotten better, not always as fast as we'd like, but in significant ways.\nYou look at the progress we've made on the financial system. The American banking system now has $700 billion more in capital; it is much safer and much sturdier. But it's not just us. Because of the G-20, you also have a Basel III agreement in which all countries are having to strengthen their capital requirements and put in place some basic safeguards to prevent what happened at Lehmans. And that's true across the board.\nSo, as always, I'd always like to see even more get done, but I'm cautiously optimistic about the progress that we made. I tell my staff when they feel worn out sometimes that better is always good. It may not be everything that needs to get done, but if it's better than before we started, we'll take it. All right?\nThank you very much, everybody.\n[At this point, many reporters began speaking at once.]\nThank you, guys.

EARNEST: Good evening, everybody. It's nice to see you all. Obviously this will be the -- one of the briefings that we'll do on the trip. I don't think we have anything at the top, so I think we'll just go to straight to your questions for the sake of efficiency. Who wants to get us started? Not everybody at once. Josh, do you want to go first?\nQ: Sure. I wanted to ask about the cancellation of the meeting with Duterte. The President said yesterday this wasn't going to affect our long-term relationship with the Philippines, but how is that the case if the President and the head of this other -- our ally are essentially in a war of words with each other? And the office of the Philippine leader said that the decision to cancel the meeting was mutual. Is that the case, or did the U.S. basically inform them that this was not happening?\nMR. RHODES: Well, look, first of all, the nature of our alliance with the Philippines has been and remains rock solid. We have incredibly close working relationships with the government of the Philippines on issues related to disaster response, maritime security, diplomatic coordination on issues related to the South China Sea; economic, commercial and people-to-people ties. So I think people should certainly expect that our very close working relationship with the Philippines is going to be enduring. And in fact, we continue to consult closely at a variety of levels, and in fact, I think Chairman Dunford has even been in the Philippines recently, if not today, for a chiefs of defense meeting.\nWith respect to the bilateral meeting, I think it was our judgment that given the focus of attention on President Duterte's comments leading into the meetings here, we felt that that did not create a constructive environment for a bilateral meeting. All of the attention, frankly, was on those comments and, therefore, not on the very substantive agenda that we have with the Philippines. So, again, given that focus, we felt that it wasn't the right time to have a bilateral meeting between the two Presidents. And that's something that we discussed with officials from the government of the Philippines last night.\nGoing forward, I would expect our close cooperation to continue, and where we also have differences, we'll continue to speak to those. And as President Obama said, for any country in the world, not just the Philippines, we'll certainly support very robust counter-narcotic efforts, but we also want to make sure that they're consistent with the rule of law and due process. And that too will be a message that we continue to carry forward.\nQ: What can you say about the likelihood of a Syrian ceasefire at this point? And you've heard the calls from Erdogan to establish a no-fly zone now that there's been more progress in Jarabulus. Do you still feel the same way about a no-fly zone as you did before?\nMR. RHODES: So, again, as it relates to the potential for a ceasefire, that continues to be a subject of discussion with the Russian government. After the discussion between President Putin and President Obama yesterday, we feel like we have now identified the remaining gaps in what have been very extensive and technical discussions over a number of weeks now. And Foreign Minister Lavrov was returning to Moscow; Secretary Kerry is staying in touch with him, and they plan to meet in the coming days to see if they can conclude an agreement, having now identified the remaining issues.\nOur objectives for that agreement would include ensuring that there is a Cessation of Hostilities that allows for humanitarian assistance to get into people who are in need. We want to make sure that there's space for the moderate opposition, and we also are open to working with Russia to focus on the threat from al Qaeda in Syria, al Nusra, as well as ISIL.\nHowever, again, in order to achieve that cooperation, we do want to make sure that there is this period of calm and that there is this humanitarian access. So we'll be, again, following up in discussions between Secretary Kerry and Foreign Minister Lavrov, and I think we've made a lot of progress. But we're not going to take a deal that doesn't meet our basic objectives. And I think we'll know very quickly whether or not we can close those remaining gaps.\nAnd your other question was -- President Erdogan. Well, first of all, I think we very much welcome the progress that has been made in terms of clearing ISIL out from along the Turkish border. That's something that we've been focused on for a long time now in our discussions with Turkey. Our own operations in support of SDF opposition forces on the ground helped to clear Manbij, which was a key transit point for ISIL fighters into Turkey. And Turkey's operations in Jarabulus and then further clearing operations on the border have made a significant amount of progress on what has been a key priority, which is making sure that you cut off that border area. Because, frankly, that's also where the flow of foreign fighters comes in and out of Syria, and so if we can seal that border using Turkish forces, opposition forces, with our logistical and air support, I think that would help us make a substantial gain against ISIL.\nIn terms of a no-fly zone, in terms of the dedication of U.S. military resources, we want to use those resources to go after ISIL, to go after al Nusra insofar as we see them affiliated with al Qaeda and engaged in external plotting. We do not think a no-fly zone would resolve the fundamental issues on the ground because there continues to be fighting on the ground. A no-fly zone would necessarily only be contained to one specific area, and we have problems and violence across the country.\nHowever, if we are able to preserve the space along that Turkish border, you do have an area for greater security and you do prevent this flow of foreign fighters into and out of Syria. So that's something -- an objective we shared with President Erdogan. We have not determined that a no-fly zone would be the best dedication of U.S. military resources.\nQ: Back on the meeting with Duterte. You said that it was your judgment that given the focus on his comments that you decided not to do the meeting. So are you saying that it wasn't the content of what he said that you found objectionable, or -- I'm trying to figure out what you're -- it seems like you're saying -- you're putting the focus on the fact that it was gathering all this attention as opposed to what he actually said, and I'm wondering if that had anything to -- if the President was offended by that.\nMR. RHODES: Well, look, I think the two are fundamentally interrelated. So certainly the nature of those comments was not constructive, and therefore there was an enormous amount of tension on this series of statements by President Duterte. And again, given the important issues that we have, having a meeting where all we were going to discuss was a series of comments, frankly, did not strike us as the most constructive way to approach a bilateral meeting.\nAt the same time, we also knew that we could have a very important meeting with President Park of the Republic of Korea at a time when we just recently had an additional provocation from North Korea. So we had a lot of business to do with President Park, and we had a constructive meeting with her today.\nBut, again, we remain in contact with Filipino officials, and our close alliance relationship obviously continues and will going forward.\nQ: Can I ask on North Korea? Can you explain a little bit -- about closing loopholes? What loopholes? And is he talking about new sanctions? What did he mean by \"making them more effective?\" And do you expect that he'll do some of this around UNGA?\nMR. RHODES: So we've passed now through the U.N. Security Council the strongest sanctions ever on North Korea. They are having an impact, we believe. It is putting a tighter squeeze on North Korea. At the same time, we have over many years seen North Korea try to find ways to evade sanctions, try to find ways to access foreign currency, try to find ways to access sensitive technology using front companies for their activities. So we have to be very vigilant in sanctions enforcement, and we have to maintain the sense of urgency among the international community.\nThis is something that President Obama talked to President Xi about, because China plays an enormously important role in the enforcement of those sanctions. It's something that we'll talk about with the leaders here at the East Asia Summit, because when you look at the interdiction of sensitive technologies into North Korea, or the interdiction of North Korean efforts to procure things on the international black market, we've worked very closely with a number of Southeast Asian countries as well.\nSo we want to make sure that we're just cutting off all the lifelines that North Korea tries to grab onto in terms of evading sanctions and accessing currency so that they pay the full cost for their actions. So that was a subject of the meeting with President Park. So was our shared commitment to deploy the THAAD defensive -- missile defense system, given these repeated provocations and the development of ballistic missiles. One of the things the two leaders focused on was our determination to move forward with the deployment of the THAAD system, which protects U.S. personnel in the Republic of Korea, protects our allies, and it ultimately is necessary to counter the threat from North Korean ballistic missiles\nMR. EARNEST: Ron.\nQ: Are you saying that in order to -- a more meaningful agreement on Syria, the two Presidents won't be -- down the road, that something appropriate or (inaudible) be accomplished about that? And secondly, on the whole cyber issue thing, the President spoke about it generally -- about (inaudible) but how concerned is he about the Russians specifically trying to target -- to meddle in the U.S. election?\nMR. RHODES: So, first of all, on Syria, we did not in any way have an expectation that the two presidents would conclude the agreement, because, frankly, the remaining issues are fairly technical, and they have to do with the manner in which an agreement would be implemented. And so we've had expert teams that have been negotiating this in Geneva in some detail, and Secretary Kerry and Foreign Minister Lavrov have been leading those discussions.\nSo the purpose of the meeting between the two presidents was to provide direction to those teams to indicate what were our respective priorities, and then to see whether they can get this done. And I do not think that the two presidents will need to meet on this again. Frankly, we would like to see this, if it can get done, happen quickly because of the enormous humanitarian needs in places like Aleppo. If it cannot get done, we won't sign on to a bad deal.\nSo I think we've been at this long enough to know what the outlines of an agreement could be, and we have to see in the coming days whether or not that can conclude, because there is an urgent humanitarian situation that needs to be dealt with. There is a terrorist threat that needs to be dealt with. And there also is the necessity of having space for a moderate opposition that can participate in the political process in Syria.\nOn cyber issues, the President spoke to this yesterday. I think, again, generally speaking, we have raised concerns with Russia, with China, about certain cyber activities that have targeted U.S. interests. The fact of the matter is, in this space we have our own significant offensive and defensive capabilities. And the reason he speaks about international rules and norms is precisely because we want to be able to hold nations to account when they are operating in an offensive manner against our infrastructure or, frankly, any other nation's infrastructure.\nWe're confident in our cybersecurity capabilities and our ability to secure our critical infrastructure, our election, as the President said yesterday. So I'm not going to get into the details of ongoing investigations that may be taking place about certain cyber intrusions.\nGenerally, we've also had concerns with some Russian actions in other parts of the world, where we've seen them seek to play a role in European politics, as well. So I think, in addition to the cyber issues, we do want to make sure that we and our democratic allies are standing up for the values that we believe in and pushing back against any efforts from Russia to seek to support -- again, I'm speaking in Europe now -- efforts to undermine European unity.\nQ: But about how many -- this investigation (inaudible). Is there a concern specifically about the U.S. election, based on (inaudible)?\nMR. RHODES: Well, again, I think we're always obviously focused on assuring that we have the ability to defend against cyber threats to all of our critical infrastructure and all major events. But again, as the President has said, I think we have great confidence in our electoral process and the integrity of our elections.\nMR. EARNEST: Roberta.\nQ: Is there any chance at all that President Obama would have kind of like an informal pull-aside or informal chat with President Duterte on the sidelines of these summits, particularly now that President Duterte has offered some kind of an apology for his statements? And secondly, how concerned is the White House that this spat, whatever you want to call it, could have an impact and push the Philippines into sort of China's arms?\nMR. RHODES: So I would expect that the President will see President Duterte in the course of those summits. We have an ASEAN meeting, we have an East Asia Summit meeting. He tends to interact with all the leaders at those events. So I would not expect a formal bilateral meeting, but I think he'll have an opportunity to interact with him, as with all leaders.\nWith respect to the South China Sea, we've sustained very close cooperation with the Philippines over the course of the transition to the new government there on those issues. So, first of all, we've supported the outcome of the arbitral ruling because we believe that international legal processes are the way to resolve these issues. We have a very close partnership with the Philippines on maritime security issues and continue to provide them with assistance in that space. We have a recently agreed-upon access agreement as it relates to bases in the Philippines. So the working relationship in this very important space continues to be strong.\nFrankly, where we've had differences with President Duterte has related more to our concerns that there needs to be a clear commitment to due process and the rule of law as it relates to some of the internal security efforts that had been undertaken there. On the alliance issues, we'll continue to work closely with them.\nWe do think it's important, though, that given the serious nature of the issues in our relationship, that leaders seek to create a constructive tone for discussions. And again, that is why we made the decision that we did about the bilateral meeting.\nAs it relates to China, we welcome efforts by the Philippines to engage in a dialogue with China. Our position has always been that we're not picking a winner in terms of claims; that we want to see basic international principles upheld, including the peaceful resolution of disputes consistent with international law. What we don't want to see is these claims resolved through force or coercion. So we don't want to see a bigger nation forcing a smaller nation to accept their will. However, if the Philippines can reach a mutual understanding with China, or any of the claimants can reach a peaceful resolution to these disputes consistent with international law, then we believe that would be a constructive development. And, in fact, we've encouraged all ASEAN countries who are claimants to engage in dialogue, and we've encouraged ASEAN as a collective to support these basic sets of international principles.\nMR. EARNEST: Margaret.\nQ: On North Korea, did you get any concrete pledges from Xi on cutting off financial lifelines? Because it was mentioned broadly, but specifically, anything that China is actually going after, bank accounts of -- leaders in a serious way? And on Duterte, this isn't the first time that he's insulted a U.S. leader, though it's certainly the first time the most powerful man in the world. I mean, he called John Kerry crazy. He used slurs to refer to the U.S. ambassador. Do you see this as a trend of anti-Americanism in the Philippines? And are you concerned about some of the things Duterte has said about perhaps getting a little closer to the Chinese, putting the court ruling aside?\nMR. RHODES: So, each time we've seen comments like that, I think we've expressed concern. We were certainly concerned about the comments that related to our ambassador. I think that, again, what we are focused on here is whether or not comments like that on the eve of a meeting, and comments that related to a very substantive difference that we have raised consistently as it relates to due process, that those comments were going to prevent us from having the right environment to have a serious, productive discussion.\nIn terms of anti-Americanism, I think if you look at the views of the people of the Philippines, they're overwhelmingly in favor of the alliance. They're overwhelmingly positive about the United States. Frankly, we've come a long way from a number of years ago when there was a greater degree of anti-American sentiment. I think we've built trust with the people of the Philippines. President Obama has invested a lot in that relationship. I think he's very well thought of in the Philippines. The fact that we're able to conclude a basing access agreement I think signaled that we're in a new chapter in our relationship.\nSo, again, we look at the whole, which is what is our relationship with the government and people of the Philippines, and we think it is very strong. However, when we see actions that we would object to anywhere, we're going to voice concerns. And when we see comments that are along the lines of what President Duterte said the other day, again, we'll raise our concerns about that as well.\nWhat we want is an effective working relationship, though, so our hope is that there's an effort that is continued to be made by the government of the Philippines to have the right tone for our discussions to be productive going forward.\nQ: Do you want an apology?\nMR. RHODES: I think it's their determination as to how they address his comments. We've noted the statements that they've made over the course of the day. I think we'd welcome efforts to set a positive tone for the discussions between our leaders. At the same time, the working relationships continue to be very strong in the relevant ministries and throughout our diplomatic and military channels. So none of these comments have affected the basic cooperation that takes place on a day to day basis with the Philippines.\nMR. EARNEST: William.\nQ: Thank you.\nMR. RHODES: Oh and again on China, look, we don't -- we have no concerns about there being positive relations between our allies and China. In fact, when our allies have constructive relations with China, it contributes to stability broadly in the Asia Pacific. We do have concerns about circumstances where China or any other nation may seek to coerce another country. So if the government of the Philippines is engaged in a dialogue with China about South China Sea claims or other issues, that's consistent with the type of diplomatic resolutions we seek here.\nFrankly, what nobody has an interest in is there to be an escalation or a conflict over these issues. We do take the position on the arbitral ruling that this is legally binding and that claims should be resolved under international law. And China is party to the U.N. convention on the law of the sea, and so therefore we believe that they and other countries should respect that ruling as final and binding.\nQ: Can you talk a little bit about human rights -- with the Lao government? In what context did you raise it? Was it just, like, the standard response? And do you get any sense that there's going to be any movement -- any chance of movement on that? And then I was also wondering, is the difference you see between race and human rights with a country like China on one -- a country like Laos, is there ever a greater chance of getting something back for that? And how do you see that coming out? And I have a follow-up question about a specific case.\nMR. RHODES: So as it relates to human rights here in Laos, in every country in the world we support a set of basic universal values like freedom of expression, freedom of association, the freedom of people to exercise the rights that are enshrined in the U.N. charter.\nI think in terms of the President's conversations and some of our work here, we have focused on support for civil society. We believe, frankly, that civil society can be an important partner in supporting development. We've seen a trend in different countries of restrictions placed on civil society. So that is both an issue that relates to political matters, but also we see civil society organizations that could do important work here in Laos on issues related to health or education and development. So that's certainly an issue that the President raised here, as he has in other places.\nI think tomorrow he'll be meeting with the Young Southeast Asian Leaders in Luang Prabang, many of whom are in the civil society space. When we work to develop these YSEALI networks, civil society along with entrepreneurship is one of the areas of focus. So there will be representatives in the audience tomorrow who have worked on civil society issues.\nI would say that we also then generally raise concerns around specific human rights concerns that emerge, whether they be individual cases or, broadly speaking, our desire to see a greater freedom of speech and association, whether that's in Laos or anywhere else in the world.\nLook, I would say candidly -- and I said this in Vietnam -- that if you're in Vietnam or you're in Laos, there's obviously a history that is quite complicated. And we do feel the need to make clear that when we raise these issues, we're not in any way suggesting that the policy of the United States is to change the regime here or to impose a new political system. It's to support a set of universal values that we would anywhere else. And we understand, obviously, and have to be mindful of the fact that we're building a new relationship here. And we don't have as extensive a history of dialogue with the government on these issues as we might have in other places. So we're just beginning to have these types of conversations at high levels and we will continue to do so.\nI think with respect to China, we raise all of the same issues there. They manifest themselves in different ways, whether it be the individual cases, which President Obama did raise when he was in China, or whether it be issues related to Tibet, or whether it be issues related to freedom of religion, which is something the President also raised when he was in China. I think the U.S.-China relationship is so big and so multifaceted that it just takes place as a part of a much broader discussion. But a human rights dialogue has been a consistent part of our China policy and it will be going forward.\nQ: And can you talk about the case of Sombath Somphone? Was that raised? And how was that raised, and what was your response? His wife mentioned especially that the standard response -- the police are looking into it, but is that what you got?\nMR. RHODES: The standard response has been what?\nQ: It's simply that police are looking into his disappearance. It's been four years, though.\nMR. RHODES: So I met with Mr. Somphone's wife when I visited Laos earlier this summer. I'll be meeting with her over the course of this visit as well. We stay in regular contact with her and we care very deeply about her case and her husband. We believe that she deserves to know what happened to her husband and what the status of his case is.\nThe response that we get from the Lao government is what she referenced, which is that they're continuing to investigate this. And oftentimes, they indicate that they do not know and that there is an ongoing investigation. Given his prominence, this is something that we'll continue to raise. I think the President addresses these issues around civil society and human rights in his meetings, and then we tend to raise individual cases with the government around those meetings.\nQ: Just talking about the complicated history of -- the decision to develop the funding for getting rid of these bombs over the country. Is that -- it was not the case in, say, Hiroshima, but is this an apology from the U.S. for what happened all those years ago? And second, in terms of MIA, I know it's been about 30 years since we started searching for the Americans that went missing. And the foreign minister said last week -- taken about 30 years. Why has it taken so long? Is it that they're somewhere out on the mountain somewhere? Are they buried where they can't be found? Why does it take so long to find them if -- it's going to take around 30 years?\nMR. RHODES: So I've worked on both of these issues. On the POW/MIA issues, we've actually taken some steps around this visit that we believe will help us accelerate the process of recovery. We've been focused on increasing the number of personnel that are in the teams that go out and conduct the recovery efforts and their ability to operate for longer durations of time at the sites.\nThe reality is, as you said, I think part of the reason it's so difficult here is that many of the search areas are densely forested, many years have passed, and it's just hard work. But it is a principle of the U.S. government that we do not leave people behind and that we exhaust every effort to find personnel who are missing in action and we'll continue to do that. I could not put a precise timeline on it, but we'd obviously like to get it done as quickly as possible. And we've made progress in recent years and around this visit in taking steps to improve our capacity in this space.\nObviously, as in Vietnam, this was a process of building trust. The notion of having teams go out in this country was controversial when it started, but now we have a good working relationship.\nOn the UXO, I think that the -- what's unique about the situation here is that this poses an ongoing threat to the people of Laos. Since the conclusion of our bombing, some 20,000 Lao have been either killed or wounded by the UXO. So it poses a danger to civilians in many different parts of the country. It's also an enormous obstacle to development here, because in a country that has got a largely agricultural economy, you cannot develop land that is littered with cluster munitions.\nSo we believe that we have a profound responsibility, a moral responsibility to do our part. When we took office, I think we were spending roughly $3 million a year, which, frankly, was nowhere near the scale of support that the Lao government needed to try to get as much done as possible in this space. We've steadily increased that. The three-year $90 million commitment is going to enable us to do a comprehensive nationwide survey here in Laos so that we're better able to identify precisely where we think these munitions are, and then we can prioritize clearance, working with the Lao and our other partners in this space.\nWe want to make it more efficient and quick, just as our recovery efforts, to clear this UXO. And in the past, it's been very difficult work -- people out with metal detectors trying to identify individual munitions, and then explode them when you have millions of cluster munitions across the country -- that is difficult work. But this is going to jumpstart that process and hopefully save lives, support victims, and open the space for greater economic development here in Laos. So we're very proud of the ability to make additional contributions.\nI don't think it's a matter of apologizing. I do think that, as President Obama said -- referenced in his remarks today, this was largely a secret war to the American people, and therefore there wasn't the same degree of public knowledge about what was taking place here, and about the scale of the bombing that took place here. And that may have contributed to the fact that we were slower in beginning to engage in some of these efforts than in a place like Vietnam, where we've been doing Agent Orange and Dioxin cleanup for a long time now.\nSo we fell an urgency, given the fact that people are still dying and being wounded by these weapons, to do our part to try to accelerate the clearance process.\nQ: I had a quick -- with Ben, and then couple of domestic -- I don't know if you want to -- Ben, the President said Secretary Kerry and Foreign Minister Lavrov were going to meet in the coming days on the Syria deal. Has that -- been planned? Has that been scheduled, or is it kind of --\nMR. RHODES: No, I think that's -- I mean, you'll have to check with the State Department on precise timing, but I think that's still the plan. And again, the urgency for the meeting is both we feel like we have a clear understanding of what the remaining issues, but also there's a humanitarian situation that we'd like to address as soon as possible.\nQ: Josh, Oklahoma ordered the shutdown of a couple dozen wells after the earthquake over the weekend. I'm wondering if the President worries those kinds of events are going to become the norm, and secondly, if -- he's very happy to take credit -- energy crisis, so -- if he at all regrets the advocacy for fracking he's -- attempting to (inaudible.)\nMR. EARNEST: I did see the news about the announcement in Oklahoma. What our policy has been as it relates to fracking has been to ensure that environmental experts and the federal government, including at the EPA, are working closely with state officials to design a regime to ensure the safety and security of the people who live in the area. In some cases, that has meant a concern about the water supply. I know that there have been other concerns about the impact of these kinds of procedures on possibly leading to earthquakes.\nSo our approach in Oklahoma will continue to be the approach we've taken all across the country, which is we're going to continue to work with local officials who do have the primary responsibility of ensuring the safety and security of the communities where this kind of activity is taking place.\nObviously, some of the advances that we've seen in the technology that have opened up access to larger deposits of natural gas have contributed to driving down the cost of natural gas, and also making the use of this fossil fuel that's much more -- much less of a contributor to climate change more common. And that's had a positive impact on the level of emissions that we've seen in this country over the last several years. That's not something that the President regrets, but the President will insist that the work to exploit those deposits is done as safely as possible. And we're certainly -- we've been mindful of that from the beginning, and our policy with regard to fracking has not changed.\nQ: And then Congress went back today with a list of -- a laundry list of the priorities that we've heard for -- I'm wondering specifically about the possibility of a government shutdown this fall -- your thinking of the chances of that happening, and have you received any assurances from Speaker Ryan or other congressional leaders that they'll probably get through the election, or -- and into the next presidency before (inaudible)?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, Justin, I'm not sure that people would -- that anybody at this point would put a lot of stock in the assurances, whether we receive them or not. The fact is we have seen the Republican-led Congress operate at historic lows when it comes to doing the people's business. Republicans, for some time, prided themselves on their ability to pass budgets. And despite having significant majorities in both the House and the Senate, they have not succeeded in passing any appropriations bills this year. And that does not bode well for the ability of members of Congress to do their job and ensure that they can pass a budget before the end of the fiscal year.\nThis administration is certainly going to continue to be in touch with members of Congress now that they're back to work after a seven-week break. Hopefully they're ready to get some business done. Hopefully that will include funding for Zika that is badly needed. Hopefully that will include funding for opioid addiction and treatment -- something that both parties have identified as a priority. Obviously we'd like to see some progress on the President's Supreme Court nominee and on TPP as well. So there's a long to-do list for members of Congress who have been gone for a while now. And hopefully they'll get after it, as they say.\nBut I think the other point that I would make here is simply that the American people are going to be watching. And as people across the country prepare to go to the ballot box this fall, they're not just going to be casting votes for the presidential candidates that understandably get the most attention, but they're also going to be making decisions about whether or not they're being well-represented in Congress. And based on the track record that we've seen from the Republican majority in Congress, I think serious doubts have been raised. And I think that does explain the low standing of Congress in public opinion surveys. I think it does account for a lot of the dissatisfaction that people have with the political system in Washington, D.C.\nAnd I've made the observation many times that there are no Republicans in Congress who are currently serving there who are forced to serve in Congress. They ran for these jobs. And the American people elected them to these jobs with the expectation that they were actually going to do something. And we have seen that Republicans in Congress have not done much, and all too often they have refused to do their job. And when it comes to the budget and a looming deadline at the end of this month, hopefully they'll step up to the plate and get it done.\nAndrew.\nQ: A quick question on the meeting next weekend with Aung San Suu Kyi. Ben, do you think there's anything you can do to help her government establish itself in terms of --\nMR. RHODES: I'm sorry, who did you say? Suu Kyi, okay.\nQ: Is there anything you can do to help her government improve their fiscal situation or -- in terms of sanctions or with the (inaudible)?\nMR. RHODES: Well, first of all, she'll be visiting Washington and meeting with the President on September 14th in her capacity as State Counselor. Since the NLD-led government took office, we have looked precisely at this question of what we can do to help. Some of that is related to providing direct assistance, and we've significantly increased the assistance through USAID, much of which is in the space related to capacity-building, so that they're better able to attract investment and create the type of legal frameworks that can grow their economy, in addition to dealing with specific issues like conflict resolution and trafficking.\nI think the biggest thing, though, we can do is help their economy grow by opening up greater trade between Myanmar and the United States and other countries around the world. Again, some of that involves us working with them so that they're strengthening the environment for investment and trade. Some of that involves sanctions relief, and we've taken steps to relax the sanctions and to authorize greater activity. It's something that we continue to look at, because the purpose of the sanctions regime was to support a democratic transition, and some of the sanctions even were tied to the treatment of Suu Kyi specifically.\nWe, of course, continue to have concerns about a range of issues inside of Myanmar, but we do want to make sure that there's a democratic dividend. I got a question before about human rights. One of the best things that we can do to support human rights is to make sure that when there are transitions to democracy, that they succeed. And so given that Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD are now elected leaders in Myanmar, we need to make sure that they are showing a dividend for their people. And so we'll be exploring ways that we can help them deal with their economy, whether that's through sanctions relief, whether that's through working with her to promote greater commercial ties with the United States. That's going to be, I think, a focal point of her visit to Washington.\nAt the same time, she has a range of other challenges that she's dealing with, whether it relates to the peace process with the ethnic groups or the situation in Rakhine State. On both those issues, she's put forward ambitious plans recently -- in the peace process, convening a conference with all of the different ethnic groups; in Rakhine State, taking some initial steps to have a citizenship verification process and have a commission that can oversee that in Rakhine; but also, I think importantly, inviting international participation through Kofi Annan's auspices. So she's doing a lot of things to try to address the toughest issues inside the country, and we want to make sure she can succeed.\nAnd so that's one of the things that we'll be most focused on when she comes to Washington. I'm sure, again, given Congress's role in supporting her and our Burma policy over the years, we'll be consulting with them, as well -- and we have been -- leading up to her visit. And that will continue when we get back to Washington.\nQ: (Inaudible) as in Burma, you would welcome a transition to the (inaudible)?\nMR. RHODES: Well, the key point I'd make here is that that transition was led by the people of Myanmar. That was not imposed by the United States. We spoke out for what we believed in. We imposed sanctions when we saw things that were contrary to our values or international law. But ultimately it took the courage of people like Aung San Suu Kyi and countless political prisoners who are now serving in parliament, over many years, to bring about a democratic transition.\nIt also took a decision by the previous government to allow for an opening and to allow for elections. Now, we were very much engaged in that process, pressuring them for many years, and then, beginning in 2011 really, accelerating our engagement on behalf of things like release of political prisoners, democratic elections. So we played a role in supporting that transition. But, ultimately, it was the people of Myanmar themselves who claimed democratic gains -- that are not yet complete. There is still 25 percent of the parliament reserved for the military.\nBut I think a key point in our foreign policy has been that we gain more in promoting our interests and our values by engaging countries; that just sitting back and criticizing countries has a limit in terms of what it can achieve. So when you look at a Myanmar, when you look at a Cuba, when you look at a Vietnam, and when you look at a Laos, these are all countries with whom we have very different relationships. The common thread is we have very difficult histories. But we believe that we're going to be more effective in building partnerships and advancing our interests and improving the livelihoods of people in these countries, and ultimately in supporting things we believe through engagement.\nWe are going to make clear in that process that we are not going to impose, again, a political system, or impose -- insist upon regime change. Those are decisions that should be left to the people of these countries.\nQ: A couple questions. Just to be clear, the Philippine government I believe suggested that there would be some sort of rescheduling of this meeting. I know you mentioned that they'll probably have a chance, Obama and Duterte, to chat along the sidelines. But is there any date set for them to actually meet before President Obama leaves office, perhaps during UNGA? That's one.\nAnd then on Syria, broadly speaking, what can the U.S. realistically do, not just on a Cessation of Hostilities, but more broadly to pressure Russia to stop propping up the Assad regime? What are the carrots and the sticks, if you look at it that way?\nAnd then lastly, on Turkey, how concerned are you that any failure, if the U.S. doesn't ultimately extradite Fethullah Gulen -- how concerned are you that that could irreparably harm the relationship with Turkey?\nMR. RHODES: I think, look, it's an irritant on our relationship, there's no question about that. The fact of the matter is, though, we have a system in which the President could not simply choose to return Gulen. I do think it's important that we show that we take Turkey's concerns seriously, and that's why the Department of Justice has devoted a lot of resources to reviewing Turkish evidence and sitting down with their Turkish counterparts. And I think that the government of Turkey sees that we're taking this seriously. We're not ignoring their concerns, we're just saying you have to meet a legal threshold. And so we'll continue to have those discussions.\nI do think that President Obama and President Erdogan had a positive meeting, and the tone of the comments after the meeting reflected that, as well as the progress that we're seeing in Syria.\nWith respect to Russia, I think the principal point that we've always made to the Russians is, when you talk about incentives: They are not going to be able to achieve their own objectives unless they engage in the type of process that we're negotiating. There is not a military solution to pacify that entire country. There is not a circumstance in which they continue to support a regime that has been bombarding its own people that doesn't lead to greater international isolation of not just the Assad regime, but ultimately Russia -- because those actions are opposed by many of the other countries in the region.\nRussia would benefit from there being a political resolution inside of Syria that can end the violence. And the only way in which you are going to achieve that is if there is a moderate opposition that is able to come to the table. At the same time, Russia wants -- it says -- to go after al Qaeda and ISIL. Well, the best way to do that is to go after al Qaeda and ISIL, and not after opposition that is more moderate in orientation and that would be interested in coming into a political resolution. Ultimately, they'll have to make the determination. And I think we'll learn over the course of the coming discussions whether or not they indeed are serious about narrowing a focus to al Qaeda and ISIL. That's a proposition that's being tested in those discussions.\nOn the Philippines, again, I think they'll see each other at the summit, as the President will see leaders over the course of tomorrow's dinner and the meetings the following day. We do not have a formal bilateral meeting scheduled. We don't anticipate a formal bilateral meeting. I do think it's the case that -- we're not indicating that we'll never speak to the President of the Philippines, we just don't think that this is the right environment after the series of comments. So I don't have any scheduling updates.\nI think in terms of the coming days we'll see him as a part of the summit meetings.\nQ: Is there a situation in which THAAD doesn't get deployed? For example, if you're more effective enforcing -- if China is more effective enforcing sanctions?\nMR. RHODES: Sanctions enforcement, no, would not lead to a reconsideration of THAAD. I think the two leaders were very clear today that they're both committed to the deployment of the THAD system; that it's entirely necessary, given the threats emanating from North Korea. That's something that President Obama said to President Xi as well.\nThe fact of the matter is we've also made the case to the Chinese that this is not a system directed at them; that this is directed at a threat from North Korea so that they should not have concerns about the deployment of the system. In terms of what could lead us to change our minds, North Korea could abandon its ballistic missile program and nuclear programs.\nThe reason we're deploying THAAD is because of the provocations from North Korea and the constant testing of ballistic missiles and the nuclear tests as well. So, again, this is a defensive system that is in response to North Korean threats. A change of behavior from North Korea is the thing that could change that calculus, but we have not yet seen any indication, given that they just recently launched another ballistic missile.\nThis is a threat to us, it's a threat to the Republic of Korea, it's a threat to Japan. I would add that the one other thing that President Obama and President Park spoke about is the importance of continued trilateral cooperation between our three countries. And in that regard, we've welcomed the progress and the leadership shown by President Park and Prime Minister Abe as well.\nMR. EARNEST: Anybody else? Yes, ma'am, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thank you very much. So the President is -- wanted to have the bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Abe? And also my question is about the state of new -- the review of the nuclear -- of the administration. So what do you want to accomplish at the next UNGA about -- in terms of the state -- and also, how much does the President weigh in -- of a nuclear weapon?\nMR. RHODES: So I would expect that the President will have an opportunity to have a meeting with Prime Minister Abe. So we're -- I think we're trying to find the time for that discussion. I think given the recent missile launch and our continued efforts to coordinate with Japan on a host of issues, that they'll want to find a time for a discussion. They spoke I think a number of times at the G20 meeting, so it may not have to be a lengthy meeting, but I do think that they'll sit down and want to have a bilateral conversation.\nWith respect to our nuclear policies, I think President Obama has consistently said that we want to look for ways to strengthen international norms against the use of nuclear weapons, and that we want to find ways to lead by example as well. As it relates to testing, we are committed to CTBT, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. We are not able to achieve ratification through the Senate, even though that's something we'll continue to do because we think Senate ratification would be critically important.\nAt the same time, we do want to see whether we can find ways for there to be international expressions of support for the norm against testing. I think that's all the more important given what we're talking about, which is North Korea having conducted repeated nuclear tests in violation of international law. In that environment, why would you not want to work at the U.N., with other countries to have a strong statement that reinforces and strengthens a fundamental international norm against testing nuclear weapons? So those are conversations that we're having diplomatically.\nBeyond that, I think we regularly look at a range of different options as it relates to our own nuclear arsenal. Some of those involve how we are addressing our own stockpile -- we've had arms control negotiations with Russia that have stalled. So we continue to look at ways in which we can lead by example, and the President said he was going to do that in Hiroshima.\nHowever, what should be very clear is that the security guarantees that we have to our allies are ironclad. And, in fact, today, in the meeting with President Park, you heard President Obama indicate once again that we embrace the concept of extended deterrence as it relates to the Republic of Korea. So we've always made clear -- and Japan, Republic of Korea will always have the commitment of our full arsenal as it relates to their defense.\nI think it's certainly -- well, I wouldn't go beyond that. There are no decisions that are pending for the President. I think there's been more speculation, frankly, publicly about this than should be the case, given that it's not as if the President is engaged in reviewing any imminent decisions. And were we to look at issues related to declaratory policy, we would obviously consult with our allies. But the fact of the matter is our security guarantees are rock solid and they will continue to be.\nMR. EARNEST: Have a good evening, everybody.\nEND 7:14 P.M.

Hurt, R-VA, and five cosponsors)\nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 5424. Actions taken in the years since enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act are curbing excessive risk-taking, closing regulatory gaps, and making our financial system safer and more resilient. For the first time, advisers to private funds with more than $150 million in assets are required to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); comply with new recordkeeping, reporting, and audit requirements; and file systemic risk reports. The President has been clear about his opposition to any legislation that would weaken or reduce oversight of the financial system.\nSpecifically, H.R. 5424 would create a loophole providing a broad exemption from audit and exam requirements, leaving investors unable to verify that funds actually contain particular investments as claimed. The bill would also make it more difficult for the SEC to police the market, particularly with respect to investments in uncertificated, private securities for which advisers would not be required to keep any record. Further, H.R. 5424 would repeal important safeguards, including the requirements that advisers: notify clients of a change in ownership or control of the adviser, deliver a plain language narrative brochure to clients annually, and disclose certain information on large private equity funds to regulators.\nThe exemptions that this bill provides would enable private fund advisers to slip back into the shadows. H.R. 5424 unnecessarily puts working and middle-class families at risk while benefitting Wall Street and other narrow special interests. Considering that investors in private equity funds include public pension funds – which support our Nation's teachers, police officers and firefighters – the Congress should be encouraging the SEC to fully implement the enhanced investor safeguards provided in current law, not repealing important protections. Therefore, the Administration strongly opposes H.R. 5424 and urges the Congress to act responsibly by enacting laws that enhance protections for investors and help working and middle-class families.\nIf the President were presented with this legislation, his senior advisors would recommend he veto the bill.", "timestamp": "2016-09-06", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 5424 - Investment Advisers Modernization Act of 2016"}

Wagner, R-MO)\nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 2357, the Accelerating Access to Capital Act. The Rules Committee Print of H.R. 2357 contains the text of H.R. 2357 as reported (Title I), as well as texts of H.R. 4850, the Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act, as reported (Title II), and H.R. 4852, the Private Placement Improvement Act, as reported (Title III). Markets function most efficiently when they are transparent, well-regulated, and trusted by investors and issuers alike. These bills would reduce transparency and inhibit effective regulatory oversight of our capital markets by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These bills would undermine not only the health and integrity of our markets, but the very capital formation process they claim to promote.\nH.R. 2357 (Title I) would weaken investor protections by reducing the quality or availability of information needed to make informed investment decisions. By compelling the SEC to amend Form S-3, the bill would: (1) allow microcap companies traded on an exchange to issue an unlimited number of shares using shelf registration within a 12-month period; and (2) permit unlisted microcap companies, including those listed on the \"pink sheets,\" with less than $75 million in common equity to sell up to 1/3 of the market value of their common equity using shelf registration in a 12-month period. This bill would harm investors by reducing disclosure requirements and infringe on the SEC's ability to appropriately respond to market developments. Such changes would increase the risks posed by accounting fraud, market manipulation, insider trading, and the sale of artificially-inflated stock.\nH.R. 4850 (Title II) would similarly undermine investor protections and the integrity of capital formation for small businesses. Specifically, the bill eliminates all existing investor protections for crowdfunding and Regulation A offerings, provided that the securities: (1) are sold to purchasers with a substantive pre-existing relationship with individuals affiliated with the company, including controlling investors; (2) involve 35 or fewer purchasers; (3) do not exceed more than $500,000, annually; and (4) do not involve a person who has violated the securities laws. These criteria do not negate the need for consumer protections embedded in current regulations.\nThis legislation would create yet another unnecessary and unwarranted exemption from the Securities Act of 1933 to enable the sale of microcap offerings (those involving sales of securities valued at $500,000 or less in a single year) without appropriate regulatory protections. While the legislation would limit the total number of investors in such offerings, it lacks a requirement that those investors have the financial sophistication to understand potential risks of the offering or the financial means to withstand losses. It requires only that they have a \"pre-existing relationship\" with an officer, director, or major shareholder of the issuer, a condition that provides no meaningful protections.\nFinally, H.R. 4852 (Title III) runs counter to SEC efforts to enhance disclosure requirements, limiting the SEC's ability to finalize previously proposed investor protections, and would weaken other key consumer protections and provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Additionally, H.R. 4852 bars the SEC from taking appropriate actions to provide needed oversight of the financial markets, encourages widespread non-compliance with existing SEC filing requirements, and undermines the SEC's informed policymaking.\nIf the President were presented with H.R. 2357, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.", "timestamp": "2016-09-06", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 2357 - Accelerating Access to Capital Act of 2016"}
{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "note": "As prepared for delivery.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119197", "text": "Thank you. It's great to be back in North Carolina.\nIn 62 days, we are going to win this state – and we are going to win the White House.\nThis is our chance to end years of injustice, corruption and betrayal.\nThis is our chance to solve all of the problems that have gone unsolved for so many years.\nFor how long have people been saying Washington is broken and controlled by special interests?\nThis is the year we can finally fix it.\nThat's because change has to come from outside of our broken and corrupt system.\nWe will never fix our rigged system by relying on the people who rigged it in the first place.\nWe will never solve our problems by relying on the politicians who created our problems.\nSo to every American who has been waiting for real change, your wait is over – your moment of liberation is at hand. A vote for Trump is a vote to restore Democracy, to heal our economy, and to bring millions of jobs back into every forgotten stretch of this country.\nThe change will begin my first day in office.\nFirst, we are going to eliminate every unconstitutional executive order and restore the rule of law to our land.\nThen, we are going to begin implementing plans for construction of a wall along our southern border. This will keep out the violent cartels and gangs, as well as their drugs that are poisoning our youth.\nBut that's just the beginning.\nI am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare. Under Senate rules, that bill can be passed with 51 votes – meaning a Republican Congress and a Republican President can save Americans from this disaster in a single afternoon.\nIt's going to be a very busy first day.\nI am going to instruct the Department of State to immediately suspend the Syrian refugee resettlement program and develop plans for the construction of a safe zone in the region. My opponent wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. She is running to be America's Angela Merkel.\nI am also going to notify all countries that refuse to take back dangerous illegal immigrants who have committed crimes in this country that they will lose access to our visa programs if they continue to do so. This is the measure that is called for under current law, and I will enforce it.\nThe Secretary of State is required to take this action, but Hillary Clinton refused to do so – resulting in thousands of criminal aliens being released into U.S. communities.\nFurthermore, I will direct every agency in government to begin identifying all wasteful job-killing regulations and they are going to be removed – this will include lifting the restrictions on American energy.\nI will also notify our NAFTA partners of my intention to renegotiate the deal, and will withdraw from the TPP before it can be ratified. We are going to bring these jobs back to North Carolina.\nHillary Clinton supported NAFTA, she supported China's entry into the World Trade Organization, and she supported the TPP. She just does whatever her donors tell her to do.\nIn a Trump Administration, we will negotiate trade deals on behalf of American workers – not on behalf of global corporations.\nWe will work to ensure farmers in North Carolina have the tools they need to thrive at home and compete on a level playing field in foreign markets – and that means negotiating fair trade deals that put America First.\nCrucially, I am also going to convene my top generals and give them a simple instruction: they will have 30 days to submit to the Oval Office a plan for defeating ISIS. Any nation who shares in this goal will be our friend in this mission.\nFor years, we have been caught up in endless wars and conflicts under the leadership of failed politicians and a failed foreign policy establishment in Washington D.C. The same people who made every wrong decision in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, Egypt, China and Russia are the same people who are advising Hillary Clinton.\nI am proud instead to have the support of our warfighting generals, active duty military officers, and top military experts who know how to win – and know how to keep us out of endless war.\nToday, 88 retired U.S. generals and admirals signed a letter of endorsement.\nThat's one of the biggest differences between me and Hillary Clinton. She favors what has been called military adventurism – rushing to invade countries, displacing millions of families, then inviting the refugees into our country – creating power vacuums filled by terrorist groups like ISIS.\nI believe in a foreign policy based on our national interests that focuses on American security and regional stability – instead of using our military to create Democracies in countries with no Democratic history.\nWe will work to form partnerships overseas based on a long-term strategy of defeating Radical Islamic Terrorism.\nWe will first have to reverse the damage inflicted by Hillary Clinton – her legacy of failure in the Middle East, Russia and Asia has made Americans less safe than ever before.\nAs part of our plan to avoid and prevent foreign conflicts, we are going to rebuild our depleted military. This is the ultimate deterrent.\nWe will be guided by those three famous words: Peace Through Strength.\nI will ask Congress to eliminate the sequester and immediately re-invest in our military. Right now, we have the smallest air force since 1947, the smallest army since 1939, and one of the smallest Navy's since 1917.\nLike the Cold War, we also need to fight this battle by collecting intelligence and then protecting our classified secrets. Hillary Clinton has taught us all how much of a problem we have with cyber-security.\nWe can't have someone in the Oval Office who doesn't understand the meaning of the word confidential.\nThe new revelations about Hillary Clinton from the just-released FBI documents make more clear than ever that she fails to meet the minimum standard for running for public office. If she applied for a low-level job at the State Department today she couldn't even get a security clearance.\nHer conduct is disqualifying.\nLet's run through what we discovered in those FBI documents. It's important, and we're hoping Matt Lauer will ask about it on Wednesday night at the Townhall.\nIt's clear from the FBI report that Hillary Clinton lied about her handling of confidential information. She repeatedly told the country that she understood the classified system, then she told the FBI she didn't understand that the letter \"C\" meant confidential in the documents she emailed.\nOn 39 separate occasions she said she couldn't recall details about her mishandling of classified information, and she couldn't even name one step she took to make sure foreign hackers couldn't get into her server. Keep in mind, that her insecure emails included emails about the drone program.\nIt's also clear from the FBI report that Hillary Clinton and her top aides knowingly destroyed evidence and covered-up their actions. After her private server was revealed last March, her staff deleted all the emails and wiped it clean using a software designed to prevent any recovery, called BleachBit.\nThey used hammers to destroy phones so they couldn't be turned over later – and by the way, who uses 12 different phones in 4 years? The only people who use that many phones are usually involved in very, very shady activity.\nPeople who have nothing to hide don't smash phones with hammers. People who have nothing to hide don't bleach their emails, or destroy evidence to keep it from being publicly archived as required under federal law.\nHillary Clinton failed to turn over thousands of documents, then tried to shield her criminal conduct by having her chief-of-staff declare herself to be Hillary Clinton's private attorney.\nHillary and her top aides told the FBI and others in related lawsuits that they couldn't recall or remember key facts hundreds of different times – and that's in addition to the guy who set up the server pleading the 5th.\nNo one takes all the risks Hillary Clinton took unless they are trying to cover up massive crimes.\nHillary Clinton was using the State Department to dole out special favors and access to her friends and donors.\nIt's called pay-for-play.\nOne example of pay-for-play is what the Clinton's did in Haiti. Let me stop here for a second and say how much we love and appreciate the Haitian-American community in Florida and across our country. We send our prayers to the many still suffering in Haiti from the earthquake.\nBut while Haiti has suffered, the Clintons and their pals have cashed in.\nBill and Hillary's brothers have signed housing deals in Haiti, and one wound up on the board of a gold mining company.\nClinton Foundation donors have seen the Clintons pave the way for their investments.\nIn one deal, Hillary Clinton set aside environmental and labor rules to help a South Korean company with a record of violating workers' rights set up what amounts to a sweat shop in Haiti.\nThe facility has produced only a fraction of the jobs it promised and faces reports of wage theft.\nPeople are asking: where did all the money go?\nThis November, it is up to the American people to stop the Clintons from raiding America the way they have raided so many other people and places.\nOne of the groups in America that have been harmed the most by Hillary Clinton's policies are African-Americans. She sees them only as votes, not as people worthy of a better future.\nMany African-Americans have succeeded so greatly in this country, we will honor and protect their achievements. That includes lowering taxes for our small business owners to fifteen percent.\nBut millions of African-Americans in our inner cities remain trapped in poverty, joblessness and failing schools.\nThe Democratic Party has run the inner cities for fifty, sixty, seventy years and more.\n4 in 10 African-American children in poverty, including 45% of those under the age of six.\n58% of African-American youth are not working.\n2,900 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.\nNationwide, African-Americans are nearly 60% of the murder victims under the age of 22.\nThis is a national crisis – and anybody who fails to understand that is not fit to seek the Presidency of the United States.\nTo those suffering in crime and poverty, I say: give Donald J. Trump a chance. What do you have to lose by embracing our platform of change? We are going to bring back your jobs, rebuild your cities, and give parents and students school choice. I will never, ever, ever take you for granted.\nWe are going to push a new Civil Rights agenda. We believe every American has the right to a safe community, a great education and government that protects their jobs.\nThis weekend, I had the honor to join a church service in Detroit at the Great Faith Ministries International with the amazing Bishop Wayne Jackson. It was an incredible and deeply moving experience.\nI will fight for Detroit, for Chicago, for Baltimore, and for every neglected part of this nation – and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.\nLet me quote the same passage from the Bible I read on Saturday, from 1 John 4: \"No one has ever seen God; but, if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us.\"\nImagine what we our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One Flag.\nIt is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a New American Future.\nIn this future, we will respect the dignity of all Americans – and that means great jobs, great schools, and great neighborhoods.\nWe will keep our children safe – which requires secure borders, a strong military, and supporting law enforcement.\nJobs will return, prosperity will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.\nGovernment corruption will end – and the State Department will answer to the voters, not Hillary Clinton's donors.\nRepublicans are the Party of Abraham Lincoln and, come November 8th, we will once again have a government of, by and for the people.\nWe Will Make America Proud Again.\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\nAnd Will Make America Great Again.\nThank you, and God Bless!", "timestamp": "2016-09-06", "title": "Remarks at a Rally at the Greenville Convention Center in Greenville, North Carolina"}

Through increased dialogue and engagement in recent years, the United States and Laos have worked to overcome a painful historical legacy to forge a new partnership based on cooperation and mutual respect. Through the newly-established Comprehensive Partnership, the United States and Laos are opening a new era of bilateral relations based on common interests as well as a shared desire to heal the wounds of the past and build a foundation for the future.\nExpanded engagement with Southeast Asia is central to the U.S. Rebalance to Asia. The burgeoning bilateral relationship and U.S. support for Laos in its tenure as Chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) this year, including our co-hosting with Laos of the U.S-ASEAN Special Leaders' Summit in Sunnylands, California, attest to U.S. commitment to Laos and the broader region.\nWorking together to resolve legacy of war issues and pursue humanitarian cooperation enabled the United States and Laos to lay a strong foundation for a forward-looking partnership.\nThe United States is helping Laos clear unexploded ordnance (UXO), which poses a threat to people and hampers economic development. Over the last 20 years, the United States has contributed over $100 million to support UXO clearance programs, helping reduce annual casualties from over 300 to fewer than 50. The United States is committing $90 million over three years to conduct a comprehensive UXO survey of Laos and for continued clearing operations, and will continue to assist UXO victims in coordination with the Centre for Medical Rehabilitation under the Lao Ministry of Health. These efforts ensure UXO victims have better access to quality rehabilitation services, including orthotics and prosthetics to improve their lives.\nLaos and the United States have worked jointly to search for and recover the remains of Americans who were unaccounted for at the end of the Vietnam War, which has resulted in the recovery and identification of the remains of 273 missing Americans. We continue to explore ways to enhance recovery operations to provide the fullest possible accounting of the remaining 301 missing Americans and bring closure to their families. The Lao government committed to increase the size and operational flexibility of U.S.-Lao joint recovery operations, which will help accelerate our accounting efforts and attests to the commitment of both our countries to this humanitarian cooperation.\nWe are expanding economic ties to support economic development in Laos and create opportunities for U.S. companies. In February 2016, the United States signed a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement with Laos. This agreement will further strengthen economic ties and provides a forum to address issues and enhance opportunities for trade and investment between the two nations.\nGE has announced it will open an office in Vientiane, and signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Electricitй Du Laos, Laos' state electric utility, to upgrade its technical training center and conduct a detailed technical assessment that will help Laos make investments in a smarter grid that will leapfrog old technologies. Microsoft has partnered with the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications to help thousands of Lao students and entrepreneurs access training courses on subjects from technology and engineering to accounting and English language at no cost. The U.S. Trade and Development Agency has committed to fund a feasibility study for a 20 megawatt solar project in Laos, which would be the first, large-scale, non-hydro renewable energy project in Laos and support the country's goals of diversifying its energy mix.\nThe United States is committed to help Laos achieve its development goals. This year, USAID will lead new initiatives including a new five-year early grade reading program that will help prepare Lao students for an increasingly competitive and integrated ASEAN community. In addition, Laos has been selected as a Challenge Fund country for Let Girls Learn, which leverages and coordinates the resources of the U.S. government to address the many challenges adolescent girls face to attend and complete school so they can reach their fullest potential. Current development assistance in Laos already includes promoting health and nutrition, trade and investment, higher education, sustainable energy, addressing environmental degradation and the effects of climate change, and the challenges faced by persons with disabilities. A new Lao-American Nutrition Institute, built with U.S. funds, will enable the Oregon Health and Science University and the Lao Ministry of Health to work together to improve child nutrition in Laos. The United States, through the U.S. Department of Agriculture, has contributed nearly $100 million over 10 years for school meal programs in Laos that allow children to concentrate on their education.\nThe United States and Laos are advancing the Global Health Security Agenda. Laos formally endorsed and will join the multilateral Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA), which was launched in 2014 and now includes over 50 participating countries. The United States has prioritized Laos as a GHSA partner country and is providing technical assistance to Laos to complete a five-year roadmap in 2016. This national roadmap will outline specific milestones for Laos to achieve the GHSA targets, prevent, detect, and respond to biological threats, and fully implement the International Health Regulations. Laos has also made a commitment in 2016 to undergo and publish a Joint External Evaluation of its national capabilities, which the United States has recently accomplished.\nThe U.S.-supported Lower Mekong Initiative, launched in 2009, serves as a platform to address transnational development and policy challenges in the Lower Mekong region. The initiative explores ways for Lower Mekong countries to work together to bolster regional economic growth and strengthen the environmental and social aspects of regional development, including smart infrastructure, hydropower, and alternative energy.\nThe United States seeks to strengthen people-to-people ties with Laos by multiplying the connections between the young people of our two countries. Recognizing that 70 percent of Laos' population is under 30 years old, the United States is engaging the next generation of young leaders and sponsors the full range of U.S. exchange programs for Lao citizens, including Fulbright, Humphrey, the Global Undergraduate Exchange Program, Study of the U.S. Institutes for Scholars, and President Obama's Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative (YSEALI). Laos takes full advantage of these programs, and over 2,300 emerging Lao leaders belong to the YSEALI network. We are also increasing our English teaching programs by bringing more teachers and language experts to Laos, and leading a program to bring Lao grade school and university officials to the United States to improve their English-language skills. The United States and Laos committed to begin discussions on establishing a Peace Corps country agreement.\nWe are committed to promoting respect for human rights and religious freedom. The United States supports a vibrant and prosperous Laos that protects human rights, welcomes civil society, and respects the rule of law. Continued progress in these areas will enable our bilateral relationship to reach its full potential.", "timestamp": "2016-09-06", "title": "Fact Sheet: U.S.-Laos relations"}

On the occasion of his historic state visit to Lao P.D.R., President Barack Obama and President Bounnhang Vorachit held talks today in Vientiane where they officially inaugurated the Comprehensive Partnership between the Lao P.D.R. and the United States of America. Through this partnership, the United States and the Lao P.D.R. are opening a new era of bilateral relations based on mutual respect, common interests and a shared desire to heal the wounds of the past to build a foundation for the future. 2. President Obama and President Bounnhang Vorachit decided to form a U.S.-Lao P.D.R. Comprehensive Partnership for advancing the relationship. They underlined the principles of the U.S.-Lao P.D.R. Comprehensive Partnership, including respect for the United Nations Charter, international law, and each other's political systems, independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. They stated that the Comprehensive Partnership is intended to contribute to peace, stability, cooperation, and prosperity in each country, in the region, and in the world. The new Comprehensive Partnership will create mechanisms for cooperation in areas including political and diplomatic relations, trade and economic ties, science and technology, education and training, environment and health, humanitarian cooperation, war legacy issues, security, protection and promotion of human rights, and people-to-people ties.\nPolitical and Diplomatic Cooperation\n3. As part of the U.S.-Lao P.D.R. Comprehensive Partnership, the two sides committed to increase high-level exchanges as well as contacts at all levels, and to intensify dialogue and cooperation mechanisms. President Obama affirmed the United States' support for Lao P.D.R.'s independence, sovereignty, prosperity, and integration into the international community. President Bounnhang Vorachit welcomed the United States' enhanced cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region, which contributes to the peace, stability, and prosperity of the region. 4. The two leaders welcomed the establishment of a regular dialogue between their foreign ministries, and encouraged dialogues and exchanges between entities associated with political parties in both countries. 5. President Obama and President Bounnhang Vorachit committed to enhance cooperation at regional and international fora including the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), the East Asia Summit (EAS), and the ASEAN Defense Ministerial Meeting Plus (ADMM+) to support peace, stability, cooperation, and development in the Asia-Pacific region. The two leaders reaffirmed their support for the settlement of disputes by peaceful means in accordance with international law. They also reaffirmed their support for not resorting to the threat or use of force in resolving disputes. 6. Both leaders welcomed the progress made under the Lower Mekong Initiative (LMI) and Friends of the Lower Mekong (FLM) in recent years. Therefore, the two presidents reaffirmed their governments' commitment to work closely together, along with other LMI and FLM members, to further strengthen cooperation through the effective implementation of projects and programs under the LMI Master Plan of Action 2016-2020 and the Sustainable Infrastructure Partnership, to enhance regional connectivity and narrow the development gaps among member countries as well as promote sustainable socio-economic development and the well-being of people in the Mekong region.\nWar Legacy Issues\n7. President Obama and President Bounnhang Vorachit confirmed that comprehensive cooperation in addressing war legacy issues to deepen mutual trust has allowed both countries to develop a relationship that looks to the future. To address the impact caused by unexploded ordnance (UXO) in Laos, President Obama announced that the United States intends to contribute $90 million over three years for a national UXO survey and clearance of UXO in Laos. President Bounnhang Vorachit welcomed the U.S. government's continued commitment to clear UXO, assist UXO victims, prevent future casualties, and develop local capacity to ensure sustainability of this work.\nHumanitarian Cooperation\n8. President Obama expressed his appreciation for the Lao P.D.R.'s continued cooperation in providing for the fullest possible accounting for U.S. personnel missing from the war, including its recent steps to increase the efficiency of joint search efforts. The two sides would continue to meet semi-annually for technical discussions on mission planning and strive to complete the mission in a timely and efficient manner.\nTrade and Economic Ties\n9. President Obama and President Bounnhang Vorachit welcomed the signing earlier this year of a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement between the two countries. The Agreement will strengthen trade ties and form a basis for expanding streams of commerce between the two nations. 10. The two leaders recognized the importance of protecting the most vulnerable populations while pursuing economic development and upholding international labor standards, including combatting child labor, forced labor, and human trafficking. 11. President Obama welcomed President Bounnhang Vorachit's commitment to pursuing steps to uphold international labor standards that could pave the way for the United States to grant the Lao P.D.R. benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences.\nEducation Cooperation\n12. President Obama and President Bounnhang Vorachit affirmed the need to enhance educational, cultural, and people-to-people ties between the United States and Lao P.D.R. President Obama announced an initial basic education program, which focuses on improving early grade reading outcomes, and that Laos would be a Let Girls Learn Challenge Fund country, which would make Laos eligible for additional U.S. government funding for adolescent girls education. The two leaders noted the positive outcomes of the ongoing U.S. Government-funded School Feeding Program, for which the U.S. Government is currently providing over $27 million in funding over five years. They remarked on the rapid growth of English language programs in Lao P.D.R. and confirmed that close cooperation on education and training are critical elements to the next phase of the relationship. The leaders noted that robust English language instruction would contribute to the Lao P.D.R.'s effective collaboration with other ASEAN nations for their mutual educational, cultural and social development as well as its competitiveness in the 21st century global economy. President Obama and President Bounnhang Vorachit noted the success of bilateral education and exchange initiatives, especially the Fulbright program. The leaders noted the need for continued discussions on a Peace Corps program in Laos.\nHealth and Nutrition\n13. The two leaders welcomed the establishment of the Lao-American Nutrition Institute, which will align with Laos's efforts to meet its Sustainable Development Goals, and ensure Lao children receive the nutrition they need for healthy lives. They also took note of a new three-year, $6 million USAID program that will improve community sanitation and mother and infant feeding practices in targeted districts, in line with the Lao government's Multi-Sectoral Food and Nutrition Security Action Plan. President Obama reaffirmed the United States' commitment to providing further medical and other care and assistance for persons with disabilities, regardless of cause. President Bounnhang Vorachit expressed his appreciation for the U.S. government's continued support through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) for Lao P.D.R.'s efforts to build sustainable systems for HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care. 14. President Obama and President Bounnhang Vorachit made a commitment to jointly advance the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA), including formally endorsing the GHSA and through bilateral efforts to develop a five-year roadmap to bolster national capacity in Laos to prevent, detect, and respond to biological threats and to fully implement the International Health Regulations. As part of this commitment, Laos will join the GHSA multilateral effort in 2016 and will undergo and publish a Joint External Evaluation (JEE) of its national capabilities. The United States has recently undergone and publically shared the results of its JEE.\nEnvironment\n15. President Obama and President Bounnhang Vorachit affirmed the importance of addressing climate change and resolved to support robust and transparent implementation of the historic Paris Agreement. Following the United States formally joining the Paris Agreement, President Bounnhang Vorachit stated that the Lao P.D.R. has completed its domestic procedures to ratify the Paris Agreement and will formally join the Agreement this year. Both leaders called on all nations to support the Agreement's rapid entry into force in 2016. Both leaders affirmed their commitment to adopt an ambitious and comprehensive hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) phase-down amendment in 2016 within the Montreal Protocol, and support the adoption of a global market-based measure at the upcoming Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization for implementation from 2020. 16. President Obama and President Bounnhang Vorachit welcomed increasing bilateral cooperation to promote sustainable development and management of hydropower and forestry resources, as well as adaptation to climate change and response to natural disasters. The two countries pledged to promote a low greenhouse gas development pathway, including clean power sources that minimize environmental and climate impacts. 17. The two leaders also committed to work together, along with their LMI partners, to promote scientific research, capacity-building, investment, and dialogue to ensure the sustainable development of the Mekong River. They committed to increase cooperation to reduce wildlife trafficking and other environmental crimes, in accordance with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).\nSecurity\n18. President Obama and President Bounnhang Vorachit confirmed that the United States and Lao P.D.R. would continue to cooperate on defense and security through annual Bilateral Defense Dialogues and associated working groups. The two Presidents committed to expand mutually beneficial cooperation to enhance capabilities such as UXO clearance, search and rescue and disaster response. The two sides also underscored the importance of enhanced cooperation in non-traditional security matters and confirmed that they would work more closely to counter terrorism; combat transnational crime including narcotics, human, and wildlife trafficking; and address high-tech crime and cyber security.\nPromotion and Protection of Human Rights\n19. President Obama and President Bounnhang Vorachit took note of the benefits of a candid and open dialogue to enhance mutual understanding and narrow differences on human rights. They emphasized the importance of protection and promotion of human rights, the rule of law, and the rights of religious believers. In this regard, President Obama noted the crucial role of civil society. Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to uphold the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The United States and Lao P.D.R. also committed to include informal consultation on human rights within the annual Comprehensive Bilateral Dialogue.\nPeople-to-People Ties\n20. President Bounnhang Vorachit and President Obama highlighted the importance of enhanced cooperation through strengthening people-to-people ties. They took note of the positive contributions that the people of the Lao P.D.R. and the United States, including the Lao-American community, can make to the strengthening of bilateral ties. The two leaders encouraged more people-to-people exchanges that focus on solving shared global challenges, with particular focus on encouraging youth leadership and entrepreneurship.", "timestamp": "2016-09-06", "title": "Joint Statement—Joint Declaration Between the United States of America and the Lao People's Democratic Republic"}

Thank you so much. Thank you. Sabaidii!\nAudience members. Sabaidii.\nThe President. Sabaidii bor?\nAudience members. Sabaidii.\nThe President. To the Government and the people of Laos, thank you so much for the kind welcome that you've extended to me and my delegation. I am very honored to be the first American President to visit Laos. [Applause] Thank you.\nNow, I am told that this hall is where you come together for the national singing contest. And I know that you celebrate your musical traditions, including kap lam. But I'm not going to sing today—[laughter]—so you should not worry. As you host leaders from across Southeast Asia and beyond, I do want to thank Laos for your leadership as this year's chair of ASEAN.\nToday the eyes of the world are on Laos. And I know that that may be a little unusual, because Laos is a small nation next to larger neighbors and, as a result, too often, the richness of your culture has not been fully appreciated. And that's why, as part of my visit, I'm grateful for the opportunity to know Laos better and to help share your story with the world.\nI know that here, you cherish the beauty of the land, the mist-covered mountains and sunsets over the Mekong, the achievements of ancient civilizations that echo in the ruins of Vat Phou, and palm leaf manuscripts that are preserved at your temples. Tomorrow I'll experience some of this heritage myself when I visit Luang Prabang. I only regret that—I know this is called the Land of a Million Elephants, but Secret Service will not let me ride an elephant. [Laughter] But maybe I'll come back when I'm no longer President. [Laughter]\nBut in countless stupas and in your daily lives, we see the strength that draws so many of you from your Buddhist faith, a faith that tells you that you have a moral duty to each other, to live with kindness and honesty, and that we can help end suffering if we embrace the right mindset and the right actions. And in literature like the epic of Sinxay, we see the values that define the people of Laos, which is modesty and compassion and resilience and hope.\nAt our luncheon today, I was treated to the best of Lao culture and cuisine, including khao niaw. I did not get any Beerlao, but I will try some later—[laughter]—maybe this evening. And in all of you here today—and especially the young people of Laos—we see the diversity that is the strength of this nation. You have Lao and Khmu and Hmong and a tapestry of proud ethnic groups and indigenous peoples. So you are truly a people of the heart, and I thank you for welcoming me with such generosity, your nam jai.\nI realize that having a U.S. President in Laos would have once been unimaginable. Six decades ago, this country fell into civil war. And as the fighting raged next door in Vietnam, your neighbors and foreign powers, including the United States, intervened here. As a result of that conflict and its aftermath, many people fled or were driven from their homes. At the time, the U.S. Government did not acknowledge America's role. It was a secret war, and for years, the American people did not know. Even now many Americans are not fully aware of this chapter in our history, and it's important that we remember today.\nOver 9 years, from 1964 to 1973, the United States dropped more than 2 million tons of bombs here in Laos, more than we dropped on Germany and Japan combined during all of World War II. It made Laos, per person, the most heavily bombed country in history. As one Laotian said, the \"bombs fell like rain.\" Villages and entire valleys were obliterated. The ancient Plain of Jars was devastated. Countless civilians were killed. And that conflict was another reminder that, whatever the cause, whatever our intentions, war inflicts a terrible toll, especially on innocent men, women, and children. Today I stand with you in acknowledging the suffering and sacrifices on all sides of that conflict.\nAnd from the anguish of war, there came an unlikely bond between our two peoples. Today, the United States is home to many proud Laotian Americans. Many have made a hard journey through refugee camps and relocation, building new lives in a new country. And even as they've become Americans, they've held on to their Lao heritage: worshipping in their temples, honoring their elders, dancing the lamvong. Even now they remember a beloved song: that \"if we depart from our homeland and flee far away from her, we will always have you as our true friend as long as we live.\" And as a new generation has come of age, more Laotian Americans have made the journey here to their ancestral homeland. Said one of them who was born in Vientiane, our \"heart and home have always been in Laos.\" And this spirit of reconciliation is what brings me here today.\nOur two governments will continue to have differences. That's true with many nations. As we do around the world, the United States will continue to speak up on behalf of what we consider universal human rights, including the rights of the people of Laos to express yourselves freely and decide your own future. Yet even as our governments deal candidly with our differences, I believe, as we have shown from Cuba to Burma to Vietnam, the best way to deliver progress for all of our peoples is by closer cooperation between our countries. And that's why today the United States and Laos have agreed to a new comprehensive partnership to guide and deepen our relationship for years to come.\nOur partnership recognizes that the Lao People's Democratic Republic is an independent, sovereign nation. The United States does not seek to impose our will on Laos. Rather, we seek a relationship based on mutual respect, including respect for your independence and your sovereignty.\nOur new partnership will continue to deal with the painful legacy of war. And on behalf of the American people, especially our veterans and military families, I thank the Government and the people of Laos for your humanitarian cooperation as we've worked together to account for Americans missing in action. And I'm pleased that, as a result of this visit, we will increase our efforts and bring more of our missing home to their families in America.\nI also know that the remnants of war continue to shatter lives here in Laos. Many of the bombs that were dropped were never exploded. Over the years, thousands of Laotians have been killed or injured: farmers tending their fields, children playing. The wounds—a missing leg or arm—last a lifetime. And that's why, as President, I've dramatically increased our funding to help remove these unexploded bombs. As a result, Laos is clearing more bombs, fewer Laotians are being hurt or killed, and together, we are saving lives.\nBut there is still much more work to do. So today I'm proud to announce a historic increase in these efforts. The United States will double our annual funding to $90 million over the next 3 years to help Laos expand its work. This will help Laos expand its work to remove even more bombs, allow Laotians to farm more land, and increase support for victims. I'll bear witness to this work tomorrow when I meet with survivors.\nNow, given our history here, I believe that the United States has a moral obligation to help Laos heal. And even as we continue to deal with the past, our new partnership is focused on the future. We want to be your partners as you invest in the well-being of your people and especially your children. I believe that when any child anywhere goes hungry, when their growth is stunted, that's a profound injustice. So we're joining with Laos to promote nutrition and bring more healthy meals to children in school so they can grow strong, focus in class, and realize their full potential.\nWe want to be your partner in improving education. I'm told that there's a saying here: \"A tray full of silver is not worth a mind full of knowledge.\" So we'll help more children learn how to read. We'll bring more American teachers here to help teach English and more Lao teachers to America to strengthen their English. And I'm proud to announce that an initiative that's very important to me and to my wife Michelle, an initiative called \"Let Girls Learn,\" is coming to Laos and Nepal. We believe that the daughters of Laos have just as much talent and potential as your sons. And none of our countries anywhere in the world can truly succeed unless our girls and our women have every opportunity to succeed, the same opportunities as boys and men do.\nWe want to be your partner with the young people of Laos as you strengthen your communities and start businesses and use Facebook to raise awareness for the rights and dignity of all people. And that's why, as part of our Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative, we're helping young men and women across Laos develop the skills you need to succeed. Two of our top companies, Microsoft and General Electric, are helping to increase training in engineering and technology. Young people in Laos shouldn't have to move someplace else in order to prosper. You should be able to work and build a better life right here in Laos.\nAnd we want to be your partners as Laos forges greater trade and commerce with the world. When other countries invest here, it should create jobs here for the people of Laos. So as Laos pursues economic and labor reforms, we'll work to encourage more trade and investment between our two countries and between Laos and the rest of this region. As a result of my visit, I hope that more Americans come here as well, to experience your country and the beautiful culture and to forge new friendships between our peoples.\nAs Laos grows, we want to be your partner in protecting the natural beauty of your country, from your forests to your rivers. As Laos works to meet its growing need for energy, I want to work with you to pursue clean, renewable energies like solar. And let's help farmers protect their crops and villages adapt to a changing climate. We should work together so that development is sustainable, especially along the Mekong, upon which millions of people depend for their livelihood and their food and their health. The Mekong is a treasure that has to be protected for future generations, and we want to be your partner in that process.\nSo this is the future our two countries can build together, and I'm optimistic that we can do it. I'm confident because my visit is part of a broader agenda. As some of you know, as President, a key priority of my foreign policy has been to deepen our engagement with the nations and peoples of the Asia-Pacific. And here, on the final leg of my last visit to Asia as President, I want to discuss why the commitment of the United States to this region will endure for the long term. America's interest in the Asia-Pacific is not new. It's not a passing fad. It reflects fundamental national interests. And in the United States, across the political spectrum, there's widespread recognition that the Asia-Pacific will become even more important in the century ahead, both to America and to the world. In this region, we see hundreds of millions of young people with high expectations for their lives. With many of our major trading partners and most of the world's growing middle class, growth here can mean more jobs and opportunity in all countries. This region is home to 5 of our treaty allies and some of the world's most capable militaries, which means Asia will shape the course of global security. And this region is home to more than half of humanity: Asian nations, developing and developed, who will be essential in the fight against challenges like climate change.\nSo for all these reasons, I've worked to rebalance our foreign policy so the United States is playing a larger and long-term role in the Asia-Pacific region. We've strengthened our alliances. With our new defense guidelines, Japan and the United States will do even more together to uphold regional security. We've expanded our collaboration with the Republic of Korea, including on missile defense to counter North Korean threats. Today I'll be meeting with President Park to reaffirm our unbreakable alliance and to insist that the international community remain united so that North Korea understands that its provocations will only continue to deepen its isolation. With our U.S. marines now rotating through Australia, we can respond even faster to regional challenges. And with our new access agreement with the Philippines, our militaries are closer than they've been in decades.\nTo keep the peace and deter aggression, we've deployed more of our most advanced military capabilities to the region, including ships and aircraft to Singapore. And by the end of the decade, a majority of our Navy and Air Force fleets will be based out of the Pacific. And our allies and partners are collaborating more with each other as well. So our alliances and defense capabilities in the Asia-Pacific are as strong as they've ever been.\nWe've also forged deeper ties with emerging economies and emerging powers. With Indonesia and Malaysia, we're promoting entrepreneurship. We're opposing violent extremism, and we're addressing environmental degradation. With my recent visit to Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, we've shown our commitment to fully normalizing our relationship with Vietnam. We've elevated our ties with India across the board, and we welcome India's growing role in the Asia-Pacific.\nWe've deepened our cooperation with regional institutions, especially here in Southeast Asia. And as part of our new strategic partnership with ASEAN, we've agreed to key principles, including that ASEAN will remain central to peace, prosperity, and progress in the Asia-Pacific. The United States is now part of the East Asia Summit, and together, we've made it the leading forum in the region for addressing political and security challenges, including maritime security.\nWe've increased the trade and investment that create jobs and opportunity on both sides of the Pacific. Since I took office, we've boosted U.S. exports to the Asia-Pacific by 50 percent. Our Young Leaders Initiative is helping more than 100,000 young men and women across this region start new companies and ventures. So we're connecting entrepreneurs and investors and businesses in America and in ASEAN with each other. And thanks to our sustained leadership, 12 of our nations have come together in the Trans-Pacific Partnership to establish the rules of trade for nearly 40 percent of the global economy.\nWe've also stood with citizens on behalf of democracy and human rights. We've expanded our support for civil society groups and open government. We saw another democratic election and transition in Indonesia. And as the first U.S. President to visit Myanmar, I am proud that the United States encouraged and now is supporting a historic transition toward democracy. And I look forward to welcoming State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi to the White House next week as we stand with the people of Myanmar in their journey towards pluralism and peace.\nAnd alongside all these efforts, we've worked to build a constructive relationship with China. Our two governments continue to have serious differences in important areas. The United States will remain unwavering in our support for universal human rights, but at the same time, we've shown that we can work together to advance mutual interests. The United States and China are engaged across more areas than ever before, from preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, to our shared commitment to denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, to our historic leadership together on climate change.\nSo I will say it again: The United States welcomes the rise of a China that is peaceful and stable and prosperous and a responsible player in global affairs, because we believe that that will benefit all of us.\nIn other words, the United States is more deeply engaged across the Asia-Pacific than we have been in decades. Our position is stronger. And we've sent a clear message that, as a Pacific nation, we're here to stay. In good times and bad, you can count on the United States of America.\nAnd the question going forward is, what will the future hold for this region? Will disagreements be resolved peacefully or lead to conflict? Will economies continue to integrate or succumb to mercantilism or protectionism? Will human dignity be upheld, or will it be denied? Will the international rules and norms that have enabled progress in this region be maintained, or will they erode?\nSo with the time I have left, allow me to share our vision, the values that guide us, and the future we're working toward: our basic principles for peace and progress here in this region, including Laos, and across the Asia-Pacific.\nFirst, we believe that all nations and peoples deserve to leave—live in security and peace. We believe that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of every nation must be upheld. And we believe that every nation matters, no matter their size. We believe that bigger nations should not dictate to smaller nations and that all nations should play by the same rules. America's treaty allies must know our commitment to your defense is a solemn obligation that will never waiver. And across the region, including in the East and South China Seas, the United States will continue to fly and sail and operate wherever international law allows and support the right of all countries to do the same.\nWe will stand with our allies and partners in upholding fundamental interests, among them freedom of navigation and overflight, lawful commerce that's not impeded, and peaceful resolution of disputes. That's the security that we seek.\nWe also believe that just as nations have rights, nations also have responsibilities, including the responsibility to work together to address problems no nation can solve alone. So many of today's threats transcend borders, and every country has a role to play. We will have to cooperate better together to stop terrorist attacks and to prevent the spread of the world's most dangerous weapons. We will have to work together to avoid the worst effects of climate change. We have to work together to stop the horror of human trafficking and end the outrage of modern-day slavery. These are areas where we seek deeper cooperation. We believe in prosperity that is shared and that reduces poverty and inequality by lifting up the many and not just a few wealthy people at the top. Rather than simply extracting another country's natural resources, we believe development has to invest in people: in their education and in their skills. We believe that trade should be free and truly fair and that workers and the environment should be protected. We believe that governments should not conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property for commercial gain. And we believe that there needs to be good governance, because people should not have to pay a bribe to start a business or sell their goods. And that's the kind of development and the kind of trade that we seek.\nThat's why the Trans-Pacific Partnership is so important: not only because TPP countries, including the United States, will be able to sell more goods to each other, but it also has important strategic benefits. TPP is a core pillar of America's rebalance to the Asia-Pacific. And the trade and the growth it supports will reinforce America's security alliances and regional partnerships. It will build greater integration and trust across this region. And I have said before, and I will say again: Failure to move ahead with TPP would not just have economic consequences, but would call into question America's leadership in this vital region. So as difficult as the politics are back home, I will continue to push hard on the U.S. Congress to approve TPP before I leave office, because I think it is important for this entire region and it is important for the United States.\nI believe that nations are stronger and more successful when they uphold human rights. We speak out for these rights not because we think our own country is perfect; no nation is. But—not because we think every country should do as we do, because each nation has to follow its own path. But we will speak up on behalf of human rights because we believe they are the birthright of every human being. And we know that democracy can flourish in Asia because we've seen it thrive from Japan and South Korea to Taiwan.\nAcross this region, we see citizens reaching to shape their own futures. And freedom of speech and assembly and the right to organize peacefully in civil society without harassment or fear of arrest or disappearing, we think makes a country stronger. A free press that can expose abuse and injustice makes a country stronger. And access to information and an open Internet where people can learn and share ideas makes a country stronger. An independent judiciary that upholds the rule of law and free and fair elections so that citizens can choose their own leaders—these are all the rights that we seek for all people.\nWe believe that societies are more stable and just when they recognize the inherent dignity of every human being: the dignity of being able to live and pray as you choose, so that Muslims know they are a part of Myanmar's future and Christians and Buddhists have the right to worship freely in China; the dignity of being treated equally under the law so that no matter where you come from or who you love or what you look like, you are respected; and the dignity of a healthy life, because no child should ever die from hunger or a mosquito bite or the poison of dirty water. This is the justice that we seek in the world.\nAnd finally, we believe that the ties between our nations must be rooted in friendship and trust between our peoples. I think of several Laotian Americans whose families came to the United States as refugees. Our nations are connected not just by policies, but also by people like John Douangdara, whose family settled in our State of Nebraska, and after high school joined our military, served with our elite special forces, and ultimately gave his life for our Nation. His mother said, \"He is a son of the Lao people.\" And he sacrificed for us, and we honor him. We're connected by Channapha Khamvongsa, who came to America when she was 7 years old and who is back here today. And for years, she urged the United States to do more to help remove unexploded bombs here in Laos. \"There are many, many problems in this world that might not be able to be solved in a lifetime,\" she's said, but this is one we can fix. So, Channapha, we thank you for working to fix this problem.\nAnd we're connected by Stacey Phengvath, who is here as well and who I met earlier. Her parents came to America and stressed the importance of education. And today, this proud Laotian American serves at our Embassy here in Laos. \"I feel a sense of home,\" she says, \"as if I have known this country before, through my parents.\" It feels \"like we've come full circle.\" So, Stacey, on behalf of all of us, thank you for helping to bring our countries closer together.\nSo these are the values that guide us. And this is the partnership that America offers here in Laos and across the Asia-Pacific: respect for your sovereignty, security and peace through cooperation, investment in the health of children, education for students, support for entrepreneurs, development and trade that creates jobs for all of us and protects our environment, a commitment to rights and dignity that is borne out of our common humanity.\nThis is our vision. This is the future we can realize together. And based on my visit to Laos and the proud work of the past 8 years, I believe that Americans and the peoples of the Asia-Pacific will be able to say to each other, as the song goes, \"we will always have you as our true friend as long as we live.\" Khop jai lai lai. Thank you very much.", "timestamp": "2016-09-06", "title": "Remarks in Vientiane, Laos"}

In his remarks, he referred to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) terrorist organization. President Park spoke in Korean, and her remarks were translated by an interpreter.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118925", "text": "President Obama. It is always a pleasure to meet with my friend and partner, President Park of the Republic of Korea, and her delegation. As we all know, the R.O.K. is one of America's oldest and closest allies. Our alliance remains the linchpin of peace and security, not just on the Korean Peninsula, but across the region.\nIn recent years, we've worked together to strengthen our alliance and to ensure our readiness against any threat. For instance, our missile defense cooperation, THAAD, is a purely defensive system to deter and defend against North Korean threats. And today I want to reaffirm that our commitment to the defense and security of North [South; White House correction.] Korea, including extended deterrence, is unwavering.\nWe had extensive discussions about the recent provocations by the D.P.R.K., and we are united in condemning North Korea's continued missile launches, including this week while China was hosting the G-20. These launches are provocative. They're a violation of North Korea's obligations internationally. Its nuclear and missile programs are a threat to not only the R.O.K., but to Japan, other allies in the region, partners in the region, and to the United States.\nSo we are going to work diligently together with the most recent U.N. sanctions that are already placing North Korea under the most intense sanctions regime ever. We're going to work together to make sure that we're closing loopholes and making them even more effective. And President Park and I agree that the entire international community needs to implement these sanctions fully and hold North Korea accountable.\nNorth Korea needs to know that provocations will only invite more pressure and further deepen its isolation, but that if it is willing to recognize its international obligations and the importance of denuclearization in the Korean Peninsula, the opportunities for us to dialogue with them are there. And we do not have any interest in an offensive approach to North Korea. We want peace and security for all peoples, but their current behavior has not been ones that are conducive to the kinds of dialogue and diplomacy that both the R.O.K. and the United States would prefer.\nBeyond the region, our alliance is a global one. We stand together against ISIL. We stand together in providing humanitarian assistance for the Syrian people and for refugees, promoting global health, and fighting climate change. The R.O.K. has been an excellent partner in helping Afghanistan stabilize. It has been an outstanding partner on global health and security issues. We talked about the leadership summit that we'll be hosting at the end of this month on refugees and the important contributions that the Republic of Korea are making.\nAnd let me just say that as I wrap up over the next several days my last trip to Asia, what a pleasure it's been to work with President Park and her team. They have been steady, consistent partners, and President Park has been a stalwart ally and friend on a whole range of issues. And her steady and wise leadership, I think, has greatly contributed to the strengthening of what was already one of our most important alliances. So I want to thank her personally for the excellent contributions she's made to advancing all the various issues that we've been working on. And I want to thank her team as well that worked very hard behind the scenes to make that happen.\nPresident Park. Today I met with President Obama and held fruitful discussions on how we will respond to the common challenges that confront both our nations. In particular, it was a pleasure to reconfirm that the Korea-U.S. alliance is stronger than ever and is playing a pivotal role for the peace and stability of not only the Korean Peninsula, but the entire region.\nNorth Korea's nuclear test earlier this year and continued missile launches are fundamentally threatening the security of both the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia. I would like to make it clear that Korea and the U.S. will respond resolutely to any provocations by North Korea by utilizing all means.\nNorth Korea launched another missiles again yesterday. I send a stern warning that the continuation of such reckless provocations will lead North Korea down the path of self-destruction. I express my gratitude to President Obama once again for clearly expressing today the unwavering commitment of the U.S. for the defense of the Republic of Korea. President Obama and I have agreed to maintain a strong deterrence posture by enhancing our combined defense capabilities, to include the deployment of the THAAD system.\nNext, the faithful implementation of the U.N. Security Council Resolution 2270 is vital to deterring North Korea's advancement of its nuclear and missile capabilities, and it is meaningful that our two countries have been engaged in close cooperation in this regard. The United States and Korea have agreed to faithfully implement U.N. Security Council resolutions and further strengthen our efforts to seal the loopholes and sanctions implementation even more tightly. Taking into consideration the importance of China's role in effective implementation of sanctions and the resolution process of the North Korean nuclear issue, our two countries have agreed to continue to communicate with China through various channels.\nRegarding the human rights situation of North Korean people, I would like to express my appreciation for the efforts made by many in the United States, both in and out of government. And I plan to further strengthen cooperation with the United States and the international community on the basis of our North Korean Human Rights Act, which entered into force on September 4. The improvement of the human rights situation for North Korean people will be a critical stepping stone for our path toward unification, and unification will provide opportunities for North Korean people to be treated equally.\nLastly, in order for the Korea-U.S. alliance to contribute to a greater peace and broader prosperity, President and I have agreed to not only expand cooperation in new frontiers such as global health, climate change, and space, but also expand our roles in areas such as refugees, peacekeeping operations, and development cooperation. I find it meaningful that through our discussions today, I was able to confirm yet once again that the foundations of our bilateral relationship are rock solid.\nI once again express my respect for President Obama, for the vision and leadership that he has shown for our alliance.", "timestamp": "2016-09-06", "title": "Remarks Following a Meeting With President Park Geun-hye of South Korea in Vientiane, Laos"}

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "note": "As prepared for delivery.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119177", "text": "Today, I am here to talk about three crucial words that should be at the center of our foreign policy: Peace Through Strength.\nWe want to achieve a stable, peaceful world with less conflict and more common ground.\nI am proposing a new foreign policy focused on advancing America's core national interests, promoting regional stability, and producing an easing of tensions in the world. This will require rethinking the failed policies of the past.\nWe can make new friends, rebuild old alliances, and bring new allies into the fold.\nI'm proud to have the support of warfighting generals, active duty military, and the top experts who know both how to win – and how to avoid the endless wars we are caught in now. Just yesterday, 88 top Generals and Admirals endorsed my campaign.\nIn a Trump Administration, our actions in the Middle East will be tempered by realism. The current strategy of toppling regimes, with no plan for what to do the day after, only produces power vacuums that are filled by terrorists.\nGradual reform, not sudden and radical change, should be our guiding objective in that region.\nWe should work with any country that shares our goal of destroying ISIS and defeating Radical Islamic terrorism, and form new friendships and partnerships based on this mission. We now have an Administration, and a former Secretary of State, who refuse to say Radical Islamic Terrorism.\nImmediately after taking office, I will ask my generals to present to me a plan within 30 days to defeat and destroy ISIS.\nThis will require military warfare, but also cyber warfare, financial warfare, and ideological warfare – as I laid out in my speech on defeating Radical Islamic terrorism several weeks ago.\nInstead of an apology tour, I will proudly promote our system of government and our way of life as the best in the world – just like we did in our campaign against communism during the Cold War.\nWe will show the whole world how proud we are to be American.\nAt the same time, immigration security is a vital part of our national security.\nWe only want to admit people to our country who will support our values and love our people.\nThese are the pillars of a sound national security strategy.\nUnlike my opponent, my foreign policy will emphasize diplomacy, not destruction. Hillary Clinton's legacy in Iraq, Libya, and Syria has produced only turmoil and suffering. Her destructive policies have displaced millions of people, then she has invited the refugees into the West with no plan to screen them.\nIncluding Veteran healthcare costs, the price of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan could total $6 trillion, according to a report in the Washington Examiner. Yet, after all this money spent and lives lost, Clinton's policies as Secretary of State have left the Middle East in more disarray than ever before.\nMeanwhile, China has grown more aggressive, and North Korea more dangerous and belligerent. Russia has defied this Administration at every turn. Putin has no respect for President Obama or Hillary Clinton.\nSometimes it has seemed like there wasn't a country in the Middle East that Hillary Clinton didn't want to invade, intervene or topple. She is trigger-happy and unstable when it comes to war.\nHillary Clinton is just reckless – so reckless, in fact, she put her emails on an illegal server that our enemies could easily hack. Then Clinton's team used a technology called bleachbit to acid wash her emails. They even took a hammer to some of her 13 phones, to cover her tracks and obstruct justice. These email records were destroyed after she received a subpoena to turn them over.\nIn the FBI report, she claimed she couldn't recall important information on 39 occasions.\nShe can't even remember whether she was trained in classified information, and said she didn't even know the letter \"C\" means confidential.\nIf she can't remember such crucial events and information, she is unfit to be Commander-in-Chief.\nHer conduct is simply disqualifying.\nShe talks about her experience, but Hillary Clinton's only foreign policy experience is \"failure.\" Everywhere she got involved, things got worse.\nLet's look back at the Middle East at the very beginning of 2009, before Hillary Clinton was sworn-in.\nLibya was stable.\nSyria was under control.\nEgypt was ruled by a secular President and an ally of the United States.\nIraq was experiencing a reduction in violence. The group that would become what we now call ISIS was close to being extinguished.\nIran was being choked off by economic sanctions.\nFast-forward to today. What have the decisions of Obama-Clinton produced?\nLibya is in ruins, our ambassador and three other brave Americans are dead, and ISIS has gained a new base of operations.\nSyria is in the midst of a disastrous civil war. ISIS controls large portions of territory. A refugee crisis now threatens Europe and the United States. And hundreds of thousands are dead.\nIn Egypt, terrorists have gained a foothold in the Sinai desert, near the Suez Canal, one of the most essential waterways in the world.\nIraq is in chaos, and ISIS is on the loose.\nISIS has spread across the Middle East, and into the West.\nIran, the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism, is now flush with $150 billion dollars in cash released by the United States – plus another $1.7 billion dollars in cash ransom payments. In other words, our country was blackmailed and extorted into paying this unheard-of amount of money.\nWorst of all, the Nuclear deal puts Iran, the number one state sponsor of Radical Islamic terrorism, on a path to nuclear weapons.\nThis is Hillary Clinton's foreign policy legacy.\nBut that's not all. President Obama and Hillary Clinton have also overseen deep cuts in our military, which only invite more aggression from our adversaries.\nHistory shows that when America is not prepared is when the danger is greatest. We want to deter, avoid and prevent conflict through our unquestioned military strength.\nUnder Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, defense spending is on track to fall to its lowest level as a share of the economy since the end of World War II. We currently have the smallest Army since 1940. The Navy is among the smallest it has been since 1915. And the Air Force is the smallest it has been since 1947.\nWhen Ronald Reagan left office, our Navy had 592 ships. When Barack Obama took office, it had 285 ships. Today, the Navy has just 276 ships.\nThe average Air Force aircraft is 27 years-old. We have 2nd generation B-52 bombers – their fathers flew the same plane.\nOur Army has been shrinking rapidly, from 553,000 soldiers in 2009 to just 479,000 today.\nIn 2009, our Marine Corps had 202,000 active Marines. Today, it's just 182,000.\nOur ship count is below the minimum of 308 that the Navy says is needed to execute its current missions. President Obama plans to reduce the Army to 450,000 troops—which would hamstring our ability to defend the United States.\nIt takes 22 years on average to field a major new weapons system.\nIn 2010, the US spent $554 billion on non-war base defense spending.\nIn the current year, we are spending $548 billion – a cut of 10% in real inflation-adjusted dollars. This reduction was done through what is known as the sequester, or automatic defense budget cuts. Under the budget agreement, defense took half of the cuts – even though it makes up only one-sixth of the budget.\nAs soon as I take office, I will ask Congress to fully eliminate the defense sequester and will submit a new budget to rebuild our military.\nThis will increase certainty in the defense community as to funding, and will allow military leaders to plan for our future defense needs.\nAs part of removing the defense sequester, I will ask Congress to fully offset the costs of increased military spending. In the process, we will make government leaner and more responsive to the public.\nI will ask that savings be accomplished through common sense reforms that eliminate government waste and budget gimmicks – and that protect hard-earned benefits for Americans.\nGovernment-wide, improper government payments are estimated to exceed $135 billion per year, and the amount of unpaid taxes is estimated to be as high as $385 billion.\nWe can also reduce the size of the federal bureaucracy through responsible workforce attrition – that is, when employees retire, they can be replaced by a smaller number of new employees.\nWe can also stop funding programs that are not authorized in law. Congress spent $320 billion last year on 256 expired laws. Removing just 5 percent of that will reduce spending by almost $200 billion over 10 years.\nThe military will not be exempt either – the military bureaucracy will have to be trimmed as well.\nEarly in my term, I will also be requesting that all NATO nations promptly pay their bills, which many are not doing right now. Only 5 NATO countries, including the United States, are currently meeting the minimum requirement to spend 2% of GDP on defense.\nAdditionally, I will be respectfully asking countries such as Germany, Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia to pay more for the tremendous security we provide them.\nFinally, we will have at our disposal additional revenues from unleashing American energy. The Institute for Energy Research cites a \"short-run\" figure of as much as $36 billion annually from increased energy production.\nUsing these new funds, I will ask my Secretary of Defense to propose a new defense budget to meet the following long-term goals:\nWe will build an active Army of around 540,000, as the Army's chief of staff has said he needs. We now have only 31 Brigade Combat Teams, or 490,000 troops, and only one-third of combat teams are considered combat-ready.\nWe will build a Marine Corps based on 36 battalions, which the Heritage Foundation notes is the minimum needed to deal with major contingencies – we have 23 now.\nWe will build a Navy of 350 surface ships and submarines, as recommended by the bipartisan National Defense Panel – we have 276 ships now.\nAnd we will build an Air Force of at least 1,200 fighter aircraft, which the Heritage Foundation has shown to be needed to execute current missions – we have 1,113 now.\nWe will also seek to develop a state of the art missile defense system.\nUnder Obama-Clinton, our ballistic missile defense capability has been degraded at the very moment the US and its allies are facing a heightened missile threat from states like Iran and North Korea. As these potential adversaries grow their missile programs, US military facilities in Asia and the Middle East, as well as our allies, are increasingly in range, with the United States homeland also potentially threatened.\nWe propose to rebuild the key tools of missile defense, starting with the Navy cruisers that are the foundation of our missile defense capabilities in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. The Obama-Clinton administration tried repeatedly to remove our cruisers from service, then refused to modernize these aging ships.\nWe will start by modernizing our cruisers to provide the Ballistic Missile Defense capability our nation needs; this will cost around $220 million per modernization as we seek to modernize a significant portion of these 22 ships.\nAs we expand our Navy toward the goal of 350 ships, we will also procure additional modern destroyers that are designed to handle the missile defense mission in the coming years.\nAccomplishing this military rebuild will be a fifty-state effort —every state in the union will be able to take part in rebuilding our military and developing the technologies of tomorrow.\nIn addition, we will improve the Department of Defense's cyber capabilities. Hillary Clinton has taught us all how vulnerable we are to cyber hacking.\nWhich is why one of the first things we must do is to enforce all classification rules, and enforce all laws relating to the handling of classified information.\nHillary Clinton put her emails on a secret server to cover-up her pay-for-play scandals at the State Department. Nothing threatens the integrity of our Democracy more than when government officials put their public office up for sale.\nWe will also make it a priority to develop defensive and offensive cyber capabilities at our U.S. Cyber Command, and recruit the best and brightest Americans.\nOne of my first directives after taking office will be asking the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and all relevant federal departments, to conduct a thorough review of United States cyber defenses and identify all vulnerabilities – in our power grid, our communications systems, and all vital infrastructure. I will then ask for a plan to immediately protect those vulnerabilities. At the same time, we will invest heavily in offensive cyber capabilities to disrupt our enemies, including terrorists who rely heavily on internet communications.\nThese new investments in cybersecurity, and the modernization of our military, will spur substantial new job creation in the private sector and help create the jobs and technologies of tomorrow.\nAmerica must be the world's dominant technological powerhouse of the 21st century, and young Americans – including in our inner cities – should get these new jobs.\nWe must also ensure that we have the best medical care, education and support for our military service members and their families – both when they serve, and when they return to civilian life.\nOur debt to our men and women in uniform is eternal.\nTo all those who have served this nation, I say: I will never let you down.\nWe will protect those who protect us.\nAnd we will follow their example of unity. We will work across all racial and income lines to create One American Nation.\nTogether, we will have one great American future.\nWe will be one people, under one God, saluting one American flag.\nAmerica will be a prosperous, generous and inclusive society.\nWe will discard the failed policies and division of the past, and embrace true American change to rebuild our economy, rebuild our inner cities, and rebuild our country.\nWe will bring back our jobs.\nWe will make America strong again.\nWe will make America safe again.\nAnd we will make America great again.", "timestamp": "2016-09-07", "title": "Remarks at the Union League of Philadelphia in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania"}

Each cohort of fellows studies one of three themes: Civic Engagement, Environmental Issues, or Social Entrepreneurship and Economic Development.\nThe YSEALI Professional Fellows Program gives participants ages 25-35 the opportunity to spend five weeks in the United States, including four weeks working directly with American counterparts in individually tailored work placements with non-profit organizations; federal, state, and local government; and private-sector offices across the country. During these placements, Fellows build their practical expertise, leadership skills, and professional networks. YSEALI Fellows' areas of work include: environmental protection, government transparency, social entrepreneurship, non-profit management, disability rights, wildlife protection, and empowerment of women and girls. American hosts also travel to Southeast Asia on reciprocal exchanges under this program.\nYSEALI Generation: Regional Exchanges\nYSEALI Generation Regional Exchanges bring together youth from all ASEAN countries to develop practical skills, learn about regional problems, and collaborate on solving common challenges. From 2013-2016, more than 1,300 emerging leaders have benefited from professional workshops focused on entrepreneurship skills, workforce development, environmental studies, education, women's leadership, and other leadership skills necessary to make a positive impact in their communities.\nYSEALI Network and Virtual Engagement: 100,000 Strong\nThe YSEALI Network connects leaders from across the region and offers online networking opportunities and professional trainings. YSEALI digital programs use social media, online speaking programs, webinars and other digital technology to encourage young people to collaborate on issues of shared concern. The YSEALI website (www.yseali.state.gov), Facebook (www.facebook.com/youngsoutheastasianleaders), and Twitter (www.twitter.com/yseali) accounts regularly update network members about upcoming events, courses, resources, and opportunities.\nYSEALI World of Food Innovation Challenge\nThe U.S. Agency for International Development launched the first YSEALI Innovation Challenge in February 2016, inviting university and vocational education students to propose science and technology solutions to food security challenges in Southeast Asia. Ten semi-finalist teams participated in an innovation boot camp in Singapore in July, supported by private sector partners. The winning teams will be announced in October.", "timestamp": "2016-09-07", "title": "Fact Sheet: Young Southeast Asia Leaders Initiative"}

Building on the President's historic action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and build a clean energy economy, the Administration has sought to lead by example, investing in Federal sustainability to improve environmental, energy and economic performance across the Federal government. With 343,000 buildings, 630,000 fleet vehicles, and $438 billion in annual purchasing power, the government has taken significant steps to operate more efficiently across the board.\nToday, in recognition of the progress our Federal agencies have made, the White House announced the winners of the 2016 GreenGov Presidential Awards, honoring those who have gone above and beyond to implement innovative sustainability projects within the government. Senior Administration officials will recognize the 12 individuals and team winners today in a ceremony at the White House.\nThe Administration also announced today new steps to advance sustainability in federal purchasing with the release of the General Services Administration's new \"Green ✔\" tool to help agencies make informed decisions about products and services that save money, increase sustainability and meet green purchasing requirements. Additionally, this week, Federal agencies will release their annual Federal Agency Strategic Sustainability Performance Plans, outlining how they are working to meet sustainability goals such as achieving a 40% reduction in Federal greenhouse gas emissions by 2025.\nWinners of 2016 GreenGov Presidential Awards\nThe GreenGov Presidential Awards celebrate outstanding achievement in the pursuit of President Obama's Federal sustainability goals. They recognize Federal civilian and military personnel, agency teams, agency projects, facilities, and programs. These awardees have contributed to the Nation's prosperity, promoted energy security, protected the interests of taxpayers, and combated climate change to safeguard the health of our environment.\n*  Climate Champion Award: Dr. Richard Bennett, Department of the Interior, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\nFollowing the devastation left by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, Dr. Richard Bennett led the Department of the Interior team charged with helping the region recover, overseeing 167 million dollars in project funding to revitalize the Northeast, and to protect it from future storms and sea level rise. Dr. Bennett worked to launch more than 100 sustainability-focused projects, and led a team that developed performance metrics for climate resilience that are changing the way the Federal government prepares for severe weather events.\n*  Sustainability Heroes Award: Dr. Rosalind A. Grymes, National Aeronautics and Space Administration\nFor nearly a decade, Dr. Rosalind Grymes has been working to enhance NASA's sustainability portfolio with a focus on optimizing the use of water, energy and other resources. She has held numerous leadership roles in the pursuit of a more sustainable NASA, including as the Executive Director of the NASA Astrobiology Institute, and as the Founding Director of the Advanced Studies Laboratories.\n*  Green Innovation Award: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers & Department of Defense\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of Defense have created a software tool that is revolutionizing sustainability planning for their agencies. The tool helps evaluate the sustainability and energy needs of an installation, and then generates a list of energy projects perfectly suited to meet the organization's goal. The software tool has been successfully leveraged by other agencies across the country to transform federal sustainability planning and implementation.\n*  Lean, Clean, and Green Award: Department of Veterans Affairs\nUnder the leadership of Timothy Morris, the Calverton National Cemetery has implemented energy saving measures and revolutionized its sustainability efforts, including the incorporation of the first ever installation of solar power at a national cemetery. From the use of automatic lighting sensors to programmable thermostats and timers, the Calverton National Cemetery has made sustainability a core part of its daily mission, becoming an energy efficiency model for cemeteries across the country.\n*  Green Dream Team Award: Environmental Protection Agency / General Services Administration\nAn employee-led team at EPA established the first compost collection program at EPA's Washington, DC headquarters. The team coordinated with custodial staff, repurposed existing collection bins, and developed low cost communication tools to educate 4,500 employees about the program. GSA partnered with EPA in this effort, and is now working to expand compost services to over 50 Federal buildings in the National Capital region.\n*  Good Neighbor Award: Environmental Protection Agency\nIn the years following the foreclosure crisis, the number of vacant homes across the country grew by 44% from 2000 to 2010. To guard against the significant environmental impact from demolishing these homes, EPA created a toolkit that's changing the way communities deal with demolitions across the country. The toolkit helps municipalities make sound environmental decisions during the demolition process, reducing pollution, among other benefits.\n*  Building the Future Award: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers & Department of Defense\nThe Army Corps of Engineers and Department of Defense have constructed the first LEED Platinum certified, net-zero energy aviation hangar at Fort Carson, Colorado. This innovative building includes high efficiency lighting and solar panels that supply half its power needs, and is a major step in support of Fort Carson's goal to become a Net Zero Energy facility by 2020.\n*  Greening the Fleet Award: Timothy Currie, National Aeronautics and Space Administration\nAs NASA's Fleet and Transportation Manager, Timothy Currie has helped transform NASA's fleet of over 3,000 vehicles nationwide. In just two years, NASA has replaced almost two-thirds of its fleet with vehicles that run on cleaner fuels, including biofuels, compressed natural gas, and electricity. This transition contributed to NASA achieving a 62% reduction in petroleum use since 2005.\n*  Purchasing Power Award: National Aeronautics and Space Administration\nNASA's White Sands Test Facility in Las Cruces, New Mexico has developed a software tool that seamlessly integrates management and oversight of green purchasing. The tool provides a list of green products available for order, captures data on purchases, and tracks compliance with sustainability requirements. With real-time data, NASA's Sustainability Program team members can now track performance on green purchasing goals from their desktops.\n*  Keeping It Clean Award: Department of Energy\nFaced with the need to treat groundwater at a former nuclear weapons production facility, the Department of Energy's Office of Legacy Management developed an innovative groundwater treatment system. Installed at Rocky Flats, Colorado, the system runs on battery power and recharges with solar power. This design enhances safety, improves groundwater treatment reliability, reduces long-term maintenance and costs, and reduces waste.\n*  Resilience Role Model Award: Environmental Protection Agency / Department of Homeland Security-FEMA\nSoon after Hurricane Sandy, a group of Federal, State, and local government leaders formed the Long Island Smart Growth Resiliency Partnership, focused on implementing recovery efforts that would be environmentally sustainable, and make the region more resilient to climate-related threats in the future. The partnership has held numerous events to educate and train the public, and is currently developing a joint EPA-FEMA guidance document for use by other impacted communities throughout the nation.\n*  The Ripple Effect Award: Department of Health and Human Services\nIn response to employee interest in electric vehicle (EV) charging, the Department of Health and Human Services launched an initiative to support EV commuting, and to install charging infrastructure across its agencies. The National Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Food and Drug Administration have developed innovative plans to make commuting by EV easier, including dedicated parking spaces and use of the conference room scheduling system to reserve charging stations.\nTo find out more about the GreenGov program visit: https://www.whitehouse.gov/greengov.\nFederal Agency Strategic Sustainability Performance Plans\nThis week, the Administration is also releasing the  Federal Agency Strategic Sustainability Performance Plans. In these strategic plans, Federal agencies detail how they are working to meet the President's goals to cut greenhouse gas emissions, increase use of renewable energy, reduce energy and water used in Federal buildings, improve efficiency of Federal fleet vehicles, and enhance climate resilience.\nBelow are some examples of how Federal Agencies are leading by example:\n* Saving Energy and Saving Money for Veteran Care: When compared to hospitals nationwide, Veterans Administration (VA) hospitals are a top energy performer. VA hospitals are approximately 35% more efficient than the average U.S. hospital, allowing more resources to be directed to the care of Veterans. The Department of Veterans Affairs has reduced energy intensity by 23.2% compared to a 2003 baseline.\n* Reducing Water Use at the World's Largest Museum and Research Complex: The Smithsonian Institution has reduced water use at its museums and the National Zoo by 54.5% since 2007, exceeding the Federal 26% reduction goal for FY 2020. The Smithsonian accomplished this achievement by using sub meters and leak detectors to discover water waste, and by focusing on water efficient landscapes for iconic public buildings on the National Mall and at the National Zoo.\n* Navy Achieves 1 GW in Renewable Energy: In the 2012 State of the Union address, President Obama announced that the Department of the Navy would seek to produce or procure 1 gigawatt (GW) of renewable energy by 2020. The Navy not only met that goal, but they did it by the end of 2015, five years ahead of schedule. One recent project represents the largest renewable energy procurement in Federal government history - a solar project that will bring 210MW of renewable power to 14 Navy bases in California. Over the life of the 25-year contract, the Navy will save more than $90 million, while enhancing energy security and resiliency.\nObama Administration's Record on Federal Sustainability\nSince taking office, President Obama has taken unprecedented steps to lead by example in the Federal government, investing in innovative and cost effective initiatives to reduce carbon pollution. In March 2015, President Obama set  aggressive targets for the government to cut Federal greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent by the year 2025, from a 2008 baseline. To date, the Federal government has met the challenge by achieving the following:\nEmissions Reductions:\n*  The Federal Government has reduced its annual greenhouse gas emissions 17.6 percent since 2008, and avoided the emission of over 41 million metric tons of GHGs, equivalent to taking 8.7 million cars off the road for one year.\n*  Federal agencies have cut energy use at Federal facilities by 15.4 percent since 2008. In 2015 alone, the government consumed almost 38 trillion British Thermal Units less than 2008, saving $680 million in energy costs.\n*  The amount of greenhouse gas emissions resulting from Federal government business air travel in 2015 was 35 percent less compared to 2008. That is comparable to 4.8 million flights across the U.S.\nWater Consumption:\n*  Over the past 8 years, the Federal government has saved almost 140 billion gallons of drinkable water, comparable to the amount of water used by almost 1 million households over the course of a year.\nClean Energy Use:\n*  The Federal government has nearly doubled the amount of clean energy used in facilities since 2008, totaling over 6% of facility energy use.\nVehicle and Equipment Energy Use:\n*  The Federal government reduced spending on gasoline/diesel by more than $963 million in 2015 compared to 2008.\n*  The government has tripled its consumption of alternative fuels since 2005, to 15.1 million gallons, surpassing the Administration's fleet alternative fuel consumption goal by 50 percent. These fuels are produced in the U.S., decreasing our dependence on foreign oil and enhancing our energy security.\n*  The number of electric vehicles in the Federal fleet have increased over 50-fold, from 83 vehicles in 2008, to 4,337 in 2015. The number of hybrid electric vehicles in the Federal fleet increased 1,194% between 2008 and 2015, from 1,766 to 22,863 vehicles.", "timestamp": "2016-09-07", "title": "Fact Sheet: White House Announces 2016 GreenGov Presidential Awards, New Steps to Advance Federal Sustainability"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "The President spoke at 10:44 a.m.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118927", "text": "Good morning, everybody. As you saw, we've just had the opportunity to learn more about the very important work that's being done here at the COPE Centre and about the magnitude of the challenge posed by unexploded ordnance.\nFor many people, war is something that you read about in books. And you learn the names of battles, the dates of conflicts, and you look at maps and images that depict events from long ago. For the United States, one of the wars from our history is the conflict called the Vietnam war. It's a long and complicated conflict that took the lives of many brave young Americans. But we also know that despite its American name, what we call it, this war was not contained to Vietnam. It included many years of fighting and bombing in Cambodia and here in Laos. But for all those years in the 1960s and seventies, America's intervention here in Laos was a secret to the American people, who were separated by vast distances and a Pacific Ocean, and there was no Internet, and information didn't flow as easily.\nFor the people of Laos, obviously, this war was no secret. Over the course of roughly a decade, the United States dropped more bombs on Laos than Germany and Japan during World War II. Some 270 million cluster bomblets were dropped on this country. And you can see some of these displays showing everything that landed on relatively simple homes like this, and farms and rural areas. By some estimates, more bombs per capita were dropped on Laos than any other country in the world.\nFor the people of Laos, war was also something that was not contained to a battlefield. In addition to soldiers and supply lines, bombs that fell from the sky killed and injured many civilians, leaving painful absences for so many families.\nFor the people of Laos, the war did not end when the bombs stopped falling. Eighty million cluster munitions did not explode. They were spread across farmlands, jungles, villages, rivers. So for the last four decades, Laotians have continued to live under the shadow of war. Some 20,000 people have been killed or wounded by this unexploded ordnance, or UXO.\nFor the people of Laos, then, these are not just statistics. These bomblets have taken the lives of farmers working in the fields, traders gathering scrap metal, children playing outside who thought these small, metal balls could be turned into a toy.\nAnd for the people of Laos, this is also about the ability to make a good living. In communities that rely so much on agriculture, you can't reach your potential on land that is littered with UXOs. As one farmer said, \"We need our land to be cleared of bombs. If it weren't for the bombs, I would multiply my production.\"\nAnd we also know that the people of Laos are resilient. We see that determination in members of the clearance teams that we met, men and women who have worked for years—this very young lady says she's been at it for 20 years—all across this country to find UXO and eliminate them one by one. And I'm glad that we could be joined by them today.\nWe see the determination in the survivors of UXOs. Some of you heard me talking to Thoummy Silamphan, who joins us here today. When he was just a young child, he was badly wounded by a UXO explosion and lost his left hand. But rather than losing hope, he's dedicated his life to providing hope for others. Through his organization, the Quality of Life Association, Thoummy has helped survivors get medical care, find work, rebuild their lives with a sense of dignity.\nAnd we see that determination in the many organizations like this one. Here at COPE, you provide assistance to those who have suffered because of UXO while shining a spotlight on the work that still has to be done. And in that effort, I'm very glad that America is your partner.\nWhen I took office, we were spending $3 million each year to address the enormous challenge of UXO. We have steadily increased that amount, up to $15 million last year. This funding—together with the work of the Lao Government, UXO Lao, other international donors, and several nongovernmental organizations—has allowed us to fund clearance efforts while also developing plans for a nationwide survey that can help locate UXO and focus clearance efforts on areas that have the most potential for economic development.\nSo yesterday I was proud to announce a significant increase in America's commitment to this work. We will invest $90 million over the next 3 years to this effort. Our hope is that this funding can mark a decisive step forward in the work of rolling back the danger of UXO: clearing bombs, supporting survivors, and advancing a better future for the people of Laos.\nAs President of the United States, I believe that we have a profound moral and humanitarian obligation to support this work. We're a nation that was founded on the belief in the dignity of every human being. Sometimes, we've struggled to stay true to that belief, but that is precisely why we always have to work to address those difficult moments in history and to forge friendships with people who we once called enemies.\nThat belief in the value of every human being is what motivates the teams of Americans who have traveled to remote parts of this land to find the remains of hundreds of Americans who have been missing so that their families can receive some measure of comfort. That belief has to lead us to value the life of every young Lao boy and girl, who deserve to be freed from the fear of the shadow of a war that happened long ago.\nDoing this work also builds trust. History does not have to drive us apart; it can sometimes pull us together. And addressing the most painful chapters in our history honestly and openly can create openings, as it has done in Vietnam, to work together on other issues so that violence is replaced by peaceful commerce, cooperation, and people-to-people ties.\nAnd above all, acknowledging the history of war and how it's experienced concretely by ordinary people is a way that we make future wars less likely. We have to force ourselves to remember that war is not just about words written in books or the names of famous men and battles. War is about the countless millions who suffer in the shadows of war: the innocents who die and the bombs that remain unexploded in fields decades after.\nHere in Laos, here at COPE, we see the victims of bombs that were dropped because of decisions made half a century ago, and we are reminded that wars always carry tremendous costs, many of them unintended. People have suffered, and we've also seen, though, how people can be resourceful and resilient. It helps us recognize our common humanity. And we can remember that most people want to live lives of peace and security. And we embrace the hope that out of this history, we can make decisions that lead to a better future for the people of Laos, for the United States, for the world.\nThank you very much, everybody. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2016-09-07", "title": "Remarks at the Cooperative Orthotic and Prosthetic Enterprise (COPE) Visitor Centre in Vientiane, Laos"}

In his remarks, he referred to Phonesapith \"Om\" Sotitham, a Young South East Asian Leaders Initiative (YSEALI) Fellow who introduced the President; White House Receptionist Leah Katz-Hernandez; YSEALI Institute on Global Environmental Issues alumna Chindavone Sanlath; Mark E. Zuckerberg, founder and chief executive officer, Facebook, Inc. He also referred to his sister Maya Soetoro-Ng, brother-in-law Konrad Ng, and Mr. Ng's parents Howard and Joan Ng.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118929", "text": "The President. Thank you! Thank you so much! Sabaidii!\nAudience members. Sabaidii!\nThe President. Well, it is such a pleasure to be here. Can everybody please give Om a big round of applause for that great introduction?\nSo it is wonderful to be in Luang Prabang. I've always wanted to visit. It is said that this is where the Buddha smiled when he rested during his travels. And I can see why, because it is beautiful and relaxed. I've just come from seeing Wat Xieng Thong. Did I say that right? Sort of. [Laughter] And it was beautiful. And the entire area is spectacular. I want to thank everyone at Souphanouvong for hosting me here today. And I want to thank the people of Laos. I've been deeply touched by the hospitality that you've shown me.\nThis is my 11th visit to Asia as President of the United States, but it's my first visit to Laos. And in fact, I am the first United States President ever to come here. And with the kindness that you've shown me, I'm sure I will not be the last. Other Presidents will want to come as well. [Laughter] And I promise you I will come back when I'm no longer President. [Applause] Yes. And the good thing about when I come back and I'm not President, I won't have so much security. [Laughter] And I can sit and relax and have some food, and I won't be so busy.\nNow, whenever I travel around the world, I spend a lot of time doing business with world leaders, and I meet with the presidents of big companies. But I try to balance spending time with young people like you. And I gave a long speech yesterday, so I'm not going to do a long speech today. I want to have a conversation with you. I want to hear what you have to say. But I'm just going to make a few remarks.\nI think you know that this part of the world means a lot to me because I lived in Indonesia as a boy. And my sister is half-Indonesian. She was born there. She married a man whose parents were from Malaysia. My mother worked in Southeast Asia for most of her life, working with women in villages to try to help them get more money through selling handicrafts and developing small businesses. So, as I drive around here, it's very familiar to me. It reminds me of my childhood. And my commitment to deepening America's ties to Southeast Asia is very real.\nNow, that's why I'm the first U.S. President who has regularly met with ASEAN leaders. It's why we're working together to promote peace, protect human rights, encourage sustainable development, advance equality for women and girls, and to meet challenges like climate change and other environmental issues.\nWhile Presidents and Prime Ministers can help lay the foundation, it's going to be young people like you who build the future of this region and the world. Here in Southeast Asia, almost two-thirds of you were born after 1980, which makes me feel very old. [Laughter] In Laos, half of you were born after 1995. And from Rangoon to Jakarta, Ho Chi Minh City to Kuala Lumpur, everywhere I go, I see the energy and the optimism of all the young people who live here. I've seen your desire to resolve conflicts through diplomacy and not war. I've seen your desire for prosperity through entrepreneurship and the rejection of corruption. I've seen your interest in promoting social harmony, not by discriminating against anyone in the community, but by upholding the rights of all people, regardless of what they look like or what religion they belong to.\nAnd because your generation is the most educated and because you are all connected through your phones—[laughter]—you have more power to shape the future than any generation that we've ever known. And that's why I've made connecting our young people a cornerstone of American foreign policy.\nThree years ago, we launched YSEALI, Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative. And what began as a small group of young people is now a network of 100,000 young people from all 10 ASEAN countries. And in fact, across Africa, the Americas, and Europe, we now have nearly half a million young people like you in our Young Leaders Initiative worldwide.\nAnd our goal is to empower young people with skills and resources and the networks that you need to turn your ideas into action and to become the next generation of leaders in civil society and in business and in government. We have regional exchanges, workshops, online networking, hands-on training. We've offered grant competitions to support your efforts. We've welcomed hundreds of you to the United States to study in our universities and experience our State and local governments and to intern, spend time at our companies. And I've even hosted some of you at the White House.\nSo what we've wanted to do is to hear from you and for you to hear from each other how you can share ideas and practices and, hopefully, forge partnerships and friendships that will last you a lifetime. And I've been so proud to see how you've made YSEALI such a success. Some of you have started projects to teach summer school and helped farmers markets grow. Some of you have worked to increase civic engagement. Some of you have been involved in economic development projects so that no country in ASEAN is left behind in today's economy.\nAnd I know that closing the development gap in innovative and in impactful ways is what you're focused on at this YSEALI summit in Laos. And that's wonderful, because whatever sector we work in, we all have a role to play when it comes to things like educating our people, lifting communities up from poverty, and protecting the environment for future generations. I also understand that YSEALI alumni have come together to plan an event called YOUnified, which is a day of service across the region on December 3, and that will be the third anniversary of YSEALI.\nSo I could not be more impressed with all of you. This is change that's happening on a global scale. Young people are taking over. And I want to help it sustain itself. So today, in Luang Prabang, I have a few announcements to make that focus on what you're here to talk about, and that's development across the ASEAN region.\nFirst, at a time when English is the language of business, science, and a networked world, it's very important that young people have English language training. And that's why today we're launching English for All. This is a program where we're going to bring more English teachers to your countries, including Laos, and bring more of your educators to America for training. And we're going to offer opportunities and resources to help anybody around the world learn English on a new website called englishforall.state.gov.\nSecond, we're focused on making sure that every girl earns a quality education. In too many countries now, women and girls are not getting the same educational opportunities as men and boys. And research shows that when girls get an education, not only do they grow up healthier, but her children will grow up healthier also. Not only will she become more prosperous, but her community will become more prosperous.\nAnd that's why yesterday I announced that \"Let Girls Learn\"—this is a program that I'm working on, but more importantly, my wife is working on—[laughter]—is coming to two more countries: Laos and Nepal. And today we're announcing the new U.S.-ASEAN Women's Leadership Academy for YSEALI. Each year, this program will offer leadership training and mentoring for emerging women leaders from all 10 ASEAN countries. And because we've partnered with several multinational companies to sponsor this academy, we're going to be able to empower women to take their place in society for decades to come. So we're very excited about that.\nSo that's what we're doing. But ultimately, it's up to you as role models to inspire young people across this region. And before I take questions, I just want to highlight two YSEALI role models whose stories have really inspired me and I think will inspire you as well.\nThe first is Mimi Sae-Ju. Where is Mimi? [Applause] There you go, there's Mimi. So, Mimi grew up in a Lisu village in Northern Thailand. When YSEALI brought her to our State of Montana in the United States she met some of our Native American tribes. And in their experience, it reminded her of her own people. So she decided \"to show my people that ladies in America are doing the same things as them.\" So she founded the Lisu Cultural Heritage Center in Chiang Mai to promote and preserve the indigenous history of her people. And she sells handicrafts made by Lisu women, which helps them earn a living and makes sure that the culture lives on in future generations.\nAnd, Mimi, is that some of the stuff that they're making? You should model it for us. [Laughter] It's very nice. Beautiful. And you got that hat in Montana, though, right?\nYSEALI Fellow Amema \"Mimi\" Sae-Ju. Yes.\nThe President. There you go. Excellent.\nMs. Amema. [Inaudible]—Asian and U.S. relations—[inaudible].\nThe President. There you go. I like that. You've got a nice cowboy hat.\nThe second person I want to introduce is Dissa Ahdanisa. Where is—[applause]? So, after her experience in America through YSEALI, she said, \"When I came back to Indonesia, I realized I love the United States not because of the fancy stuff, but because of the people and because of their kindness.\" And so I want you to know that the American people feel the same way about you.\nBut it was actually Dissa's time volunteering in Nicaragua a few years ago that set her on a new course. One day, she happened across a cafe for the deaf. And at first, she just wanted to learn a new language, in this case, the sign language spoken by the waiters and waitresses. She came to realize that cafe was a great way to empower people with a disability. She visited schools for the deaf, made deaf friends. Last year, Dissa opened the Fingertalk Cafe in Indonesia to provide job opportunities for the deaf community there. And I've been told great things about the cafe, because my receptionist, as you know, in the White House, a wonderful young woman named Leah, she visited earlier this year. She is deaf, and she is the receptionist at the White House. So when you come visit the White House, she's the first person you meet. And she signs. And she said—she wanted me to tell you how proud she is of you. So congratulations. So Dissa says she wants her country to be a place where people can \"achieve dreams without restriction,\" where her daughter \"can be who she wants to be . . . [and] inspire other people with what she's doing.\" And I'm inspired by what Dissa is doing, because here, on my final trip to Asia as President, I want to make sure that all of you keep on inspiring others the way these two young women are inspiring people in their countries and around the world.\nAnd because we're in Laos, I'm going to finish with an inspiring story I heard last year about a Lao woman named Thongvone Sosamphan. I shared it with the YSEALI Fellows I welcomed to the White House. I hope you don't mind me sharing it again. Where is she? Is she here? I wasn't sure if she was here, but I'm going to tell her story anyway.\nSo as part of YSEALI, Thongvone spent time in our city of Atlanta, and she visited the memorial and center honoring one of my heroes, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. And she said she was struck by what this great civil rights leader said. He said: \"Life's most persistent and urgent question is, what are you doing for others?\"\nAnd that question made her think about the true meaning of leadership. And then, she wrote something very beautiful: \"Leadership is inside you. . . . Everyone can be a leader, because everyone can serve. You don't have to have a college degree to lead. You don't need to know more than others. All you need is a heart full of grace and a soul generated by love.\"\nAnd that is what I see in all of you. And as long as I think you keep on trying to answer that question that Dr. King asked, what are you doing for others, then I'm sure you will be extraordinary leaders in your own country. And you will always have a friend and partner in the United States of America.\nSo thank you very much, everybody. And with that, let's take some questions and comments from our YSEALI network. All right?\nSo what I'm going to do is, I think we have microphones in the audience, and we will—I will call on people. I'm going to go—I'm going to call on boys and then girls and back and forth so that it's fair. [Laughter] And when I call on you, if you could introduce yourself, tell us where you're from, and tell us what you're doing. And then, you can ask a question. Okay?\nSo let's start with this young lady right here. Yes, you. Here's a microphone. Oh, I'm sorry.\nRole of Young People in Political and Economic Development\nQ. Hello, Mr. President. I'm your big fan, actually. [Laughter] So my name is Tia. I'm from Indonesia. And it's a pleasure that you can come here. So my question is, in your opinion as a father and as a President, how important we, as a youth, to take a role in developing countries' development and changing? And also, how you measure it? Thank you.\nThe President. How—I'm sorry, what was the last one?\nQ. Do you think, how important is—how important youth role is in developing country development and how you measure it as a President and as a father? Thank you.\nThe President. Well, I think that young people historically have always been the key to progress and development. Because if you think about it, old people like me—[laughter]—we do things the old way. We have—we're trapped by our own experience, and we look to the past so often and we think this is how things always should be. Young people, they're looking to the future, and so they're able to say, we don't have to do things the old way; we can do things new ways. And that's what creates new ideas, new businesses, new ways of organizing people, new ways of treating each other with more respect, rejecting some of the old habits. Think about the U.S. relationship with Laos. For 9 years, there was a secret war in which the United States was dropping bombs on this country. And I just this morning came from a organization that is taking ordnance—explosives that did not detonate—and trying to remove them from the countryside. So if you are an old person, that may be your image of the United States. If you're a young person, now you think we have the opportunity to work with the United States in a different way, and that creates new opportunities and new hope and new relationships.\nSo I think the challenge for young people is to find the skills and the resources to put your ideas into action. Because it's not enough just to dream about, I want to educate everybody in my country, or I want to build a great new business. You actually have to do the work, and you have to have plans. And it's hard. And so part of what we're trying to do is to provide resources to young people, but also help them learn from each other so that maybe there's a program—well, we just learned from Dissa, right? She saw a program in Nicaragua, and now it's in Indonesia. So now maybe somebody in Africa visits Southeast Asia, and they have a new idea about sustainable agriculture. Right? And part of what we want to do is to make sure that people are exchanging ideas all the time. And that's very valuable.\nAll right? Good. Well, I said I was going to call on a gentleman first, right? This young man in the uniform. That's a very fancy uniform—[laughter]—so we'll have to find out from him what——\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations-U.S. Relations\nQ. Okay. Sawatdee krab. Good afternoon. My name is Phillip—[inaudible]. I'm from Thailand. And my question is, in next 10 years, what do you expect ASEAN people to think about U.S.A., and why?\nThe President. Well, the—my hope is, is that the next President will continue my policy of meeting regularly with ASEAN leaders. We are working on a whole range of different issues, from how can we help develop health care networks so that people are getting better health care, but also so that we identify if there's a disease and we can stop it before it starts spreading; to disaster relief so that if there's a typhoon that there's local capacity to respond quickly; to economic development; to education. And some of these programs, they'll take some years before they bear fruit. And my hope is that 10 years from now, people will look back and they'll say that the engagement that we began with ASEAN now has developed so that we have a very mature and deep relationship in all areas.\nAnd I believe that the United States is and can be a great force for good in the world. But because we're such a big country, we haven't always had to know about other parts of the world. If you are in Laos, you need to know about Thailand and China and Cambodia, because you're a small country and they're right next door and you need to know who they are. If you are the United States, sometimes, you can feel lazy and think we're so big—[laughter]—we don't have to really know anything about other people.\nAnd that's part of what I'm trying to change, because this is actually the region that's going to grow faster than anyplace else in the world. It has the youngest population, and the economy is growing faster than anyplace. And if we aren't here interacting and learning from you and understanding the culture of the region, then we'll be left behind. We'll miss an opportunity. And I don't want to—that to happen.\nOkay? Good. All right, let's see. This young lady right here. Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative/The President's Post-Presidency Plans\nQ. Oh, thank you. Thank you, sir.\nThe President. What's your name?\nQ. My name is—[inaudible]. I am from Singapore. Yes. I like to ask since YSEALI means so much to you, how will you ensure that YSEALI continues after you step down?\nThe President. Well, it's a great question. There are two things that we're going to do. First of all, we're working with the State Department, my Foreign Ministry, so that YSEALI continues after I've left. The program to bring certain members of YSEALI to the United States, to maintain the networks, we're trying to institutionalize that so that it continues after I'm gone.\nWhat I'm also going to do is, in my own work as an ex-President, I'm hoping to continue to work with young people through my Presidential Center. And so one of the components that I've discussed with my team is how I can continue to interact with the YSEALI alumni, and we can share ideas, and I can continue to meet with you, and we can work on projects together. So I'll continue to stay involved. But the YSEALI program itself we will continue to run through the State Department. And I'm confident that it will continue to do great things. Good. All right.\nSo since were in Laos, let me see if—a Lao young man. Here we go, right here.\nQ. Sabaidii.\nThe President. Sabaidii.\nEducation\nQ. Good afternoon, Mr. President. Thank you for visiting us. My name is—[inaudible]. I wanted to ask you, if one thing, only one thing, can be changed in ASEAN, especially in Lao, what kind of the change do you want to see? And how will you contribute to that change? Thank you.\nThe President. No, it's a good question. Well, I think that if there's one thing that we've learned is that the most important thing for any country is its people. So if there's one thing that I could help to bring about, it would be improving educational standards for young people throughout Laos and throughout ASEAN and, as I said before, making sure that that includes girls and not just boys.\nBecause if you look at the countries that are successful—let's just take ASEAN as an example—the country that has the highest standard of living is Singapore. Now, Singapore actually has very little. It doesn't have natural resources. It has ports, but it's a tiny country. And yet, economically, it is very successful. Well, why is that? Well, part of it is because its education levels are extremely high, and as a result, companies from around the world, they are interested in locating in places where they can find a workforce that is creative and smart and can do the job.\nSo it's wonderful if you have natural resources. It's wonderful if you're a big country with a large population. But ultimately, how successful a country is will depend on whether its people have the skills and the education and the vision to be able to use those resources effectively. And we're going to continue to work with all the countries in ASEAN so that we can constantly promote greater education and greater training. Now, when I say education, by the way, I don't always just mean a high-level college degree. Technical training, training in a trade, that can be valuable as well. And in the United States—this is not just for ASEAN; this is in the United States as well. In the United States, we have some of the best universities in the world, but one of the things I've been emphasizing is, we also have what are called community colleges. They're not 4-year universities, they're 2-year—typically 2-year degrees. And you can be very successful going there and finding a specialized trade or learning a very specific skill that companies are hiring for.\nAnd we want to give young people a range of options. Not everybody wants to study in a classroom and become a lawyer or a doctor. But it's also very valuable if you have somebody who's a really skilled electrician. We talk about high tech, and it's true that people who are designing software for the iPhone are the best engineers, but there are jobs in computer science where you don't need a 4-year degree. Coding is not actually that complicated once you learn how to do it. So we want to make sure that at every level young people have the ability to access a great education. And if we're able to do that, then I'm confident that ASEAN will be successful.\nOkay? Yes, go ahead.\nRacial, Ethnic, and Religious Pluralism/Human Rights\nQ. Okay. Hello. My name is—[inaudible]. I'm from Indonesia. I'm asking a question on behalf of the YSEALI online audience. So this question is from my friend—[inaudible]—from Indonesia also. She asked about this: \"Actually, America is a very big country, consists of various community of different tribes, religions, and also race. And how do you unite them into live peacefully side by side in accordance of the United States motto, e pluribus unum\"?\nThe President. Oh, that's a great question. Thank you very much. Well, you're exactly right that the United States historically, unless you're a Native American, like those who Mimi met in Montana, you came from someplace else. Those of you who visit the United States, if you walk down the streets of Los Angeles or New York, you don't know what an American looks like because Americans could be anything. They could be any color, any religion, from—with a heritage from countries all around the world. And that's our great strength. Because one of the things that I strongly believe is that when people from different cultures interact, then you're always learning something, because people bring new ideas and new traditions.\nAnd that's why in our big cities in America, you can get really good food from everywhere. And then sometimes, people come up with new food that's a mix of different foods. The same with music. If you think about rock and roll or hip-hop or any American—or jazz—any American music, it's a blend of all these different traditions. And that's part of what makes us unique.\nRecently, we all saw the Olympics. And not to brag, but the United States did very well at the Olympics. [Laughter] Now, part of this is because we're a big country and we're a wealthy country, so we can provide training and opportunities for our athletes. But if you look at our athletes, there are two things that stand out. First of all, half—more than half of the medals we won were from women. And the reason—so we passed a law a long time ago that said, if you give sports opportunities to boys, you have to give them to girls too. It's called title IX. And as a consequence, we've developed a really excellent program for women's athletics.\nThe second thing is, because we have people that came from everywhere, we have people of all different types for every sport. So we have really tall people to play basketball or to swim. We have little people for gymnastics. [Laughter] Right? We have, genetically, for whatever sport, we have people who fit the sport, right? And that's a good metaphor for why I think we've been very successful.\nNow, the challenge we have, because we are people from so many different places, is that sometimes we've had to deal with racism or conflict between races, ethnic groups, new immigrants. And that especially becomes a problem when the economy is not doing well, and so people feel stressed. And typically, when people feel stressed, they turn on others who don't look like them. It's easy—that's true everywhere in the world. When things are going good, everybody is okay. And then, when suddenly things are harder, people start saying, ah, you know what, this is the fault of the Chinese, or this is the fault of the Jews, or this is the fault of the Houthi, or whatever this—it's the Javanese or the—so one of the things that we try to do is to make sure that we're continually reminding ourselves that what makes an American is not your race or your skin color, but what makes an American is a set of beliefs, a creed: our belief that all men are created equal or our belief that our Constitution is the law of the land and that everybody has to follow it and everybody is equal before the law, so that if you're a President or you're a janitor, in the court of law you should be treated the same. We try to promote the notion that the state cannot choose sides in a religion. We have a very religious country, but part of the reason America is very religious is because we don't let the state establish one religion, so everybody is free to choose the religion that they practice.\nAnd so these ideas, these principles, are the things that need to be constantly strengthened and reinforced. And I think that, ultimately, that's where we need to go as a human race. And this is why sometimes we talk about issues like human rights or freedom of the press or freedom of speech. And I'll be honest, everywhere we go, including here at ASEAN, sometimes, people say: \"Ah, why are the Americans talking about these issues? This is none of their business; they shouldn't be meddling in other people's business. And they're—also, America is not perfect. Look, it still has racial discrimination. It still has its own problems. It should worry about its own problems.\"\nAnd I agree with that in the sense that we definitely do still have problems we have to work on. We still have discrimination; we still have situations where women are not treated equally. But I think that, over the long term, the only way that humans are going to be able to work together and interact and prosper and deal with big problems is if we are able to see what we have in common with each other and treat everybody with dignity and respect. And that means that we have to have some principles that are not just based on our nationality, they're not just based on our tribe or our religion or our ethnicity. Otherwise, we—at some point, we're not going to be able to get along, and we'll have more war, and we'll have more conflict, because that's been human history.\nAnd this is why we talk about these issues when we travel to other countries as well. It's not because we think we're better than other people, it's because we have learned from our own experience that if you don't respect all people or you don't respect all religions, but also make sure that no matter how religious you are, you respect other people to have a different idea—we've learned that if that doesn't happen, then we have conflict.\nAnd if you look at what's happening now in the Middle East, for example, that's not a—the problem in the Middle East is not primarily a problem of the West versus Islam; the problem increasingly is, Shia thinking that Sunnis are following the wrong path, and vice versa. And in Syria, if you're an Alawite or you're a Christian or—then you're worried about what the Sunni Muslims are going to do. And that—the same in Africa, where—a place like Rwanda, where in a matter of just a few months you saw a country kill hundreds of thousands of people just because of those differences. And that's been true in all parts of the world. So we have to fight against that. And that means that we have to be able to promote principles that rise above any individual religion, nationality, race. And that's what we've been trying to promote. We—not always successfully. Not everybody in America agrees with me on this, by the way. [Laughter] I'll leave it at that.\nOkay. Let's see. What country has not been—okay, but it's a—first of all, it's a boy's turn, first. Huh? Myanmar. Let's go, right here.\nYoung Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative\nQ. Good afternoon, Mr. President. My name is—[inaudible]—from Myanmar. And YSEALI is almost 3 years now. And my question is, what is the best impact of the YSEALI you have ever seen in your second term of the President, and how that is affect your administration in ASEAN? Thank you.\nThe President. Sorry, what is the best what?\nQ. The best impacts of YSEALI.\nThe President. The biggest impact of YSEALI.\nQ. The best impact of YSEALI——\nThe President. I see.\nQ. ——and you have ever seen in your second term of the President, and how that affect your administration in ASEAN? Thank you.\nThe President. Well, I don't think I can choose the best project, because there have been so many good ones. I mean, we have already heard a few here. I know that at the last town hall that we had, YSEALI town hall—where were we? It was in Ho Chi Minh City. And I had before that, Kuala Lumpur. I'm not sure which one it was, but we—I'm going to point out, there was a Lao woman who had grown up in a small village, and she had somehow traveled—her family could not afford to give her an education. She became a migrant and traveled on her own when she was very young. And because she was so driven, somehow learned English and became part of this NGO—international NGO—and she applied for YSEALI and had become a conservationist and traveled to the United States, learned about conservation practices, and then was coming back to rural communities here in Laos to help preserve the environment and to teach sustainable agriculture.\nAnd I remember just listening to her story—you were asking how this affected me. And I thought, if a young—and she was tiny; she was, like, about this big—[laughter]—and she looked very young. And I thought, if a young women, who was not—she was not born to wealth, she was not born to a famous family, she wasn't politically connected—if she could suddenly make such an impact, then that means that anybody can make an impact. And that's inspired me as a President, because it's not so much that her project was any better than any of the projects that you're working on. It's just, part of the point of YSEALI is, is that in each of us, in each of you, there's the potential to change the world. And you don't know exactly who it is here that's going to make some world-changing business or organization or environmental idea. But if we empower everybody, then we will all benefit from the talents of those people. And this is true whether you're talking about non-for-profit work or if you're talking about business. I just came from China, from the hometown of a gentleman named Jack Ma—some of you know—he's Chinese. And he is the founder and—of Alibaba. So Jack is very wealthy now. But if you listen to Jack's story, he basically started off as somebody who couldn't get into the top universities, taught himself English because he was interested in getting to America somehow. Came back, started a business that nobody thought was going to actually be very successful. He couldn't get any funding for it. But he had this idea that the Internet and computers were really important and now has created the biggest platform in Asia for selling goods.\nIf you looked at Jack Ma when he was 20 years old, when he was your age, nobody would have predicted that he'd be one of the most successful businessmen on Earth. Just like if you met Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, you wouldn't predict that he was going to be the most—have one of the most successful businesses in history.\nWell, what is true in business, it's also true in politics, it's also true in government. All of you have enormous potential, but you have to have very specific plans. And you have to work really hard, and you have to pursue those plans with determination and dedication. And then, if what you're trying isn't working, then you have to try something different and not get discouraged, because very few people are successful right away. Even the most successful people, typically, they have some failures that they have to learn from and not get discouraged.\nSo—good. Let's see. What other countries aren't—Philippines, right here.\nSustainable Development/Alternative and Renewable Energy Sources/Environment\nQ. Mabuhay, Mr. President. You were noted as one of—the only American President who was able to protect such a large area of land and sea. How were you able to justify and reconcile the very idealistic concept of economic sustainability and development without exploiting the environment? Thank you very much.\nThe President. Well, it's a good question. The—and it's a good question for ASEAN, because ASEAN is so populated, there's so many people here, and it's growing so fast—it's such a young population—that you have to ask some very tough questions, particularly because what we now know is that the models of development that we saw in the West, using fossil fuels, are not going to be sustainable. We're not going to be able to develop Laos the same way that we developed the United States. We're going to have to have a new model.\nBecause if all of the ASEAN countries and China and India all were using as much oil and gas and coal as the West did when it was developing, we're all going to be underwater. The environment will not survive.\nSo what we have to do is to, first of all, leapfrog over the old models. And what I mean by that is to come up with more efficient ways of doing the same thing. A good example of that—although this is not in the energy space, but it will describe what I mean—if you travel through Asia or Africa, everybody has got a phone. But in the West, we had to lay all these lines, right, all these underground cables and above-line telephone poles. That's how we communicated. Now, if you're a poor country, it would make no sense to rebuild all those cables. Now you just put up a cell tower, because we have a new technology.\nWell, what's true in communications is also true in energy. Part of what we're going to have to do is to develop solar power and wind power and hydropower. We have to come up with more efficient cars, more efficient appliances. And this is part of what the Paris Agreement was all about, was having each country come up with its own plans for reducing its carbon footprint without holding countries back from their ability to develop and insisting that the wealthier countries contribute to poorer countries so that they can develop faster, but using new technologies rather than the old ones.\nBut I think that every country has to recognize that there's no contradiction between conservation and development if you have a good plan. The problem is that oftentimes, in order to have good planning, you have to have a government that has skills in identifying: If we put a factory here, what's this going to do to the river? If we are going to see an expansion of population, are we going to build a mass transit system—a train system or bus system—so that people can travel without everybody using their own car? That requires a level of planning and participation and listening to the community.\nI—when we were in Vietnam, one of the biggest stories there was a big factory—was it steel? I think it was a steel—there was some sort of manufacturing company that, whatever they were doing to the water, it appeared as if it was killing all the fish. I mean, you had these days where just thousands of fish were just floating up to the surface. And so there were a lot of people who were still depending on fish for their livelihoods. So that's not a good model over the long term.\nSo when that factory had put in its application to build a factory, the government may have thought to itself, well, this is great for development, this is going to create jobs. But if it's creating jobs for the people in the factory, but destroying the jobs for the people who fish, then the total sum of development is lower than it could be. And if they had planned ahead of time, then they could have built a factory that maybe had a filter. It might have cost a little bit more, but it also meant that the water was maintained.\nAnd so part of the thing for young people like you, whether you're in government or an NGO, you're going to have to learn the best practices so that you can still grow, but you do so in a way that can be sustained over a long period of time. And look, the United States is still learning how to do this, and we've been at it a long time. But we used to have terrible pollution everywhere. And we ultimately passed laws like the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, and what we discovered was, when you set rules to preserve the environment, that companies will adjust, and they'll find new and innovative ways to make the same products and make the same amount of money, but do it in a way that actually is good for the environment.\nSo the—usually, if you see the environment destroyed, it's not because that's necessary for development. It's usually because we're being lazy, and we're not being as creative as we could be about how to do it in a smarter, sustainable way.\nAll right? Okay. So any other countries we haven't called on yet? Vietnam? Okay. Vietnam? Vietnam? Okay, right here.\nTrans-Pacific Partnership\nQ. Good afternoon, President Obama. I am Pham, from Vietnam. I would like to ask you about TPP. That is a very good idea to have all other countries in the world; the TPP includes four countries in ASEAN country, like Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei, and Vietnam.\nThe President. Right.\nQ. And we expect a lot about the future with TPP. But now, so far, the Government has not ratified it. So do we believe that within the remaining time, or even the new President—the TPP will be, could be ratified? Otherwise, what shall happen? Thank you. The President. I believe it will be ratified because it's the right thing to do. We're in a political season now, and it's always difficult to get things done. Congress isn't doing much right now. They're all going home and talking to their constituents trying to get reelected. So, after the election, I think people can refocus attention on why this is so important.\nBut the reason I think it is important is because the United States and the ASEAN countries and the Asia-Pacific region, together, these countries represent 40 percent of the world's economy. And the problem we are seeing is that at a time when growth is slow around the world, if we don't pass trade agreements that create a level playing field so businesses and workers are all treated fairly, so that there are environmental standards, just as we discussed, for products that are being sold—if we don't do that, then countries are going to turn inward, and everybody will be poorer.\nSo right now, around the world, there are some people who are resisting trade. And in some ways, that's understandable, because in advanced countries, in wealthier countries, they feel as if the old manufacturing jobs have gone to China and places with cheaper labor and lower environmental standards and lower worker protections. And so even though the United States is still very wealthy, there are places where the factories have closed because they've moved someplace else. And that happened over the course of the last 30 years. And people remember that, and they feel as if trade wasn't good for them.\nAnd what I've had to explain is that, first of all, if we do nothing, then we're not going to bring those old jobs back. Those factories will not reopen. But if we now enter into agreements with countries like Vietnam, where we have difficulty selling our products, then we can create new businesses, have new customers. And yes, Vietnam may be selling shoes and shirts, but we'll be selling software, and we'll be selling jet engines, and so both countries can grow together.\nOne of the problems we've also seen in terms of trade is that the benefits of trade all too often have gone to the wealthy people who own the companies. A lot of times, they haven't gone to the workers. And so what I've said is that, as part of TPP, we've asked countries like Vietnam, that want to be a part of it, to start raising their standards and protections for their workers and allow worker organizations to join together so that they have more of a voice in terms of their wages and their benefits and the safety of the workplace. And in fact, the Vietnamese Government has said that it's willing to do that.\nAnd if standards in ASEAN countries rise, then they're not going to be competing with U.S. workers just for who can pay workers the least, or put them in the most unsafe conditions. Instead, they'll be competing for who's working smartest and has the best products and the best ideas. And that's a competition that all of us will benefit from.\nSo I believe that we'll get it done, but it's always going to be hard. Nothing is easy in the U.S. Congress right now. [Laughter] Maybe there was a time when it was, but I haven't seen it. It sure hasn't been easy since I've been President. All right? But eventually, we'll get it done.\nOkay. How many more—how much time do we have? Last question? Because I can't miss—after having said such nice things about ASEAN, if I miss the dinner tonight, I'll be in trouble. [Laughter] So I'm going to have to go. The—who, okay, hold on, hold on. I can't hear everybody. Let's see. So I've got Brunei that hasn't had a question and Malaysia and Cambodia. Those three, huh? Man, that's a lot of countries.\nAll right, we'll go really quick. Somebody from Brunei. Somebody from Brunei. Okay, here. Go ahead. First Lady Michelle Obama/Global Health\nQ. Hello, Mr. President. Thank you for the opportunity. My name is—[inaudible]—from Brunei Darussalam. I would like to thank you for the YSEALI initiative, and also to your wife, who has initiated the healthy nutrition initiative that has changed the norms of nutrition worldwide.\nThe President. Yes.\nQ. So my question is, what are your views on the future of global health, especially on noncommunicable diseases, such as cancer and diabetes? And will your wife continue her healthy nutrition initiative after this?\nThe President. Well, the—first of all, my wife I think, will continue to work on nutrition issues. But she's going to probably be more involved internationally as well as domestically than she has been. Now that our girls are getting older, she can travel more. It used to be, she didn't like going too far away for too long because she wanted to make sure the girls were doing their homework and acting properly. But now that they're almost grown—Malia is—she's leaving, and Sasha will be gone soon as well—I think you'll see Michelle work on these issues internationally more than she has.\nIn terms of global health, I think that there are different stages. In developing countries, there are just a lot of things that we know how to do; we just have to do them. Diseases that are the result of poor nutrition, not enough to eat, no clean drinking water; sanitation systems that are not ideal; basic preventive care that can be provided in clinics and don't require big technologies; preventing malaria, which—just mosquito nets and effective mosquito abatement can make a difference. So there's a lot of low-hanging fruit, things that we can do that can save so many lives. Maternal health, working—because we still have too much infant mortality and women who are dying in childbirth. So that's one set of issues.\nA second set of issues have to do with, actually, prosperity. And that is, as people get wealthier, they're starting to get fatter, they're starting to get more diseases that are associated with modern life, right? Lack of exercise, processed foods. And what's been interesting is, these are—a lot of these problems, like diabetes, used to be primarily in wealthier countries; now you're seeing them pop up in countries like Mexico that didn't used to have these problems because of changing eating habits and lifestyles. So those are a second set of issues. Again, these are all preventable.\nThe third set of issues have to do with cancer and Alzheimer's, and these are issues that really have to do with new science and new technology. And one of the things that I've done as President in the United States is to invest heavily in research. Now that we have been able to crack the code on human genetics, we think that the time will come when we'll be able to diagnose diseases before they happen. We'll be able to say that this person has a tendency because of their genetic variations to get these diseases and develop cures before those diseases kill them.\nBut I guess my general attitude would be that even as we're working on those diseases that are worldwide and that have plagued humanity for a very long time, we can save a lot of lives and improve quality of life for a lot of people now just by dealing with the things that we know what to do, but we're just not doing it as well as we should. All right?\nOkay. So, Cambodia, who—we have somebody from Cambodia? Right here, this young man. By the way, everybody looks very good in their native clothes. Those of you who are just wearing shirts, you look good too. [Laughter] But I appreciate how nice everybody looks today. Go ahead.\nSustainable Development Goals\nQ. Okay, so thank you, Mr. President. May name is—[inaudible]—from Cambodia, and actually, my question was taken by one of the Fellows, so I just come with the second question. If the 17 goals of the SDGs were implemented in the United States, what—which goals should be the top priority, and why is it? And how you are going to deal with it? Thank you.\nThe President. The—that's a good question. So for those of you who didn't hear the question, SDG is the sustainable development goals that were an update on the original set of goals. Keep in mind how much progress we've made on those goals over the last 20 years.\nI mean, the numbers of people who we've seen rise out of extreme poverty, the number of people who are now able to have enough to eat, the reduction in infant mortality has been remarkable. So we've made real progress. Worldwide, people are much better off now than they were just 20 years ago, and I think we can make similar progress going forward.\nI've actually asked our teams to look at where in these sustainable development goals do we have work to do in the United States? And although we're still evaluating that, I would say that the areas where we still fall short are—there are still too many children in poverty in the United States. Now, they're not suffering extreme poverty of the sort that you see in parts of India or China or Laos or Cambodia, but we have children who are very poor and who still aren't getting enough to eat. That is also connected to education. And we still have a lot of children in a country so wealthy that on a day-to-day basis are not getting the kinds of educational opportunities that they deserve.\nSo I would say that the way forward for us involves addressing those pockets of poverty, and starting with kids. And we have enough wealth to do it. The question is whether we have the political will to make the investments in these communities, many of which are in inner cities. Oftentimes, they are poor African American or Latino who are still held back historically by discrimination. And sometimes, it's harder to get the society as a whole to invest in these kids.\nBut if we're going to be successful, we're going to have to do it. This goes to a question that was asked earlier. The United States, by the year 2050, so that—which is only 35 years from now, will no longer be a majority-White country—think about that—because the birth rates for particularly people of Hispanic background, but also Asians, in America is much faster, much higher.\nSo if those kids today who are poor aren't provided opportunity, our society as a whole is going to be poorer, because that's going to be the workforce of the future. And that's where I think we have to make the most progress.\nAll right, so what was the last country?\nAudience members. Malaysia!\nThe President. Malaysia. Okay, go ahead, right here.\nNative American Issues\nQ. My name is Alice Matthew, I'm from the State of Sabah in Malaysia. My question is, in solidarity with the indigenous people in—not my country, but in America itself. I just heard recently that this group of people is fighting to protect their ancestral land against the Dakota Access Pipeline. Yes. So my question is, what—in your capacity, what can you do to ensure the protection of the ancestral land, the supply of clean water, and also environmental justice is upheld? Yes.\nThe President. Well, it's a great question. The—as many of you know, the way that Native Americans were treated was tragic. And one of the priorities that I've had as President is restoring an honest and generous and respectful relationship with Native American tribes. And so we have made an unprecedented investment in meeting regularly with the tribes, helping them design ideas and plans for economic development, for education, for health that is culturally appropriate for them.\nAnd this issue of ancestral lands and helping them preserve their way of life is something that we have worked very hard on. Now, some of these issues are caught up with laws and treaties, and so I can't give you details on this particular case. I'd have to go back to my staff and find out, how are we doing on this one?\nBut what I can tell you is, is that we have actually restored more rights among Native Americans to their ancestral lands, sacred sites, waters, hunting grounds. We have done a lot more work on that over the last 8 years than we had in the previous 20, 30 years. And this is something that I hope will continue as we go forward. But it was an excellent question.\nLet me just say this in closing. This has been a great group. I want to thank, again, the university for hosting us and the people of Laos for being such wonderful partners in this process.\nFor all the young people here, I want to end by telling you the same thing that I tell young people back in the United States. Sometimes, because we have so much information from all around the world on our televisions, on our computers, on our phones, it seems as if the world is falling apart. All right? Because we're always getting information about, there's a war here, and there's a terrible environmental disaster there, and there's conflict here, and this horrible issue is happening, and everybody is shouting and everybody hates each other. And you get kind of depressed. You think, goodness, what's happening?\nBut the truth is, is that when you look at all the measures of well-being in the world, if you had a choice of when to be born and you didn't know ahead of time who you were going to be—what nationality, whether you were male or female, what religion—but you just said, when in human history would be the best time to be born? The time would be now. The world has never been healthier, it's never been wealthier, it's never been better educated. It's never been less violent, more tolerant than it is today.\nNow, we don't always see that, because there are terrible things that are happening around the world, and there are real tragedies and injustice that are happening. And it's your job to fix it. But you should never be discouraged because you have more opportunity today to make a difference in the world than any generation before. And my hope is that you will seize that opportunity and you'll know that you will have a strong friend and partner in the United States of America when you do. Okay?\nThank you very much, everybody.", "timestamp": "2016-09-07", "title": "Remarks and a Question-and-Answer Session at a Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative Town Hall Meeting in Luang Prabang, Laos"}

It's great to be here today.\nIn particular, I want to thank Mr. Ron Packard and Ms. Deborah Mays for hosting me at their school.\nToday, we are going to discuss one of the most important issues in this campaign: school choice.\nBut before we do, I want to briefly discuss new revelations about Hillary Clinton's emails. According to the FBI report: \"The FBI did find that hostile foreign actors gained access to the personal email accounts of individuals with whom Clinton was in regular contact, and, in doing so, obtained emails sent to or received by Clinton on her personal account.\"\nRemember, Hillary Clinton was emailing about the drone program – among many other extremely sensitive matters.\nThis is yet more evidence that Hillary Clinton is unfit to be commander-in-chief. By the way, the whole country saw how unfit she was at the Townhall last night, where she refused to take accountability for her failed policies in the Middle East that have produced millions of refugees, unleashed the horror of radical Islamic terrorism, and made us less safe than ever before.\nThroughout it all, she put the entire country at risk in order to cover-up her pay-for-play scandals as Secretary of State. These include scandals like giving up our uranium to Russia, doing favors for UBS bank, and selling contracts to friends and family in Haiti.\nIt's all about hiding her criminal enterprise at the Clinton Foundation.\nAs part of her criminal cover-up, Hillary Clinton's staff digitally bleached her emails after receiving a Congressional Subpoena. Her staff also destroyed some of her 13 different phones with a hammer.\nThen, when she was interviewed by the FBI, she claimed she couldn't remember important events 39 times. She couldn't even remember whether she was trained on handling classified information. She even said she didn't know that the letter \"C\" stood for confidential classified information.\nAll the while, as Hillary and Bill raked in millions of dollars from special interests, the world fell apart. Hillary Clintons' policies produced ruin in Libya, Iraq, and Syria. She failed in Russia, in China, in North Korea.\nHer policies unleashed ISIS, spread terrorism, and put Iran on the path to nuclear weapons – not to mention the ransom payments.\nOn top of it all, Hillary Clinton is trigger-happy. She's raced to invade, intervene, and topple regimes. She believes in globalism, not Americanism.\nLast night, she even falsely said no American died in Libya. Then she also falsely said there's no ground troops in Iraq, even though we have 5,000 military personnel there right now.\nIraq is one of the biggest differences in this race. I opposed going in, and I opposed the reckless way Hillary Clinton took us out – letting ISIS fill the void.\nBut I was opposed to the war from the beginning.\nLong after Howard Stern, but three months before the Iraq war started, I said, in an interview with Neil Cavuto, that \"perhaps [we] shouldn't be doing it yet,\" and that \"the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the President is concerned.\"\nThen, On March 25th of 2003, just days after the war started, I was quoted as saying the war is \"a mess,\" yet more clear evidence that I had opposed the war from the start.\nIn July of 2003, I said that \"I would love to see New York City and some of the cities and some of the states get some of the money that`s going toward Iraq and other places, because you know, they really need and it they need it badly.\" I had a number of quotes to this effect.\nThen, in August of 2004, very early in the conflict, I made a detailed statement to Esquire magazine.\n\"Look at the war in Iraq and the mess that we're in. I would never have handled it that way. Does anybody really believe that Iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to step up to lead the country? C'mon. Two minutes after we leave, there's going to be a revolution, and the meanest, toughest, smartest, most vicious guy will take over.\nWhat was the purpose of the whole thing? Hundreds and hundreds of young people killed. And what about the people coming back with no arms and no legs? Not to mention the other side. All those Iraqi kids who've been blown to pieces. And it turns out that all of the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong. All this for nothing!\nI would have been tougher on terrorism. Bin Laden would have been caught long ago.\"\nHad I been in Congress at the time of the invasion, I would have cast a vote in opposition. For years, I have been a critic of the kind of reckless foreign invasions and interventions that have been the Hallmark of Hillary Clinton's failed career.\nHere is the bottom line: I was a private citizen. I had no access to the briefings that Hillary Clinton had. But in Iraq, my judgement was right and hers was wrong.\nHillary Clinton is always complaining about what's wrong, but she's been there for more than 30 years and has never done anything about it – all you have to do is look at New York State, when she was a Senator. All talk, but nothing happened.\nWe're on track to spend $6 trillion altogether on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nMeanwhile, massive portions of our country are in a state of disrepair.\nIt's time to rebuild America.\nToo many Americans living in our inner cities have not been included in the American Dream.\nWe are one nation, and when any part of our country hurts – our whole country hurts.\nMy goal as President will be to ensure that every child in this nation – African-American, Hispanic-American, all Americans – will be placed on the ladder of success: a great education, and a great job.\nThat ladder rests on a fundamental foundation: safety.\nIn order to help our children succeed, our first duty is to ensure that every kid in America can grow up in a safe community.\nYou can't have prosperity without security.\nThis is the new civil rights agenda of our time. The right to a safe community, a quality education, and a secure job.\nOur campaign represents the long-awaited chance to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a New American Future.\nThere is no failed policy more in need of urgent change than our government-run education monopoly.\nThe Democratic Party has trapped millions of African-American and Hispanic youth in failing government schools that deny them the opportunity to join the ladder of American success.\nIt is time to break-up that monopoly.\nI want every single inner city child in America who is today trapped in a failing school to have the freedom – the civil right – to attend the school of their choice. This includes private schools, traditional public schools, magnet schools and charter schools which must be included in any definition of school choice.\nOur government spends more than enough money to easily pay for this initiative – with billions left over. It's simply a matter of putting students first, not the education bureaucracy.\nLet's run through the numbers.\nAt the state and federal level, the United States spends more than $620 billion on K-12 education each year. That's an average of about $12,296 for every student enrolled in our elementary and secondary public schools.\nThe federal government pays for about 10 percent—$64 billion, to be precise—of the K-12 costs. That $64 billion makes up about half of the total spending of the U.S. Department of Education.\nThe other roughly $570 billion spent on K-12 education comes from the states.\nWe spend more per student than almost any other major country in the world. Yet, our students perform near the bottom of the pack for major large advanced countries.\nOur largest cities spend some of the largest amounts of money on public schools.\nNew York City spends $20,226 dollars per pupil.\nBaltimore spends $15,287 dollars per student.\nChicago spends $11,976 dollars per student, and in Los Angeles it is $10,602.\nJust imagine if each student in these school systems was given a scholarship for this amount of money – allowing them and their family to choose the public or private school of their choice.\nNot only would this empower families, but it would create a massive education market that is competitive and produces better outcomes.\nThese schools would then cater to the needs of the individual student and family – not the needs of the Teachers' Union. There is no more important job than a teacher, and teachers will benefit greatly from these reforms.\nThe current government monopoly, while great for the bureaucrats, has utterly failed too many students.\nAccording to the National Assessment of Education Progress, only 1 in 6 African-American students in the eighth grade are considered proficient in math and reading.\nFailing schools then contribute to failing economies.\nIn Los Angeles the official unemployment rate for African-American men is almost 20.7 percent. In Baltimore, it is 16.2 percent, 14.7 percent in Chicago and 10.9 percent in New York City.\nIn Los Angeles, 26 percent of African American women live in poverty. In Baltimore, the poverty rate for African Americans is 27 percent. In New York, over 31 percent of African Americans live in poverty.\nNationwide, nearly 40% of African-American children live in poverty – including 45% of children under the age of six.\nOur public schools are failing to put young Americans on a path to success.\nMeanwhile, we have all seen the tragic rise in crime in these communities – which remains one of the greatest barriers to fostering opportunity and success for America's children.\nViolent crime rose more than 20% in Los Angeles in 2015. Homicides in Baltimore increased by 63%. There have been nearly 3,000 victims of shootings in Chicago so far this year.\nGovernment is failing our citizens at every level.\nThat is why I am proposing a plan to provide school choice to every disadvantaged student in America.\nThat means parents will be able to send their kids to the desired public, private or religious school of their choice.\nHere is how it will work.\nRight now, about $1.9 billion is spent on fifty private school choice programs nationwide. These are opportunity scholarships, tax credits, and education savings accounts. This covers about 400,000 students in our country.\nAltogether, school choice is serving more than 3.4 million students nationwide.\nCharter schools, in particular, have demonstrated amazing gains and results in providing education to disadvantaged children and the success of these schools will be a top priority for my Administration.\nThey also produce competition that causes better outcomes for everyone.\nMy first budget will immediately add an additional federal investment of $20 billion towards school choice. This will be done by reprioritizing existing federal dollars.\nSpecifically, my plan will use $20 billion of existing federal dollars to establish a block grant for the 11 million school age kids living in poverty.\nWe will give states the option to allow these funds to follow the student to the public or private school they attend. Distribution of this grant will favor states that have private school choice and charter laws, encouraging them to participate.\nThis $20 billion will instantly extend choice to millions more students.\nA state like Ohio will benefit greatly from these new funds. Ohio is a leader in school choice. Ohio has 5 private school choice programs that serve over 30,000 students, and 384 charter schools serving 123,844 students.\nBut the $20 billion is only the beginning. As President, I will establish the national goal of providing school choice to every American child living in poverty.\nThat means that we want every disadvantaged child to be able to choose the local public, private, charter or magnet school that is best for them and their family.\nEach state will develop its own formula, but we want the dollars to follow the student.\n9 in 10 dollars spent on K-12 education is spent at the state and local level. To achieve this long-term goal, we will have to make this a shared national mission – to bring hope to every child in every city in this land.\nI will use the pulpit of the presidency to campaign for this in all 50 states, and I will call upon the American people to elect officials at the city, state and federal level who support school choice.\nMy Administration will partner with the leadership of any inner city in America – Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit – that is willing to run a pilot program to provide school choice to every child in that community. In Baltimore, for instance, that would mean more than $15,000 funds available per student.\nI am confident that the politicians will not be able to suppress the will of the people anymore.\nIf we can put a man on the moon, dig out the Panama Canal, and win two World Wars, then I have no doubt that we, as a nation, can provide school choice to every disadvantaged child in America.\nIf the states collectively contribute another $110 billion of their own education budgets toward school choice, on top of the $20 billion in federal dollars, that could provide $12,000 in school choice funds to every K-12 student who today lives in poverty.\nThe money will follow the student. That means the student will be able to attend the public, private, charter or magnet school of their choice – and each state will develop its own system that works best for them.\nAs your President, I will be the nation's biggest cheerleader for school choice. I understand many stale old politicians will resist. But it's time for our country to start thinking big once again. We spend too much time quibbling over the smallest words, when we should spend our time dreaming about the great adventures that lie ahead.\nI will also support merit-pay for teachers, so that we reward great teachers – instead of the failed tenure system that rewards bad teachers and punishes good ones.\nAt the same time, we have to ensure that jobs are waiting for our young kids when they graduate high school and college.\nMy policies will add millions of new jobs to our country, especially for our African-American and Hispanic communities.\nMy plan to lift restrictions on the production of American energy will not only make home energy bills cheaper, but it will add an estimated half a million jobs per year.\nBy reducing radical regulation and over-taxation, we can bring thousands of new companies into our poorest communities.\nCrucially, my trade reforms will create a manufacturing revival in America. We have a nearly $800 billion dollar annual trade deficit with the world – that's money coming straight out of states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Maine, and so many others. By ending foreign currency manipulation, product dumping, and other predatory trading practices, we will be able to open thousands of new plants and factories across America.\nThe future is filled with limitless possibilities for our nation, and exciting opportunities for our children.\nAll we have to do is cut our ties with the failed politics of the past. We've had a failed foreign policy. A failed education policy. A failed economic policy. And, underneath it all, a failed political system that rewards politicians for how many donors they have – or how many journalists they know – not how many Americans they help to live better lives.\nBut the failures of the past are about to end.\nThose failures end beginning on November 8th.\nWe will have One American Nation.\nWe will be One American People.\nWe are fighting to give every child, in every forgotten stretch of this country, the chance to live out their dreams in safety and peace.\nThat means a safe neighborhood, a quality education, and a secure high-paying job.\nThis is how we will rebuild our future.\nThis is how We Will Make America Great Again – For Everyone.\nThank you.", "timestamp": "2016-09-08", "title": "Remarks at the Cleveland Arts and Social Sciences Academy in Cleveland, Ohio"}

Let's be clear: Trump's proposal to apparently gut nearly 30 percent of the federal education budget and turn it into private school vouchers would decimate public schools across America and deprive our most vulnerable students of the education they deserve.\n\"Hillary Clinton believes that the public school system is one of the pillars of our democracy. As president she will fight to strengthen our public schools to ensure every student receives a world-class education, regardless of their ZIP code.\"\nDonald Trump's proposal, explained: TRUMP: \"[U]se $20 billion of existing federal dollars to establish a block grant for the 11 million school age kids living in poverty.\"\nEXPLAINER: A more extreme version of past Republican proposals, Trump's plan would apparently eliminate the targeting of federal dollars to schools and districts with the highest concentrations of low-income students. Instead, he would turn over all $15.4 billion in Title I funding to states, and allow money to follow students outside of the public school system to private or parochial schools.\n* Trump's proposal could strip funding from up to 56,000 public schools serving more than 21 million children.By allowing funding to leave America's 56,000 Title I schools, Trump's proposal will put crucial funding at risk for nearly 21 million American students.\n* Trump's proposal might only serve 1.4 million students, while stripping funding from the other 10.5 million low-income students in America.Trump's proposal would serve no-where near 11 million students. The average cost of a K-12 private school is $13,640 per student, per year. Since the vast majority of states do not support private school vouchers, Trump's proposal would have to carry the full cost of attendance. As a result, Trump's proposal might only serve 1.4 million students, while taking away funding that serves America's low-income schools.\n* Trump's proposal could have a devastating impact on student achievement.Research shows that students who attend schools using vouchers often do worse than those who stayed in their neighborhood public schools.\n* To fund his $20 billion voucher program, Trump would have to cut all Title I funding and $5 billion dollars in additional federal education programs.Trump would need to \"repurpose\" roughly $5 billion in annual education funding which currently supports programming such as preschool, Pell grants, and crucial resources to help low income students, students with disabilities, and English-language learners.", "timestamp": "2016-09-08", "title": "Hillary for America Statement in Response to Trump's Education Speech Today in Cleveland"}

We're here in the White House. And we are beyond thrilled to have you all here today.\nI want to start by thanking a few people who helped make this day possible. Of course, I want to start with Megan Beyer and the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities. Yay! (Applause.) The Alliance for Young Artists & Writers, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Institute of Museum and Library Sciences, Urban Word, Youth Speaks. (Audience snaps fingers.) Yeah, I forgot we snap here, too. (Laughter.)\nAnd I want to give a very special shout-out and thank you to Olivia Morgan, who has just done all the great work to make this possible. (Applause.) This is not on the teleprompter -- but, Olivia, we couldn't have done this without you. Your passion, your energy, your focus, your vision has just been tremendous. Barack and I think the world of you -- and your whole family. And we love you and are so grateful for everything you've -- okay, we're not crying. (Laughter.) We're not going to cry. But, Olivia, thank you so much.\nAnd I also want to thank our distinguished guest, an Abstract Poet himself, the one, the only -- Q-Tip. (Applause.) Looking good! So good to have you. Now, when my kids look up and go, \"Q-Tip is coming?\" -- I know we're into something. (Laughter.) They usually don't care what I do here. (Laughter.) But they were excited that you were going to be here. They're at school. I also want to give a huge thank you to our wonderful jurors who helped to do the hard work. (Applause.) All of you who are here today, thank you. Thank you.\nAnd last but not least, I want to recognize the young people who are up on not the stage, but in front of this fireplace with me: our fifth class of National Student Poets. Let's give them another round of applause. (Applause.)\nI know we're proud of these guys. And I got a chance to take some photos with their families, proud families. I know you all are excited to be here and watch your young people soar. Thank you for creating these young people. (Laughter.) To all the families, way to go.\nWell, I have to say that this event -- I've said this too many times, because we're celebrating a lot of \"last\" here this year -- but this is the last time that we're going to have the pleasure of welcoming a class of National Student Poets to the White House, at least under this administration. So I'm feeling a little melancholy here, because this has truly been an honor and a privilege and a joy.\nSo before we get into the readings from these amazing poets, I just want to take a moment to reflect on how we got started and why we're so committed to lifting up young people through the arts.\nBack when Barack and I first got to the White House, we knew that we wanted to use this incredible platform of the White House to inspire our young people to dream really big for themselves, to think about what their lives could look like beyond what their everyday existence is like. We wanted to ignite their ambition and also celebrate their talent, because there are so many talented young people all over this country. It just blows my mind.\nWe also knew that schools across the country, and so many of them art and music classes, were being cut back or eliminated completely. And what we knew is that loss was pretty devastating, because we all know what the evidence shows is that when kids are involved in arts, they do better in school and in life. They have higher grades. They have fewer behavioral problems. We talk about this at almost every event. They're more likely to go to college, to graduate, and go on and do wonderful things. So we know that the arts are critical.\nBarack and I also happen to be pretty huge poetry fans ourselves. My husband considers himself kind of a poet -- (laughter) -- but we'll see. We'll see. Maybe when he's done he'll write one for me. (Laughter.) You hear that, honey? (Laughter.) So that's kind of where the idea of the National Student Poet program came from. And, of course, having Olivia on our team, also a passionate person, has helped to make this happen.\nSo we decided that we wanted to honor five outstanding poets each year and then give them the mic here in the White House so that they could inspire countless other young people to follow in their footsteps. And since we started the program, we've received over 70,000 submissions from applicants -- 70,000. Just so you know, the competition is fierce. (Laughter.) It's not like you just happened up here. A lot of people have applied over the years. And we've named 20 national poets. And these talented young people have done so much over these years. They've traveled the country, many of them the world, and they've been sharing the magic of poetry with others.\nAnd this year, we were proud to double the size of this program by naming the first class of five National Youth Spoken Word Ambassadors, who are here with us today. (Applause.) You guys, stand up. Together, these talented students are what we call living, breathing proof of the power of poetry to transform young people's lives.\nWe all know that being a kid today can be a little hard. It can be tough, especially when you're a teenager and you're dealing with emotions and experiences that can be overwhelming, so say the least. It's tempting at this age to just close down and shut out the rest of the world, especially when the world can feel so ugly at times. But for so many people, writing poetry helps them open up, even in the face of all kinds of challenges and obstacles in their lives.\nAnd as Q-Tip once put it, he said, \"The world is kinda cold and the rhythm is my blanket.\" And you don't have to be a renowned artist like Q-Tip to try your hand at poetry. You don't need any special equipment -- that's the beauty of it. You don't have to have any advanced qualifications. All you need to be is willing to work hard and have a whole lot of courage -- because it is never easy to expose your inner thoughts and rawest emotions, let alone in front of a lot of cameras at the White House. (Laughter.) They're like -- it's going to be okay! It's going to be fun. (Laughter.) It's going to be fun.\nMaya -- where's Maya? You put it best. These are your words, I'm told: \"On the stage, there is no way to leave unnoticed.\" Did you say that?\nMAYA EASHWARAN: Yes. (Laughter.)\nMRS. OBAMA: Thank God. I was going to check with my speechwriter. (Laughter.) But if you can summon that courage and go through draft after draft of writing -- which is painful, I know -- and then finally stand up on this stage and speak your truth -- well, here is what we know: After all of that, you are ready for anything. That's the beauty of it. You're ready to graduate from high school and go to college, and chase after whatever dream you have. If you can be here, you can do anything, right? Small steps. And I believe that every young person in this country deserves those kinds of opportunities.\nSo I have one request that I make of all of our student poets, and I'm going to make that of you all here today. I want you to go out there and share your gifts with others. That's your job now, all right? After all the fun -- there was a reception, right? We fed you a little bit. Maybe there will be cookies. In exchange -- (laughter) -- I want you to show other young people the power of taking risks and opening themselves up to the world. Talk to your teachers about bringing poetry into the classroom if they're not doing it. Make sure that folks in your communities understand why it's so vitally important to have the arts in our schools.\nAnd that might be asking a lot, because you guys are going to have busy years ahead. This year is going to be busy. You're going to be juggling your schoolwork and your writing with the speaking engagements that I know you're going to have all across the country. So it's going to be a busy time. But we chose you because we know you can handle this. And if you don't believe me, just listen to the stories of some of the alums of this program, many of whom are here with us today. Where are our alums? Yay! (Applause.) You guys. We've got alums representing all four prior years of the National Student Poets initiative.\nOne of these young people used poetry -- which she refers to as \"power-tree\" -- to help heal her community in the aftermath of a devastating school shooting. Another National Student Poet conducted poetry workshops at veterans' centers, and he helped one veteran fulfill her dream of putting her poetry to music. He even accompanied her on piano while she sang. Other student poets designed classes for military kids, taught workshops to incarcerated women, and brought poetry to senior citizens with Alzheimer's disease.\nSo, big shoes to fill. But if you follow their lead and keep on following your passion for poetry wherever it may take you -- well, you never know where you might end up.\nAnd that was certainly true for a spoken word poet that I know -- someone who's not that much older than many of these guys. I'm older than him. But this young man performed at the first-ever White House poetry jam that my husband and I hosted back here in 2009 in the East Room. And this kid got up on stage and started rapping about Alexander Hamilton. And he blew us away. That guy's name is Lin-Manuel Miranda. And he expanded that song into one of the most extraordinary pieces of art that I -- and probably so many others -- have ever seen. (Applause.)\nSo that just goes to show you that if you can make it to the White House, you make it anywhere. (Laughter.) And I'm excited to see where you all end up and what you achieve in the years ahead. I want you all to have fun today. This is your day. Being in the White House at this moment, doing what you're about to do, is something you should treasure. So I want you all to breathe deep and just enjoy it. We all love you. We support you. You all are winners. This is your stage, your house.\nSo, I am proud of you, okay? All right. (Applause.) So with that, we're going to get going. Thank you all so much. Thank you for your hard work. Olivia, thank you so much. You all, God bless. Take it away.", "timestamp": "2016-09-08", "title": "Remarks by the First Lady Honoring the 2016 Class of the National Student Poets Program"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122664", "text": "Deepening Ties, Confronting Challenges, and Creating Opportunities\nToday, President Obama led the U.S. delegation to the U.S.–ASEAN Summit in Vientiane, Laos. The United States and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have been partners for nearly 40 years, working together on shared goals of stability, prosperity, and peace in Southeast Asia. Engagement with Southeast Asia, a strategically important, economically dynamic region at the heart of the Asia-Pacific, is a central pillar of the U.S. Rebalance to Asia. The United States is committed to this strategic partnership which advances our shared interest in building and sustaining a rules-based order in the Asia-Pacific, one in which countries can pursue their objectives peacefully and in accordance with international law and norms.\nIn 2009, his first year in office, President Obama became the first U.S. president to meet all ten ASEAN leaders as a group and has since made seven visits to the ASEAN region. In February of this year, President Obama hosted ASEAN leaders for the first time in the United States for the Special U.S.-ASEAN Summit in Sunnylands, California, to enhance our strategic partnership. Since this Summit, the United States and ASEAN continue to deepen and broaden our engagement and have jointly undertaken a variety of activities and programs, including support for the ASEAN Economic Community and expanding programs to strengthen people-to-people ties, like the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative.\nIncreasing Economic Cooperation\nU.S.-ASEAN Connect (\"Connect\") is the new strategic framework for U.S. regional economic engagement with ASEAN and the ASEAN Member States. We are expanding our economic bonds, creating business opportunities, and new jobs for citizens in all of our countries. Connect reflects both the U.S. government and U.S. private sector's desire to support ASEAN's continued integration, including the success of the ASEAN Economic Community, and to increase U.S.-ASEAN trade and investment ties. Connect is delivering on the promise of providing a focused approach to U.S. economic engagement in ASEAN. Through Connect, we are launching new activities and programs on finance, including a Women's Livelihood Bond Program that will leverage just over $15 million in private capital to create sustainable livelihoods for women; in energy, through USAID's Clean Power Asia program, a multi-million dollar effort over five years to increase the supply of grid-connected renewable energy in ASEAN; and in innovation, where a new Digital Economy Series is being organized around the key issues ASEAN must tackle to build a successful and vibrant digital economy. U.S.-ASEAN Connect is also ensuring that our new activities are well coordinated with existing U.S.-ASEAN engagement, including the U.S.-ASEAN Trade and Investment Framework Arrangement, under which we launched the new U.S.-ASEAN Trade Workshops this year that will help ASEAN officials familiarize themselves with high-standard trade agreements. We also endorsed two statements on best practices: the ASEAN-U.S. Cooperation in Fostering Transparency and Good Regulatory Practices and the ASEAN-U.S. Cooperation in Fostering International Investment.\nExpanding Maritime Cooperation\nThe United States is working to increase maritime domain awareness, reverse environmental degradation, and support sustainable fisheries and aquaculture in the ASEAN region. The USAID Oceans and Fisheries Partnership program works to restore and protect ecosystems to provide sustainable harvests of fish to local communities. We are helping to develop an electronic traceability system in ASEAN to ensure that marine resources are legally caught and properly labeled, working in partnership with fisheries authorities and companies. The United States also strongly supports ASEAN-led mechanisms and efforts to advance a secure, rules-based maritime environment. We co-chair the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) Maritime Security Inter-Sessional Meeting and actively participate in ASEAN Defense Ministers Meeting-Plus, including in maritime exercises, as well as the Expanded ASEAN Maritime Forum (EAMF), hosting an annual EAMF workshop on maritime boundary delimitation since 2015. These efforts complement U.S. security assistance and capacity building offered to ASEAN member states focused on enhancing shared maritime awareness and human security capabilities.\nCultivating the Emerging Leaders of ASEAN\nBy creating new opportunities, we are nurturing a regional network for ASEAN youth – 65 percent of ASEAN's population – to collaborate on solving common challenges and building an ASEAN identity. The Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative (YSEALI), launched by President Obama in December 2013, now engages nearly 100,000 participants aged 18-35. Through new exchange programs, workshops, online tools, and grant opportunities, YSEALI has created a platform through which this rapidly growing network of young ASEAN leaders can confront their generation's greatest challenges. The United States also awards 700 Fulbright scholarships between the United States and ASEAN Member States annually including the Fulbright U.S.-ASEAN Scholar Initiative and the ASEAN-U.S. Science and Technology Fellows Program, supporting ASEAN early-career scientists. With U.S. support, the ASEAN Youth Volunteer Program mobilizes young people to address regional challenges as well, such as environmental sustainability and disaster management.\nPromoting Opportunity for Women in ASEAN\nResearch shows that the more girls and women are educated and join the workforce, the more economies grow, infant mortality falls, and communities prosper. The U.S.-ASEAN Women's Leadership Academy for YSEALI, formally launched by President Obama at today's U.S.-ASEAN Summit, will provide an annual, week-long, capacity building leadership seminar, bringing together mentors and young women (ages 25-35) from all ten ASEAN Member States. The United States is supporting the ASEAN Commission on the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Women and Children to provide government officials and practitioners across all sectors with a comprehensive and current assessment of services for victims of human trafficking. In collaboration with the ASEAN Committee on Science and Technology and Underwriter Laboratories, we are awarding an annual ASEAN-U.S. Science Prize for Women.\nAddressing Transnational Challenges\nThe United States works with ASEAN to address 21st century challenges across borders. The November 2014 U.S.-ASEAN Joint Statement on Climate Change demonstrates our shared commitment to address this global issue. We cooperate through a wide range of activities that promotes a low-carbon economic growth trajectory and builds more climate resilient societies. The United States also works closely with ASEAN governments' disaster management authorities and the ASEAN Coordinating Center for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster response coordination in support of the ‘One ASEAN, One Response' initiative. Further, the United States supports a victim-centered approach to combatting trafficking in persons and welcomes ASEAN's Convention against Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children and supports the implementation of the Convention's plan of action. Building on existing cooperation with ASEAN, USAID will launch a five-year regional effort to counter trafficking in persons later this year focused on preventing vulnerable people from becoming victims of trafficking and improving access to support services. Additionally the State Department's new program to assist all ASEAN member states with the implementation of the victim compensation components of ACTIP, announced at the Sunnylands conference in February, will launch this fall.\nWe are also engaging with ASEAN to counter violent extremism and terrorism, and to provide support for the victims of terrorism. The International Law Enforcement Academy Bangkok has trained over 3,000 ASEAN officers to address a variety of transnational threats such as organized crime, trafficking in persons, wildlife trafficking, and corruption, in addition to counterterrorism. Following long-standing support to the ASEAN Wildlife Enforcement Network, USAID launched earlier this month a new five-year activity, building upon previous efforts to strengthen and institutionalize counter-wildlife trafficking efforts in the region.\nCybersecurity's importance to security and economic prosperity is of particular concern in Southeast Asia. The United States has conducted multiple cybercrime training courses for ASEAN and this year co-chaired an ARF Seminar on Operationalizing Confidence-Building Measures (CBMs) to enhance stability in cyber space by fostering transparency, cooperation, and communication. Earlier this year, we launched our first cyber security assistance programs for ASEAN, which includes an annual cyber security workshop, an incident response capacity building program, and a network security seminar.", "timestamp": "2016-09-08", "title": "Fact Sheet: U.S.-ASEAN Summit in Vientiane, Laos"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122665", "text": "Strategic Partners for Sustainable and Innovative Economic Growth\nConnect Represents the Next Chapter in the U.S.-ASEAN Economic Relationship\nU.S.-ASEAN Connect (\"Connect\") is the U.S. Government's strategic framework for economic engagement with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the ASEAN Member States. Connect was announced by President Obama on February 15, 2016, at the historic U.S.-ASEAN special Leaders' Summit in Sunnylands, California. Organized around four pillars – Business Connect, Energy Connect, Innovation Connect, and Policy Connect – the initiative provides strategic focus to ongoing and future U.S. economic activities in the region. U.S.-ASEAN Connect brings together all the resources and expertise of the U.S. government and private sector to create a whole-of-U.S. approach to economic engagement in the region. It reflects both the U.S. government and U.S. private sector's desire to support ASEAN's continued integration, including the success of the ASEAN Economic Community, and increased U.S.-ASEAN trade and investment.\nStrong economic ties have been at the core of the United States and ASEAN's relationship for the past four decades. ASEAN countries are collectively the United States' fourth-largest goods trading partner. Two-way trade in goods and services has tripled since the 1990s and now supports hundreds of thousands of jobs in the United States and ASEAN. U.S. businesses have more than doubled their foreign direct investment (FDI) in ASEAN, where they have been one of the largest cumulative sources of FDI. U.S. investment in the region not only supports jobs and economic growth – it transfers cutting-edge technology, builds local communities, and strengthens the skill sets of local workers.\nThrough U.S.-ASEAN Connect, the U.S. Government and private sector will strengthen our partnership with ASEAN, supporting ASEAN's goal of building a dynamic, innovative, sustainable, resilient and rules-based economic community that benefits citizens in all of our countries.\nDelivering New High-Impact Programs and Events under Four Pillars\nConnect is delivering on the promise of providing a strategic focus to U.S. economic engagement in ASEAN under four pillars: Business Connect, Energy Connect, Innovation Connect, and Policy Connect. New activities under Connect include the following:\nBusiness Connect supports increased commercial engagement between the United States and ASEAN. The United States is establishing an agribusiness credit enhancement program, in partnership with regional financial institutions, to increase access to finance and improve business processes and technologies for small and medium-sized agribusinesses and entrepreneurs in the region. Through a new Memorandum of Understanding between the U.S. Department of Commerce and the Singapore Ministry of Trade, U.S. and Singaporean firms will work to deliver e-commerce, financial technology, infrastructure, and smart city solutions throughout ASEAN.\nEnergy Connect helps develop ASEAN's power sector using sustainable, efficient, and innovative technologies. To help deliver on this goal and increase the supply of grid-connected renewable energy, USAID will support a new multi-million dollar, multi-year effort in ASEAN member states through its Clean Power Asia program.\nInnovation Connect supports innovation-focused ecosystems that spur invention, create new businesses, promote sustainable growth and assist ASEAN in developing the region's future innovators, entrepreneurs and business leaders. The United States, in partnership with Australia, is providing a guarantee to support the Women's Livelihood Bond, which will leverage just over $15 million in private capital for microfinance institutions that lend to women and social enterprises to create sustainable livelihoods for women. A new Digital Economy Series is being organized around the key issues ASEAN must tackle to build a successful and vibrant regional digital economy. This cross-cutting initiative will feature a series of public-private policy engagements, capacity-building activities, and people-to-people exchanges on e-commerce, digital entrepreneurship, mobile payments, and broadband connectivity, among other topics. The initiative will support ASEAN in developing an open and integrated digital economy that can drive innovation and inclusive economic growth.\nPolicy Connect works with ASEAN countries to improve the policy and regulatory environment for growth, trade, innovation and investment supporting ASEAN Member States' regional integration objectives under the ASEAN Economic Community. The U.S.-ASEAN Trade Workshops, under the U.S.-ASEAN Trade and Investment Framework Arrangement, will help ASEAN Member State officials familiarize themselves with the elements that go into high-standard trade agreements, helping to improve the environment for trade and investment.\nMaking a Tangible Commitment\nThe U.S. government is establishing a U.S.-ASEAN Connect Center led by a new resident Director and new dedicated staff housed within the U.S. Mission to ASEAN in Jakarta. The Center will work closely with strategic Connect locations and with regionally focused staff in Bangkok and Singapore to carry forward the Connect vision. The Connect personnel in these three locations will coordinate closely with the ten bilateral U.S. embassies in the ASEAN member state capitals that will remain the primary points of contact for country-specific issues. The U.S. government is also launching a U.S.-ASEAN Connect web site (www.usaseanconnect.gov) to facilitate access to the wide variety of expertise and resources the United States has to offer.\nTaking a \"Whole-of-Government\" Approach to Partnership under U.S.-ASEAN Connect\nEffective economic engagement requires coordination to utilize the wide variety of expertise and resources the United States has to offer. The U.S. government is collaborating across the wide range of departments and agencies and is deepening cooperation with the U.S. private sector to deliver programming, events, and assistance to promote inclusive economic growth and encourage improvements in the rule of law and the business climate. Examples of the comprehensive support the United States has been providing in the region include:\nU.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)\nSince February 2016, USAID has supported programs under each Connect pillar. Highlights include:\n•      Under Business Connect, and in collaboration with ASEAN and the U.S.-ASEAN Business Council, launching the ASEAN SME Online Academy (http://www.asean-sme-academy.org/). This one-stop resource links small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to regional and global supply chains and allows users to take courses on topics ranging from finance to technology. Facebook, Google, HP, Microsoft and MasterCard have contributed to the development of the academy's coursework. A resources section links users to more than 300 business associations, corporate initiatives, financial services and government services.\n•      Under Business Connect, establishing an agribusiness credit enhancement program, in partnership with regional financial institutions, to increase access to finance and improve business processes and technologies for small and medium-sized agribusinesses and entrepreneurs in the region.\n•      Under Innovation Connect, and in partnership with the Australian government, providing a guarantee to support the Women's Livelihood Bond, which will leverage just over $15 million in private capital for microfinance institutions that lend to women and social enterprises to create sustainable livelihoods for women.\n•      Under Innovation Connect, supporting the annual Sankalp Southeast Asia Summit, one of the largest events in the ASEAN region, which promotes the growth of social enterprises and catalyzes impact investments in developing markets.\n•      The new USAID Clean Power Asia program will support Energy Connect by helping ASEAN member states to strengthen their power sector planning, improve policy and regulatory frameworks and facilitate mobilization of investment in grid-connected renewable energy.\n•      Under Policy Connect, supporting the launch of the ASEAN Single Window (ASW), which integrates customs procedures across all 10 member countries to expedite cargo clearance and reduce transaction costs and time, effectively lowering the cost of doing business across the region and facilitating ASEAN's participation in global supply chains.\nU.S. Department of State\nSince the announcement of U.S.-ASEAN Connect, the U.S. Department of State has contributed to each pillar of U.S.-ASEAN Connect. Highlights include:\n•      Developing the U.S.-ASEAN Connect: Digital Economy Series in support of ASEAN's goal of a digitally enabled, integrated, and innovative society. The series consists of a wide breadth of activities including a USAID sponsored assessment paper of the important digital economy issues that the region faces, a series of joint public-private policy conversations around key issues, and capacity-building assistance in these areas. This initiative aims to bring together U.S. government and private sector experts with ASEAN counterparts to dive deep into the policies and regulatory frameworks required to foster the development of the digital economy. The initiative also provides an opportunity to address key U.S. and ASEAN priorities such as the development of e-commerce, enabling small and medium-sized enterprises to take advantage of the Internet, the use of mobile and electronic payments, and expanding broadband connectivity, in line with the U.S.-led Global Connect Initiative.\n•      In partnership with USAID, supporting the YSEALI Innovation Challenge to promote innovative technology solutions to some of the region's most complex problems. This year's Challenge is focused on agriculture, aquaculture and fisheries and partners with innovative businesses like Cisco and Intel.\n•      Launching the Innovation Roadshow series to bring together executives from leading U.S. companies and senior officials from the ASEAN Member States to discuss the ecosystem for innovation and entrepreneurship.

The conference will highlight Singapore as a featured country.\n•      Collaborating with the Singapore government on Singapore's inaugural FinTech Festival in November 2016 to highlight U.S. technology and expertise, increase U.S.-ASEAN trade and investment in financial technology, and promote financial inclusion. Commerce will lead a FinTech Trade Mission to the festival.\nU.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA)\nUSTDA links U.S. businesses to priority development projects in emerging economies. USTDA has funded a number of activities aimed at connecting decision-makers from ASEAN Member States with U.S. companies providing advanced infrastructure solutions. Highlights include:\n•      In collaboration with the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Secretariat and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, hosting a workshop in Manila in March 2016 to facilitate the exchange of best practices for reducing aviation emissions and fuel consumption, as well as for improving the efficiency of airline operations. The workshop connected U.S. companies to key decision-makers from Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam to discuss how advanced air traffic management and air traffic control solutions could support their efforts.\n•      The Asia-Pacific Flight Standards Reverse Trade Mission (RTM) provided an opportunity for delegates from across the region to learn about regulatory best practices to improve civil aviation safety and security oversight in their countries.

At today's East Asia Summit (EAS), the region's leaders responded to President Obama's call for strengthened cooperation by endorsing the EAS Leaders' \"Declaration on Strengthening Responses to Migrants in Crisis and Trafficking in Persons.\" To support this stronger focus on human trafficking and irregular migration challenges, President Obama announced USAID's comprehensive, five-year plan of action. The plan commits nearly $12 million in the first year, including support for a new regional program which will strengthen cross-border collaboration between source, transit, and destination countries; leverage the private sector to reduce human trafficking in person in global food supply chains; and support improved research and data collection to ensure that interventions against trafficking in persons are targeted and effective.?\nThis new program builds on the work of a separate U.S. assistance package announced by President Obama at the U.S.-ASEAN Special Leaders' Summit at Sunnylands, California in February 2016, which committed $1,000,000 to support ASEAN in implementing its new Convention Against Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children (ACTIP). The project, awarded by the State Department to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), will begin in October 2016 and run for three years. Specific support includes: strengthening domestic legal systems to offer compensation for victims of trafficking; establishing a dedicated victim compensation fund in each country; and building the capacity of prosecutors to seek criminal damages or compensation.\nThese new programs will contribute to ongoing and comprehensive efforts aimed at addressing trafficking in persons and irregular migration in Asia. As a leading member of the Migrants in Countries in Crisis (MICIC) Initiative, for example, the United States partnered with the Philippines at the United Nations in June to launch the Global Guidelines to Protect Migrants in Countries Experiencing Conflict or Natural Disaster. This inclusive, state-led, non-binding initiative is a model for other efforts on migration.\nThe U.S. Government also supports a number of programs in East Asia and the Pacific to protect vulnerable migrants who are at particular risk of human trafficking. In the Greater Mekong Sub Region and Malaysia, the United States funds IOM to train government officials and civil society to identify and assist vulnerable migrants. The project helps bolster regional coordination, particularly through bilateral cooperation on protection, assistance, return, and re-integration for trafficking victims. The United States also supports IOM's work in the People's Republic of China (PRC) to strengthen coordination within the PRC government on trafficking in persons and migration. The project advances the government's efforts to address vulnerabilities for irregular migrants and improve the framework for legal migration.\nIn addition, the State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons has 20 open projects in 15 countries in this region totaling more than $10 million. Projects focus on prevention, prosecution, and protection, with funds relatively evenly dispersed across these priorities. These projects also tackle a wide range of challenges, including building government capacity to investigate and prosecute trafficking in persons cases; assisting civil society to provide shelter, legal aid, or job training to trafficking victims or populations at risk; and working to prevent trafficking in persons through awareness raising, community and private sector engagement, and strengthened legal frameworks. Lastly, we are proud to have representatives from the region on the U.S. Advisory Council on Human Trafficking, which is comprised of eleven survivors who advise federal anti-trafficking policies.\nThailand, Malaysia, Burma, and Laos stand out as priority countries that have received significant programmatic assistance, with each currently benefitting from more than $900,000 in dedicated programs from the TIP Office. One program in Thailand provides direct support to victims of trafficking in the fishing industry, including shelters, legal aid, and witness-protection assistance. A project in Malaysia is improving shelters by training local organizations and authorities on best practices and how to screen for victims. In Burma, a grantee is improving victim-centered investigations and prosecutions through training and support to police, judges, prosecutors, and case managers. In Laos, the TIP Office is supporting the establishment of a shelter for trafficking survivors.\nUSAID's new regional program on preventing and combating trafficking in persons across Asia complements its existing bilateral anti-trafficking projects in 11 countries around the region. In its first year of implementation, USAID's current program in Cambodia has already provided direct assistance to 250 trafficked persons and emergency assistance to over 5,400 deportees from Thailand, of whom 140 were identified as trafficked persons. The 2015 ASEAN Convention Against Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children is a landmark regional cooperation framework to combat human trafficking, and USAID is assisting with implementation of ASEAN member state obligations under that convention. USAID also partners with IOM to support safe migration through an innovative communications campaign that targets persons vulnerable to trafficking as well as social attitudes in destination countries that drive demand for goods and services produced by trafficked victims.\nUnited States diplomacy is also focused on this issue. Officials in Washington and at our U.S. Embassies in the region meet regularly with foreign government officials to promote effective anti-trafficking policies, gauge progress in anti-trafficking efforts, and identify and examine trafficking trends. The Department of State annually publishes the Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report, the U.S. government's principal diplomatic and diagnostic tool to assess and help guide foreign government efforts to address trafficking in persons.", "timestamp": "2016-09-08", "title": "Fact Sheet: U.S. Efforts to Address Trafficking in Persons and Irregular Migration in East Asia and the Pacific"}

I've now met with the leaders of ASEAN eight times, visited Southeast Asia more than any other U.S. President, and it reflects the growing importance of ASEAN and this region.\nASEAN is key to the U.S. rebalance to Asia, and more importantly, it's key to a peaceful and prosperous future for the world. And we have forged a strategic partnership. The U.S. is committed to building on this solid foundation.\nWe have laid out a common vision for the region, articulated in the Sunnylands Declaration: An open, dynamic, economically competitive Asia-Pacific that respects human rights and upholds a rule-based order. Today we can discuss further how we can advance that vision together.\nThrough the U.S.-ASEAN Connect initiative, we're deepening our economic cooperation. As ASEAN integration generates new opportunities, the United States will work to promote innovation and entrepreneurship between our countries and throughout the region, and we will continue to push for completion of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\nWith respect to maritime issues, we'll continue to work to ensure that disputes are resolved peacefully, including in the South China Sea. The landmark arbitration ruling in July, which is binding, helped to clarify maritime rights in the region. I recognize this raises tensions, but I also look forward to discussing how we can constructively move forward together to lower tensions and promote diplomacy and regional stability.\nASEAN played an important role in achieving the historic Paris climate agreement, an agreement that we must all work to bring into force as soon as possible. With ASEAN nations particularly vulnerable to climate change, we have to work together to transition to cleaner economies so as to make sure that it is not impinging on development, but rather a spur to development and opportunity for your people. And we have to strengthen resilience to the impacts of climate change.\nAnd together, we're expanding our cooperation to address transnational threats. We will stay vigilant in combating terrorism, including in Southeast Asia, where we have very strong partnerships with many of you. We'll continue to partner to strengthen global health security and fight epidemics. We will continue to make progress on people-to-people ties, scientific exchanges, and making sure that we are increasing continually the opportunities for our businesses, our students, our scientists, our people to work together.\nSo again, I want to thank very much, Mr. Prime Minister, you and the Government and the people of Laos, for your excellent hospitality.

He also referred to the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) antiballistic missile system. A reporter referred to President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118941", "text": "The President. Good afternoon, everybody. Well, once again, I want to thank the Government and the people of Laos for their wonderful hospitality and for their leadership as hosts of the ASEAN and East Asia Summits. And I especially want to express my gratitude for the warmth and the kindness that they've shown to me as the first U.S. President to visit this nation. It has been a memorable and, at times, a very moving visit.\nNow, we're here because, as a region with more than 600 million people, several fast-growing economies, some vibrant democracies, but also countries transitioning to democracies, and given their strategic location along vital trade routes, the 10 nations of ASEAN are critical to peace and prosperity not only in the Asia-Pacific, but to the world. Indeed, the United States and ASEAN are among each other's top trading partners. We're the largest investors in this region, and ASEAN is one of our largest markets for U.S. exports, supporting hundreds of thousands of American jobs. So our trade and investment fuels jobs and prosperity across our countries.\nAnd that's why, as part of my rebalance of American foreign policy to the Asia-Pacific, I've deepened our engagement with the nations of Southeast Asia and with ASEAN as an institution. As the first U.S. President to meet with the leaders of all 10 ASEAN countries, I've sustained our cooperation throughout my Presidency. Earlier this year, I was proud to host the first U.S.-ASEAN summit in the United States, at Sunnylands, California. Our meeting here in Laos was our eighth meeting. And this visit marks my ninth to the ASEAN region, more than any U.S. President.\nTogether, the United States and ASEAN have forged a strategic partnership guided by key principles, including that ASEAN will remain central to peace, prosperity, and progress in the Asia-Pacific. The United States is now firmly part of the East Asia Summit, and we have worked to make that organization the region's leading forum for dealing with political and security challenges, including maritime security. And we're guided by the shared vision of the region that we put forward at Sunnylands: open, dynamic, and competitive economies; mutual security and the peaceful resolution of disputes; and respect for human rights. In short, a region where all nations play by the same rules. That's a vision that we advanced here.\nWe're stepping up our efforts to increase trade and investment. As part of the initiative I announced earlier this year, U.S.-ASEAN Connect, we're doing more to connect our businesses and investors so that it is easier to start new ventures together; more to connect our entrepreneurs so we're encouraging innovation in what are increasingly digital economies; more to connect clean energy projects as we pursue a low-carbon future. All of which will also reinforce this region's continued economic integration through the ASEAN Community. And given that four ASEAN nations are also part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, I reiterated that I am determined to do everything I can to encourage the U.S. Congress to approve TPP before I leave office.\nWith regard to security, our nations reaffirmed our commitment to a regional order where international rules and norms are upheld and where disagreements are resolved peacefully. There was recognition of the importance of the international arbitration ruling in July, which is legal and binding, and which clarified maritime claims by the Philippines and China in the South China Sea. We discussed the importance of claimants adhering to steps to which they've already agreed, including respecting international law, not militarizing disputed areas and not occupying uninhabited islands, reefs, and shoals. And I reiterated that the United States will stand with allies and partners in upholding fundamental interests, among them the freedom of navigation and overflight, lawful commerce that is not impeded, and peaceful resolution of disputes.\nThe United States and ASEAN also continue to deepen our cooperation on transnational challenges. We discussed the importance of continuing to share information to prevent terrorism and the flow of foreign fighters. Given the threat of climate change to all our nations—especially countries in this region—we agreed on the importance of bringing the Paris Agreement into force as soon as possible. We agreed to cooperation in the fight against human trafficking, including sharing more information on smugglers, closer law enforcement cooperation, and more support for victims.\nAnd at the East Asia Summit, our 18 nations expressed our grave concern about North Korea's provocative missile launches, highlighted the threat posed by its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, and called on North Korea to uphold its international obligations.\nAnd finally, I'm especially pleased that we continue to deepen the connections between the people of ASEAN and America, particularly our young people, like the inspiring young men and women that I met with at our town hall yesterday. Our Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative is now [more; White House correction.] than 100,000 strong. The women's leadership academy that I announced yesterday will support women leaders in business, government, and civil society throughout ASEAN. And we're going to help increase language skills among students and teachers through our English for All program.\nNow, in closing, I'm mindful that this is the last day of my last trip to this region as President. And when I think back to the time that I spent here as a boy, I can't help but be struck by the extraordinary progress that's been made across so much of the region in the decades since, even as there's still a lot of work to be done. And so it means a great deal to me, not only as President, but also personally, that over the past 8 years we've increased cooperation between ASEAN countries and the United States. It is unprecedented the breadth and depth of our relationships. And I think it's one of the most successful parts of our rebalance policy.\nWe've made it clear that the United States will continue to stand with the people of this region in advancing their security, prosperity, and dignity, including universal human rights. And I am very optimistic that the ties of friendship between our people, as reflected by that room full of young people that we saw yesterday, will bring us even closer in the years to come.\nSo, with that, I'm going to take a couple questions. And I will start with Kathleen Hennessey of AP.\nThe President's Travel to Asia/Guantanamo Bay Detention Center\nQ. Thanks very much, Mr. President. There's been a lot of talk back at home and here about how you were received on this trip, your last to Asia. Donald Trump said you were humiliated. [Laughter] I suspect you think that was overblown, but——\nThe President. Yes. Q. Maybe you could talk about whether or not you think your reception here was at all limited to some of the—or at all related to the limits and challenges of your Asia pivot policy. And while we're talking about legacy items, if I could just ask another quick one on Guantanamo Bay. You have 4 months left, 60 prisoners left. At this point, are you willing to acknowledge that the prison will be open by the time you leave office?\nThe President. Well, in terms of my reception here, as far as I can tell, it's been terrific. I don't know if you've gone and talked to some people in Laos. They seem pretty happy about my visit. Everywhere we've gone, we've had a great reception, just as earlier when we went to Vietnam we got a great reception. You'll recall, there were millions of people lining the streets.\nSo if this theory about my reception and my rebalance policy is based on me going down the short stairs in China, yes, I think that is overblown. [Laughter] And I think that any reasonable person, certainly any person in the region, would be puzzled as to how this became somehow indicative of the work that we've done here.\nIf you look at the remarks of leaders, if you look at the remarks of ordinary people, if you look at the concrete work that we've gotten done on everything from economic programs to development programs, to legacy of war issues, to promoting civil society and young people, the concern that I've heard is not that what we've done hasn't been important and successful. The concern that I've heard is, will it continue? And almost uniformly, the question I get from other leaders is, we hope that America's interest and presence and engagement is sustained.\nAnd my hope and expectation is, is that my successor will, in fact, sustain this kind of engagement, because there is a lot happening here. You've got countries here that are taking off. You've got one of the most dynamic and youngest populations in the world. This is where the action is going to be when it comes to commerce and trade and ultimately creating U.S. jobs by being able to sell to this market.\nAnd that's the only feedback that I've received. And that's not just based on what leaders tell me. If you read local newspapers or you talk to people, that's been the same commentary that we receive generally.\nWith respect to Guantanamo, I am not ready to concede that it may still remain open, because we're still working diligently to continue to shrink the population. I continue to believe that Guantanamo is a recruitment tool for terrorist organizations, that it's—clouds and sours some of the counterterrorism cooperation that we need to engage in. And it's not necessary, and it's hugely expensive for U.S. taxpayers.\nIs there strong resistance in Congress? Absolutely. But as we continue to shrink the population to the point where we're looking at 40 or 50 people and are maintaining a multimillion-dollar operation to house these handfuls of individuals, I think the American people should be asking the question, why are we spending this kind of money that could be spent on other things when it's not necessary for our safety and security?\nSo there's no doubt that because of the politics in Congress right now, it is a tough road to hoe. But I expect to work really hard over the next 4 months—5 months—4½ months. [Laughter]\nMargaret Brennan [CBS News].\nPresident Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines/Philippines-U.S. Relations/Republican Presidential Nominee Donald J. Trump/2016 Presidential Election Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Can you tell us if last night Philippine President Duterte offered his apology to you and if you said to him the U.S. will continue to help the Philippines push back against China? And last night, sir, Donald Trump said Vladimir Putin has been more of a leader than you, and then he said you have reduced American generals to rubble. Do you care to defend your legacy?\nThe President. [Laughter] Do I care to defend—okay.\nQ. ——respond.\nThe President. Okay, okay—respond. Got it. I did shake hands with President Duterte last night. It was not a long interaction. And what I indicated to him is, is that my team should be meeting with his and determine how we can move forward on a whole range of issues.\nAs I said when I was asked about this in China, I don't take these comments personally, because it seems as if this is a phrase he's used repeatedly, including directed at the Pope and others, and so I think it seems to be just a habit, a way of speaking for him.\nBut as I said in China, we want to partner with the Philippines on the particular issue of narcotraffickers, which is a serious problem in the Philippines. It's a serious problem in the United States and around the world. On that narrow issue, we do want to make sure that the partnership we have is consistent with international norms and rule of law. So we're not going to back off our position that if we're working with a country—whether it's on antiterrorism, whether it's on going after drug traffickers—as despicable as these networks may be, as much damage as they do, it is important from our perspective to make sure that we do it the right way, because the consequences of when you do it the wrong way is, innocent people get hurt and you have a whole bunch of unintended consequences that don't solve the problem.\nIt has no impact on our broader relationship with the Philippine people, on the wide range of programs and security cooperation that we have with this treaty ally. And it certainly has no impact in terms of how we interpret our obligations to continue to build on the longstanding alliance that we have with the Philippines however that may play itself out. And my hope and expectation is, is that as President Duterte and his team get acclimated to his new position, that they're able to define and clarify what exactly they want to get done, how that fits in with the work that we're already doing with the Philippine Government, and hopefully, it will be on a strong footing by the time the next administration comes in.\nAs far as Mr. Trump, I've—I think I've already offered my opinion. I don't think the guy is qualified to be President of the United States. And every time he speaks, that opinion is confirmed. And I think the most important thing for the public and the press is to just listen to what he says and follow up and ask questions about what appear to be either contradictory or uninformed or outright wacky ideas.\nThere is this process that seems to take place over the course of the election season where somehow behavior that in normal times we would consider completely unacceptable and outrageous becomes normalized and people start thinking that we should be grading on a curve. But I can tell you from the interactions that I've had over the last 8 or 9 days with foreign leaders that this is serious business, and you actually have to know what you're talking about, and you actually have to have done your homework. And when you speak, it should actually reflect thought-out policy that you can implement. And I have confidence that if in fact people just listen to what he has to say and look at his track record—or lack thereof—that they'll make a good decision. Elise Hu [NPR].\nChina-U.S. Relations/North Korea\nQ. Thank you very much, Mr. President. On North Korea, there's increasing evidence that China isn't enforcing economic sanctions, namely, when it comes to coal. So what's the next move there in your remaining 4½ months in office? And second, is it time for a fundamental rethink of North Korea policy, given that all these years of condemnations and increasing sanctions haven't led to a desired outcome? Thank you.\nThe President. Good. Well, those are good questions. In my meeting with President Xi, we emphasized the importance of full implementation of the U.N. sanctions that have been put forward. I can tell you that based on not only their presentations, but actually intelligence and evidence that we've seen, China has done more on sanctions implementation than they have on some of the previous U.N. Security Council sanctions. But you are absolutely right that there are still places where they need to tighten up. And we continue to indicate to them the importance of tightening those up.\nYou may have noted that China continues to object to the THAAD deployment in the Republic of Korea, one of our treaty allies. And what I've said to President Xi directly is that we cannot have a situation where we're unable to defend either ourselves or our treaty allies against increasingly provocative behavior and escalating capabilities by the North Koreans. And I indicated to him that if the THAAD bothered him, particularly since it has no purpose other than defensive and does not change the strategic balance between the United States and China, that they need to work with us more effectively to change Pyongyang's behavior.\nNow, when it comes to changing Pyongyang's behavior, it's tough. It is true that our approach—my approach since I've been President—is to not reward bad behavior. And that was based on the fact that, before I came into office, you had a pattern in which North Korea would engage in some provocative action and, as a consequence of the equivalent of throwing a tantrum, countries would then try to placate them by giving them humanitarian aid or providing other concessions or engaging in dialogue, which would relieve some of the pressure, and then they would just go right back to the same provocative behavior later.\nAnd so our view was, that wasn't working, let's try something else. Now, it is entirely fair to say that they have continued to engage in the development of their nuclear program and these ballistic missile tests. And so we are constantly examining other strategies that we can take, close consultations with Republic of Korea and Japan, as well as China and Russia and others who are interested parties, and we do believe that if there are any signs, at any point, that North Korea is serious about dialogue around denuclearization in the Korean Peninsula, that we'll be ready to have those conversations.\nIt's not as if we are looking for a problem or avoiding a willingness to engage diplomatically. But diplomacy requires that Pyongyang meet its international obligations, and not only is it failing to meet those international obligations, it's not even suggesting that they have any intention to do so anytime in the future regardless of the inducements that might be put on the table.\nSo look, we are deeply disturbed by what's happened. We are going to make sure that we put our defensive measures in place so that America is protected, our allies are protected. We will continue to put some of the toughest pressure that North Korea has ever been under as a consequence of this behavior. Can I guarantee that it works? No. But it is the best options that we have available to us right now. And we will continue to explore with all parties involved, including China, other potential means by which we can bring about a change in behavior.\nBob Woodruff [ABC News].\nVietnam War/Cold War/Heroism of U.S. Servicemembers\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President. First of all, I just want to let you know that this is going to be more of a personal question for you. We are almost the same exact age, born August 1961, but I'm 2 weeks younger than you. [Laughter]\nThe President. You know, I noticed that when we were in the gym together, you were working out a little harder than me. [Laughter]\nQ. We only have so many years left. [Laughter]\nThe President. So those 2 weeks clearly are making a difference.\nQ. [Laughter] But I want to ask you about some of your thoughts all those years ago, since we were living in those days of the Vietnam era. What were your thoughts about Vietnam, the war at that time and certainly as time when on, but more importantly, about the secret war, when you found out about that and also as time went by? Given what you learned about that and what you see now and what you've witnessed when you're here, do you think you should apologize fully to the country of Laos? And one other very important thing too is, for those American veterans who did serve in the secret war, those that are special ops, CIA, certainly pilots that dropped the bombs—those are the ones that targeted known enemies in a war they did not create. Would you be comfortable, in Laos, calling them heroes as we do with those that served in Iraq and Afghanistan?\nThe President. Well, because we're the same age, you'll recall that, sort of, at the peak of the war, we were still too young, I think, to fully understand the scope of what was taking place. It was the tail end of the war where we're entering high school and starting to understand the meaning of it. But at that point, it was—I think the debate had raged. Even those who had been strong supporters of the war recognized there needed to be some mechanism to bring it to an end. So I can't say that I was so precocious that I had deep thoughts about it at the time, other than the images that we all saw on television.\nStanding here now, in retrospect, I think what I can say is that the United States was on the right side of history when it came to the cold war. There may have been moments, particularly here in Southeast Asia, in which, in our singular focus on defeating an expansionist and very aggressive communism that we didn't think through all the implications of what we did as policymakers. And certainly, when you see the dropping of cluster bombs, trying to figure out how that was going to be effective—particularly, since part of the job was to win over hearts and minds—how that was going to work, I think, with the benefit of hindsight, we have to say that a lot of those consequences were not ones that necessarily served our interests.\nHaving said that—and I've said this before—regardless of what happens in the White House and decisions made by policymakers, when our men and women in uniform go into action and put their lives on the line and are carrying out their duty, my attitude is, they're always heroes, because they are saying that I am willing to do whatever it takes, what my Commander in Chief has ordered, in order to keep the American people safe. And by definition, their job is to put their lives on the line and make sacrifices, both seen and unseen, that have longstanding ramifications. And that act of sacrifice is heroic. And one of the things that when I think about in terms of legacy and I think, reflect back on my Presidency as it comes to an end, is the degree to which I came in respecting and honoring our men and women in uniform, I leave here even more in awe of what they do.\nAnd it also is one of the reasons why I take so seriously the decisions I make about war and peace. Because I know whatever decision I make, there are men and women out there who will carry out my decision, even if they think it's wrong, even if they didn't vote for me, even if they have completely different ideas about what's required for our national security. That's heroism. That's service. That's the definition of it. And that puts a special burden on the occupant of my office to get it right or at least as right as you can. And hopefully, when people look back 20 years from now or 30 years from now at the decisions I made, they'll be able to say that he did pretty good.\nAll right? Thank you very much, everybody.

I got the evangelicals. [cheers and applause] I'm going to make it up to you too, you watch. There are no more decent, devoted, or selfless people than our Christians brothers and sisters here in the United States. [applause]\nTrue. So true. I've witnessed that incredible generosity all across this land, gotten to know so many people. I saw it during my trip to Louisiana, where Christian volunteers raced to help their fellow citizens in need. Franklin Graham is an example. He brought the most incredible people and equipment to Louisiana. [cheers and applause] And he didn't want anything for it. He's a great man. It's that spirit of giving that we will need to rebuild Louisiana and to rebuild this country, which is in serious, serious trouble. [cheers and applause]\nYet, our media culture often mocks and demeans people of faith. And you understand that. All the time I hear from concerned parents how much harder it is for a Christian family to raise their children in today's media environment.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Right!\nMR. TRUMP: It is right, isn't it? [laughter] Yeah, it is right. [applause] Not even close. Your values of love, charity and faith built this nation. [cheers and applause] So how can it be that our media treats people of faith so poorly? One of the reasons is that our politicians have really abandoned you, to a large extent. And Hillary Clinton, you can forget about her. [laughter and jeers]\nSo let me say this right up front: A Trump administration, our Christian heritage will be cherished, protected, defended, like you've never seen before. [cheers and applause] Believe me. I believe it. And you believe it. And you know it. You know it. And that includes religious liberty – remember, remember. [cheers and applause] I recently had a chance to visit a church in Detroit, Great Faith Ministries International. Stand up if you're member. That's good. That was a great – that was an amazing experience. [applause] And the bishop, what a great guy.\nIn my remarks, I spoke about how African American church – and this is all across the country – for centuries have been the conscience of our nation. Their unbreakable faith and sprit overcame some of the most difficult periods in our history, leading us all to a better future. Very true. Amazing. This was such an amazing experience. [applause] This is the power of faith. It's the power to heal. It's the power to unite. It's the power to make all of us live better lives – all of us. [cheers and applause]\nOur nation today is divided. Nobody likes to say it, but we're living in a very, very divided nation. It will be our faith in God and his teachings, in each other, that will lead us back to unity. [cheers and applause]\nEach of us here today has a role to play in bringing our country together, united in common purpose and in common values. So let's talk today about some of the things – and these are great things – that we can do together to create the American future for everybody, not just a certain group of people, but for everybody.\nThe first thing we have to do is give our churches their voice back. It's been taken away. [cheers and applause] The Johnson amendment has blocked our pastors and ministers and others from speaking their minds from their own pulpits. If they want to talk about Christianity, if they want to preach, if they want to talk about politics, they're unable to do so. If they want to do it, they take a tremendous risk that they lose their tax-exempt status.\nAll religious leaders should be able to freely express their thoughts and feelings – [cheers and applause] – on religious matters. And I will repeal the Johnson amendment – [cheers and applause] – if I am elected your president, I promise. [cheers and applause] So important.\nThank you. That's so important.\nAnd I must tell you from the heart, this started, a building of mine in Manhattan. I had 50 pastors in a big conference room. And we actually had 50 pastors, two rabbis, a couple of priests. We were all talking. And we were there for two hours. And at the end, it was a love-fest. We all agreed. It was like a love-fest.\nAnd I said to them – we were high up in a building on 5th Avenue – and I said to them I'd love your support. And I know when I can get support. I'm quite sophisticated. [laughter] And I know they wanted to give me their total support, 100 percent, just like I had in the primaries. And I said I really would like your support. And they didn't really know what I was talking about. And I said, what's going on here? They said, well, sir, we can't do that because we would be violating the laws. And I said, what's the punishment? Well, we could lose our tax-exempt status, which, of course, is a, you know, massive penalty.\nI said, tell me about this. And we sat down. They talked about it. When did it happen? 1954 or so. Lyndon Johnson was having problems – powerful guy. I actually, as just own way – you have to gain respect for what he was able to do. Can you imagine that this man single-handedly – he was having problems with churches. And there was a church in Houston that was giving him a hard time, maybe for very good reason. And he put in an amendment that basically stopped our great pastors and ministers and others from talking, under the penalty of losing their tax-exempt status.\nSo we were looking down onto the sidewalk and there were people walking on the sidewalk. And I said, so, folks, what you're telling me is those people walking way, way down there on the sidewalk have really more power than you do, because they're allowed to express their feelings and thoughts openly and without penalty. And one of the pastors, who I knew very well – and these are powerful people; these are strong people with magnificent voices and just – and magnificent hearts, much more importantly – they looked at me and they said, that's actually right. They have more power than we do. We're not allowed to express.\nAnd that's what I said. We have to start thinking about this. And I thought about it. And then we had a large group of pastors again. I said I have thought about it. If I become president, we are going to knock out the Johnson amendment. We are going to do that. And it's not going to be hard. It's not going to be hard. [cheers and applause]\nWhen you – when you think, from the standpoint of political, you have more than men – let's say men are 50 percent, women are 50 percent. You're much more than 50 percent, added together. And I actually believe that's one of the reasons why you haven't seen Christianity and other religions within the United States going like a rocket ship – like our polls have been going in the last four weeks, a rocket ship, right? [cheers and applause] I really believe that, because you're great people. The people that you rely on on Sunday and all during the week, they've been stopped from talking and speaking by a law. And we're going to get rid of that law and it's going to get rid of – we're going to get rid of it so fast.\nAnd I'm so proud to say – honestly, I don't want to take credit, but you had 50 people in that first meeting and many more in the second. I am so proud – I was just telling this to Tony – to say that was my idea. I figure it's the only way I'm getting to heaven, so this is going to be very – [laughter] – the only way. [applause] So we're going to get rid of it, and we're going to let your great people speak, and you're going to see something happen that's going to be very, very good, OK? So important.\nI hope – which means you have to get out and vote on November 8th. You cannot – you didn't vote four years ago. You didn't vote.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: I did.\nMR. TRUMP: You did? Well, you did. A few of you did. [laughter] Believe me, I know. I look at the stats. You didn't vote. But this time you really have – and this is your last chance. This is it. I mean, we'll never have this opportunity again. So I hope you can get every one of your friends and just get up – your family and your friends, and get out and vote, OK? November 8th. [cheers and applause] Thank you. [cheers and applause] And if you do, we're going to win by a lot. That's not going to even be a close election. And if you don't, could be a very unhappy November 8th.\nWe're also going to repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare – [cheers and applause] – which gives the government control over the lives of everyday citizens. And the numbers are horrendous. Your premiums are going up by 50, 60, 70 percent. The deductible is so high you never get to use it unless you are going to lead a very long and very complex bad period – very, very long. It is a disaster. It's a disaster, and everybody knows it. And it's going to die of its own weight anyway, but we're going to get rid of it and we're going to replace it with some great, great alternatives – much better health care at a much lower price. [cheers and applause]\nHillary Clinton wants to have completely government-run health care, which would be a disaster for the liberties and freedoms of all America. That's what she wants. That's what she's aiming at. That's what Obama wanted. He didn't quite get there, but he got this, and you see how bad this has been.\nOne of the biggest issues in this race is going to be the issue of school choice. [cheers and applause] And I can't possibly emphasize this enough. Millions of poor and disadvantaged students are trapped in failing schools. This education crisis afflicts all communities, but none more so than the African-American community – none. The Democratic Party has run the inner cities of America for 50, 60, 70 years, some cases over a hundred years – over a hundred years. Their policies and their politics, and in particular the politics of people like Hillary Clinton, have produced only poverty, joblessness, and rising crime.\nWhen she was running for the Senate in New York State, she said she was going to produce jobs, jobs, jobs in Upstate New York. It's a disaster. She's going to produce jobs, big thing – jobs, we're going to bring back jobs. Been a catastrophe. We've lost tens of thousands of jobs. She never did a thing. It was all talk, no action, just like what she's doing right now is all talk, no action. She'll talk and talk, and nothing will happen. Only bad will happen. But you just have to ask the people in Upstate New York. She won because of them, and she produced absolutely nothing. Jobs left. It's today one of the worst, one of the most depressing places in this country. So just remember that when you hear her talking about jobs. I know jobs. She doesn't know jobs. That I can tell you. [cheers and applause]\nI have outlined a new civil rights agenda for our time – the right to a safe community, a great education and a secure job. [applause]\nAnd I say to African-American parents, I say to Hispanic American parents – and I say it with great respect – our inner cities are a disaster – crime, no jobs, education is the worst, in many cases almost worldwide bad and in many cases actually worldwide bad. I say, with great respect, what do you have to lose? It can't get any worse. It can't get any worse. You choose Donald Trump, I'm going to fix the problem. You're going to have safety. [applause] You're going to have good education. We're going to get jobs, because we're going to bring our jobs back. Mexico's taking our jobs. So many other places, they're taking our jobs. What China's doing to us is horrible. We're going to have jobs. What do you have to lose? I'm going to fix this. I'm going to fix it. [cheers and applause]\nSchool choice is at the center of this civil rights agenda, and my goal is to provide every single inner-city child in America that is trapped in a failing government school the freedom to attend the school of their choice. Competition – the schools the schools will get better and better and better. [cheers and applause]\nAnd that means a private school, a religious school, a charter school or a magnet school. School choice also means that parents can home-school their children. [cheers and applause] Hundred percent.\nHillary Clinton opposes school choice because she is controlled totally, totally, like a puppet, by special interests. Her policies will force millions of African-American and Hispanic children to remain stuck in failed government schools, leading to higher unemployment and more poverty. The poverty levels in this country nobody will believe, nobody will believe.\nMy plan will break the government monopoly and make schools compete to provide the best services for our children – [applause] – including every African-American and Hispanic child in this country, every single one of them. [cheers and applause]\nThis proposal begins with a $20 billion block grant from the federal government for states to pursue school choice programs. [applause] However – that's good, right? [applause] However, because 90 percent of education spending is at the state level, I will campaign to get the states to reallocate another $110 billion of their education budgets to school choice programs. [applause]\nIf we do this, that would mean $12,000 in school choice funds for every disadvantaged student in America. What a difference this is going to make. The money will follow the student to the public, private or religious school that is best for them and their family. In so many ways, you're going to have choice.\nMy administration will partner with the leadership of any inner-city – anybody – anybody in the inner cities of America willing to run a pilot program – and there will be a lot of them – to provide school choice to every child in that community. In Baltimore, for instance, that would mean more than $15,000 in funds available per student.\nAs your president, I will be the biggest cheerleader for school choice you've ever seen. [cheers and applause] This means a lot to me, because I know it can turn things around. Again, the education can't get worse. Commo Core – we're going to end it. [cheers and applause] We're bringing education local.\nI will fight for every child in this country who deserve better futures. The African-American community has heard my message that I am going to make the inner city safe again, and I'm going to bring back jobs, and I'm going to bring back the great education. Don't be surprised – remember this, November 8th – don't be surprised, because we have been given a lot of support over the last three or four weeks, if on November 8th I get more African-American and Hispanic votes than anyone thought possible about a month ago. You see what's going on? [cheers and applause]\nThey're starting – people are starting to hear about this. And they're saying, wow. Wow. They're liking it. And again, can't get any worse. It's going to get a lot better. But only if I do it. They can't do it. The Democrats, they have – what they've done is incredible. And Hillary Clinton will be absolutely more of the same – rigid. It'll never change. Remember, a hundred years, 70 years, 50 – it's not going to change. Not going to happen.\nNow, let's talk about another issue that will define the future of this country for generations to come, the United States Supreme Court. [cheers and applause] Earlier this year, we lost the great justice, Antonin Scalia. The next president will not only have to fill this seat, but as many as four others. It could even be – I mean, we could end up with a total of five judges by one president. It would be record-setting. Probably be three. Could be four. Could even be five. And you pick the wrong people, you have a country that is no longer your country. It will be a disaster.\nOne of the most important issues, frankly – other than maybe defense, because we're going to build up our military, it's so depleted. [cheers and applause] We're going to take care of our vets. We're going to protect your Second Amendment, so many things. But one of the most important – some people think it's actually the most important – is the filling of the seats, United States Supreme Court. You see what's happening right now? Essentially it's four and four. And you see what – how bad it is. We're going to pick great judges. I've already put a list of 11 Federalist Society, highly recommended, got uniform great reviews on these 11 people. And we are going to put truly great people. Maybe we use Judge Scalia of the ultimate example of what we're looking for, OK? [cheers and applause]\nThis will determine whether or not we remain a constitutional republic, frankly. That's what's going to happen. I have pledged to appoint judges who uphold the Constitution, to protect your religious liberty, and apply the law as written. [cheers and applause] We reject judges who rewrite the Constitution to impose their own person views on 300 million-plus Americans. We're not going to have that. I've made public a list of judges, as I said, that will guide my selection process. Hillary Clinton has refused to provide such a list. And we brought it up.\nLet's see a list. You ever saw the list you would walk out of here not feeling very well. [laughter] Because she knows the extremist judges she would pick would be rejected by the overwhelming majority of the American public. They'd be rejected. Clinton's judicial picks would allow her to completely take over American health care, the American economy, and Americans religious liberty – not to mention your Second Amendment, which is on very thin ice right now, as you know, because of the fact that we're at four-and-four. If they even pick one judge who's wrong you can probably – as you know it – you can kiss the Second Amendment goodbye. And we don't want to see that.\nAnother issue in this race of great importance to everyone in this room is the issue of course of national security. Just today it was announced that North Korea performed its fifth nuclear test – its fourth since Hillary Clinton became secretary of state. It's just one more massive failure from a failed secretary of state. [cheers and applause] Failed at everything. Her policies have also put Iran onto a path of nuclear weapons, and I have to say made them overnight an absolute power. They were dying three years ago. The sanctions were choking them. They would have fallen. But Obama didn't support people that would have taken over, and I think in this case probably would have taken over the right way; had no support.\nBut you look at what's happened to Iran in such a short period of time. But remember the ransom payments. Remember, it was $400 million two weeks ago. But then they made a mistake. This is cash. Remember, they said they paid cash because they couldn't open a bank account. There was no way of sending it into a checking account. [laughter] All lies, just like Obamacare was a big lie, remember? You can use your plan. You can use your doctors – 27 times, right? Twenty-seven times. You can use your doctors, use your plan; turned out to be a lie. It's all a lie. It's all a big lie. It's a rigged system and it's a lie.\nAnd I'll tell you what. I'll tell you what. The 400 million (dollars), for those that haven't been reading the papers over the last two days, turned out to be 1.7 billion (dollars) in cash – cash. And I actually said – they said, oh, that money's going to be used for terror. I said, no, they don't need it for terror. They've got 150 billion (dollars). That's in addition to the $150 billion that we're giving back. I said they don't need it. This is going into their Swiss accounts and going into their accounts. They're not going to use it for terror. They have plenty of money for terror.\nThink of it – $1.7 billion (dollars) in cash – massive, big vats of cash. You saw them – cartons. I never saw anything like it. I've seen a lot of cash. [laughter] Hey, never saw anything like this – $1.7 billion (dollars). Can you imagine these guys? Planes get – they stop. Remember, they wouldn't give back the hostages. They waited there for hours and hours. And Obama kept saying, no, no, this has nothing to do – even the hostages said they kept us waiting for a certain plane to come in, not to take them back, because they were waiting for something. It was this – just another lie.\nBut can you imagine these people sitting there and they see $1.7 billion (dollars) in cash? Ai, yai, yai. They think we're stupid. [laughter] They think we're stupid. They won't be thinking it for long. [cheers and applause] Very sad. [cheers and applause]\nAt the same time, ISIS is hunting down and exterminating what it calls the nation of the cross. ISIS is carrying out a genocide against Christians in the Middle East. We cannot let this evil continue – can 't let it. [cheers and applause] ISIS must be destroyed – have to; have no choice.\nTo defeat ISIS, we must use military warfare, but also cyber warfare, financial warfare and ideological warfare. It's a whole different ballgame today than it was 50 years ago and 200 years ago – different world.\nWe must also establish a bipartisan goal in the United States and an international goal with our allies of defeating radical Islamic terrorism – [cheers and applause] – words that our president won't use and words that Hillary Clinton won't use. Just like we won the Cold War by identifying our enemy and building a consensus to guide a long-term strategy, so too must we do the same with Islamic terrorism.\nBy the way, President Obama has allowed Syrian refugees to pour into our country at unbelievable rates. And Hillary Clinton wants to allow 550 percent more. But it's almost impossible to get a Christian in from Syria. They take others, but they don't take Christians – very, very, very rare.\nSo I said that we need to make safe zones in the region. We want to take care of people. But we absolutely cannot allow this potential tremendous threat to continue, and we have to stop this. This is going to be potentially a catastrophe for our country. It's from within. This could be the all-time great Trojan horse. This could be it.\nYou ever notice on the – you look at the migration trail and you see people with cellphones. Cellphones. And some of the cellphones have the ISIS flag printed on them. And some of them have things far worse than that – scenes far worse than that.\nSo it was the failed policies, you have to remember, of Hillary Clinton and Obama that unleashed ISIS in the first place. If they did the right thing, you wouldn't be talking about ISIS right now. [applause] Now she wants to get rid of – oh, we're going to get rid of them. You know, she tells them already there will be no boots on the ground. Now, even if you don't want boots on the ground, you don't want to say it. Don't say it! Now they're saying, oh, I hope she wins. Oh, boy, would they dream of having her as president. Can you – [laughter] – they dream about it every night, having Hillary Clinton. But even if you believe – and I can understand that. No boots on the ground, I can understand. You don't say it! Let them think they're going to go through hell. Don't say it! [cheers and applause]\nCan you imagine the great General Douglas MacArthur, can you imagine the great General George Patton, or one of our great generals that we have today – General Flynn, who's here someplace – [cheers and applause] – I love General Flynn – but can you imagine these people saying – I mean, they're basically giving out the strategy: there will be no boots on the ground. If you don't want that, I fully understand. Don't say it! Don't say it! Could you imagine MacArthur saying we're going to fight the enemy, and we're going to move our troops in in about a month, we're going to hit from behind? [laughter] We're going to hit them from the front, then – and everything they say turns out to be true? You know, I hate to say this because we have a lot of Evangelicals in this room, but maybe we shouldn't be so honest when it comes to military strategy. Does that make sense? [laughter and applause] Hope I didn't lose your vote for saying that. [applause]\nJust look at what her policies have left us with in Iraq, Syria and Libya. The problem is Hillary Clinton is trigger-happy. She really is. She's trigger-happy, and yet she says no boots, which is sort of – probably will be boots, you know. Probably will turn out to be another disaster. He tenure has brought us only war and destruction and death. She's just too quick to intervene, invade, or to push for regime change with people we don't even know who they are. And they take over, and they're far worse. This creates the power vacuums that are filled by terrorist and groups like ISIS.\nMy administration, on the other hand, will work with any country that is willing to partner with us to defeat ISIS and halt radical Islamic terrorism. And by the way, that includes Russia. If they want to join us on knocking out ISIS, that is just fine as far as I'm concerned. [cheers and applause] It's a very imperfect world, and you can't always choose your friends. That's life.\nBut you can never fail to recognize your enemies. We have some real enemies. Unfortunately for our country, our enemies probably hacked into Hillary Clinton's emails. These are the same emails she destroyed after receiving a federal subpoena. What's that? Using software in order to bleach the emails so you can never, ever see them. She even mysteriously lost 13 different phones before the FBI got them, and many were destroyed with a hammer. [laughter] Did anybody ever hit a hammer – you know, maybe two or three people, but they were just released from prison, those two people. [laughter] Can you believe this? Destroyed them with a hammer – the old-fashioned way, I guess. [laughter]\nThe other night in the Commander in Chief Forum – did anybody see that? [cheers and applause] How did I do? [cheers] Good. Well, we have a big debate coming up. Who knows what's going to happen there? But I will say, every poll has me winning big league at the Commander in Chief. [cheers and applause] We had – the polls came out after that event and we won big league. Now we have a debate coming up. I don't imagine any of you going to be watching the debate, right? [laughter and cheers]\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Don't take her bait. Don't take her bait.\nMR. TRUMP: I won't; I promise. Hillary Clinton answered questions on her emails horribly. That's why she lost. That's why she did so poorly. She was terrible. She was – honestly, I shouldn't be saying this – she was terrible. [laughter] She keeps talking about the emails. Every time she talks about them, she talks about them differently. [laughter] It seems each week, true, she has, like, a different answer. But there can be no answer when she deletes 33,000 emails, bleaches them so they can never be recovered – an unheard-of practice – hammers them into total silence. You know what happening. You know what's happening.\nI always say, getting away with that will be the single greatest accomplishment of her career. [laughter and cheers] It's true. It's true. [cheers and applause] So her answers were bad. They were bad. And a lot of people said they were so totally dishonest. And you know, she was blaming Matt Lauer. I thought Matt Lauer did a very good job. I mean, his questions to me were very tough. [applause] But the gentleman who stood up and said: Honestly, you should be in prison for what you did – [jeers] – to me, that was the tough one. [laughter] That was the tough – hey, that was a tough question. [laughter] It was sort of a question in the form of a statement, right? [laughter]\nHillary Clinton is unfit to be our president, for many reasons. [cheers and applause] True. True. [cheers and applause] She's unfit for many reasons, the biggest of which is her judgement. It's just so bad. [laughter] It's time to restore honestly and integrity to our government. [applause] Have to do it.\nAnd one more issue, finally issue I want to discuss today is the economy, and helping those in need. There is no more charitable group in this country than Christians. [applause] And all of us through – and all of us here today are determined to lift suffering Americans out of poverty. Going to do it, with a lot of other people going to help. As you president, I will pursue a complete reform of our economy to bring back millions of new jobs into our country – millions of new jobs. [cheers and applause] We've lost our jobs like we're a bunch of babies. They've gone to other countries. They've gone to Mexico. They've gone to many other countries. China's taking massive advantage of us. It's all so easy, believe me. It's all so easy.\nThat includes, we will be doing massive tax cuts for working families and for businesses. [cheers and applause] It includes, very importantly, the elimination of all needless job-killing regulations. [cheers and applause] It includes lifting the restrictions on American energy, which is under siege. [cheers and applause] I will also renegotiate NAFTA. And if they don't want to renegotiate it so it becomes a two-way highway, not just a one-way highway out of the United States for our companies and our jobs, we will terminate NAFTA, believe me. [cheers and applause] We'll stand up to China, and we're going to fight for every last job. It's going to be America first, and it's going to be the American worker first. [cheers and applause]\nCrucially, I will also fight for the American family and American family values. The family must be at the center of any anti-poverty agenda. Has to be. [cheers and applause] Thank you.\nOur country just lost one of the great champions for the American family, Phyllis Schlafly. Great woman, really great woman. [applause] We send our thoughts and prayers to her loved ones. I will be going to her funeral tomorrow in St. Louis. [cheers and applause]\nPhyllis fought very hard to the very end for a free and prosperous America. She understood that, to be truly united as a country, we can't simply turn to government or to politicians. The bedrock of our unity is the realization that we are all brothers and sisters created by the same God. Phyllis understood that. [cheers and applause] Phyllis understood that.\nAnd by the way, Phyllis endorsed me a long time ago, when it wasn't necessarily – [cheers] – something that was so easy to do. And she was incredible. She was so brave. She endorsed me, and that was not the thing to do at the time. People said, Trump? She said, he's going to win, you don't understand. He knows how to win. He's going to win. [applause] They said, Phyllis, not going to be Trump. And we went boom, boom, boom. But I will tell you, Phyllis endorsed me at a time when it wasn't necessarily the thing to do, even the popular thing to do, and I will never forget that. That had a huge impact. She was a great, great, powerful woman with a tremendous heart. And I look forward to being with her family tomorrow, because you really – that's a celebration. She was 92 years old. [cheers and applause]\nWe are all equal, and we all come from the same Creator. If we remember that simple fact, then our future is truly limitless. There is nothing we as Americans can't do.\nThere's a biblical verse that I have often read, and I want to repeat it again because I think it is so important to what we're trying to achieve right now for our country. It's from 1 John, Chapter 4: \"No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives in us, and His love is made complete in us.\"\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Amen.\nMR. TRUMP: So true. [cheers and applause] So true. [applause]\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God, saluting one flag. [cheers and applause] It's time to stop quibbling over the smallest words and time to start dreaming about the great adventures that lie ahead for our country.\nThis is my promise to all of you: starting in 2017, we will be one American nation. It's time to break our ties with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a new American future. Have to do it. Together, we will make America believe again, we will make America united again, and we will make America great again. Thank you very much, and God bless you. Thank you.

Let me also thank our good and dear friend, Chairman Jeff Miller, for joining us here today. We've worked closely together on developing much-needed reforms to take care of our Veterans.\nLet me open by making this very important declaration: I love this state, I love the people of this state, and together we are going to have an amazing victory in November.\nDecades of political failure and corruption will come swiftly to an end, and a New American Future will begin.\nThe citizens of this country will be in charge once more.\nThe special interests have had their day. That chapter in our history is closing.\nThe history book is closing on the failed politicians of yesterday. A new chapter is beginning, and this chapter will be authored by you, the American people.\nThis will be your time. You will be running the show. Not the donors, not the insiders, not the media executives.\nOnce more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.\nAll we have to do is cut our ties to the bitter failures of the past, and anything becomes possible.\nChange is coming.\nAll the people who've rigged the system for their own personal benefit are trying to stop our change campaign because they know that their gravy train has reached its last stop.\nIt's your turn now. This is your time.\nThe fact that so many encrusted old political insiders oppose our campaign is the best proof you will ever need that we are fighting for real change – not partisan change.\nWe are fighting for all Americans – Democrats, Republicans, Independents, Conservatives, Liberals – who've been failed by this corrupt system. We're fighting for everyone who doesn't have a voice.\nWe're also fighting for every region of this country. For every part of Florida, and every part of America. From Pensacola to Pittsburgh, from Baltimore to Baton Rouge, we are fighting for every last city and every last person in this country.\nHillary Clinton is the candidate of the past.\nOurs is the campaign of the future.\nIn this future, we are going to pursue new trade policies that put American workers first – and that keep jobs in our country. All the people who got NAFTA wrong, and China wrong, and who are trying to give us the Trans-Pacific Partnership – are the same failed voices pushing for Hillary Clinton.\nOur trade deficit with the world is now nearly $800 billion dollars. We've lost one-third of our manufacturing jobs since Bill and Hillary Clinton gave us NAFTA. China is manipulating its currency and taking our jobs. We are going to stop companies from leaving our country and keep those jobs right here in America. The era of economic surrender is over.\nWe will also have a very strong border that stops people and drugs from illegally pouring into our country -- and we're going to build a border wall, and Mexico will pay for it.\nIn this new future, we are going to raise your wages. Household incomes are over $4,000 less today than they were in the year 2000.\nMy tax, trade, energy, immigration and regulation reforms will get your salaries and wages up. Hillary Clinton will continue the failed economic agenda that has only made her friends rich at your personal expense. Many people in this room tonight, and across this country, haven't seen a real wage increase in 18 years.\nThe people getting rich off of our rigged system have sent tens of millions of dollars to Hillary Clinton – much of it to her personal bank account – to keep you from having the future you deserve.\nBut on November 8th, you get to vote for the future you want.\nIn this future, we are going to pursue new education policies. At the center of my plan is school choice. I want every disadvantaged child in America to be able to attend the public or private school that is right for them and their family.\nIn this future, we are also going to keep our country out of the endless wars that have defined Hillary Clinton's career.\nTo keep our country out of war, we will remember those three very famous words: Peace Through Strength.\nThat means rebuilding our badly depleted military. I laid out a detailed plan this week to re-invest in our military and our troops.\nWe are going to build a 350 ship Navy, a 540,000 soldier Army, an Air Force of 1,200 combat-ready fighter jets, and a Marine Core built on 36 Battalions. Crucially, we are also going to pursue a state-of-the-art missile defense.\nWe will start by modernizing our cruisers to provide the Ballistic Missile Defense capability our nation needs.\nAs we expand our Navy toward the goal of 350 ships, we will also procure additional modern destroyers that are designed to handle the missile defense mission in the coming years.\nJust today we were reminded of the need for missile defense after North Korea performed its fourth nuclear test since Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State.\nOne more massive Hillary Clinton failure.\nJust like she failed in Iran and put them on the path to nuclear weapons.\nHillary Clinton has presided over the greatest series of foreign policy failures and blunders anyone has ever seen. Her policies have produced massive global disorder.\nShe handed Iraq over to ISIS, unleashing that terror group onto the world. ISIS would not be threatening the West today if not for the decisions Hillary Clinton made.\nShe helped destabilize Egypt by supporting the ouster of President Mubarak in exchange for the Muslim Brotherhood. Fortunately, President El-Sisi is now in charge, but terrorists have gained a foothold in that country.\nShe helped push Syria into a prolonged civil war by pushing regime change in that country too – without any plan for the day after.\nShe failed with China, which has only grown more aggressive. By the way, she also let China steal hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property.\nAnd of course, Hillary Clinton failed with her Russian Reset. She gave up missile defense in Poland and the Czech Republic in exchange for nothing in return. Then, she gave up 20% of U.S. uranium to Russia –while those who benefited from the deal gave money to the Clintons.\nLet's not forget, Russia went into Crimea on President Obama's watch.\nUnlike Clinton and Obama, we will negotiate with Russia from a position of strength – not weakness. And weakness is all we get from President Obama and Hillary Clinton.\nThe difference between me and my opponent on Vladimir Putin, and in all negotiations, is that I negotiate by creating leverage so I can extract a good deal for the United States.\nHillary Clinton negotiates but never gets anything of value for the United States. Putin laughs at our leaders, and takes them to the cleaners again and again.\nThat is why we will rebuild our military, strengthen our economy, and regain our position of leadership in the world – so we can negotiate from a position of great strength once again.\nIf I cannot get a good deal for the United States, I will follow the example of Ronald Reagan and walk away. That is completely contrary to the way President Obama and Hillary Clinton negotiate which gets nothing of value for the United States, ever. They just keep losing.\nI will end this legacy of failure and strongly defend the interests of the United States.\nBut I will also keep focused on the ultimate goal. We will not seek endless conflict and hostility; we won't get trapped in the failed approaches of the past. A future where America can find common ground with countries like Russia and China is a better future for our children.\nWe will pursue these relationships with our eyes wide open, and a clear understanding of our many, many differences. I will advocate the American position with a strength and clarity President Obama and Hillary Clinton never have. No more apology tours. No more bowing to foreign powers. We proudly defend America at every single turn.\nAmerica will get the respect it deserves.\nAnd if we don't, I will walk away from the deal like you've never seen anyone walk before. And, believe me, within a short while, they will come back -- but only on my terms, therefore the terms of the American people.\nOn these principles, we will pursue our long-term goals of peace – for the sake of our kids, and for the sake of the world's future.\nHillary Clinton has failed in every single country where she has ever gotten involved, and at a very high price for the world.\nHer policies have produced only death and destruction, not diplomacy. She's trigger-happy, pushing recklessly for regime change – but never creating or promoting stability, or advancing the core interests of the United States.\nHer only real achievement as Secretary of State has been getting away with her massive email scandal. She bleached, deleted and destroyed her emails after a subpoena from Congress.\nShe lied to Congress while under oath, and smashed her phones with a hammer to keep them from getting to authorities.\nBy the way, who has thirteen phones in the first place? Only somebody with a whole lot to hide.\nAnd we all know what Hillary Clinton was hiding. She was hiding her pay-for-play scandals as Secretary of State.\nHillary Clinton isn't just part of the corrupt establishment, she is the corrupt establishment.\nI just saw her press conference today where Hillary Clinton complained about all of the problems in the world. If only we'd had a competent Secretary of State who could have prevented all of these problems from happening.\nThroughout it all, Hillary Clinton and her Foundation raked in millions and millions of dollars from the most oppressive and brutal regimes on earth. Hillary Clinton and her Foundation have cozied up to regimes that oppress and brutalize women, that murder gays, and that violate human rights on an unimaginable scale.\nMy Administration will be a voice for all people who are oppressed, including the millions of women being oppressed by Radical Islam.\nHillary Clinton has been there for 30 years and produced only failure. Yet people keep giving her money and protecting her.\nIt's the powerful protecting the powerful.\nThe insiders fighting for insiders.\nI am fighting for you.\nAll the people advising Hillary Clinton are the people responsible for the endless wars and conflicts, and the tragedies in the Middle East.\nI am proud to have the support of the retired generals and admirals who know how to win – and how to avoid endless war.\nLet me also take this moment to express our deepest thanks and gratitude to everyone who has worn the uniform, but most especially to those who have given the ultimate sacrifice for this country.\nThere is no greater expression of love than the love shown by the men and women who have laid down their lives for their country and its people.\nIt is our duty to ensure that their sacrifices are not in vain. That means we don't issue timetables for political reasons, but that we work with our generals and our leaders to produce a real plan for victory.\nWe will pursue a new, steady foreign policy that seeks to advance the national security interests of the United States – not a reckless, interventionist globalism that has failed this country so badly.\nAnd we will be clear in naming our enemy: Radical Islamic Terrorism.\nThe fact that Hillary Clinton can't even say these words proves how unfit she is to lead this country. This is one single fact she can never escape.\nAny country that shares our goal of defeating this enemy will be our partner in this mission.\nWe will break the cycle of regime change, and refugee crisis, that has gone on for so many years.\nWe simply can't afford to continue down the road we are on right now.\nThat applies to everything.\nChange is needed at every single level of our society.\nWhen I talk about making America Great Again, I'm talking about creating a future that includes each and every American.\nI want the most inclusive, generous and prosperous society we have ever had.\nThe possibilities for our future are unlimited.\nThe Hillary Clinton campaign is so small, so petty, so tired.\nIf we just break from this bitter, divisive past, we can achieve anything.\nThat also means breaking from the lies and the deceit of the Clintons. They want to scare you out of voting for change. The most recent smear comes from Bill Clinton, who said that the theme of Make America Great Again is somehow racist – now they've unearthed video footage of Bill Clinton repeatedly using this same phrase. It's just one more Clinton lie, one more desperate slander to keep the people from having the future they deserve.\nWhen I talk about Making America Great Again, I'm talking about making it Great Again for Everyone – but especially for all of the Americans who have been left behind.\nWe are the campaign of unity, and we will deliver amazing things for all of our people.\nNew schools, new factories, new infrastructure.\nBeautiful skyscrapers will rise all across this nation. We will develop Detroit, Not Beijing.\nMost importantly, we will fight to end the systemic poverty in our inner cities, and to lift millions of African-Americans and Hispanics out of poverty.\nHere, in Florida, we have such an amazing and diverse community of Hispanic-Americans – from Cuba, from Puerto Rico, from Venezuela, from Haiti, from all over.\nThese incredible Americans will have in Donald J. Trump a President who is determined to fight for their jobs, their wages, their schools, and their futures.\nTo all Hispanic-Americans who want better jobs and higher wages: I will be your champion.\nAll working people, of all backgrounds and from all places, will have a true friend in Donald Trump.\nIn particular, I have a very special place in my heart for those who make a living as tradesmen, craftsmen and construction workers.\nI've spent my professional life among construction workers, bricklayers, electricians and plumbers. I feel more comfortable around blue collar workers than Wall Street executives. There's a reason the hedge fund managers are funding Hillary Clinton's campaign, and not mine.\nMy campaign is powered by my own money, but also small dollar donations from people like all of you who just want their country back.\nThis is our chance. It's our last chance to give the people control over their own futures once again.\nGleaming new plants stretching across our nation.\nYoung Latino children getting an amazing education at the school of their choice – and their parents having their jobs protected from unfair competition.\nOur Veterans will get the best healthcare in the world. You can read the whole plan on our website, DonaldJTrump.com.\nMassive tax reductions and tax simplification – so that you can keep more of your precious time and your hard-earned money. Hillary Clinton wants to raise your taxes big time.\nMost importantly, 2017 will be about unity.\nOnce again, we will be One American Nation.\nWe Will Be One American People.\nJust imagine what we can accomplish together if we set aside our differences, and focus on what we have in common as Americans.\nWe will be one people, living under One God, saluting one beautiful American Flag.\nWe Will Make America Proud Again.\nWe Will Make America Prosperous Again.\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\nFriends and fellow citizens, We Will Make America Great Again!", "timestamp": "2016-09-09", "title": "Remarks at a Rally at the Pensacola Bay Center in Pensacola, Florida"}

I strongly condemn this reckless action, which – coupled with its recent series of missile launches – makes clear Pyongyang's determination to develop a deliverable nuclear weapon. This constitutes a direct threat to the United States, and we cannot and will never accept this.\nI support President Obama's call to both strengthen the sanctions passed earlier this year with the United Nations and to impose additional sanctions. At the same time, we must strengthen defense cooperation with our allies in the region; South Korea and Japan are critical to our missile defense system, which will protect us against a North Korean missile. China plays a critical role, too, and must meaningfully increase pressure on North Korea – and we must make sure they do.\nThis is another reminder that America must elect a President who can confront the threats we face with steadiness and strength. We need a Commander-in-Chief committed to a bipartisan foreign policy, who can bring together top experts with deep experience to solve the toughest challenges. And we need a President committed to reducing – not increasing – the number of nuclear weapons and nuclear states in the world. More countries with nuclear weapons in Northeast Asia would increase the chances of the unthinkable happening. We cannot take that risk.\"", "timestamp": "2016-09-09", "title": "Statement From Hillary Clinton On North Korea's Nuclear Test"}

North Korea stands out as the only country to have tested nuclear weapons this century. Today's test, North Korea's second this year, follows an unprecedented campaign of ballistic missile launches, which North Korea claims are intended to serve as delivery vehicles for nuclear weapons targeting the United States and our allies, the Republic of Korea and Japan. As Commander in Chief, I have a responsibility to safeguard the American people and ensure that the United States is leading the international community in responding to this threat and North Korea's other provocations with commensurate resolve and condemnation.\nTo be clear, the United States does not, and never will, accept North Korea as a nuclear state. Far from achieving its stated national security and economic development goals, North Korea's provocative and destabilizing actions have instead served to isolate and impoverish its people through its relentless pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missile capabilities. Today's nuclear test, a flagrant violation of multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions, makes clear North Korea's disregard for international norms and standards for behavior and demonstrates it has no interest in being a responsible member of the international community.\nLast night I returned from the G-20 and East Asia Summit meetings in Asia, where my counterparts and I were united in our call for North Korea to return to the path of denuclearization. Upon hearing the news of the test, I had the opportunity to consult separately via phone with Republic of Korea (R.O.K.) President Park Geun-hye and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. We agreed to work with the U.N. Security Council, our other six-party partners, and the international community to vigorously implement existing measures imposed in previous resolutions and to take additional significant steps, including new sanctions, to demonstrate to North Korea that there are consequences to its unlawful and dangerous actions. I restated to President Park and Prime Minister Abe the unshakable U.S. commitment to take necessary steps to defend our allies in the region, including through our deployment of a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery to the R.O.K. and the commitment to provide extended deterrence, guaranteed by the full spectrum of U.S. defense capabilities.", "timestamp": "2016-09-09", "title": "Statement on North Korea's Nuclear Test"}

Higher education gives people a sense of who they are and sharpens how they see the world, and in our 21st-century economy, it is an investment that pays off—helping Americans work their way into the middle class. Across our country, Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) have helped Hispanic students—many of whom are the first in their family to go to college—earn a college degree. This week, we reflect on how these important institutions have helped Hispanic students reach for their dreams, and we reaffirm our commitment to supporting them for generations to come.\nHSIs have given more Hispanics access to the resources and opportunities they need to compete in our economy. More than half of America's Hispanic undergraduates attend HSIs, which have played a critical role in increasing access to a college education and have worked to bolster enrollment, retention, and graduation rates. In the last several years, college enrollment among Hispanics hit a record high, and today, it continues to grow. Over the past two decades, the percentage of young Hispanics who have earned a college degree has increased significantly—but in that same time, disparities have persisted. HSIs are helping ensure more Hispanics have the opportunity to complete college, moving us closer to our goal of leading the world in higher education by 2020.\nHispanics are the largest and fastest growing minority group in America, and we must keep striving to ensure they can pursue an exceptional education. My Administration has sought to improve educational outcomes and opportunities for every American, including Hispanics through the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for Hispanics. We have helped strengthen HSIs, which serve a higher proportion of low-income students than other institutions of higher education, by investing more than $1 billion in them over 10 years. Because college has never been more expensive, I have also taken steps to make it easier for more Americans to pay for higher education—steps that include expanding Pell Grants and offering tuition tax credits. And I am fighting for 2 years of free community college for any student willing to work for it, because no American should be priced out of a quality education.\nThe contributions of Hispanics have shaped our national narrative, and it is crucial to our success that we empower more Hispanics and young people across our country to thrive. For generations, HSIs have helped Hispanics earn college degrees, seek meaningful careers, and aspire to be anything they want. At the heart of our Nation is the idea that no matter where you come from or what you look like, if you are willing to work hard, you can make it in America. By expanding opportunities for all, we can bring more people closer to reaching their piece of the American dream.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 12 through September 18, 2016, as National Hispanic-Serving Institutions Week. I call on public officials, educators, and all the people of the United States to observe this week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities that acknowledge the many ways these institutions and their graduates contribute to our country. In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-09-09", "title": "Proclamation 9487—National Hispanic-Serving Institutions Week, 2016"}

From the Atlantic to the Pacific, Americans were struck with grief as devastation and senseless loss of innocent human life unfolded. In the empty shadow of the World Trade Center, the remains of the Pentagon, and a charred Pennsylvania field where courageous passengers saved countless lives, what emerged from the ashes of that day was not defeat—it was the heroism, compassion, and unity of the American people, which no act of terror or hate could ever take away. On September 11, we recall the true spirit of our Nation following these heinous attacks, and we resolve to enshrine the enduring compassion and love of our people forever in the heart of America.\nFifteen years later, we pay tribute to the loss of nearly 3,000 lives, reflect on treasured memories of those we lost, and resolve to never forget that day, even as we look toward a brighter and more hopeful future. We draw inspiration from the survivors who still bear the scars—both seen and unseen—of that tragic day. We honor the valiance of our Nation's first responders, whose instinct was not to turn back to find safety for themselves, but to run toward untold danger. We show our gratitude to those young Americans of the 9/11 Generation, who until that day lived knowing only peace, but who have answered our country's call to serve under our flag to meet the threats of our time with bravery and distinction.\nIn the years that have followed, with prayer and reflection, grace and faith, Americans have grieved together, held each other close, and looked out for one another. Though the void felt by those who lost a loved one on that day can never be filled, we can continue to heal the wounds inflicted by hatred by honoring the notion that, no matter our differences, we are forever united as one American family.\nAs we mourn on this most solemn anniversary, let us also reflect on the freedom and tolerance that define this great Nation, and let us reaffirm our commitment to preserving those fundamental values for each generation of Americans to come.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Friday, September 9 through Sunday, September 11, 2016, as National Days of Prayer and Remembrance. I ask that the people of the United States honor and remember the victims of September 11, 2001, and their loved ones through prayer, contemplation, memorial services, the visiting of memorials, the ringing of bells, evening candlelight remembrance vigils, and other appropriate ceremonies and activities. I invite people around the world to participate in this commemoration.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-09-09", "title": "Proclamation 9488—National Days of Prayer and Remembrance, 2016"}

World Suicide Prevention Day is a time to join with neighbors across the globe to reaffirm our commitment to preventing suicide. Here at home—thanks to dedicated crisis counselors on hotlines and in schools; clinicians and other health professionals in hospitals and mental health centers; faith leaders, teachers, friends, and family members who never give up on trying to make a meaningful difference—lives have been saved. Together, we can get people critical help when they are in crisis and raise awareness of the importance of preventing suicide in every community.\nIt is critical that we recognize the connections that mental health conditions and substance use disorders have to suicide, as well as how other external factors, including harassment, bullying, and discrimination, can play a role. Suicide can touch any of us—regardless of age, gender, or race—and leave a lasting mark on communities. We must strive to build safe and supportive environments and eliminate the stigma surrounding mental health issues that too often prevents people from seeking the care they need.\nNo one should feel alone when facing these challenges—there is always hope, and always a helping hand. My Administration has served as a partner in this important effort through the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention—a public-private partnership through which the Federal Government has helped champion suicide prevention. All Americans can make a difference in this effort. Reach out to a friend, let them know you are there in moments of need, and encourage others to seek assistance—because empowering others to find the strength to ask for help and lifting up those who feel alone can save lives. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline provides immediate assistance for all Americans at 1-800-273-TALK, and I encourage you to call if you or someone you know is in need of help. Veterans, service members, and their loved ones can also call this number to reach the Veterans Crisis Line, and they can also send a text message to 838255.\nThe Affordable Care Act provides the largest expansion of mental health coverage in a generation, and it has helped increase access to quality, affordable health insurance for all Americans. The Act prohibits insurers from discriminating against people based on pre-existing conditions like depression, expands mental health and substance use disorder parity policies to more than 60 million Americans, and requires that Health Insurance Marketplace plans cover mental health and substance use disorder services. Additionally, my Administration proposed a new $500 million investment to increase access to mental health care. And because more than 20,000 Americans each year take their own lives with a firearm, we must do all we can to ensure people who need help get it and improve gun safety technology that can help prevent suicides.\nWe also have to end the tragedy of suicide among our troops and our veterans. These American heroes give of themselves for our country, and they deserve the best from us in return—so long as any veteran is suffering or feels like they have nowhere to turn, we have more work to do. In 2014, I announced 19 Executive actions to improve mental health care for our veterans, members of our Armed Forces, and their loved ones. And last year, to build on these efforts, I signed the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act to improve how we serve veterans with post-traumatic stress and other illnesses. By increasing peer support and outreach to service members transitioning to civilian life, this Act makes it easier for veterans to find the care they need when they need it.\nThe theme of this year's World Suicide Prevention Day is \"Connect. Communicate. Care.\" These words provide a roadmap to reaching our universal goal of suicide prevention—encouraging all people to reach out to those who are suffering in silence, express when they are in need of help, and lift up those around them. On this day, we are reminded that help is available and that a brighter future lies ahead. Let us honor the souls we have lost too soon and vow to do everything in our power to prevent suicide.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 10, 2016, as World Suicide Prevention Day. I call upon citizens, government agencies, organizations, health care providers, and research institutions to raise awareness of the mental health resources and support services available in their communities and encourage all those in need to seek the care and treatment necessary for a long and healthy life.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-09-09", "title": "Proclamation 9489—World Suicide Prevention Day, 2016"}

On National Grandparents Day, we honor America's grandparents as the backbone of our communities, and acknowledge the progress they forged so that their children and grandchildren could live out their dreams.\nIn our grandmothers and grandfathers, we see a reflection of what is possible with hard work, grit, and determination. Their fight for inclusivity and opportunity for all can be seen in board rooms and courthouses across our country, and their efforts helped build the world's largest, most durable economy and strongest middle class. This enduring legacy spans generations and will empower innovators and leaders for years to come.\nSome grandparents sacrificed everything, leaving behind all they knew and loved to fight for freedom far from home, or to start a new life and give their families a chance at a brighter tomorrow in America. Millions of grandparents serve as primary caregivers, providing the discipline, guidance, and encouragement needed to thrive. And for so many Americans, our grandparents are our heroes, our confidantes, and our fiercest advocates. As connections to our past and inspirations for our future, grandparents made us who we are today and have paved a path we can aspire to follow.\nToday, we pause to reflect not only on the myriad ways our grandparents have enriched our lives with their selfless acts of compassion and kindness, but also on our responsibility to ensure they can retire as they deserve—with security and dignity. Let us recognize their lasting contributions to their families and communities, and let us express our gratitude for all they have made possible.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 11, 2016, as National Grandparents Day. I call upon all Americans to take the time to honor their own grandparents and those in their community.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-09-09", "title": "Proclamation 9490—National Grandparents Day, 2016"}

But the acts of terror of September 11, 2001, sought to do more than hurt our people and bring down buildings: They sought to break our spirit and destroy the enduring values that unite us as Americans. In the years that followed, our capacity to love and to hope has guided us forward as we worked to rebuild, more sound and resilient than ever before. With the hearts of those we lost held faithfully in our memories, we reaffirm the unwavering optimism and everlasting strength that brought us together in our darkest hour, and we resolve to give of ourselves in service to others in that same spirit.\nThe pain inflicted on our Nation on September 11 was felt by people of every race, background, and faith. Though many young Americans have grown up without knowing firsthand the horrors of that day, their lives have been shaped by it. They hear of the many acts of service that occurred—coworkers who led others to safety, passengers who stormed a cockpit, and first responders who charged directly into the fire. Many Americans did everything they could to help survivors, from volunteering their time to donating food, clothing, and blood. And many signed up to don our Nation's uniform to prove to the world that no act of terror could eclipse the strength or character of our country.\nUnited by a common creed, a commitment to lifting up our neighbors, and a belief that we are stronger when we stand by one another, we must find the courage to carry forward the legacy of those who stepped up in our time of need. By devoting ourselves to each other and recognizing that we are a part of something bigger than ourselves—just as heroic patriots did on September 11—we are paying tribute to their sacrifices. On this National Day of Service and Remembrance, we must ensure that darkness is no match for the light we shine by engaging in acts of service and charity. I invite all Americans to observe this day with compassionate and selfless deeds that embody the values that define our people, and to visit www.Serve.gov to find opportunities to give back to their communities.\nAmerica endures in the tenacity of our survivors, and in the dedication of those who keep us safe. Today, we honor all who lost their lives in the heartbreaking attacks of September 11, and all who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country in the years that followed. In memory of these beautiful souls, we vow to keep moving forward. Let us have confidence in the values that make us American, the liberties that make us a beacon to the world, and the unity we sustain every year on this anniversary. Above all, let us stand as strong as ever before and recognize that together, there is nothing we cannot overcome.\nBy a joint resolution approved December 18, 2001 (Public Law 107-89), the Congress has designated September 11 of each year as \"Patriot Day,\" and by Public Law 111-13, approved April 21, 2009, the Congress has requested the observance of September 11 as an annually recognized \"National Day of Service and Remembrance.\" Now, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim September 11, 2016, as Patriot Day and National Day of Service and Remembrance. I call upon all departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the United States to display the flag of the United States at half-staff on Patriot Day and National Day of Service and Remembrance in honor of the individuals who lost their lives on September 11, 2001. I invite the Governors of the United States and its Territories and interested organizations and individuals to join in this observance. I call upon the people of the United States to participate in community service in honor of those our Nation lost, to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities, including remembrance services, and to observe a moment of silence beginning at 8:46 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time to honor the innocent victims who perished as a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-09-09", "title": "Proclamation 9491—Patriot Day and National Day of Service and Remembrance, 2016"}

I regret saying 'half' – that was wrong. But let's be clear, what's really 'deplorable' is that Donald Trump hired a major advocate for the so-called 'alt-right' movement to run his campaign and that David Duke and other white supremacists see him as a champion of their values. It's deplorable that Trump has built his campaign largely on prejudice and paranoia and given a national platform to hateful views and voices, including by retweeting fringe bigots with a few dozen followers and spreading their message to 11 million people. It's deplorable that he's attacked a federal judge for his 'Mexican heritage,' bullied a Gold Star family because of their Muslim faith, and promoted the lie that our first black president is not a true American. So I won't stop calling out bigotry and racist rhetoric in this campaign. I also meant what I said last night about empathy, and the very real challenges we face as a country where so many people have been left out and left behind. As I said, many of Trump's supporters are hard-working Americans who just don't feel like the economy or our political system are working for them.

But it's Donald Trump - who just this week attacked America's generals and showered praise on Russia's authoritarian leader - running to be our next president. Trump has continued to hide behind fake excuses to avoid coming clean with the American people, thumbing his nose at a basic level of transparency practiced by every major party nominee since 1976. As prominent Republicans have speculated, Trump's returns could reveal further ties to Russia and its oligarchs, the truth about his personal wealth, or more lies about his charitable contributions. But we won't know until we see them. According to a recent poll, more than than six in 10 Republicans are now asking: what is Trump hiding?\"\nLast month, Tim Kaine released 10 years of tax returns. On the same day, Hillary Clinton released her 2015 personal tax return, building on the Clintons' tradition of making their returns public since 1977. You can view both Clinton and Kaine's returns here.\nConsidering Trump has released his taxes under audit before, and his actions help determine the speed at which the IRS can complete the audit, why won't Trump release his tax returns and what is he hiding? Here's a few theories:</span>\n1. Trump may not be worth the $10 billion that he claims\n2. Trump may pay little to no income tax\n3. Trump is deeply in debt and owes more than a hundred million to a foreign bank\n4. Trump wrongly undervalues his properties to local tax men\n5. Trump is making a \"flood of cash\" from running for president\n6. Trump is taking tax breaks he shouldn't\n7. Trump is hiding his lack of charitable donations\nHere's 5 FACTS we know about Trump's tax returns:\n1. In multiple years in which we know Trump's tax rate, he paid a rate of 0%\n2. Trump promised millions in charity, but reportedly gave less than $10,000 over a period of 7 years\n3. Trump has accepted a grant intended for small businesses affected by 9/11\n4. Trump has repeated accepted a tax break intended for middle-class people\n5. Trump might not even be undergoing an audit in the first place - and he refuses to present a letter from the IRS, sent to every individual who is audited, to prove it\nProminent Republicans question what Trump is hiding in his tax returns:\nGeorge Will: \"Perhaps one more reason why we're not seeing his tax returns is because he is deeply involved in dealing with Russian oligarchs.\"\nMitt Romney: \"Either he's not anywhere near as wealthy as he says he is\" or \"There's a bombshell in Donald Trump's taxes.\"\nMark Sanford: \"I Support You, Donald Trump. Now Release Your Tax Returns.\"Is there ANY way to make Trump release his tax returns? Last month, Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden and Senate Foreign Relations Committee Member Chris Murphy called for the Senate to vote on their bill, the Presidential Tax Transparency Act, to require presidential nominees to release their tax returns after their conventions.In the meantime, media, pundits, and Americans across the country continue to challenge Trump to release his tax returns.\nNew York Times: Letters to the Editor: \"Why Won't Trump Release His Taxes?\"\nWashington Post Editorial: \"Even Mike Pence appears to disagree with Trump on releasing tax returns\"\nHuffington Post: \"Even Donald Trump's Supporters Are Telling Him To Release His Tax Returns\"", "timestamp": "2016-09-10", "title": "Hillary for America Statement on Mike Pence Releasing His Tax Returns"}

The Twin Towers were reduced to rubble. The Pentagon was in flames. A Pennsylvania field burned with the wreckage of an airplane. And nearly 3,000 innocent lives were lost: sons and daughters, husbands and wives, neighbors and colleagues and friends. They were from all walks of life, all races and religions, all colors and creeds, from across America and around the world.\nThis weekend, we honor their memory once more. We stand with the survivors who still bear the scars of that day. We thank the first responders who risked everything to save others. And we salute a generation of Americans—our men and women in uniform, diplomats, and our intelligence, homeland security, and law enforcement professionals—who serve, and in some cases have given their lives, to help keep us safe.\nA lot has changed over these past 15 years. We've delivered devastating blows to the Al Qaida leaders that attacked us on 9/11. We delivered justice to Usama bin Laden. We've strengthened our homeland security. We've prevented attacks. We've saved lives.\nAt the same time, the terrorist threat has evolved, as we've seen so tragically from Boston to Chattanooga, from San Bernardino to Orlando. So in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and beyond, we'll stay relentless against terrorists like Al Qaida and ISIL. We will destroy them. And we'll keep doing everything in our power to protect our homeland.\nAs we reflect on these past 15 years, it's also important to remember what has not changed: the core values that define us as Americans, the resilience that sustains us. After all, terrorists will never be able to defeat the United States. Their only hope is to terrorize us into changing who we are or our way of life. That's why we Americans will never give in to fear. It's why this weekend we remember the true spirit of 9/11. We're still the America of heroes who ran into harm's way, of ordinary folks who took down the hijackers, of families who turned their pain into hope. We are still the America that looks out for one another, bound by our shared belief that I am my brother's keeper, I am my sister's keeper.\nIn the face of terrorism, how we respond matters. We cannot give in to those who would divide us. We can't react in ways that erode the fabric of our society. Because it's our diversity, our welcoming of all talents, our treating of everybody fairly—no matter their race, gender, ethnicity, or faith—that's part of what makes our country great. It's what makes us resilient. And if we stay true to those values, we'll uphold the legacy of those we've lost, and keep our Nation strong and free.\nGod bless you, and God bless the United States of America.", "timestamp": "2016-09-10", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}

We honor the courage of those who put themselves in harm's way to save people they never knew. We come together in prayer and in gratitude for the strength that has fortified us across these 15 years. And we renew the love and the faith that binds us together as one American family.\nFifteen years may seem like a long time, but for the families who lost a piece of their heart that day, I imagine it can seem like just yesterday. Perhaps it's the memory of a last kiss given to a spouse or the last goodbye to a mother or father, a sister or a brother. We wonder how their lives might have unfolded, how their dreams might have taken shape. And I am mindful that no words we offer or deeds we do can ever truly erase the pain of their absence.\nAnd yet you—the survivors and families of 9/11—your steadfast love and faithfulness has been an inspiration to me and to our entire country. Even as you've mourned, you've summoned the strength to carry on. In the names of those you've lost, you've started scholarships and volunteered in your communities and done your best to be a good neighbor and a good friend and a good citizen. And in your grief and grace, you have reminded us that together, there's nothing we Americans cannot overcome.\nThe question before us, as always, is, how do we preserve the legacy of those we lost? How do we live up to their example? And how do we keep their spirit alive in our own hearts?\nWell, we have seen the answer in a generation of Americans—our men and women in uniform, diplomats, intelligence, homeland security, and law enforcement professionals—all who have stepped forward to serve and who have risked and given their lives to help keep us safe. Thanks to their extraordinary service, we've dealt devastating blows to Al Qaida. We've delivered justice to Usama bin Laden. We've strengthened our homeland security. We've prevented attacks. We've saved lives. We resolve to continue doing everything in our power to protect this country that we love. And today we once again pay tribute to these patriots, both military and civilian, who serve in our name, including those far away from home in Afghanistan and Iraq.\nPerhaps most of all, we stay true to the spirit of this day by defending not only our country, but also our ideals. Fifteen years into this fight, the threat has evolved. With our stronger defenses, terrorists often attempt attacks on a smaller, but still deadly, scale. Hateful ideologies urge people in their own country to commit unspeakable violence. We've mourned the loss of innocents from Boston to San Bernardino to Orlando.\nGroups like Al Qaida, like ISIL, know that we will never be able—they will never be able to defeat a nation as great and as strong as America. So instead, they've tried to terrorize in the hopes that they can stoke enough fear that we turn on each other and that we change who we are or how we live. And that's why it is so important today that we reaffirm our character as a nation, a people drawn from every corner of the world, every color, every religion, every background, bound by a creed as old as our founding: e pluribus unum. Out of many, we are one. For we know that our diversity, our patchwork heritage, is not a weakness; it is still, and always will be, one of our greatest strengths. This is the America that was attacked that September morning. This is the America that we must remain true to.\nAcross our country today, Americans are coming together in service and remembrance. We run our fingers over the names in memorial benches here at the Pentagon. We walk the hallowed grounds of a Pennsylvania field. We look up at a gleaming tower that pierces the New York City skyline. But in the end, the most enduring memorial to those we lost is ensuring the America that we continue to be: that we stay true to ourselves; that we stay true to what's best in us; that we do not let others divide us.\nAs I mark this solemn day with you for the last time as President, I think of Americans whose stories I've been humbled to know these past 8 years, Americans who I believe embody the true spirit of 9/11.\nIt's the courage of Welles Crowther, just 24 years old, in the South Tower—the man in the red bandana who spent his final moments helping strangers to safety before the towers fell. It's the resilience of the firehouse on Eighth Avenue—patriots who lost more than a dozen men, but who still suit up every day as the \"Pride of Midtown.\" It's the love of a daughter—Payton Wall of New Jersey—whose father, in his last moments on the phone from the towers, told her, \"I will always be watching over you.\"\nIt's the resolve of those Navy SEALs who made sure justice was finally done, who served as we must live as a nation: getting each other's backs, looking out for each other, united, one mission, one team. It's the ultimate sacrifice of men and women who rest for eternity not far from here in gentle green hills, in perfect formation; Americans who gave their lives in faraway places so that we can be here today, strong and free and proud. It's all of us, every American who gets up each day, lives our lives, carries on, because as Americans, we do not give in to fear. We will preserve our freedoms and the way of life that makes us a beacon to the world.\nLet us not—\"let not steadfast love and faithfulness forsake you . . . write them on the tablet of your heart.\" And how we conduct ourselves as individuals and as a nation, we have the opportunity each and every day to live up to the sacrifice of those heroes that we lost. May God bless the memory of the loved ones here and across the country. They remain in our hearts today. May He watch over these faithful families and all who protect us.

It's been a little while since we've been in this setting. I was feeling nostalgic for it. I assume all of you were, too. (Laughter.)\nQ: Nice tie.\nMR. EARNEST: Thank you. Before we get started, I do have one piece of scheduling news here. On October 18th, President Obama will host Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy at the White House for an official visit. Prime Minister Renzi's visit will be an opportunity to recognize the depth and breadth of our relationship with Italy and exchange views on the future of Europe. Italy is one of our closets and strongest allies, and we cooperate across a range of shared interests, from addressing climate change and the global refugee crisis, to promoting global security and inclusive economic growth.\nThe President and Mrs. Obama will host Prime Minister Renzi and his wife, Mrs. Agnese Landini, for a state dinner on the evening of October 18th. So that's something to look forward to. But with that, we can go to your questions.\nKevin, do you want to start?\nQ: Sure, Josh. Thank you. I want to start out -- Senators McCain and Biden put out reams of medical records when they ran for President. Does the President think it's essential for voters to have more information about both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's health, given their age?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President believes that it's the responsibility of the two candidates to make their own decisions about their campaign. And what is true is that as President, President Obama every couple of years has asked his physician to put together a memo that we release to the public, detailing the President's health. We did something similar when then-Senator Obama ran for President, as well. And obviously the requirement that the American people have some understanding of the health of their President is I think a pretty common-sense proposition.\nBut for individual candidates, they ultimately have to make a decision on their own about what kind of information and what kind of detail about their health they're prepared to disclose.\nQ: So the President sees this as entirely the responsibility of the candidate? He doesn't view this as something that the American people should have, are entitled to have before they make a decision at the ballot box?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President's opinion on this I think can be judged based on the way that he has handled this question when he's been President. And he's arranged for his physician to communicate information to the American public about his health. So I think those are entirely legitimate questions, but how they're answered is something that the individual candidates have to decide for themselves.\nSo there's a reason that we've had a longstanding tradition in this country of individual candidates disclosing information about their health to the American public before the election. But I don't have any advice to dispense to the individual candidates about how they should handle this question. What I can do is point you to what Senator Obama did when he was running for this office and what President Obama has done while serving in this office.\nQ: Thank you. With the movie about Edward Snowden coming out, can you speak to whether the President would ever consider a pardon for Snowden before he leaves office? And earlier in his administration, the President said Snowden's leaks were damaging to the United States and damaging to our intelligence capabilities. Has his thinking about Snowden evolved over the last couple of years? Is it possible that he did perform a public service?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President has been asked this several times over the last couple of years, and I think the President has been pretty consistent in answering this question. The first is that Mr. Snowden has been charged with serious crimes, and it's the policy of the administration that Mr. Snowden should return to the United States and face those charges. He, of course, will be afforded due process, and there are mechanisms in our criminal justice system to ensure that he's treated fairly and consistent with the law. And that's what the President believes.\nWith regard to the impact that he has had on the broader debate, the fact is the manner in which Mr. Snowden chose to disclose this information damaged the United States, harmed our national security, and put the American people at greater risk. There are mechanisms that Mr. Snowden could have availed himself of, if he had concerns about information that he had access to, to communicate this information more responsibly and address some of the policy concerns that he purports to have.\nBut the impact of his actions, because of the way he chose to disclose this information, did harm our national security. The President said that on a number of occasions, and his assessment of that situation has not changed.\nQ: No pardon before he leaves office for Snowden?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not going to get into the President's thinking about anybody being considered for a pardon. Obviously there's a process that people can go through in requesting a pardon. But right now, Mr. Snowden has not been convicted of crimes with regard to this particular situation, but he's charged with various crimes. And it's the view of the administration and certainly the view of the President that he should return to the United States and face those charges, even as he enjoys the protection of due process and other rights that are afforded to American citizens who are charged with serious crimes.\nQ: And finally, could you just review the meeting with congressional leaders this afternoon? And in particular, the governor of Louisiana is asking for $2.8 billion in federal spending to help deal with the flooding in that state. Will that be part of any request that the President makes to the leaders?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, the meeting that the President has arranged for today is an opportunity for the President to sit down with the Democratic and Republican leaders of the House and Senate to discuss the rather long list of priorities that Congress needs to address. It's hard to rank them in priority order because so many of them are important. And the failure of Congress to act on some of these priorities would have significant negative consequences for the American people.\nSome of the items I'm referring to are the need for the United States Congress to pass a continuing resolution to prevent a government shutdown. It continues to be our view that the continuing resolution should be short and not freighted with the kind of ideological riders that have led to a government shutdown in the past, to put it bluntly.\nSo we're hopeful that Congress will act on that before the end of the month; that's the deadline they're facing. We've spent a lot of time talking in this room since February about the need for Congress to pass funding to fight the Zika virus. Our public health professionals continue to say that they need additional resources to do everything possible to protect the American people, and I just saw an op-ed in The Hill newspaper earlier today on behalf of governors all across the country, Democrats and Republicans, urging Congress to act to provide funding to fight the Zika virus.\nThere are other priorities, like the approval of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, criminal justice reform, given the consideration and confirmation of the President's nominee to the Supreme Court that are also top priorities. And these are priorities, each of them, where Congress has not fulfilled their responsibility to the American people. Each of these are areas where there should be some -- there is bipartisan common ground, but the Republicans who are in charge of running the Congress have refused to capitalize on it.\nWith regard to the situation in Louisiana, it's quite serious. Last month, there was a conversation about whether or not the President should interrupt his vacation to go and visit the people in Louisiana. And at the time, what I assured all of you was that the President was focused on doing his job and focusing on the fundamentals of the situation in Louisiana. And what we have seen there is an extraordinarily effective partnership between state and local officials and the federal government to ensure a professional response.\nSignificant federal resources have already been expended to try to meet the emergent, immediate needs of people affected by the flooding. More than 63,000 Louisiana families have received federal assistance through one or more of the housing options available to them, including rental assistance or paying for hotel or motel stays; $260 million in total payments to flood-insurance policy holders who have sustained damage or filed a claim. And the President recently -- just last week -- announced that the federal share of these expenses would increase to provide additional support to the state government, who is trying to meet the needs of all the people who have been affected by the flood.\nSo we've been focused on an effective federal response to this situation. The President also traveled to Louisiana a couple of weeks ago; had an opportunity to tour the damage, to visit one of the communities, one of the neighborhoods that had been so negatively affected by the flooding -- devastated, in fact. And the President had the opportunity to comfort some of the people who had lost so much.\nSo there's been a lot of attention on whether or not the administration is going to fulfill its responsibilities to the people of Louisiana who were affected by the flooding. We've done it. The President believes that there are additional resources -- he agrees with the assessment of the governor that additional resources are likely to be needed to help the people of Louisiana recover. And so I recognize there's a lot of moralizing about how the President should do his job. Well, he's done it. And so the question now is, are Republicans in Congress going to do their job? They just got back from an uninterrupted, seven-week vacation. Are they going to do right by the people of Louisiana? I think we're going to find out.\nAyesha.\nQ: Thank you. Following up on the meeting that's supposed to happen this afternoon, there's been some talk that Republican lawmakers might put forward a CR that would include funding for Zika -- $1.1 billion in funding for Zika, and it wouldn't have the Planned Parenthood riders that had caused some concerns, but it would pay for the funding with cuts to other programs. Is that something that the administration could get behind?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Ayesha, this falls in the category of the kinds of things that if it were just a couple of reasonable people like you and me sitting down across the table to figure out what we could do to meet the country's priorities, including fighting the Zika virus, it's something we could probably figure out in a couple of hours. That's not the situation that we have here.\nInstead, we've got Republicans in Congress who have capitalized on this opportunity to play politics. And it wasn't just riders related to funding for Planned Parenthood that we objected to; the irony, of course, is associated with the fact that the Zika virus is actually a sexually transmitted disease. So the fact that Republicans want to blunt funding for contraception is not just ironic, it's dumb. But we also saw that there were riders associated with limiting or constraining the EPA's regulatory authority, and even a rider associated with Confederate flags being displayed at certain federally run cemeteries across the country.\nSo Republicans have been playing politics with the Zika virus since before, frankly, most Americans had even heard of the Zika virus. The President put forward a specific funding proposal almost seven months ago now. This is a funding proposal that was developed by the nation's public health experts who itemized exactly what they believed was necessary to do everything possible to prevent the Zika virus from harming the American people. Congress has not acted on that funding request, and it's quite unfortunate.\nSo the President is, once again, going to make the case that that's exactly what Republicans in Congress should do. And again, I think it's an open question about whether or not they'll fulfill their responsibilities. Hopefully they will.\nQ: But would the White House be willing to support -- if you didn't have those additional riders, would the White House be willing to support $1.1 billion -- which is less than what you asked for -- and cuts to other programs to pay for that? Would the White House be willing to support that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, Ayesha, the American people would be fortunate to just have you and me negotiate this out, but unfortunately they're stuck with Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan being responsible for this. So hopefully they'll step up to the plate and do their job.\nQ: Also, the House passed a bill last week that would allow victims' families of 9/11 to sue countries over that. And this could be aimed at Saudi Arabia. I wondered, in the past the White House has said that they would veto this bill. Is that still a plan? Is the plan to veto this?\nMR. EARNEST: That is still the plan. The President does intend to veto this legislation. Let's talk about why. Currently, there is a process inside the executive branch of the United States government for designating certain countries as state sponsors of terrorism. There are a couple of countries that fit that category. And that's a very serious designation. It submits those countries to a whole set of -- list of limitations and restrictions that isolate them not just from the United States, but in many cases, the rest of the world.\nThere is an evidentiary threshold that has to be met before reaching that kind of legislation, but that designation, when it's reached, is something that's made public. The impact of this legislation could set up a situation where you have judges at a variety of levels, in a variety of courtrooms across the country, making a similar designation. You could have judges at different levels in different courtrooms, reaching different conclusions about the same country. That's not an effective, forceful way for us to respond to terrorism. A forceful way for us to respond to terrorism is to thoroughly investigate what role individual countries may have in supporting terrorism, and if we find compelling evidence that they are, to label them accordingly and to act accordingly. And that is what the President believes is the most forceful way for us to confront state sponsors of terrorism.\nThe other concern that we have also articulated is that this law actually opens up the United States to risk being hauled into court in countries around the world. The concept of sovereign immunity is one that protects the United States as much as any other country in the world, given the way the United States is engaged in the world. So it's not hard to imagine other countries using this law as an excuse to haul U.S. diplomats or U.S. servicemembers, or even U.S. companies into courts all around the world.\nSo the President feels quite strongly about this. And our concern is not limited to the impact it could have on a relationship with one country, but rather it could have an impact on our relationship with every country around the world in a way that has negative consequences for the United States, for our national security, and for our men and women in uniform.\nSo the President feels strongly about this, and I do anticipate that the President will veto the legislation when it's presented to him. It hasn't been presented to him yet.\nMary.\nQ: Thanks. Back to concerns about Hillary Clinton's health, does the President think that she should have disclosed her pneumonia diagnosis sooner? As he gets ready to go out and campaign for he tomorrow, does he have any concerns that her campaign's handling of this issue may turn some voters off?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I'm not sure that the -- I haven't heard the President weigh in with an opinion on this. I think it certainly does not impact his assessment that she is the best person in the country to succeed him in the Oval Office. And he has had an opportunity to work closely with her when she was Secretary of State. They traveled around the world. She pulled long hours. She bore a significant burden, both mentally and physically. And she didn't just succeed in that role, she thrived. And the interests of the United States were well represented as a result of it.\nAnd the President, as you've heard him say on many occasions, is confident that she'll bring those same skills and that same endurance to the job as President.\nQ: But when it comes to transparency, this administration prides itself on a certain level of transparency. Is there any concern about a lack of transparency that we may be seeing from the Clinton campaign? Does the President agree with his formal advisor, David Axelrod, who said that the Clinton campaign has an unhealthy penchant for privacy?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President has certainly not described that phenomenon to me. And you're right that this administration has prided itself and made transparency in government a genuine priority. And he believes the American people were well-served by that. He believes that our government is more effective because of the way that he has made that principle a genuine priority in this administration.\nOther candidates are going to have to make their own case about what they believe is the best way to run the country. And the President has taken a close look at the agenda and philosophy that's been put forward by Secretary Clinton. And he has enthusiastically endorsed it.\nSo I think the President's belief that she'd be an excellent President of the United States is something that you've heard him say many times. And I can tell you there's nothing that happened yesterday that has changed that assessment at all.\nApril.\nQ: Josh, a couple of questions. One, did the President call Hillary Clinton at all or call someone in her campaign after he found out that she was not well?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any calls the President has placed to Secretary Clinton. So, no, I'm not aware of any calls.\nQ: Is he planning on possibly -- would you be surprised, would it be something out of the blue, something unexpected, if he were to call her? Do you think he could call her?\nMR. EARNEST: If we have any telephone calls to read out to you, I'll make sure you're among the first to know.\nQ: Oh, thank you. So, also, I want to talk about health on the road. When President Obama and Hillary Clinton were running against one another, everyone kept talking about stamina. What does it take on the road? How grueling is the road? And is her tour schedule just as hectic as his was the first term and even the second -- well, the first run and the second run?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think I'd answer that question a couple of ways. Many of you have spent time on the road with these presidential candidates, and I think you can observe for yourself what kind of pace they're keeping. And based on the fact that you have to do these trips as well, and you're responsible for filing stories based on these events, you can assess just how demanding that pace is.\nIt's hard for me to draw a comparison between the schedule that the candidates are keeping now and the schedule that then-Senator Obama kept in 2008, primarily because I'm just not following the minute-by-minute of the schedule of the candidates in 2016 in the same way that I was in 2008.\nQ: Donald Trump is speaking in Baltimore right now, and he said something very interesting, saying something about the tolerance -- or values of tolerance when it comes to other communities, when he was talking about the Muslim communities. Is there something in this nation called the \"value of tolerance\"? Do we tolerate one another? Does the President see that from his unique perch? Does he see this nation -- different cultures, different communities -- tolerating one another?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, religious tolerance is a principle that was discussed quite extensively by our Founding Fathers.\nQ: But is that the right word now in 2016?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think there are a lot of ways to talk about this, about the way that we embrace diversity in this country and the way that the United States benefits from the variety of people and faiths and races and ethnicities that make up our country. The President has certainly given voice to the idea that that diversity makes our country stronger. The President genuinely believes that.\nI'll let the Republican candidate for President describe his own views of the impact that diversity has on the country.\nQ: And last question. You talked about priorities, the list of priorities that the President would go down today with leaders from the Hill. Is the funding, more funding for Flint, on the list of priorities? Because a couple weeks ago in Detroit, Jesse Jackson and a couple of Congressional Black Caucus members were saying not enough money was appropriated; they need billions of dollars, not just a --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, April, you'll recall that when this issue first emerged in the late winter and early spring, the administration mobilized resources to try to address the emergency situation inside of Flint. Some of that assistance took the form of expertise, putting scientists and public health professionals on the ground to try to assess the situation and offer advice to local leaders about how to ensure the safety of the water supply.\nThe administration expedited funding for infrastructure projects for the state of Michigan that could be deployed to address the situation in Flint. The administration put forward funding to expand medical care for young people in Flint who were at risk of lead poisoning.\nSo there are a lot of resources that have already been mobilized by the administration to try to address the situation in Flint. And the administration has indicated that we would support congressional action to offer additional assistance. It's clear that the problems in Flint are deeply entrenched. And the administration would certainly be supportive of an effort in Congress to offer additional assistance to the state of Michigan and to the community of Flint. But we'll just add it to the long list of things that Republicans in Congress have failed to make progress on.\nQ: And lastly, they say that Flint is not alone; there are more communities who have lead levels in their piping that's just as bad. So is there going to be any kind of conversation in the next couple weeks about this? Is there anything planned? Or even today -- I mean, you've said your hope is that Congress would assist with this, but what about the other cities that are having issues -- lead-level issues?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think it's -- I don't want to oversimplify the situation. I think each situation is unique. And the EPA, I think, has been quite conscientious in redoubling their effort to make sure that the water that Americans are drinking is safe. And that involves effective coordination with state and local officials who are responsible for providing water to their citizens, but the EPA has done a lot of work to try to clarify those relationships and to clarify the regulatory role that they'll play to ensure the safety of the water supply.\nSo there's a lot of important work that's been done over the course of this year because of some of the concerns that were initially raised around Flint.\nMichelle.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Now that we've seen a new memorable campaign phrase emerge, \"a basket of deplorables,\" and Republicans are now fundraising like crazy off of this, do you feel that that was a mistake on the part of Hillary Clinton, or a gaffe?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I'll let all of you armchair quarterback the campaign, to use a phrase. I guess it seems appropriate after week one of the NFL season.\nI think what is true more generally is that we have seen a disturbing tendency on the part of Republicans in Washington, D.C., to try to appeal to extremists for political support. And those appeals take a variety of forms. We've talked extensively about the cynical tactics around the Confederate flag, including attaching a Confederate flag rider to the Zika bill. As we've discussed in here many times, House Republicans elected a guy who described himself as \"David Duke without the baggage\" to be one of their leaders in Congress.\nWe've heard from Republicans, both a variety of presidential candidates -- not just one -- and some members of Congress talk about the benefits of imposing a religious test on people seeking to enter the United States to try to keep Muslims out.\nSo I think it's pretty well-documented that there has been a consistent willingness on the part of Republicans in Washington, D.C. to appeal to extremists to build political support. And it's distressing, but not new.\nQ: So it sounds like you don't disagree with her using that phrase.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I'm not going to -- again, I'm not going to armchair quarterback. I'll leave that to Jon Gruden and others.\nQ: But it's important in the sense that the President is heading out on the trail for her tomorrow. Does he feel like he needs to do some damage control for the way that the other side is jumping all over this?\nMR. EARNEST: No, he doesn't. I think you can look forward to the President making a strong, affirmative case about why he believes she would be an excellent President of the United States and why he is forcefully supporting her campaign.\nQ: But her campaign has already, and pretty soon after, expressed regret over that. Doesn't that necessitate some kind of -- I don't know if damage control is the right phrase to use.\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I'll leave it to them to make decisions about the most effective way to run their campaign. The President is going to be in a mode tomorrow where he's enthusiastically advocating for her election.\nQ: But if they're expressing regret for her using either the phrase or quantifying it, does the President share that regret? Does he not have to --\nMR. EARNEST: It's not the President's phrase. So, again, she can describe the situation however she would like. I think I've just given my own explanation and offered my own observation about the cynical tactics that we've seen Republicans employ. And again, these are -- it's not just limited to one candidate for President. This is true of a variety of candidates for Congress. It's true of sitting members of Congress. And again, it's a distressing temptation that Republicans have given into. And it's not good for the country.\nAnd, look, I'm not -- I guess this is the other thing I would say about this. There are plenty of Republicans who have expressed their own deep concern about this. There are a lot of -- you guys have made a living chronicling the disgust that some Republicans have offered about the state of their party. And that's just the state of play.\nQ: So in the last couple of days, we've seen her quantify her description of a portion of Donald Trump's supporters. Her campaign then expressed some kind of regret over it but defended it at the same time. And then we've seen her have an issue medically, and then her campaign says that she has pneumonia. Do you think that this is sloppy handling?\nMR. EARNEST: No. Again, I'll leave the armchair quarterbacking to all of you and to the variety of pundits that make a pretty good living this time of year, every four years. And I don't begrudge them on that, but that's their job and my job is different than that.\nQ: But the concern is, with it being such a close race and now we're seeing the polls tighten up in swing states, are you worried that this could hurt her?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, we're still a couple months from Election Day, and I know that the President is determined over the course of the next eight weeks or so here to make a forceful case in support of her campaign. He certainly believes that the stakes are high. He certainly believes that it's important that the next President of the United States be somebody who is committed to building on the progress that we've made over the last eight years. But you all have heard him make this case before, and you'll have an opportunity to hear him make it again tomorrow.\nJulie.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Going back to the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, obviously this debate has been going on for a long time and the President has expressed his opposition to the bill. And there was some discussion earlier this year that the White House was going to try to look for ways to address these issues short of what the post-legislation would have done. Did that ever happen? Or can you characterize any of the negotiations that went on in the run-up to this vote? Did the White House try to get Congress to back off of this and do something different?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think we've not made it a secret that we have significant concerns with this legislation. And there were a number of conversations that originated at the White House with members of Congress in both parties to try to persuade them to pursue a more constructive approach. But that's not what they chose to do.\nQ: Can you characterize what a more constructive approach would look like? I mean, short of just accepting the State Department's designation as it stands now and that whole process, was there alternative legislation that could have addressed the President's concerns and still addressed some of the sponsors' concerns?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, there were a variety of conversations. I'm not going to get into the details of those kinds of conversations, but I think there are -- the concerns that we've expressed are significant. And the concern that we have is that the way that this bill is currently written exposes the United States, U.S. diplomats, U.S. servicemembers, and in some situations, even U.S. companies to significant risk in courts all across the world. And that is a concern that we have expressed to members of Congress in both parties. In many cases, we had members of Congress who were sympathetic to our concerns, but I think those same members of Congress were concerned about the impact that this would have on their political standing, to oppose this bill.\nThere's no denying the political potency of this issue. But the President believes that it's important to look out for our country and to look out for our servicemembers, and look out for our diplomats. And allowing this bill to come into law would increase the risk that they face.\nQ: So obviously communicating those concerns didn't have the desired effect. And looking at the margins that this legislation passed by, it looks almost certain that they'll have the votes to override the President's veto. So is the White House doing anything to prepare for that -- I mean, given what you've talked about in terms of the great consequences of this legislation for foreign policy here?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I would anticipate that the President will continue to explain his opposition to this legislation, and we'll do that up until Congress ultimately makes a decision about whether or not to override his veto.\nQ: Do you think he thinks there's still a chance to change minds on the Hill?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we'll see. I think I've got a pretty persuasive case to make in terms of the forceful nature of a state sponsor of terror designation and the significant policy consequences that go along with that, and the restrictions that countries around the world face as a result of that designation. I think it makes a lot of sense that that's a more forceful way for us to confront state sponsors of terrorism as opposed to delegating that decision to judges in different courtrooms all across the country. And I think it's persuasive that we would want to protect the concept of sovereign immunity in a way that doesn't increase risk for our servicemembers or our diplomats, or even U.S. companies.\nSo we've got a forceful case to make -- and, yes, we'll continue to make it.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Did the President, by chance, see the video of Secretary Clinton getting into that van? And was he alarmed? And I ask that, that way, because if that were the President and he were sort of being helped into a van in that manner, I think the American people would rightly be alarmed.\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know whether or not he saw the video.\nQ: He's a pretty heavy consumer of media. I think it would be pretty shocking if he hadn't at least seen or heard it.\nMR. EARNEST: I certainly would not be surprised if he did, but I didn't talk to him about it.\nQ: Okay. Let me ask you about President Duterte's comments about removing American forces from the southern part of his country -- Special Forces. What's the White House reaction to that? Is that a surprise to you or the President?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, \"surprise\" is not the word I would choose, primarily because of the tendency of this individual to make some rather colorful comments. What is true about the U.S. military presence in the Philippines is that this presence has been in the Philippines for a number of years at the request of leaders of that country. It is an indication of the alliance between the United States and the Philippines. We've got a wide range of shared concerns and shared interests, and the United States and the Philippines have been able to work effectively together in a variety of areas to advance our mutual interests. And the President is certainly committed to continuing to do that over the four months that are remaining in his second term.\nQ: It seems odd, though, doesn't it? I mean, we were just there in November and everything seemed like it was moving along swimmingly and then --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, they had an election. And I think it's an indication of how important elections are. The Filipino people made a decision. And the Filipino people have enormous affection for the United States. There are deep cultural ties between our two countries, there are a lot of Filipino Americans here in the United States. When the Philippines was hit by a devastating cyclone, it was the United States who led an international response, mobilized millions of dollars -- tens of millions of dollars in resources to try to meet the basic humanitarian needs of the Filipino people.\nWhen the President was in the Philippines back in November, one of the things that he did while he was there was he went to a pier and visited a ship that had been provided by the United States to the Philippine coast guard to assist them in their maritime security efforts. That's indicative of the strong relationship between our two countries and the effective cooperation between our two countries.\nI think it explains why the Filipino people hold the United States and President Obama in such high regard. But yes, elections have consequences. And elections do say a lot about what kind of person is going to represent your country on the international stage. And it's why you're going to prize qualities like decorum and temperament and judgment in casting votes in elections, because you know that that person is going to represent you on the international stage. And I think that certainly is something that the Filipino people are well aware of right now.\nQ: Cautionary tale for the American voters -- is that what you're getting at?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess some people could draw that analogy if they chose to do so. (Laughter.)\nQ: Pretty much everybody in the room. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: You guys are a little in that mode right now. We're eight weeks before an election. So it's natural that you might interpret many of the things that I say through the prism of a national election.\nQ: Inescapably. Let me ask you about the Dakota pipeline project. I think it surprised some people that the administration would weigh in after a judicial review had taken place. And this is a pause, from what I understand. Can you explain why the President, and through the other agencies, decided that this was the right decision?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, this was a decision that was made by the Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of Interior. And you're right that a federal judge did rule and uphold the approach that they have taken to the decision to move forward with this specific project. So it really was based on their own judgment at the Department of Interior and the Army Corps of Engineers.\nQ: No request from here? No influence from --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, this is a decision that they made. I can't speak to the discussions that they may have had with the White House, but this is ultimately their decision. And they made this decision to ensure that the interest and concerns of everybody who was affected by the construction of this project were properly taken into account. And I'll let them speak to any concerns that they may have had that that may not have taken place before this construction went forward.\nLook, I think they're trying to do the right thing here in terms of making sure that everybody's interests are taken into consideration. And particularly when it's an infrastructure project this significant, you want to make sure that everybody's voice is heard. And that's what they're going to go to great lengths to do.\nQ: And last one, Syria. Can you give us an update on the negotiations and the apparent ceasefire? Have you gotten any word?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I know this is something that Secretary Kerry is likely to discuss a little bit later today. The arrangement that was announced at the end of last week is one that places a lot of pressure on Russia to deliver. The way that the arrangement is structured is that we'll need to see seven continuous days of reduced violence and unimpeded access for badly needed humanitarian relief, particularly in Aleppo, but not just in Aleppo, but in a number of besieged communities inside of Syria. And only after we have seen a sustained and continuous faithful implementation of those arrangements will the United States move forward on the element of this arrangement that we know Russia is quite interested in, and that is enhanced military cooperation with the United States, focused on al Qaeda and ISIL targets in Syria.\nBut, look, we've been talking for months, if not years, about how Russian credibility is on the line. And based on our collective experience here in observing the situation inside of Syria over the last year or two, I think we'd have some reasons to be skeptical that the Russians are able or are willing to implement the arrangement consistent with the way it's been described. But we'll see.\nThe reason that we have reached this arrangement in the first place is that we've prioritized going after ISIL, al Qaeda, and other extremists inside of Syria that could pose a threat to the United States. So if there's more that we can do to be more effective in that fight, then we'll pursue it. We've prioritized trying to bring an end to the violence and trying to bring humanitarian relief to innocent civilians inside of Syria that desperately need it. And we've said from the beginning that reducing the violence inside of Syria, at least between Assad regime forces and the opposition, is the only way we'll be able to create space for the kind of political transition that even the Russians acknowledge is necessary to address the root causes of the chaos inside of Syria.\nSo the arrangement as it's currently structured advances all of our goals, but I think Secretary Kerry would be the first to acknowledge that this arrangement is only going to succeed if the Russians live up to their end of the bargain, and that is at best an open question right now.\nRon.\nQ: Are you concerned at all by President Assad's comments this morning that his goal was to recover all of Syria? Or was that just talk?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it is true that we are much more focused on actions than talk. It is also true that the Russian government exercises at least some leverage over the Assad regime. And in the context of this arrangement, they have made a commitment to exercise that influence in a way that's consistent with the arrangement, which is essentially to say we're going to reduce the violence inside of Syria, we need the regime to stop attacking innocent civilians. And once we have gotten to a position where we are providing humanitarian relief for a sustained, consistent period of time, and once the United States and Russia have been able to effectively coordinate our military efforts against al Qaeda and ISIL and other extremists inside of Syria, then that also is going to involve the grounding of the Syrian government's air assets.\nQ: What about American influence over the opposition groups that the United States has been backing? Are you satisfied with the commitments that they have given? Because there were some public statements that all these groups have not agreed to the cessation either.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what we have seen is we have a seen a willingness on the part of most opposition groups to abide by a Cessation of Hostilities when they're not provoked by the regime. And the reason for that is these opposition groups represent the people who are being slaughtered by the government. These opposition groups are the ones that are clamoring for a political transition inside of Syria.\nSo a ceasefire, as we've described, is consistent with the interests of the opposition groups that we work with. So that's why we can have some confidence that they'll abide by the terms of the arrangement. The real open question is whether or not the Russian government is able to or is willing to exercise their influence over the Assad regime to get them to do the same thing.\nQ: On the Secretary Clinton matter, you said that the President hadn't seen this video and that he hadn't communicated with her directly by phone or reached out to her. But he's aware of this health issue?\nMR. EARNEST: The President has read the news in the last 24 hours. And I didn't say that he hadn't seen the video, I just don't know whether or not he's seen the video. But as I guess I said to Michelle, there's nothing that's happened in the last 24 hours that's caused him to reassess in any way his enthusiastic support and his confidence that she'd be an excellent President.\nQ: Just so I understand the relationship, though, has the White House reached out to Secretary Clinton in any way -- to anyone -- to offer support, to offer concern, to offer best wishes?\nMR. EARNEST: I guess I'd say I think you're sort of putting your finger on the difficulty that I'm going to have in answering your question. I'm not really sure -- I mean, I can't rule out all conversations, but it's not clear to me what they would say vis-а-vis yesterday's news.\nQ: But wishes -- \"feel better soon,\" \"get back to work soon.\"\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm sure that those warm feelings are extended all the time.\nQ: Vice President Biden in Charlotte said something about she's recovering well and her health is great. He hasn't talked to her. He was just, I guess, speculating about that?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know whether or not Vice President Biden has spoken to Secretary Clinton or spoken to somebody else on her team, but you can check with his team on that.\nQ: And just lastly, on this event tomorrow, is it safe to say that there's some concern that the President has about his voters, voters who helped put him over the top in the two previous elections, really turning out enthusiastically for Secretary Clinton? I mean, that's in part why he's going to Philadelphia.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what is clear is that the President does have a lot of influence over a large number of voters that haven't previously been regularly engaged in politics; that the key to President Obama's success from the very first contest, the Iowa caucuses in January 3rd, 2008, was to motivate and turn out people who hadn't regularly participated in the past.\nAnd you did see the surge in participation in the caucuses, and that was a hallmark of President Obama's victories throughout the primary process in 2008, but that also was critical to his success in the general election in 2008 and in his reelection in 2012, that in particular young people have been genuinely inspired by his candidacy and by his presidency. And the President will make a forceful case to those voters in the same way that he will to all voters about how important it is for him to be succeeded by somebody who's committed to the same kind of vision for the country that he's been fighting for, for the last eight years.\nQ: So was it correct that he's targeting places where voter registration is wrapping up and early voting is about to start? Is that a conscious part of the strategy?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think when it comes to the strategy you can talk to the campaign, but I know that they have indicated that they expect to use the President in that way. They've said that they're hoping that the President will be helpful in making the case on their behalf to motivate voters to register -- to get registered and to participate on Election Day.\nByron.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. While we're discussing transparency concerning health, in 2002 and in again in 2007, George W. Bush handed power briefly to the Vice President while under sedation for routine tests. Has the President in his seven years in office ever had a medical procedure of any kind where he was sedated? And even if the answer is no, would it be the White House's policy to invoke the 25th Amendment in that situation?\nMR. EARNEST: Byron, I'll check on this answer for you, but my understanding is that there's never been a situation in which the President has undergone a medical procedure that required him to delegate any authority to the Vice President, or anybody else for that matter.\nQ: I know you said you didn't want to tell other candidates what they should or should not disclose, but you also said there was a longstanding tradition in this country to be transparent about health information. Have the two current candidates lived up to that tradition?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, you guys are the ones that are offering the assessments of the candidates and critiquing their campaigns and offering your advice, and doing the armchair quarterbacking thing, and there are plenty of people out there who are willing to do that. I'm going to focus on my day job.\nQ: One more. Another issue yesterday was the lack of a protective pool around Secretary Clinton, and I know from experience that the White House works very closely making sure that journalists have access to the President whenever he leaves a secure location. Is it time for the candidates who aim to replace the President to do the same, especially given the sort of health scare yesterday that was recorded not by the press but by a bystander?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think this falls in the same category, that I'm going to let the individual campaigns manage their own relationships with the press corps who covers them. But speaking for the President, I can indicate that the President does believe that the protective pool is something that's important for reporters who are covering the President of the United States. And it's not always convenient for him. Yesterday was actually a pretty good example. The President decided to go on a hike with his daughter in Great Falls yesterday. Most Americans, when they see the weather is nice, they can just decide to head out the front door and go spend some time with their kids, but the President has to make different arrangements -- not just for security, but also to make sure that all of you can travel with him.\nSo the President is committed to this process, even when it's not particularly convenient for him. And that's certainly something that previous Presidents have done, and we'll see what the next President chooses to do.\nOlivier.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. A couple on the 9/11 bill. You're talking about a straight veto? You're not talking about some clever variation on a pocket veto, right? You're going to send it back to Congress. He's not just going to sit on it until January 20th?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not sure that's an available option. I'm not a -- I guess if it were an available option we might take it. (Laughter.) But I'm not sure that it is. The President intends to veto this legislation and for reasons that I've walked through. And we'll see what Congress chooses to do from there.\nQ: I don't expect you to volunteer many names here, but how many members of Congress told you they didn't like this bill and voted for it anyway?\nMR. EARNEST: I'll let individual members of Congress --\nQ: Disclose what -- he's leading the constituents?\nMR. EARNEST: I'll let them search their conscience and describe their own position on this bill.\nQ: Last one. The guidance for today's congressional meeting includes a reference to reading out his trip to Asia. Apart from the obvious, which is TPP, are there action items, are there things he wants Congress to do related to Asia policy -- whether it's new North Korea sanctions or something else? Is there an ask today? Does he want Congress to take some steps that are directly related to this trip?\nMR. EARNEST: I think that reference was essentially an allusion to two things. The first is the Trans-Pacific Partnership. And the President did hear quite extensively from leaders across Asia about how important it is for U.S. credibility for the United States Congress to ratify the Trans-Pacific Partnership. There are important questions about how the United States will continue to compete in an international economy if we aren't engaged in the region that's home to some of the most dynamic economies in the world.\nThere are also some strategic questions that are raised. We know that China is looking to expand their influence in this region of the world. The United States of course welcomes a rising China, but it seems unwise, to put it mildly, for our strategic interests for the United States not to compete there too, particularly given the significant interests that we've already established there. So the President discussed that a lot with leaders over the course of his trip.\nThe second thing that the President -- that we were referring to in that phrase is that the President had an opportunity to consult with a number of our allies and partners on the trip, some of them from Asia and some of them not. The President had bilateral meetings with President Erdogan, Prime Minister May, and then obviously President Xi and President Putin and President Park. I'm sure I'm forgetting some. Prime Minister Modi.\nAnyway, the President had a number of conversations with world leaders, and he's interested in making sure that leaders in Congress understand the kinds of issues that were discussed in those settings.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, on the 9/11 lawsuit bill, is there any White House outreach to 9/11 families, explaining why the President is going to veto this bill that they place so much importance on?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I haven't had the opportunity yet I think to reflect on something that the President discussed in his remarks yesterday. The President has found the families of those who lost loved ones on 9/11 to be a source of inspiration. They're an inspiration to him and to people all across the country for the kind of resilience that they have shown in the face of this unimaginable loss.\nSo there's no effort to diminish the sacrifice that they have made or the pain that they have endured, or the heroism that they've displayed over the last 15 years. And I think there are a variety of ways to illustrate that, particularly when it comes to the President's own activities.\nThe President made clear that bringing Osama bin Laden to justice was going to be a top foreign policy and national security priority. And he made good on it. He was willing to assume significant risk -- certainly not as much risk as our men and women in uniform who carried out that mission. But he was willing to stake the future of this presidency on it. That is how strongly the President felt about looking out for America's national security interests and getting justice for the thousands of Americans who were killed on that dark day 15 years ago.\nThe President also has been an aggressive advocate of the 9/11 First Responders Bill that would guarantee that individuals who worked at Ground Zero were going to get their health care needs taken care of. These were individuals who worked around the clock and performed heroically to help our nation recover. They deserve leaders in Congress and in the U.S. government who have their back. And President Obama has every single time.\nThis administration requested the declassification and the release of the so-called 28 pages. That goes back to the President's commitment to transparency and also trying to provide the American people greater insight into what happened on 9/11 and what may have contributed to it. So the President's commitment to fighting for the kinds of values that the 9/11 families represent I think has been well documented.\nAs it relates to specific conversations, I'm sure there are some conversations that have been had. I don't know of any meetings or any presidential-level conversations. But I think it's fair for you to assume that the administration has certainly made our case to individuals who see the impact of this legislation differently.\nQ: But President Obama must realize that he is going to disappoint, if not anger, a lot of 9/11 families with his veto.\nMR. EARNEST: I think that's possible. But again, I think the President's words and deeds when it comes to standing up for the interests of 9/11 families speak for themselves, including prioritizing bringing Osama bin Laden to justice, fighting for the 9/11 First Responders Bill, fighting for the declassification of the 28 pages, and using the opportunity on the anniversary of 9/11 every year to talk about the 9/11 families and the source of inspiration that they continue to be for him and for people all across the country.\nQ: And one related issue. Can you say why the President's moment of silence yesterday was private in the Oval Office and not on the South Lawn like it usually is?\nMR. EARNEST: The reason for that is that yesterday was a Sunday, and my colleagues and I here at the White House are extraordinarily hardworking, but there aren't too many of us here before 9:00 a.m. on a Sunday. So rather than have the President stand either by himself or with a small number of people on the South Lawn, he just observed that moment of silence in private, and then spoke publicly about the day.\nToluse.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. I wanted to ask you about the Ex-Im Bank. Right now there's no quorum. There's a bit of a logjam there on larger loans being sent out. And I know the White House wants language to be put in the CR that would sort of allow you to get around the logjam. I'm wondering how much are you going to push that in the meeting -- or you are going to push that in the meeting this afternoon, and how much are you going to push for that to get into the CR so that these loans that are larger than $10 billion will be able to go through the Ex-Im?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't know that there's going to be a lot of detailed negotiating that goes on in the Oval Office. Maybe there will be. But we're still at the relatively early stage here of ensuring that the government doesn't shut down.\nI think the principle that you're singling out is an important one. And again, as a result of Republican dysfunction, even Republican nominees to the Ex-Im Bank are being bollixed up in Congress for no good reason. And it's impairing the ability of the federal government to do important work that would have a positive economic benefit for the country.\nSo it's a rather obscure example, but a relevant one in terms of Leader McConnell not making good on his promise to get Congress moving again.\nQ: I just want to ask you about Syria. You all are working with the Russians at this point, or planning to work on the Russians, to target -- and that's something that the Russians called for when they first started sort of flying into Syria a year ago. And the White House, as Lavrov said in his statement, the White House was cool to that idea. What has changed? And sort of do you regret not being more open to working with the Russians a year ago, considering there's been so much carnage over the last 12 months?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Toluse, a couple of things. The first is that the United States has not begun coordinating with the Russians on military actions against ISIL and Nusra. Before any of that cooperation begins, we need to see Russia make good on the commitments they've made in the context of this arrangement to prevail upon the Assad regime to observe the Cessation of Hostilities. And by reinvigorating the Cessation of Hostilities, we can reduce the violence, increase the flow of humanitarian assistance, and provide space for political negotiations.\nRussia has been unwilling to do that thus far. There was a brief period in February and March where there was a Cessation of Hostilities that did, largely, prevent violence in some of the most hotly contested areas of that country. But that Cessation of Hostilities was short-lived. After several weeks, it began to fray. And it's only worsened over that period of time.\nBut we should just be clear about why that happened. That happened because the Assad regime didn't live up to the commitments that they made in the context of that Cessation of Hostilities. They continued to provoke and attack opposition forces and, in some cases, innocent civilians. And that wasn't some kind of secret strategy that was employed by the Assad regime; they were pretty bold about announcing that they were going to go and bomb hospitals, targeting civilians, until they could get some of these groups to surrender.\nSetting the immorality of that approach aside, it's an indication that the Russians were either unable or unwilling to use their influence with the Assad regime to get them to live up to the Cessation of Hostilities. For reasons that I guess you'd have to ask the Russians, they now are making a renewed commitment to doing so. I suspect that part of it stems from their concern about getting sucked into this conflict over the long term -- something that the United States warned of since we saw this military intervention by Russia last year. I suspect that some of this stems from ramped-up concerns about extremist activity in Syria on the part of al Qaeda in Syria. I think some of it stems from a Russian desire to enhance their international reputation by being able to say that they're working with the Americans.\nSo the dynamics in this relationship I think are quite clear. But being able to move forward here is entirely contingent on Russian credibility, and we'll need to see them deliver before they get the kind of cooperation that they'd like to see.\nPam.\nQ: Josh, the President has suggested that there could be new sanctions on North Korea, following their latest nuclear test. What new sanctions could be possible? And would they have any impact, given that North Korea has continued to test nuclear tests and ballistic missile tests and seems to be now scoffing at the idea of more sanctions?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, this is actually something, Pam, that the United Nations Security Council is considering, even as we speak. I know that there was a statement from the Security Council over the weekend that indicated that they were going to consider additional economic sanctions that could be imposed against North Korea for their continued and flagrant violations of a variety of Security Council resolutions.\nFor a statement like that to come forward, it has to have unanimous agreement of the Security Council. And I think that's an indication of how unified the international community is in prioritizing the situation in North Korea, in being alarmed about the situation in North Korea, and in considering additional steps to isolate the North Korean government even further. So there's some important work to be done at the United Nations, and the United States will be supportive of that process.\nThe other thing I'd point out is that, on Thursday, the President did a news conference in Laos prior to this most recent nuclear test in North Korea, and the President talked about how, while we have been pleased with the constructive contribution that the Chinese have made to applying pressure on the North Koreans, the President believes there's more that they could do. And there have been a number of conversations, including between President Obama and President Xi, about the need to continue to make dealing with this situation a priority.\nQ: So there are no, like, separate U.S. sanctions that might be considered?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I certainly wouldn't rule out an announcement like that, but those kinds of sanctions are not the kind of sanctions that we talk about publically because doing so would only tip our hand and allow those who were the target of the sanctions to make arrangements to try to avoid them before we were even able to implement them in the first place.\nSo if there are more sanctions like that that are put forward, then we'll certainly announce them publicly and explain to you the rationale for why they were imposed. But we won't do that until a final policy decision has been made about them.\nQ: And just one more. What is the level of concern about North Korea developing ballistic missiles that could have a nuclear weapon on it reaching the United States?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, you've heard experts in the U.S. government indicate their continuing concern with the way that North Korea's missile program and their nuclear program has advanced. In part, that is why the United States has taken steps at the direction of the Commander-in-Chief to enhance our anti-ballistic-missile capabilities in the Asia Pacific.\nThe United States has deployed additional naval assets in the Pacific, including Aegis systems that can be used to defend the United States against ballistic missiles. There's technology that's been deployed to Japan to better track those missiles and enhance our ability to defend the United States and our allies against them. There are THAAD -- there's a THAAD battery that's been deployed to Guam. And, as you know, the United States and South Korea recently agreed to deploy an additional THAAD battery in South Korea -- all of which is oriented against the threat from North Korea.\nAnd I think it's an indication that President Obama takes the threat seriously and is committed to taking the prudent steps that are required to protect the American people and our allies.\nSarah.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Shortly before the briefing, the White House made the decision to let the pool have access to the President's meeting with Congress today. Can you give us a little insight into the thinking behind that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think primarily the idea was the President was interested in having a meeting with the congressional leaders, and there was a discussion about the most effective way to convey to all of you exactly what had happened in the context of that meeting. And so the original plan had been to do a written readout, and we decided to let at least a small subset of you hear directly from the President himself about the discussion that he had with congressional leaders.\nQ: And so not to -- Toluse was very earnest today -- but not to channel cynical --\nMR. EARNEST: I always appreciate that. (Laughter.)\nQ: -- it didn't have anything to do with the likelihood of questions about protecting pools and transparency and that sort of thing?\nMR. EARNEST: No, it did not.\nQ: And one more on these lines. You wrote an op-ed to the New York Times, a letter to the editor, not too long ago where you said, \"President Obama's government transparency effort is not even noted by The Times media columnist, then why would future presidential candidates make it a priority?\" Is there any evidence that transparency has practical or political benefits beyond getting cheers from the press corps?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think that's the point of the letter that I tried to write. In a different point, I made clear that the only real constituency for transparency in government is all of you. And that's a good thing. That's an important role that all of you play in our democracy. American voters, I think, largely -- almost all of them -- are considering a range of other factors when they walk into the ballot -- when they walk into the voting booth.\nSo that's why it's important for all of you to play the role that you do. And it is why our approach to transparency is one in which we would never expect for anybody who's sitting in those chairs to say that we've done enough. It's your responsibility to constantly push for more. And all of you have lived up faithfully to that responsibility. So, thank you. (Laughter.)\nThe point of the letter, though, was that I expressed my opinion that that kind of advocacy is more effective and more credible when you give us credit in those instances when we do it right. And Mr. Rutenberg, whom I respect greatly -- I think that he's an excellent journalist and obviously somebody who brings a wide range of experience to the job that he has now -- overlooked that fact in the column that he wrote a couple of weeks ago. And that's what prompted me sending that letter.\nAnd the truth is, I expressed that concern to him privately after reading his column, and he acknowledged that that was a fair point and encouraged me to make it publicly. So I give him credit for a willingness to engage on that. I don't want to leave you with the impression that he agreed entirely with the point that I was making, but I think that he believed it to be a credible one. And that was the -- anyway, that's the backstory on how the letter to the editor appeared.\nQ: I guess I'm saying, is the incident with Secretary Clinton over the weekend, is that maybe evidence of a political benefit to being more transparent?\nMR. EARNEST: I see. Well, look, I think that's hard to assess. Part of the argument that President Obama was making in 2008, when he was making the case for greater transparency in government, is that there were instances where the Bush administration had not been. And President Obama was very interested in making a forceful and clear case about the different approach to governing the country that he would pursue than his predecessor did.\nSo I think from that standpoint, his ability to talk about transparency was an effective way for him to illustrate some of the differences with the Bush administration. But I think my point is that transparency in its own right is not something that a lot of voters are going to consider. And that's okay. There are a lot of other things for them to consider that are entirely legitimate -- for example, the economic plans that are put forward by the individual candidates, the competence that the candidates bring to the job, the values that the candidates bring to the job, the ability of the candidates to represent the United States on the international stage, the experience that the candidates bring to the job. Those are all entirely reasonable criteria for voters to consider. Not a lot of them are prioritizing this question of transparency. And I know this is something that all of you, both professionally and personally, believe is important. And that means that you play an important role in our democracy in holding whoever is in the Oval Office accountable to the American people and for being transparent with the American people.\nBut again, I guess the point that I'm trying to make here -- that's a little meandering, I acknowledge -- (laughter) -- I chalk that up to, it's still like 3:00 a.m. in Laos right now. But the point that I'm trying to make here is there are a variety of ways to evaluate transparency. And again, I think this is a point that all of you make with some persuasive power on a regular basis -- that it doesn't just apply to the every-other-year report that you get from the President's physician, for example. It also applies to access to the President when he's meeting with congressional leaders. It also applies to the records related to the individuals who visit the President at the White House.\nSo it applies to tax returns, something that just about every presidential candidate in both parties has provided in the context of running for this office. It certainly applies to the financial disclosures that sitting Presidents file.\nSo there are a variety of ways to draw that assessment, and it's not just whether or not a candidate included the press corps in their motorcade on one movement.\nLet's just do a couple more. Cheryl?\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Quick policy one. Back on the CR. Senator Cruz is looking to add a rider.\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't heard his name in here in a while. (Laughter.)\nQ: Looking to add a rider to the CR. I know that's rare. It would prohibit the Commerce Department from giving up some of its oversight on Internet domain names. And I'm wondering if that would be a big problem for this White House.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think it may be a bigger problem for Republicans if Senator Cruz considers a maneuver like the one that he employed back in 2013.\nSo again, I haven't seen the specific proposal from Senator Cruz, and knowing him, he's not particularly concerned with the details. But the fact of the matter is that there is a long-established transition that's scheduled to take place that would essentially transfer responsibility of establishing Internet domain names outside of the hands of government and into the hands of a non-governmental organization.\nNow, I know what you're thinking. You might think that somebody who is an ardent champion of smaller government and getting the government out of the hands -- or out of the business of the American people would praise such an effort. So it might lead you to conclude that Senator Cruz is interested in something other than the merits of this specific proposal.\nBut Internet experts, scientists, business leaders, technology experts all agree that this is the most effective approach and the right thing for the long-term security and wellbeing of the Internet.\nSo that's the approach that we're intending to pursue. We'll see what kind of tricks Senator Cruz has up his sleeve.\nGregory, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Has the President been examined by a physician for any reason since the last report we got in February?\nMR. EARNEST: Well -- for any reason? I think that's --\nQ: I'm excluding meetings with physicians to talk about health care policy. (Laughter.) Has he been examined by a physician?\nMR. EARNEST: Right. Look, I don't think that we're going to set a standard where we going to read out every conversation the President has with his doctor. And I don't think that's --\nQ: The standard you articulated earlier in this briefing was that the American people have a right to know the health status of the person who occupies this office.\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah.\nQ: Has there been any material change to his health? Any complaints, any ailments that we should know about?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look -- I mean, all of you have been in situations where you've seen him coughing at a news conference or having a cold. But, no, I'm certainly not aware of any material change in the President's overall health. And I don't think the standard that people expect is that every time the President talks to his doctor that we're going to read out the conversation to all of you.\nQ: Fair enough. But apparently the standard is that we have to ask whether the (inaudible) has pneumonia before we find out.\nMR. EARNEST: No, I'm not suggesting that that's the standard. I think the standard is that you'd get a memo like this from the President's doctor that I think is pretty detailed in terms of listing his body mass index, his resting heart rate, his blood pressure -- you know, a whole bunch of other things that give you an indication of the health of the President of the United States.\nAnd I think it's fair to assume that if there were a significant change in any of this, that we would either tell you of you'd be able to tell. But I don't we're going to set a standard where every time the President talks to his doctor that we're going to read out the conversation.\nQ: There's no material change in the President's health since that report in February?\nMR. EARNEST: Certainly not one that I'm aware of. I'm not a doctor and I'm not prepared to play one on TV either. But no, I'm not aware of any material change to the President's health since the last update you received from his physician, which was just back in March, so not that long ago.\nAll right?

Miller, R-FL, and 29 cosponsors)\nThe Administration is committed to ensuring that the Nation's veterans have access to the care, services, and benefits that they have earned. Over the past seven years, the President has maintained a steadfast commitment to serving veterans and their families. More veterans are now receiving health care through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) than ever before, and VA is delivering more benefits to more veterans in a timely and efficient manner. The Administration is working to end veteran homelessness in cities and states across the country, and has reduced veteran homelessness by nearly half. Under the leadership of the First Lady and Dr. Biden, through their Joining Forces initiative, the Administration has called on all Americans to rally around service members, veterans, and their families to support them through wellness, education, and employment opportunities. And Secretary McDonald has initiated the most sweeping organizational transformation in the history of VA, ensuring that the agency is keeping veterans' best interests at the center of everything it does.\nH.R. 5620 includes a provision that would enable another essential reform that would build on this record of progress. By fundamentally restructuring the current process by which veterans can appeal their initial benefits claims decisions, this legislation would ensure that veterans receive the benefits they have earned and are not subject to years of endless waiting and duplicative process. The current appeals process – built up over 80 years of overlapping laws and regulations – is broken and is failing both veterans and taxpayers. Today, more than 450,000 appeals are pending at some point in the process, with veterans waiting an average of at least 3 years for a decision. Moreover, the problem is only going to get worse if the system is not fundamentally reformed. VA projects that, under the current process, the number of pending appeals will soar to more than 2.17 million by the end of 2027, which will require a significant increase in resources to address and result in veterans continuing to wait for an appeals decision for years.\nIn response to this critical problem, the Administration, with the support of major veteran advocacy groups, put forward a comprehensive appeals reform proposal that would fix this system. The essential feature of this new approach is to step away from a unified appeals process that tries to do many unrelated things inside a single process and replace that with differentiated lanes, which give veterans clear options after receiving an initial decision on a claim. And it would allow all veterans to have a clear answer and path forward on their appeal within one year from filing. H.R. 5620 adopts this comprehensive reform proposal, and the Administration strongly supports this provision.\nHowever, the Administration is deeply concerned that H.R. 5620 contains numerous provisions that would undermine VA's workforce and could ultimately hinder the ability of the over 330,000 dedicated civil servants at VA to effectively serve veterans. The Administration is strongly committed to strict accountability standards that ensure VA employees act with the best interests of veterans in mind, and instances of misconduct or poor performance in carrying out these duties cannot be tolerated. But the Administration believes that the approach to accountability in the legislation – focused primarily on firing or demoting employees without appropriate or meaningful procedural protections – is misguided and burdensome. This approach significantly alters and diminishes important rights and protections that are available to the vast majority of other employees across the government and which are essential to safeguarding employees' rights and the merit system. Furthermore, the legislation allows for the broad recoupment of awards earned by VA employees, and prevents VA from rewarding its high-performing senior executives. These provisions will make it more difficult for VA to attract the top talent that is needed to serve veterans, limit the rights of VA employees and senior executives, and set back the work done by VA to rebuild veterans' trust.\nIn addition, many of the provisions in the legislation raise constitutional concerns. Most significantly, certain provisions compress the time period within which VA employees would receive notice and an opportunity to be heard on charges against them before the Secretary of VA may take disciplinary action, including removal, and provide an expedited appeal process in which the disciplinary action would be automatically affirmed if the reviewing agency failed to rule within a certain number of days. We would welcome the opportunity to work with the Congress to address these due process concerns and other potential constitutional concerns raised by the bill.\nThe Administration encourages the Congress to ensure that accountability actions support, rather than impede, the ability of VA to carry out its duties, and looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress to address these and other important issues on behalf of the Nation's veterans and their families.", "timestamp": "2016-09-12", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 5620 – VA Accountability First and Appeals Modernization Act of 2016"}

You are Democrats, Independents and Republicans.\nAbove all else, you are Americans – and you are entitled to leadership that honors you, cherishes you and defends you.\nEvery American is entitled to be treated with dignity and respect in our country.\nWhether you vote for me, or whether you vote for someone else, I will be your champion in the White House.\nHillary Clinton represents only the insiders, the donors and the special interests.\nI will be speaking more about Hillary Clinton's disqualifying remarks in a minute, but first let me invite onto the stage some people who can tell you themselves what they think of her spiteful comments.\nI have some more thoughts on Clinton's remarks I will be sharing momentarily, but first I want to tell you what I am going to do to make your life better.\nWe've outlined a detailed plan on trade, on immigration, on rebuilding the military, on changing our foreign policy.\nI've delivered a plan on defeating Islamic terrorism, on reforming our tax code, on unleashing American energy, and on providing school choice to every disadvantaged child in America.\nWe've released policy after policy, solution after solution.\nEvery day, we are putting forward new ideas to make your life better.\nThe change will start right away, the moment I take my oath of office.\nOn my first day, we are going to immediately terminate every single unconstitutional executive order signed by President Obama.\nThen, I am going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight\nyears. All needless, job-killing regulations will be cancelled. Millions of new jobs will come pouring in.\nWe are going to lift the restriction on American energy – this will create another half a million new jobs a year.\nThat's just the beginning.\nOn my first day in office, I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare – this will instantly save another 2 million jobs.\nI am also going to propose a massive tax reduction to unleash prosperity in every city and state in our country.\nOn that first day, I am also going to instruct the Department of Commerce to immediately begin a review of all foreign trade practices that unfairly hurt American manufacturing. I will use every lawful Presidential power to achieve relief for our workers.\nYou can read the full 7-point trade plan on my website, DonaldJTrump.com.\nNorth Carolina has lost more than 4 in 10 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA. Bill Clinton signed it, and Hillary Clinton supported it.\nRight here in Ashville, you've lost 1 in 5 manufacturing jobs since China joined the World Trade Organization – another Hillary-backed deal.\nHillary Clinton owes all of you an apology. And I think you'll get that apology right around the same time Hillary Clinton hands over the 33,000 emails she deleted.\nBy the way, Hillary Clinton destroyed her emails after she received a congressional subpoena. They used a special software called bleach bit.\nShe even made her 13 different phones disappear – some of them were even destroyed with a hammer.\nHillary Clinton obviously had a whole lot to hide, including her pay-for-play scandals at Secretary of State.\nPay-for-play with UBS, with Russian Uranium, with contracts for her friends and family\nin Haiti.\nNothing is so dangerous to American Democracy as when a public official puts their federal office up for sale.\nHillary Clinton believes she is above the law.\nShe also believes that she is above all of you.\nAfter months of hiding from the press, Hillary Clinton came out and finally told the world how she feels about the people of this country.\nShe said tens of millions of patriotic Americans belong in a \"basket of deplorables.\" She talks about people like they're objects, not human beings.\nShe said half of our supporters are not even real Americans, and describes the other half as having run out of options – what she can't understand or accept is that the great majority of this country now sees right through the lies and deceptions of a failed political establishment. They want change, they want justice, and they want a government that puts the American people first.\nWhether our supporters have lost a job to a factory moved to another country, or whether they're a captain in the police department, or a teacher at a local school, they are united by their deep and sophisticated understanding of how our political system has abandoned the people.\nFor those who have been hit by hard times, they understand better than anyone that it's Hillary Clinton's Wall Street agenda that has crushed the middle class of this country.\nHillary Clinton spoke with hatred in her heart for these working class Americans. She looks down on them – she looks down on all the people who make her life possible. She looks down on the carpenters, plumbers, electricians, lawyers and accountants. She looks down on the police officers, soldiers, and firefighters supporting our campaign.\nShe looks down on the people who cook her meals, drive her cars, and dig the coal that powers her electricity.\nShe called these Americans every name in the book – racist, sexist, xenophobic, Islamophobic – she said they were not even American.\nNever in history has a major-party presidential candidate so viciously demonized the American voter.\nShe was attacking millions of moms and dads who love their children and want a better future for all Americans.\nWhat should these parents tell their children about Hillary Clinton's attacks?\nTo every kid in America tonight, I want you to know: your parents are working so hard to make your life better, and to make your country better – and if I get the chance, I will fight right alongside them to deliver a better future for everyone.\nClinton made her remarks at a high-dollar fundraiser in Wall Street. Her goal is simple: to bully the American voter out of voting for change.\nThe people who rigged the system want to keep things exactly as they are. They want to keep our terrible trade deals. They want to trap children in failing government schools. They want massive regulation to keep small businesses from being able to compete.\nHillary Clinton can never be President of this country. No one who has such a low opinion of the American people can ever be elected as their President.\nEarlier today I had a chance to spend some time with some more of our most amazing Americans.\nI spent the afternoon with the National Guard Association of the United States.\nThese are the heroes who rescue our people in disasters, and who fight our wars.\nThese heroes are a permanent testament to the courage and character of our nation.\nWe also honor and remember the lives of the service members who have made the ultimate sacrifice.\nThere is no greater love than the love shown by the men and women who have laid down their lives for this country and its people.\nOur debt to them is eternal and everlasting.\nOne thing that we must do is to ensure that our men and women in uniform have the best equipment, resources and tools in the world.\nWe must provide them the best medical care while they serve, and the best medical care when they return home to civilian life.\nThe Veterans scandals that have occurred under this Administration – and that have been dismissed by my opponent – are a permanent stain on this government. It's just one more way Hillary Clinton only looks out for herself.\nWe must take care of our Veterans. That includes giving Veterans the right to choose treatment at either a public VA facility, or the private doctor of their choice.\nJust today we learned that the VA has violated a federal law by failing to make its\nperformance records available to consumers.\nThe scandals never seem to end – but they will, when I'm elected President.\nNothing makes me more proud than to have the support of the men and women who hear the uniform.\nWe've received endorsements from 120 generals and admirals, these are the people who know how to keep our country safe.\nJust today, I was profoundly humbled to gain the endorsement of 13 Medal of Honor recipients. I can't even begin to say how much it means to me to have the support of these intrepid heroes.\nAlso, today, I was thrilled to announce that Ambassador R. James Woolsey, former head of the CIA, is now a senior advisor to our campaign.\nWe are on a mission of change.\nThat includes a new agenda for our inner cities.\nThe Democratic Party has run the inner cities for fifty, sixty, seventy years and more.\n4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty, including 45% of those under the age of six.\n2,900 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.\nFor those suffering and hurting, I say: give Donald J. Trump a chance. I will fix it. What do you have to lose?\nLet me also tell you what you have to gain: millions of new jobs, higher wages, and amazing schools.\nI will fight for Detroit, for Chicago, for Baltimore, and for every neglected part of this nation – and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\nIt is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a New American Future.\nIn this future, we will respect the dignity of all Americans – and that means great jobs, great schools, and great neighborhoods.\nWe will keep our children safe – which includes steadfast support for American law enforcement.\nJobs will return, prosperity will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.\nGovernment corruption will end.\nHonesty will be restored.\nRepublicans are the Party of Abraham Lincoln and, come November 8th, we will once again have a government of, by and for the people.\nWe will make America prosperous again.\nWe will make America safe again.\nAnd will Make America great again.\nThank you, and God Bless!", "timestamp": "2016-09-12", "title": "Remarks at the US Cellular Center in Asheville, North Carolina"}

Let me extend my special gratitude to General Ashenhurst and General Hargett, and to each and every one of you.\nThe National Guard of the United States has defended this nation at war, kept our citizens safe at home, and rushed into danger wherever it has threatened our people.\nOur debt to you is eternal.\nYesterday was the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. The National Guard was sent to assist in the aid and recovery efforts at Ground Zero in New York City.\nSince 9/11, there have been 780,000 members of the National Guard deployed overseas – including those with multiple deployments. Right now, 10,000 members of the National Guard are in Iraq, Afghanistan, and many other countries across the world.\nMembers of the National Guard come from all walks of life, work in every kind of job imaginable, and juggle a thousand different challenges as they raise their kids, serve their states, and answer the call of duty for their country.\nIf I am given the honor to serve as your President, I will pledge to give you the resources, the equipment, and the support you need and deserve.\nYou will have a true and loyal friend in the White House.\nWhether you vote for me, or whether you vote for someone else, I will be your greatest champion. I will not let you down.\nI am running to be a President for all Americans – and I've been especially humbled to have the support of so many of our men and women in uniform.\nAll across this country, I've met so many incredible members of both our military and law enforcement community. There's nothing I've enjoyed more than the time I've spent with our service members, police officers, and also our firefighters and paramedics.\nThey embody the goodness and decency of our country.\nI was thus deeply shocked and alarmed this Friday to hear my opponent attack, slander, smear and demean these wonderful, amazing people who are supporting our campaign.\nOur support comes from every part of America, and every walk of life. We have the support of cops and soldiers, carpenters and welders, the young and the old, and millions of working class families who just want a better future.\nThese were the people Hillary Clinton so viciously demonized. These were among the countless Americans that Hillary Clinton called deplorable, irredeemable and un-American. She called these patriotic men and women every vile name in the book – she called them racist, sexist, xenophobic, and Islamaphobic.\nShe called them a \"basket of deplorables\" in both a speech and an interview. She divides people into baskets as though they were objects, not human beings.\nHillary Clinton made these comments at one of her high-dollar fundraisers in Wall Street.\nShe and her wealthy donors all had a good laugh. They were laughing at the very people who pave the roads she drives on, paint the buildings she speaks in, and keep the lights on in her auditorium.\nHillary Clinton is an insider, supported by powerful insiders, attacking Americans who have no political power.\nHillary Clinton spoke with hatred and derision for the people who make this country run.\nShe spoke with contempt for the people who thanklessly follow the rules, pay their taxes, and scratch out a living for their families.\nWhile Hillary Clinton lives a sequestered life behind gates and walls and guards, she mocks and demeans hardworking Americans who only want their own families to enjoy a fraction of the security enjoyed by our politicians.\nAfter months of hiding from the press, Hillary Clinton has revealed her true thoughts.\nShe revealed herself to be a person who looks down on the proud citizens of our country as subjects for her to rule over.\nHer comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as Secretary of State, hide and delete her emails, put classified information in the reach of our enemies, lie to Congress, and sell government favors and access through her Foundation.\nIt's the same attitude that explains why Hillary Clinton refuses to take accountability for the deadly disasters she helped to create in Iraq, in Syria and in Libya.\nTo this day, she still won't take accountability for her role in unleashing ISIS across the Middle East – or for putting Iran on the path to a nuclear weapon.\nHillary Clinton believes she is above the law, that she is above accountability, and that she is above each and every one of you.\nOur campaign is about giving voice to the voiceless. It's about representing the forgotten men and women of this country.\nI'm here to represent everyone, but especially those who are struggling against injustice and unfairness.\nI am running so that the powerful can no longer beat up on the powerless. I'm running to take on the special interests, the big donors, and the corrupt political insiders.\nI am running to be your voice.\nHillary Clinton is a voice for Wall Street, for hedge fund managers, for the top tenth of the one percent. Just look at the people funding Hillary Clinton's campaign, and paying for her speeches, and you'll know who she represents.\nThe disdain that Hillary Clinton expressed towards millions of decent Americans disqualifies her from public service.\nYou cannot run for President if you have such contempt in your heart for the American voter. You can't lead this nation if you have such a low opinion of its citizens.\nHillary Clinton still hasn't apologized to those she slandered. In fact, she hasn't backed down at all – she's doubled-down on her campaign of conspiracy and contempt.\nIf Hillary Clinton will not retract her comments in full, then I don't see how she can credibly campaign.\nLet's be clear. These were not offhand comments from Hillary Clinton. These were not stray remarks in an interview, or an accidental choice of words. These were lengthy, planned, and prepared remarks – it was perhaps the most explicit attack on the American voter ever spoken by a major-party presidential nominee.\nClinton was using a very deliberate page from the Democratic Playbook – smearing someone with one of those names in order to scare them out of voting for change. She just took it to a whole new level by applying it to tens of millions of people.\nShe used these vile words in order to bully and intimidate honest citizens out of seeking government reform.\nPeople who want their immigration laws enforced, and their borders secured, are not racists. They are patriotic Americans of all backgrounds who want their jobs and families protected.\nPeople who warn about Radical Islamic Terrorism are not Islamophobes. They are decent American citizens who want to uphold our tolerant values and keep our country safe.\nPeople who support the police, and who want crime reduced, are not prejudiced. They are concerned and loving citizens whose hearts break every time an innocent child is lost to preventable violence.\nHillary Clinton doesn't have to worry about Sanctuary Cities, or jobs moving overseas. She's protected from her own policies.\nThe policies of Hillary Clinton have produced failing schools, shrinking incomes, and the tragic poverty and joblessness in our inner cities.\nOur campaign is dedicated to changing these policies to make life better for all Americans.\nWe are the campaign of school choice.\nWe are the campaign dedicated to improving economic conditions for every African-American and Hispanic worker.\nWe are the campaign that will deliver a government of, by and for the people.\nThis change agenda includes a new foreign and military policy.\nWe are going to put the failed policies of the past behind us.\nWe will empower our generals to do the job they were hired to do – and that begins with defeating and destroying ISIS.\nInstead of endless wars, we want a real plan for victory.\nWe will abandon the policy of reckless regime change favored by my opponent, and we will instead work with our allies to advance the core national security interests of the United States.\nMy plan calls for a major rebuilding of the entire military, and the elimination of the defense sequester. In this rebuilding, we will provide our National Guard with the best, modern state-of-the-art equipment in the world.\nThe National Guard is often the first and the last line of defense for our people.\nYou are there when the hurricanes and floods and tornadoes strike.\nYou are there to protect civilians in times of unrest.\nYou are there to respond to every natural disaster.\nYou deserve a government that recognizes and honors your contribution, and that ensures you have the resources you need to get the job done.\nIn a Trump Administration, the National Guard will always have a direct line to the Oval Office.\nYou will have an Administration that never loses sight of the vital contribution you make each and every day.\nYou will have a President who supports, promotes and speaks up for the National Guard at every turn.\nThe members of the National Guard have sacrificed life and limb for our freedom, our safety and our country.\nWe will never forget our heroes, their families, and the ones they've left behind.\nOur gratitude is everlasting.\nWe will protect those who protect us.\nAnd we will follow your example of unity – working in common purpose and common cause.\nWe will be one people, under one God, saluting one American flag.\nWe will rebuild our military – and our country.\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\nThank you, and God Bless you all.", "timestamp": "2016-09-12", "title": "Address to the National Guard Association of the United States 138th General Conference & Exhibition at the Baltimore Convention Center in Baltimore, Maryland"}

This second annual White House Summit on Next Generation High Schools builds on progress made during the first summit held in November 2015, which generated $375 million in private and public sector commitments to rethink the high school experience.\nPresident Obama announced his Next Generation High School proposal in his  2013 State of the Union address to redesign the high school experience so that it is rigorous and more engaging and relevant to today's students. Today's Next Generation High Schools are better engaging students by providing stronger connections to the educational needs and interests of individual students; opening new opportunities to personalize and tailor academic content and wrap-around student supports; challenging students with rigorous courses, including in new economy subjects such as computer science; using innovative approaches and strategies to restructure the scope and time spent learning; and employing innovative educational technologies, project-based learning, and competency-based progressions to engage and empower learners. Ultimately, the strategies reflected in America's Next Generation High Schools will equip today's youth with the strong content knowledge, collaboration opportunities, and critical skills needed to meet the demands of an innovation economy, while preparing them to embark upon a lifetime of learning.\nThe commitments states, school districts and the private sector are making at the Summit to Next Generation High Schools underscore growing momentum from across the country. In addition to these efforts, the U.S. Department of Education is announcing new resources to help communities that want to create Next Generation High Schools.\nKey New Federal Resources to Advance Next Generation High Schools\nThe White House and the U.S. Department of Education are announcing federal resources that will help more states and districts create and scale Next Generation High Schools in their communities. These resources include:\n•      Progress Update on Commitments to Scale Next Generation High Schools: Building on the progress of the first annual White House Summit on Next Generation High Schools last November, the White House is releasing a  progress report detailing key metrics of success from the commitments that were made at the first Summit.\n•      Issue Brief - Results from National Survey on High School Strategies Designed to Help At-Risk Students Graduate – Early Warning Systems: The U.S. Department of Education is releasing the first of 13 briefs that provide descriptive information on the prevalence and characteristics of strategies designed to help at-risk students graduate from high school. The Department's first brief on Early Warning Systems is being released today, with other briefs coming out this fall.\n•      Using Evidence to Create Next Generation High Schools: The U.S. Department of Education is releasing a new resource that highlights six evidence-based strategies to improve America's high schools for the next generation The six general evidence-based strategies in this document can be used to create Next Generation High Schools that improve important student outcomes, such as high school completion and readiness for college and careers.\n•      Next Generation High Schools - Guide to Federal Resources: Later this fall, the U.S. Department of Education will release a guide for states and districts to available funding streams that may be leveraged to promote the development, enhancement, and continuity of Next Generation High Schools. The guide will provide state and local stakeholders with innovative examples of how to utilize their existing funds or new funding streams to promote Next Generation High Schools.\nActions by States to Redesign the High School Experience\nEducation leaders from six states will join the Summit to underscore their commitment to advancing Next Generation High Schools, share best practices and announce new progress towards increasing student access to redesigned high schools. Their commitments include:\n•      The New Hampshire Department of Education, in conjunction with the Buck Institute, is announcing a professional learning community as part of ongoing efforts to support the state's lowest performing schools. The community will provide embedded professional development, leadership, and technical assistance to schools engaged in implementing project-based learning and is estimated to reach 22,292 students.\n•      The Ohio Department of Education is committing to rethink high schools according to many of the Next Generation principles and to focus on helping students successfully transition from high school to college and career. Combined, initiatives that are being undertaken could impact over 100,000 students across the state.\n•      The Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) is committed to expanding scalable opportunities throughout the state that promote and incorporate the principles of Next Generation High Schools. The combined impact of their efforts has the potential to benefit more than 300,000 students across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\n•      The Rhode Island Department of Education is undertaking efforts to create Next Generation High Schools that better prepare their students for postsecondary success by increasing access to rigorous coursework, dual enrollment and innovative school models. This fall, three P-TECH high schools will open in Rhode Island and Rhode Island plans to open two P-TECH high schools in the fall 2017. These five schools will serve more than 1,400 students when fully enrolled.\n•      The Virginia State Board of Education is reforming graduation requirements to change the structure and operation of high schools to encourage high schools to be more rigorous and more innovative in how they educate students. Those requirements will go into effect with the entering freshmen class of 2018 -- impacting about 100,000 students.\n•      The Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction (WDPI) and Milwaukee Public Schools (MPS) will work together to scale innovative practices in active learning that promote postsecondary and career readiness, specifically focusing their efforts in three to five of the lowest performing high schools in MPS.\nContinued Private Sector Commitment to Next Generation High Schools\nBuilding on the commitments made during the last summit, additional resources are also being announced by non-profit and private sector organizations to continue to support Next Generation High Schools, including:\n•      A Roadmap to Evidence based practice for Improving Low Graduation Rate High School: Today, the Everyone Graduates Center at John's Hopkins University is releasing a roadmap that provides a high level synthesis of what is known and what has been learned about the reforms low graduation rate high schools typically require and what evidence indicates works.\n•      Announcing the Next Generation of Super Schools: On September 14, 2016, XQ: the Super School Project is committing to announce at least five winning teams to become America's first cohort of Super Schools. The Super Schools Project, which was announced as a commitment to action as a part of the President's My Brother's Keeper initiative, will allow all communities to build on what works, because every child deserves an equal opportunity to get an effective education.\n•      Building Capacity for Redesign at the Local Level: The Alliance for Excellent Education is working to help connect the numerous high school redesign efforts currently underway across the nation through both traditional communications means and a digital network infrastructure. Further, the Alliance is creating toolkits for education leaders designed to support next-generation high schools including implementation around the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). The first tool kits are being released in conjunction with the second annual White House Summit on Next-Generation High Schools.\n•      Funders' Collaborative for Innovative Measurement Building a Repository of Measures Next Gen Competencies: In 2015, the Funders' Collaborative for Innovative Measurement (FCIM) was formed. Among other projects, FCIM is supporting the creation and curation of a repository of existing measures of 21st century competencies, like collaboration and perseverance, which will help the field to understand what skills and dispositions currently can and cannot be measured at scale. With seed funding in early 2016 from the Hewlett Foundation, the RAND Corporation has pilot-tested and now developed the basic architecture for such a repository; FCIM is currently working on a number of ways to generate the support to complete this important initiative.\n•      Supporting Socioemotional Learning: The Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence and Facebook are announcing an expanded version of inspirED, an online resource center and community that focuses on creating pathways for high school students and educators to work together to create more positive emotional climates in their schools. This October, they will host a Summit that will bring together teens, educators, school administrators, and researchers to share best practices, tackle challenges, and celebrate schools that are working together to create more positive school climates and greater well-being for students and educators.\nFor further information about actions being undertaken by more than 20 school districts across the country, the private sector and additional details on commitments being made by the six states as part of the Summit, click  HERE.", "timestamp": "2016-09-12", "title": "Fact Sheet: White House Announces New Resources at Second Annual Summit on Next Generation High Schools"}

As all of you know, I visited Louisiana, where obviously a lot of folks are still suffering the cleanup process there. And there are also significant other areas of the country that are suffering from everything from wildfires to the situation in Flint, which is still unresolved. So we discussed strategies where we might be able to make a difference there.\nWe had an opportunity to talk about some initiatives that had been moving forward in a bipartisan basis that have not yet been fully resolved, but where we still have a chance to make a difference, like criminal justice reform. And we—I also gave everybody here a briefing on my travels through Asia and some of the strategic issues that are posed there.\nSo my hope is, is that we can make some modest progress in areas where we agree and we've been working together. After the election, I am even more hopeful that we can get some things done. But I want to thank everybody for coming here, and my hope is that by the time Congress adjourns before the election that we will have an agreement in place to fund the Government and that our Zika funding will be taken care of.\nSo thank you very much.", "timestamp": "2016-09-12", "title": "Remarks Following a Meeting With Congressional Leaders"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "This memorandum was published in the  Federal Register  on September 20.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118959", "text": "Presidential Determination No. 2016-10\nMemorandum for the Secretary of State\nSubject: Presidential Determination on Major Drug Transit or Major Illicit Drug Producing Countries for Fiscal Year 2017\nPursuant to section 706(1) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107-228) (FRAA), I hereby identify the following countries as major drug transit and/or major illicit drug producing countries: Afghanistan, The Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Burma, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela.\nA country's presence on the foregoing Major Drug Transit and Major Illicit Drug Producing Countries List is not a reflection of its government's counternarcotics efforts or level of cooperation with the United States. Consistent with the statutory definition of a major drug transit or drug producing country set forth in section 481(e)(2) and (5) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (FAA), the reason major drug transit or illicit drug producing countries are placed on the list is the combination of geographic, commercial, and economic factors that allow drugs to transit or be produced, even if a government has carried out the most assiduous narcotics control law enforcement measures.\nPursuant to section 706(2)(A) of the FRAA, I hereby designate Bolivia, Burma, and Venezuela as countries that have failed demonstrably during the previous 12 months to adhere to their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements and take the measures set forth in section 489(a)(1) of the FAA. Included in this report are justifications for the determinations on Bolivia, Burma, and Venezuela, as required by section 706(2)(B). Explanations for these decisions are published with this determination.\nI have also determined, in accordance with provisions of section 706(3)(A) of the FRAA, that support for programs to aid Burma and Venezuela is vital to the national interests of the United States.\nIn addition to emphasizing the importance of international cooperation, this determination highlights a number of recent developments concerning various aspects associated with the worldwide drug problem.\nGrowing Consensus on International Narcotics\nThere is a growing international consensus that counternarcotics programs must be designed and implemented with the aim of improving the health and safety of individuals while preventing and reducing violence and other harmful consequences to communities.\nIn concert with international partners, the United States is expanding its domestic and international funding for drug treatment and recovery support programs based on empirical scientific evidence that shows that substance use disorders are medical conditions and must be treated as such. To achieve greater balance, U.S. drug policy also includes stepped-up promotion of effective alternative development programs for farmers and others who agree to stop illegal drug cultivation and associated activities. Such efforts also focus on advancing the rule of law through improving and strengthening civil and law enforcement institutions. United States polices support overall citizen security, including deepening worldwide adherence to fundamental human rights guaranteed by international law.\nThis consensus was demonstrated at the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on the World Drug Problem (UNGASS) held on April 19-21, 2016, in New York. The meeting served as the first high-level, global gathering on counternarcotics in a generation, and its resulting outcome document forged international consensus behind a balanced and pragmatic approach to drug control. A central theme of UNGASS was to further develop and implement strategies based on the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) 2009 Political Declaration and Action Plan aimed at reducing drug production, trafficking, and use from the standpoint of effective public health practices. UNGASS participants, including the United States, also highlighted the importance of substantive advancement of the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which for the first time in history incorporates rule of law objectives into global development policy.\nUNGASS further underscored the broad consensus among United Nations member states with regard to many major drug control themes. At the special session, member states demonstrated their common cause to reinforce efforts to counter drug cultivation, production, distribution, and use through pragmatic approaches that balance both law enforcement and public health perspectives. As stated by the UN International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), we have a \"common obligation to employ effective drug abuse prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation of our citizens.\" Participants also reaffirmed their ongoing commitment to the 1961, 1971, and 1988 UN conventions on drugs as the essential backdrop for worldwide drug control efforts. These conventions leave sufficient room for individual states to pursue drug policies that are in accord with their own laws and national realities.\nThe foreign policy approaches to drug control of the United States are explained in detail in the U.S. National Drug Control Strategy, and our policies and programs are designed to help reach the goals established at UNGASS and work effectively with partners around the world. They include, for example, on going bilateral cooperation and collaborative work through numerous regional and sub-regional multilateral organizations such as the Organization of American States; the European Union; regional affiliates of the global Financial Action Task Force; the Economic Community of West African States; the Association of Southeast Asian Nations; and many others. The United States also joins other nations in supporting the important, positive contributions of many nongovernmental organizations in the academic and private sectors that work on improving counternarcotics policies and programs.\nGrowing Challenges of Heroin Use, Adulterants, and Opium Poppy Cultivation\nAccording to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the use of heroin and other opium poppy derivatives is the greatest worldwide drug problem today. Heroin is also the greatest drug threat in the United States, according to the 2015 U.S. National Drug Threat Assessment published by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. Especially dangerous is the increasing adulteration of heroin with synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, leading to an increase in the number of deaths as the result of drug overdoses. In 2014, the Centers for Disease Control reported that approximately 10,500 Americans died from heroin-related overdoses; the true number likely is higher given inconsistent testing across the States. Opium poppy cultivation is expanding beyond Afghanistan, Burma, and Laos the traditional primary producing countries in the world. While Afghanistan is still the major supplier of opium derivatives to Europe and Canada, nearly all opium derivatives found in the United States are primarily grown in or trafficked through Mexico or by Mexican-based drug trafficking organizations. In Mexico, for example, international officials estimate that the number of hectares of heroin poppy under cultivation increased from 11,000 hectares in 2013 to as much as 28,000 hectares in 2015. Limited poppy cultivation also has been detected in Colombia and Guatemala.\nAccording to UNODC, 201,000 hectares of opium poppy were cultivated in Afghanistan in 2015, a 5 percent decline from 2014. Comparative data shows, however, that while cultivation and yields declined relative to previous years, cultivation is still at historically high levels.\nThe 2016 U.S. International Narcotics Control Strategy indicates that insurgent groups in Afghanistan generate significant revenue by taxing drugs passing through regions they control. Afghan government drug control efforts are hampered by broad security challenges associated with intensive, long-term conflict and combat. The U.S. Government continues to support a broad range of multilateral and bilateral drug control programs in Afghanistan.\nAlthough many treatment and recovery facilities established in Afghanistan show great promise, the 2015 Afghanistan National Drug Use Survey conducted by the Department of State and the Afghan Ministry of Health Institutional Review Board found an 11 percent drug positive rate in Afghanistan. Use of heroin and other opium poppy products, according to international analysis, is also significant in Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan. The INCB is also concerned about the increasing use of Afghan sourced heroin throughout the Middle East.\nHeroin in the United States is being increasingly adulterated with low-cost synthetic opioids, especially fentanyl. Research has shown that fentanyl and its analogues can be 25 to 50 times more potent than heroin. According to U.S. law enforcement, most illicit fentanyl, precursors, and fentanyl analogues that have been identified in the United States originate in China and enter the country via Mexico, Canada, or direct mail. The United States has taken a number of steps to address this issue. The United States is working with Mexico and Canada to develop bilateral and multilateral approaches to combating opioid production and trafficking, particularly heroin and fentanyl. Law enforcement cooperation with Mexico includes programs to strengthen Mexico's capacity to identify, investigate, interdict and dismantle clandestine drug laboratories and disrupt trafficking networks. The United States conducts regular and positive discussions with China to enhance controls on many chemicals used to make fentanyl and other synthetic drugs. In a welcome development in late 2015, China placed controls on 116 substances including a dangerous analogue to fentanyl, acetyl fentanyl. Much work remains to be done in this area, and developing compatible, consistent, enforceable international standards is crucial to successfully controlling this growing drug threat.\nCocaine and Coca Cultivation\nAlthough international and U.S. surveys indicate overall production of coca leaf for cocaine has remained stable from a decade ago, Colombia has seen a 42 percent increase in illegal coca crop cultivation from 2014 to 2015. Colombia remains the major provider of cocaine available in the United States, though data shows that cocaine use is declining in the United States and in Europe. Nevertheless, U.S. rates of overdose involving cocaine were up in 2014.\nIncreased Colombian coca cultivation can be attributed to a number of factors, including Colombia's decision to end the aerial coca eradication program in October 2015 throughout the country. Even prior to the end of spray eradication, coca growers began to implement \"counter\" eradication techniques, such as by migrating their plantings to areas where spray was not permitted by law or policy. Illegal coca cultivators also began to cultivate smaller, better concealed fields to avoid detection by law enforcement. Colombia has reformulated its counternarcotics strategy to prioritize robust law enforcement activity against criminal drug trafficking organizations, including enhanced interdiction, over that of crop eradication. In 2015, the country seized 295 metric tons of cocaine along with other illegal drugs.\nTo reach the United States, cocaine is primarily trafficked by land, air, and sea via Central America, Mexico, and the Caribbean. Over the past decade, roughly 97 percent of U.S. bound cocaine is smuggled out of South America on noncommercial maritime conveyances. Smaller amounts are smuggled via commercial maritime vessels and noncommercial aircraft. Using similar conveyances, cocaine destined for Europe is often routed through Brazil, Bolivia, and Venezuela, as well as via West Africa.\nNumerous large shipping containers have been interdicted on Atlantic routes, sometimes with a first stop in Portuguese speaking countries in Africa. Using these routes reduces language barriers before the drugs are smuggled to their final destination. A variety of U.S. assistance programs, especially those designed to enhance national interdiction capabilities and target kingpin traffickers, are carried out in Africa.\nUnited States assistance programs are designed to disrupt the flow of cocaine and other harmful products to the United States by building the capacity of judicial, law enforcement, and treatment institutions in partner countries. For example, in Central America these programs are carried out through the Central America Regional Security Initiative, while those in the Caribbean are conducted through the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative. The Merida Initiative provides the framework for assistance and bilateral cooperation with Mexico. Key activities of these programs include drug interdiction cooperation, especially maritime-based efforts in Central America and the Caribbean; law enforcement capacity building; anticorruption initiatives and support; and enhanced prosecution and judicial reform strengthening efforts.\nLooking to the Future\nFuture action by the international community to address drug cultivation, production, trafficking, and use should be closely tied to the important priorities described in the 2016 UNGASS outcome document. These include, for example, utilization of sound scientific evidence for prevention and treatment programs, effective law enforcement, and appropriately balanced responses to drug-related crime. Areas of special concern include the connections between drug use and human rights, especially as they pertain to vulnerable groups such as women and children. The exchange of information among nations and between professionals engaged in reducing drug trafficking and use, and efforts to stay ahead of new and threatening developments, such as synthetic substances, are central to progress by communities, countries, and regions around the world.\nThe U.S. Government will continue to work with fellow United Nations member states to galvanize the international community toward implementation of the principles that were agreed upon at the 2016 UNGASS. General coordination among concerned United Nations entities is particularly important. This includes collaboration among bodies within the UN\nstructure as a whole, but particularly those that concern themselves to some extent with drug control and related social issues.\nYou are hereby authorized and directed to submit this report, with its Bolivia, Burma, and Venezuela memoranda of justification, under section 706 of the FRAA, to the Congress, and publish it in the Federal Register.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-09-12", "title": "Presidential Determination on Major Drug Transit or Major Illicit Drug Producing Countries for Fiscal Year 2017"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118885", "text": "Aboard Air Force One\nEn Route Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n12:37 P.M. EDT\nMR. SCHULTZ: Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome aboard Air Force One on this very short flight to Philadelphia. I have one quick announcement at the top, and then I'm happy to take your questions.\nAs hopefully you all saw, the Census Bureau this morning released its annual data on income, poverty, and health insurance, which shows the remarkable progress that American families have made during this recovery. Today's report shows that real median income household income grew at 5.2 percent from 2014 to 2015. This is actually the fastest annual growth ever on record. Incomes grew for households across income distribution with the largest gain among lower and middle-class income families.\nAs you all know, there's a lot of doom and gloom about America being purveyed these days, but the facts tell a different story. In 2015, we experienced the fastest wage growth on record, the biggest decline in poverty since the 1960s, and an uninsured rate at its lowest level on record. This progress didn't happen on its own. It was hard-earned by the resilience of the American people and supported by policies of this President.\nThe President is absolutely committed to using every one of his remaining days in office to further this progress by calling on Congress to take steps to invest in job creation, wage growth, and equal pay for equal work.\nWith that, I'm happy to take your questions.\nQ: Do you know if the White House has received the 9/11 lawsuit bill and the timing on the veto, when we should expect it?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Kathleen, I can confirm that the White House received the bill last night. I don't have any further updates for you on timing. As you know, as Josh made clear yesterday, we intend to -- the President intends to veto this bill. He took some time yesterday to explain why. I'm happy to reiterate. The reason we oppose this bill is because it's contrary to how the United States has conducted business on the international stage for decades. It's inconsistent with this administration's policies, but also policies that have been longstanding by administrations of both parties.\nWe have felt that if we open up individuals to lawsuits that it can start to chip away at the concept of sovereign immunity, which is something that's protected Americans, again, for a very long time. That includes American servicemembers; that includes American diplomats and also American businesses.\nSo as a matter of policy, this is just not something that we believe is the right course. And that's why the President intends to veto this bill.\nQ: Does he intend to veto it quickly?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I don't have any timing apace for you on that. As I just said, we got it last night. So if we have anything new on this we'll make sure to let you know.\nQ: On those numbers that you read out earlier, you said there's a lot of doom and gloom that people talk about. Do you think that's illegitimate? Do you think that people who think the economy isn't working, do you think they don't have a strong case to make given the numbers that you just read out?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, I think the facts today speak for themselves. If you're interested in a few others, I'm happy to share those. In fact, the number of people in poverty fell by 3.5 million from 2014 to 2015, with the poverty rate decreasing faster than at any point since the 1960s -- all racial and ethnic groups saw increases in household incomes and decreases in poverty in 2015, with African American and Hispanic households seeing the largest declines in poverty.\nThe uninsured rate, as we've said, continued to fall in almost every state in 2015, reflecting progress under the Affordable Care Act. Refundable tax credits like the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit lifted 4.8 million children out of poverty in 2015.\nSo there's no question there's more work to be done. That's why the President is determined to use his last few months in office to keep his foot on the gas, make sure we can be doing whatever we can to lift wages, to invest in job growth and equal pay for equal work. So the President is not resting on these laurels. The President does want to make sure that these benefits are being felt throughout the economy. And, fortunately, the data today shows that that's happening.\nQ: Hillary Clinton is not on the trail today because she's recuperating. Does the President feel the need to reassure voters at all about her stamina, or does the White House feel like they need to kind of address her absence or anything like that?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Ayesha, as you know, I think, this event has been on the books for some time now, so the President is deeply looking forward to going to Philadelphia. I think you can expect his remarks to reflect themes that you've already heard.\nHe gave a widely received -- well-received speech at the convention a few weeks ago now, talking about why he believes Secretary Clinton is uniquely qualified to be the next President of the United States. That has essentially two underpinnings. One, he's watched her up close. He worked with her closely for four years as she not only succeeded as Secretary of State, she thrived.\nThat followed an intense period where he ran against her. He was her opponent on the campaign trail in the primary. And he -- even despite that tension, he witnessed firsthand her grit, her determination, her sense of selflessness and her pride in her country. And that's why he believes she's uniquely qualified to be the next President of the United States.\nSecond, the President also brings a unique perspective to this campaign. He's one of very few people who have actually sat in the Oval Office making presidential-level decisions. So he understands, like almost nobody else, what challenges face the next President and what opportunities face the next President. And he believes Secretary Clinton should be his successor because she has the determination and the judgment to make those decisions in the best interest of the country.\nQ: Has he called her to check in on her?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I don't have any calls to read out to you. As Josh mentioned yesterday, we don't read out every private conversation they had. I know they had a chance to catch up in person at the convention backstage following the President's speech. So they check in from time to time, but I don't have any calls to read out.\nQ: Yesterday the Vice President said that he thought that he could beat Donald Trump if they went jogging together, he could out-run him. Does the President think that he could out-run Donald Trump?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Oh, Isaac. (Laughter.)\nQ: The Vice President says --\nMR. SCHULTZ: Yeah, yeah. I think you'll hear the President make a case today about why Secretary Clinton should succeed him in the Oval Office, the choice that voters face. And I think you'll hear the President make some policy-based arguments for why Secretary Clinton --\nQ: -- think that Donald Trump has the physical stamina, since that's the issue, right? Does he have the physical stamina to be President of the United States? The President knows full well what that is, and he's kept in shape himself, obviously, right?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I'm not here to handicap the physical fitness of the candidates running for office. Obviously the President will speak to why he believes Secretary Clinton should be the next President and, quite frankly, why he believes her opponent presents the wrong path for America.\nQ: It's been seven weeks since that convention. We haven't seen him publicly campaigning for Secretary Clinton in a while. Is there any frustration that he's got this busy day job that's keeping him off the trail? And how is his schedule being crafted for the final eight weeks here? I assume we'll see him ramp up that activity.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Mike, perhaps you're frustrated that you weren't able to join us on a 10-day trip through Asia earlier this month. (Laughter.) So, yes, the President was traveling around the world the past 10 days, so that was part of the reason he wasn't able to be on the campaign trail. As you all know, he also will be in New York next week for most of the week for the United Nations General Assembly.\nThat all said, he is very much looking forward to today. Again, he wants to be out there making the case for Secretary Clinton, why he believes she should be the next President of the United States. I'd expect more events in the coming weeks between now and November, but I don't have any scheduling updates for you.\nQ: -- to her?\nMR. SCHULTZ: He believes that this election has enormous stakes. And he's not only proud of his record over the past eight years, but he believes that we should not be turning back the clock. And the progress we've made -- some of which is outlined in the data that was released this morning -- is a sign of good progress and a sign of where we've come -- and how far we've come. But there's a alternative vision for this country that the President wants to make sure doesn't take hold.\nQ: Do you think that Democrats need to focus voters' attention on the sort of alt-right elements in Donald Trump's campaign -- or the \"basket of deplorables,\" as some have said? Is that part of his message here today? And do you think Democrats need to do a better job of focusing on that?\nMR. SCHULTZ: The good news about doing this event in Philadelphia is we are literally minutes away from you hearing the President himself. So I think the President will address both why he believes Secretary Clinton should be the next President of the United States, but also why her opponent isn't qualified to be President.\nQ: More broadly, though, if not today, just as a strategy, is that something he endorses?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Look, I think -- Josh mentioned yesterday, this is part of a pattern of this Republican Party. Unfortunately, they have deployed some cynical tactics to appeal to -- they've deployed some tactics to appeal to American cynicism. If you look at their House Republican leadership, they have someone who proclaims himself to be \"David Duke without the baggage.\" They've threatened to hold up government funding to make sure that the Confederate flag can be shown in government cemeteries. They have supported proposals to ban Muslims from entering this country.\nSo we've seen this threat before. Unfortunately, it's been surfacing over the past few months within Republican leadership, but I don't have anything new to add.\nQ: Have you gotten a readout of the meeting this morning with Secretary Kerry? Can you talk about why that was added and -- I assume it was Syria related.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Happy to clarify that, Mike. This was part of the President's regularly scheduled meetings with Secretary Kerry. Unfortunately, due to an internal oversight, it wasn't listed on the public schedule last night, but it was always on the President's schedule. But in the interest of transparency -- (laughter) -- we wanted to make sure you had all possible information about the President's schedule before departing for Philadelphia.\nSo I don't have a detailed readout of that meeting. I imagine that Syria and the Cessation of Hostilities was on the agenda. I'm sure that was discussed. But I don't want you to have the impression that this meeting was added at the last minute.\nQ: One more campaign question. What does the President think about Mike Pence, the vice presidential nominee, not calling David Duke deplorable?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Isaac, I saw reporting of that exchange. I haven't talked to the President about it. Obviously this is a back-and-forth the campaign is having, so we're not going to weigh in from here.\nQ: But should a Republican vice presidential nominee be calling a former KKK leader who sticks by all of his views deplorable?\nMR. SCHULTZ: You're going to have to ask the campaign to defend their own comments.\nQ: Does the White House support the decision by the NCAA to strip North Carolina of its tournament games because of the bathroom bill?\nMR. SCHULTZ: As you know, the President himself has spoken out about this. We've called this mean-spirited and misguided. He's called for the repeal of the legislation. And we've also made the case that this is not only contrary to our values, but it's also bad business. And I think you can look no further than the NCAA's decision yesterday, I believe, for evidence of that.\nQ: Non-campaign related. We're reporting that the U.S. has reached a deal with Israel, a funding deal. Do you have any comments on that, or when the deal would be signed?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Sure, Ayesha. As you know, we have been discussing a memorandum of understanding with our Israeli counterparts. I can confirm for you that we're in the final stages of those discussions.\nThis has been a long, complicated process. But we believe that it's one that's worth it because it's in the interests of both the United States and our greatest ally in the Middle East, Israel -- one of our closest allies around the world -- to reaffirm our commitment to their security. So I don't have any updates on timing for you, but I can say that this has been a priority for this administration.\nQ: One on the health care exchanges. The President dropped by a meeting of insurance executives yesterday. Is he worried about those exchanges before the open enrollment, and does he feel like he has enough sway to get enough young people to sign up?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, Toluse, you're right, we did have a meeting yesterday with some leaders of the insurance industry. That was a meeting with senior administration officials who work on this issue. The President did take a few minutes to drop by that meeting because this is a priority -- making sure the next open enrollment period is a success -- I should say as successful as the previous ones -- is important to the President.\nSo I can tell you, I was not in the meeting, but the readout I got was that it was a good meeting, a positive one, constructive one -- that in order to make sure the marketplace succeeds, we're going to need people acting in good faith. And, around the table, people felt confident that the Affordable Care Act is working.\nQ: Does the President take credit for the positive household income numbers that you announced? Does he personally take credit for that?\nMR. SCHULTZ: It's not about taking credit. This is about making clear where we were, how far we've come, and where we are today. And I think that given that we are a few months from an election that it's important to take stock of how far -- how much we've achieved over the past eight years. There's no question that the grit, determination of the American workforce is why we are in such a better place than we were when the President took office, but there's also no question that the President's policies have helped -- steered the United States economy over the past eight years. And that is something the President is proud of.\nQ: One more. On TPP, did the President get any assurances or have a conversation with McConnell and Ryan yesterday about bringing that up in the lame duck?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Kathleen, the President did have an opportunity to have a pretty thorough conversation yesterday with the four leaders in Congress in the Oval Office. I don't have any additional details to read out to you from that conversation beyond what the President offered in the spray at the bottom of the meeting.\nI can tell you that passing the Trans-Pacific Partnership is a priority for this President. He believes that -- as we're talking about the economic progress that we made over the past eight years -- it can only be bolstered if we start to invest -- if we continue to invest in America's workers and American businesses.\nSo the President does believe that's on the agenda for the next few months for Congress, and he made that clear. He also talked about his trip -- that you were fortunate enough to accompany him on -- though Asia. And he talked about how -- on that trip, he talked about how America's credibility in the region is on the line. That this was a deal we negotiated; we negotiated it with America's businesses and America's workers' interest at heart.\nBut the truth is that if we don't write the rules of the road on trade, China is going to. And China is already trying to negotiate their own trade agreement. So that's why the President believes the United States of America should write the rules on trade, and that's why he's going to be pushing on Congress to pass this deal.\nQ: Did he seem optimistic that they will?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Again, I don't have anything to add from the conversation, but he left confident that the leaders know his position.\nAll right. Thank you.\nEND 12:55 P.M.

McSally, R-AZ, and 17 cosponsors)\nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 3590. It would repeal a provision of the Affordable Care Act that limits a regressive, poorly targeted tax break for health care spending. This repeal would disproportionately benefit high-income Americans, while increasing national health care spending. Additionally, it would increase the Federal deficit by $32.7 billion over ten years according to the Congressional Budget Office.\nThe Administration is always willing to work with the Congress on fiscally responsible ways to further improve health care affordability and the Affordable Care Act. The President's Budget offers a number of proposals to do so. However, H.R. 3590 would be a step in the wrong direction because it would increase health care spending and increase the Federal deficit, while doing little to improve the affordability of health care for middle-class families.\nIf the President were presented with H.R. 3590, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.", "timestamp": "2016-09-13", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 3590 – Halt Tax Increases on the Middle Class and Seniors Act"}

Walorski, R-IN, and 67 cosponsors)\nThe Administration strongly objects to H.R. 5351, which would prohibit the use of funds to transfer any individual detained at the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, either to the United States or any foreign country. As the Administration has said many times before, the continued operation of the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay weakens our national security by draining resources, damaging our relationships with key allies and partners, and emboldening violent extremists. In February, the Administration submitted a comprehensive plan to safely and responsibly close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and to bring this chapter of our history to a close. Rather than constructively engage with the Administration on the imperative of closing the facility, this bill would seek to prohibit any and all transfers of detainees, even where such transfers are conducted securely and responsibly and to further substantial U.S. national security interests. This bill represents an effort not only to extend the facility's operation – as have the other unwarranted legislative restrictions on transfers – but to bring to a standstill the substantial progress the Administration has made in safely and securely reducing the facility's population.\nAs the Administration has repeatedly emphasized, detainees are transferred from Guantanamo Bay only after a rigorous interagency review process assesses, based on all relevant facts and circumstances, that potential receiving countries are capable of successfully reintegrating them and implementing appropriate security measures, consistent with our humane treatment policy. The restrictions contained in this bill would seek to foreclose entirely the Executive Branch's ability to determine appropriate disposition options for detainees, including to transfer them consistent with our national security and our humane treatment policy, as well as its flexibility to determine when and where to prosecute them, based on the facts and circumstances of each case and our national security interests. Moreover, by purporting to prohibit all transfers of individuals detained at Guantanamo Bay, the bill would in some circumstances violate constitutional separation of powers principles, and could interfere with the ability to transfer a detainee who has been granted a writ of habeas corpus.\nIf the President were presented with H.R. 5351, his senior advisors would recommend he veto the bill.", "timestamp": "2016-09-13", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 5351 – Guantanamo Detainee Transfer Prohibition Act"}

I want to applaud my daughter, Ivanka, for her work and leadership on the issues facing working moms in our country. She has been deeply invested in this since long before the campaign began, and I am so grateful for her work and efforts on this proposal which I will be outlining today.\nI want to also take a moment to recognize Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Chairwoman of the House Republican Conference and a mother of three small children, who has been such a leader on these issues.\nWe are also joined tonight by some amazing members of Congress in our audience: Congresswoman Blackburn, Lummis, Black, and Ellmers.\nOur campaign is about ideas. We're about solutions. I've travelled all over the country in recent weeks offering detailed plans to make life better for you and your family.\nI've outlined detailed proposals for providing school choice, reforming our tax and regulatory code, lifting restrictions on American energy, rebuilding our military, changing our foreign policy, fixing our immigration policy, and keeping our country safe.\nRight now, our politicians have locked our country into endless fights about small and petty things. I'm asking the nation to lift our sights, and to imagine what we can accomplish if we work together, trust each other, and put the needs of our own citizens first.\nWe must break our ties with the failed and bitter politics of the past and pursue a future where every American is honored and respected.\nWe have to reject the arrogance of Washington D.C. that looks down on everyday hardworking people. Too often those who have power have disdain for the views, beliefs and attitudes of those who don't have political power.\nThose in leadership must put themselves in the shoes of the laid-off factory worker, the family worried about security, or the mom struggling to afford childcare.\nThat means we need working mothers to be fairly compensated for their work, and to have access to affordable, quality child care for their kids.\nWe want higher pay, better wages, and a growing economy for everyone.\nThese solutions must update laws passed more than half a century ago when most women were still not in the labor force. Today, nearly 2 in 3 mothers with young children have jobs.\nFor many families in our country, childcare is now the single largest expense – even more than housing.\nYet, very little meaningful policy work has been done in this area – and my opponent has no childcare plan.\nMany Americans are just one crisis away from disaster – a sick kid, a lost job, a damaged home. There is no financial security.\nBut that will all change under our pro-family, pro-child, pro-worker plans I am outlining tonight. Before going any further, I want everyone watching on TV right now to go to DonaldJTrump.com to read the full plan.\nThe first part of my childcare plan allows every parent or family in America – including adoptive parents and foster parent guardians – to deduct their childcare expenses from their income taxes.\nThey will be able to fully deduct the average cost of child care for their state, from birth through the age of 13.\nBecause of the way the benefit is capped and structured, our plan will bring relief to working and middle class families.\nThe deduction also applies to elder care, capped at a $5,000-dollar deduction per year.\nImportantly, our policy also supports mothers who choose to stay at home, and honors and recognizes their incredible contributions\nto their families and to our society. Families with a stay-at-home parent will be able to fully deduct the average cost of child care from their taxes.\nFor low-income individuals who have no net income tax liability, we will offer an expanded Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in the form of a childcare rebate. Working parents can get an expanded EITC benefit that equals up to half of their total payroll tax – a major relief for low-income parents. This translates to as much as an extra $1,200 dollars in EITC benefits for working families.\nNext, our plan allows every parent in America to open up a Dependent Care Savings Account. Families can contribute up to $2,000 dollars a year to these accounts completely tax-free. Crucially, unlike the flexible spending accounts that exist today, these accounts will be available to all Americans – you won't have to depend on your employer to provide them.\nImmediate family and employers can also contribute to a dependent account, each of which is designated for a specific child, including an unborn child.\nThe money that is put into these accounts can also be spent not only on child care, but also child enrichment activities. Additionally, the funds in these accounts do not expire at the end of the year – they don't revert to employers or to the Treasury. Instead, the funds rollover – so while only $2,000 dollars can be contributed each year, unspent sums can accumulate and create substantial savings.\nThese savings can then be used by parents to help give their kids school choice, and will thus contribute to the school choice reforms\nI outlined last week.\nThe funds will remain in the account until the age of 18. Whatever still remains at that time can be used to help offset the costs of higher education.\nFor low-income individuals, the federal government will provide matching funds – if parents contribute $1,000 dollars, the federal government will provide a $500 dollars match. To help low-income families reach these targets and save money, we will put a box on federal income tax forms allowing these parents to have their Earned Income Tax Credit funds directly deposited into their Dependent Care Savings Accounts.\nThese Dependent Care Savings Accounts can also be set-up to provide care for elderly dependents.\nOur plan also includes much needed regulatory reform to incentivize private sector solutions. The new funds offered by our plan will create a new market for innovative childcare solutions.\nBut to make sure these solutions are available, especially in low-income and rural communities, we must reduce regulations that favor large institutional care facilities. We will allow the states to make the decisions that are right for them.\nIn this era of the sharing economy, we want parents to be able to access lower-cost, competitive and innovative solutions at the click of a button – including services like nanny-sharing. Our plan would also cover care provided by relatives and grandparents.\nOur plan includes incentives for more employers to offer on-site childcare as well. This can often be a good solution for many working parents, and can save them up to 30 minutes of commute time. Currently, only 7% of employers provide these services. Our plan will expand tax deductions for employers, allow companies to pool resources to provide shared childcare services, and remove needless requirements that have prevented employers from using the credit.\nFinally, our plan offers a crucial safety net for working mothers whose employers do not provide paid maternity leave. This solution will receive strong bipartisan support, and will be completely self-financing. By recapturing fraud and improper payments in the unemployment insurance program, we can provide 6 weeks of paid-maternity leave to any mother with a newborn child whose employer does not provide the benefit. This maternity leave will be paid straight out of the unemployment insurance fund and, again, this safety net will be completely paid-for through savings within the program.\nThere are more reforms and solutions in our childcare plan, and you can review them all on the website.\nOn Thursday, I will outline my full economic plan, which is completely paid for through economic growth and proposed federal budget savings. Together, our tax, trade, regulatory, and energy policies will add trillions in new deficit-lowering growth.\nThese are the kinds of solutions I want to bring to the White House as your President. It's time to free ourselves from the baskets that politicians try to put us in, and instead to work together – not as Republicans or Democrats – but as Americans, to achieve real, positive results for the American people.\nWhile my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you, hard-working American Patriots who love your country, love\nyour families, and want a better future for all Americans.\nIt's time to end the rule of special interests, and to begin the rule of the American people.\nIt's time to stop fighting over the smallest words, and to start dreaming about the great adventures that lie ahead.\nIt is time to Believe In America.\nTogether, We Will Make Our Country Strong Again.\nWe Will Make Our Country Prosperous Again.\nAnd Will Make Our Country Great Again For Everyone.", "timestamp": "2016-09-13", "title": "Remarks at Aston Community Center in Aston, Pennsylvania"}

Spending time in your state has been one of the great joys of this campaign.\nTogether, we are going to win Iowa in November -- and we are going to win the White House, and Make America Great Again.\nThe White House will become the People's House. We will tackle and fix the problems that have gone unsolved for years.\nWe are going to fix our crumbling infrastructure, renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, free children from failing government schools, eliminate government waste, and create a fair, simple and efficient tax code that adds millions of new jobs.\nProsperity will rise, poverty will recede, and wages will finally begin to grow – and they will grow rapidly.\nThis is a campaign about big ideas designed to help everyday people.\nIn recent days, we've rolled out one new policy idea after another – on taxes, on school choice, on foreign policy, on defeating terrorism, on rebuilding our military, on Veterans care, on unleashing American energy, and on the vital issue of trade.\nBy contrast, Hillary Clinton is running a policy-free campaign. She offers no ideas, no solutions, only hatred and derision.\nI am running to be a President for all Americans – Democrat, Republican, Independent, everyone. Whether you vote for me, or whether you vote for someone else, I will be your greatest champion.\nOur support comes from every part of America, and every walk of life. We have the support of cops and soldiers, carpenters and welders, accountants and lawyers, the young and the old, and millions of working class families all over this nation.\nWhile my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you hardworking American patriots who love your country and want a better future for all of our people.\nHer comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as Secretary of State, hide and delete her emails, put classified information in the reach of our enemies, lie to Congress, and sell government favors and access through the Clinton Foundation.\nIt's this attitude of arrogance that explains why Hillary Clinton made her 13 phones disappear – including with a hammer – so the FBI couldn't see them, and why she bleached her emails after a congressional subpoena. Now the people who destroyed the emails are all pleading the fifth amendment in front of Congress today.\nAnyone watching today's hearing in Congress knows that Hillary Clinton's actions are far more corrupt than we even imagined.\nThis is a far bigger scandal than Watergate ever was, but with Watergate we had the Justice Department doing its jobs – here we don't have either. This is a scandal that threatens national security and that involves a multimillion dollar pay-for-play scheme between the Secretary of State and her Foundation.\nWhether it's her emails, her disasters in Iraq, Libya and Syria, or her failures on the economy, Hillary Clinton lacks the judgement, temperament and moral character to lead this country.\nIn the words of a secret service agent posted outside her office: \"she simply lacks the integrity and the temperament to serve in the office…from the bottom of my soul, I know this to be true.\"\nThe policies of Hillary Clinton have produced death and destruction overseas, and produced only failing schools, rising crime, job loss, shrinking incomes, and tragic poverty at home.\n1 in 5 American households do not have a single member in the labor force. Another 14 million people left the labor force entirely since 2009. And the national debt has doubled to nearly $20 trillion during the Obama Years.\nI am running to reverse these policies, and to create a future of prosperity for all Americans.\nThat includes our family farms right here in Iowa.\nFamily farms are the backbone of this country. We are going to end the EPA intrusion into your family homes and your family farms.\nWe are going to protect the Renewable Fuel Standard, corn-based ethanol, eliminate job-killing regulations like the Waters of the U.S. rule, and provide desperately-needed tax relief.\nOur plan lowers the tax rate on family farms down to 15 percent, and to stop the double-taxation of family farms at death – helping to ensure that the family farm tradition in Iowa continues to thrive and flourish.\nMy economic agenda can be summed up in three words: jobs, jobs, jobs.\nThat means we are going to negotiate trade deals to protect our farmers, help them export their goods, and grow family farming in America.\nMy first day in office, I am also going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight years. All needless, job-killing regulations will be cancelled. Millions of new jobs will come pouring in.\nWe are going to lift the restrictions on American energy – which means lower electricity prices for our farmers, and half a million new jobs a year.\nThat's just the beginning.\nAlso on my first day, I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare – this will instantly save another 2 million jobs.\nBy the way, remember when Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, said the \"lack of transparency,\" was essential to passing the legislation and then he talked about – and I quote – \"the stupidity of the American voter.\" This is the hateful attitude of insiders like Mr. Gruber and Hillary Clinton – and the voters have had enough. They're taking their country back.\nAnother major reform is going to be school choice. I've outlined a plan to provide every disadvantaged child in America the freedom to choose the private, public, magnet or religious school of his or her choice.\nThis will help lift millions of poor African-American and Hispanic children out of poverty.\nIt's time to break-up the failed Democratic control over our inner cities, and provide real hope and opportunity to every single community in this nation.\nOur policies on taxes, trade, regulations and education will grow incomes, boost jobs and reduce poverty for our African-American and Hispanic communities.\nWe need a new civil rights agenda for our time, one that promises safe neighborhoods, great education, and secure jobs.\nNearly 4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty, including 45% of African-American children under the age of six. 58% of African-American youth are not working.\nViolent crime rose in America's fifty largest cities last year. Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.\nOver 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January of this year. There's a shooting on average every 2 hours.\nTo those suffering and hurting I say: what do you have to lose – vote for Donald J. Trump. I will fix it. I will bring back millions of jobs, higher wages, and great schools.\nI will make your communities safe.\nSafety also means protecting our people from Radical Islamic Terrorism.\nNew video has just been released showing ISIS butchers murdering innocent people in what has been called a Syrian slaughterhouse. The victims were dragged, then hung from meathooks, and then their throats were slit.\nThis is an evil, sadistic, monstrous enemy and we must keep these killers out of our country.\nWe know that ISIS is trying to infiltrate refugee flows, and to recruit refugees after their entry to our country.\nMy opponent wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. According to the Senate Subcommittee on immigration, her entire plan will bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term and cost $400 billion in lifetime benefits.\nInstead of providing free healthcare and jobs to refugees from around the world, we should rebuild our inner cities and help struggling Americans get jobs.\nI support the construction of safe zones in the region, and we will get the Gulf States to pay for it.\nAt the same time, as we rebuild our military, we are going to get our allies to pay their fair share. Only 5 of the 28 member NATO countries meet their obligation to spend 2% of GDP on defense. I will convene a summit of our European and Asian allies to make sure everyone is sharing in the security burden – and that we are properly focused on Radical Islamic Terrorism.\nIn all things, it's time to put Americans first – and start taking care of each other.\nTonight, I am going to roll out a plan to help our mothers and our families get affordable, quality childcare for their children.\nOn policy after policy, we are going to provide opportunity, prosperity and security for all Americans.\nI am going to lower your taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; I'm going rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; I'm going to save your 2nd amendment. I'm going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country, and yes, we will build the wall and I'm going to, so importantly, renegotiate your horrible trade deals, especially NAFTA – which is the single worst trade deal ever made by any country anywhere in the world a one-way street for jobs out of the United States – and we will make great trade deals that put the American worker first.\nAnd Apple, and our other major companies, will start making their iPhones, computers and other products inside of the United States – not in China, and all over the world.\nWe don't make our products anymore in the United States, but we will again – like never before.\nWe will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.\nAmerican cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.\nAmerican steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.\nAmerican hands will rebuild this nation – and American energy, mined from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.\nWe will put new American metal into the spine of this country.\nI will fight for every neglected part of this nation – and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\nIt is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.\nJobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.\nOnce more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.\nWe Will Make America Prosperous Again.\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\nAnd Will Make America Great Again.\nThank you, and God Bless!", "timestamp": "2016-09-13", "title": "Remarks at Seven Flags Event Center in Des Moines, Iowa"}
{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119364", "text": "Hillary for America senior policy advisor Maya Harris issued the following statement on Donald Trump's new proposal:\n\"After spending his entire career — and this entire campaign — demeaning women and dismissing the need to support working families, Donald Trump released a regressive and insufficient 'maternity leave' policy that is out-of-touch, half-baked and ignores the way Americans live and work today. Instead of asking those at the top to pay their fair share, he's robbing Peter to pay Paul by raiding unemployment insurance funds, and giving the most to the wealthy while providing far less relief to middle-class and working families. The lack of seriousness of this proposal is no surprise given his history of disrespecting women in the workplace and the fact there's no evidence he ever provided paid family leave or childcare to his own employees. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton — who has a lifelong record of fighting for women and families — has a comprehensive plan that will support 21st century families.\"\nPOLICY ANALYSIS\nTRUMP MATERNITY LEAVE CLAIM: \"The Trump plan will guarantee six weeks of paid maternity leave by amending the existing unemployment insurance (UI) that companies are required to carry. The benefit would apply only when employers don't offer paid maternity leave, and would be paid for by offsetting reductions in the program so that taxes are not raised.\"\nEXPLAINER:\n* Trump's plan will undercut women in the workplace and depress their wages. Trump's plan casts women as the sole child caretaker and actually encourages employers to discriminate against women. Studies have shown that providing paid leave to new mothers, but not to new fathers, negatively affects women's return to the workplace, can discourage employers from hiring or promoting female employees, and can increase the gender pay-gap. By only providing leave to new mothers, Trump's plan also undercuts working dads, including gay couples and single-fathers.\n* Trump's plan is paid for on the backs of Americans most in need of support: those who have recently lost their job. By cutting unemployment insurance - rather than asking the wealthy to pay their fair share - he's putting working families at risk.\n* Trump's plan would provide no relief to many working families. Unlike comprehensive and effective paid family leave proposals, Trump's plan does not guarantee workers a portion of their wages while on leave, rather workers would receive an undefined percentage of unemployment insurance. In Florida, for example, this means a mother would only receive, at most, $275 per week.\n* Trump's numbers simply don't add up to a real paid leave plan.  The absurdly low projected cost of his policymeans it will not provide sufficient support for middle class families to actually afford taking time off to care for a child.\n* Hillary's plan for paid family leave is actually responsive to the needs of working families in the 21st century. It would guarantee twice as many weeks of leave as Trump's plan; ensure hardworking Americans get at least two-thirds of their current wages; apply to fathers and those who need to care for an ill family member; and is funded by making the wealthy pay their fair share—not by robbing recently laid-off workers of the support their families need.\nTRUMP CHILD CARE CLAIM: \"The Trump plan will rewrite the tax code to allow working parents to deduct from their income taxes child care expenses for up to four children and elderly dependents…Individuals who have no tax liability…will claim an expanded Earned Income Tax Credit, equivalent to half of their payroll tax contribution.\"\nEXPLAINER:\n* Trump's child care plan gives at least twice as big a tax benefit to the wealthy than the middle class.  After changing his child care proposal numerous times, Trump's latest child care deduction remains highly regressive - Trump's plan give around 43 cents on the dollar to 470,000 families with children in the top income tax bracket, and less than half as much to tens of millions of working families in the middle class. That's because taxpayers in the top income tax bracket can deduct at their income tax rate of 39.6% plus around 4% for half of their payroll taxes.\n* Trump's child care plan gives 12 million hard-working families just 4 cents on the dollar. For the 12 million families with children who do not have federal income tax liability, Trump's plan would give just a few cents on the dollar - half of their payroll tax obligations, or around 4 cents on the dollar. That's almost 10 times less than the highest-earning families eligible for the plan.\n* Trump's plan could give thousands more to wealthy than working families. For example, in states like New York and Massachusetts where the average cost of childcare can be around $15,000, a family in the top bracket could get a $6,000-$7,000 tax cut by deducting at the top bracket rate of 39.6% (and potentially plus around 4% for half of their payroll tax obligations), compared to just around $200 for a family spending $5,000 a year on child care, and relying on Trump's proposal to get a roughly 4% credit.\n* Trump's new child care proposal might offer families less than currently available tax credits. In fact, the more than 30 million middle-class families with children in the 15% bracket or lower might get less under Trump's plan than under the current-law Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit, which offers a 20% tax credit against up to $6,000 in child care expenses, because under Trump's plan, they might only be able to deduct up to 15%.\n* Trump's plan could actually bring down the quality of childcare for working families. By making child care less expensive for wealthy families, while doing close to nothing for millions of middle class Americans, Trump's plan could actually increase economic segregation in the child care setting. Decades of early learning research shows the negative impact of such segregation on children.\n* Hillary's plan will actually make childcare affordable for hard-working families. Hillary believes quality, affordable childcare should be available for every family—not just those at the top. That's why she will fight to ensure no family in America pays more than more than 10% of its income to afford care.\nTRUMP SAVINGS ACCOUNT CLAIM: \"The Trump plan would create new Dependent Care Savings Accounts (DCSAs) so that families can set aside extra money to foster their children's development and offset elder care for their parents or adult dependents. These new accounts are available to everyone, and allow both tax-deductible contributions and tax-free appreciation year-to-year.\"\nEXPLAINER:\n* Trump's plan creates a new, regressive tax break for expensive private schools and nannies.  Trump's new savings account creates a regressive new tax break for nannies, private school and other spending for the most fortunate.\n* Trump's plan offers more to high-earning families than the middle-class. The highest-earning families, like millionaires in the top bracket, could deduct 40 cents on the dollar for spending on private schools, nannies and other expenses they don't need a tax break for.\n* Trump's plan gives much more to high-income families than lower income families. For example, a high-income family putting $2,000 into a savings account would get almost a $800 tax break. A middle-class family who put in $2,000 might only get $300 if they were in the 15% tax bracket. And even lower-income families eligible for a match would get less than the highest earning families.\n* Hillary's plans will provide caregivers with real relief: Hillary will actually provide tax relief to families that need it most. She will offer a 20 percent tax credit to help family members offset up to $6,000 in caregiving costs for their elderly family members, allowing caregivers to claim up to $1,200 in tax relief each year.\nBACKGROUND ON TRUMP'S DISMAL RECORD ON SUPPORTING FAMILIES\nNo Evidence Trump Provides Paid Family Leave to Employees\nThe Trump Presidential Campaign And The Trump Organization Did Not Respond To Questions About What Their Family Leave Policy Was. \"The Daily Beast reached out to the Trump presidential campaign, the Trump Organization, and Ivanka Trump, to ask about the family leave policy at the Trump Organization. A representative from Ivanka Trump's brand replied quickly to say that employees of the former model's small fashion and lifestyle shop were provided with eight weeks of paid leave… 'In addition, since we have flexible working hours with a focus on results rather than face time, we are supportive of all working moms who some days may need or choose to work from home,' she said. 'My colleague Melissa, cc'd, can advise on Trump Org.' After three follow-up emails, Melissa from the Trump Organization wrote back: 'We will have no further comment.'\" [Daily Beast, 8/15/16]\nOnly One Former Trump Employee Of Nine Willing To Speak Recalled Any Family Leave Offered At The Company And It Was Unpaid. \"As an alternative to the tight-lipped corporate communications department, The Daily Beast reached out to over 100 former employees to ask about the company's family-leave policy…Of the nine ex-employees who were willing to speak, only one was able to recall any maternity leave—in this instance, it was apparently unpaid leave—being offered at the company, although none of them could say conclusively that no such leave was offered.\" [Daily Beast, 8/15/16]\nTrump Lied About Providing Childcare to Employees\nDonald Trump Said He Provides Child Care For His Employees And It Was Very Inexpensive To Do So — \"I Do It All Over, And I Get Great People Because Of It.\" \"Donald Trump doesn't understand why so few companies provide affordable, in-house child care for their employees like he does at some of his companies. 'It's not expensive for a company to do it,' Trump said during a town hall at a community college in this small town on Thursday afternoon. 'You need one person or two people, and you need some blocks and you need some swings and some toys. You know, surely, it's not expensive. It's not an expensive thing. I do it all over, and I get great people because of it...

Hello, Philly! Hello, Philadelphia! Oh, it is good to be back in Philly. Can everybody please give Patrick a big round of applause for that great introduction? Oh, it is good to be back on the campaign trail. Now, I understand I am not—I know I'm not the first person from the White House to come to Philly this week. Some of you may have seen Joe Biden at the Eagles game. He told me, \"Barack, you've got to get on the Wentz wagon,\" he said, \"We—they—we've got a new quarterback; we've got hope in Philly.\" And I had to explain, \"Joe, I am a Bears fan.\"\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. And we play Philly next Monday night. So I've got to stick with my team, but I am going to go to Philly and scout out what all the fuss is about.\nI also am here because you've got some of the best public servants in America. They work their heart out every day for you. You've got Scranton's favorite son, in addition to Joe Biden: Senator Bob Casey, one of the best Senators in the country. Your outstanding Governor, Tom Wolf, is here. Your wonderful mayor, Jim Kenney, is here. One of your outstanding Members of the House of Representatives, Bob Brady, is in the house. Your candidate for the United States Senate—this is a special woman, she is going to do a great job—Katie McGinty is here. And your candidate for attorney general, an old friend of mine, somebody who was with me early, early, early on: Josh Shapiro. Give Josh a big round of applause. Now——\nAudience member. We love you!\nThe President. I love you too. But I've got to—but we've got some business to do here, so—we've got some business to do.\nAudience member. I love you, Obama!\nThe President. This will be—this is going to be one of the last times I visit Philly as President.\nAnd so my first order of business is to say thank you for all the support you've given me all these years. And I've got incredible memories here in Philly, most recently at the Democratic National Convention. And I could not be prouder of the leader that we have nominated to take my place. So even though I've run my last campaign, I am going to work as hard as I can this fall to elect Hillary Clinton as our next President of the United States of America.\nAudience members. Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!\nThe President. Hillary!\nNow, in election season, you will often hear crazy stuff. But I've got to say, this year we've been hearing a little more crazy than usual. [Laughter] Having said that, after almost two terms as your President, I am here to tell you I am more optimistic about our future than I have ever been. Look, because I've seen an America that, for all the challenges, for all the noise of the politics, still has the capacity to come together and do great things. You think about it. We fought our way back from the worst recession in 80 years. We turned around a declining economy. We helped our auto industry set new records. Our businesses created 15 million new jobs. Slashed our dependence on foreign oil. Doubled our production of clean energy. Made marriage equality a reality in all 50 States.\nWe brought more of our troops home to their families. We delivered justice to Usama bin Laden. Through diplomacy rather than war, we shut down Iran's nuclear program, opened up a new chapter with the people of Cuba, brought nearly 200 nations together around a climate agreement that could save this planet for our kids and our grandkids. That's what we've done.\nBy so many measures, America is stronger and more prosperous than when we started out on this journey together. In fact, some of you may have saw, there was a new report out just today showing that last year, across every age, every race in America, incomes rose and the poverty rate fell. In fact, the typical household income of Americans rose by $2,800, which is the single biggest 1-year increase on record. We lifted 3.5 million people out of poverty. That's the largest 1-year drop in poverty since 1968. The uninsured rate is the lowest it has been since they kept records. The pay gap between men and women shrank to the lowest level ever.\nSo, now, let's face it, Republicans don't like to hear good news right now. [Laughter] But it's important just to understand this is a big deal. More Americans are working; more have health insurance. Incomes are rising. Poverty is falling.\nAudience member. And gas is $2 a gallon!\nThe President. And gas is $2 a gallon. I didn't even—thank you for reminding me. [Laughter] Thanks, Obama. [Laughter] Yes. So the steps that we have been taking over these years, they're paying off. We've shown that progress is possible.\nAnd of course, none of this was easy. We knew all along that change wasn't going to be quick. We knew that we wouldn't meet all of our challenges in one term or even in one Presidency. But we're here today because we know we've got more work to do for every worker who still needs a good job, for every worker who still needs a raise or a decent retirement, for every child who still needs a world-class education as a ladder out of poverty, for every family who hasn't yet felt progress these past 8 years. We've got more work to do, we know that.\nAnd the choice that you make—that we make, just 8 weeks from today, will determine the direction of this country for a long time. And I've already said this: This is not a choice—this is not the usual choice between parties and policies and left and right. This is more fundamental. This is a fundamental choice about who we are as a people. This is a choice about the very meaning of America.\nDemocrats and Republicans, we've always had our differences. There's nothing wrong with that; that's how the country moves forward. Right? We have debates; different ideas compete. We see what's going to make us work. But what we've seen from the other side in this election, this isn't Abraham Lincoln's Republican Party. This isn't even the vision of freedom that Ronald Reagan talked about.\nThis is a dark, pessimistic vision of a country where we turn against each other, we turn away from the rest of the world. They're not offering serious solutions. They're just fanning resentment and blame and anger and hate.\nAnd that is not the America we know. That's not the America I know. The America I know is full of courage and optimism and generosity and ingenuity and innovation. Yes, we've got real concerns. We worry about paying the bills; we worry about protecting our kids; we worry about caring for a sick parent. Lord knows we get frustrated about Washington and all the gridlock. We worry about racial division. There are pockets of America that never fully recovered from the factories closing down. There are parents who are worrying about whether their kids are going to have the same opportunities they had.\nBut I—look, I've traveled in every State. And I've seen, more than anything, all that is good and right about America. I see people working hard. I see folks starting businesses. I see teachers just digging in their own pockets to buy school materials and teaching kids, just because they love kids. I see men and women in uniform serving their country, making incredible sacrifices. I see engineers inventing new stuff and doctors coming up with new cures.\nAnd most of all, I see this younger generation that is so full of energy and ideas and aren't going to be held back by the old ideas, imagine what can be instead of just what is. And I see Americans of every party and every background and every faith who ultimately believe we're stronger together. All of us: young, old; men, women; Black, White, Latino, Asian, Native American, folks with disabilities, all pledging allegiance to the same, proud flag.\nThat is the America I know. That's the America you know and believe in. And there is just one candidate in this race who's devoted her life to building that America: a mother and a grandmother who would do anything to help our children do better; a leader who's got real plans to break down barriers and blast through glass ceilings and widen opportunity for every single American, the next President of the United States of America, Hillary Clinton.\nAudience members. Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!\nThe President. Hillary!\nAudience members. Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!\nThe President. Now, look, can I just say, I am really into electing Hillary Clinton. Like, I—this is not me going through the motions here. I really, really, really want to elect Hillary Clinton. And sometimes, folks, they're kind of surprised by that because they remember, man, you guys had a tough fight 8 years ago.\nAnd it was tough, because Hillary is tough. Every time I thought I had that race won, I was, like, going up the \"Rocky Steps.\" [Laughter] I was like—I was about to celebrate, and then I look, and she's right there. And I got whooped here in Pennsylvania. She whooped me. [Laughter] Now, you did make it up to me in November, when I won. [Laughter]\nBut I had seen what she could accomplish. I had seen how smart and savvy and tough she was. So I asked her, I said, join my team. And she wasn't sure about it at first. But she ultimately knew that what was at stake was bigger than either of us. That's the kind of patriot she is.\nAnd so for 4 years, I had a front-row seat. I watched her intelligence. I watched her judgment. I watched her discipline. I saw her in the Situation Room, where she argued in favor of the mission for bin Laden. I watched her pursue diplomacy to open up new partnerships, to help promote democracy, to help reduce the nuclear threat. And she worked hard, tirelessly, flying around the world again and again. I don't know how many times she lapped it—the world, but she went around a long time. [Laughter] Because she had never forgotten what she was fighting for: to make sure every child has the same opportunities as her granddaughter and her daughter's and your kids. And if there's one thing I can tell you, Philadelphia, nobody fully understands the demands of my job—this job of the President—until you actually sit behind that desk. Folks, look, I didn't understand it before I had the job. You think you do——\nAudience members. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!\nThe President. No, no, no, hold on, I appreciate that. But I'm not gone yet, so don't—save the thank-yous. [Laughter]\nAudience member. You ain't done yet!\nThe President. I'm not finished yet. I've got a few more months.\nListen, the—what you come to realize when you're in this job is, anybody can pop off, anybody can fire off a tweet. Everybody is a critic. But that doesn't mean you know what it's like to manage a global crisis. You don't know what it's like to send a group of young people to war, knowing some won't come back. But the closest you can come to understanding what it's like is to be where Hillary has been, to have been part of those decisions. She knows what it means for working families and senior citizens and small-businessowners and soldiers and veterans when we make policy in the White House. And in the middle of crises, she'll listen to people, and she will keep her cool, and she treats everybody with respect. And no matter how daunting the odds, no matter how many times people knock her down and mess with her, she does not quit. She doesn't quit. She doesn't quit. That's the Hillary that I know.\nAnd that's why I really want to get her elected. That's the Hillary I've come to admire. I believe there has never been a man or a woman more qualified than Hillary Clinton to serve as our President.\nNow, Hillary actually has plans to address the things that she's heard from you on the campaign trail: specific ideas to invest in new jobs and to help workers share in their company's profits and to help put kids in preschool so they get a good start and to put students through college without taking on a mountain of debt. And I know that these days in campaigns, sometimes, the plans get ignored. But they're there, and they make sense, and they add up.\nAnd then, there's the other guy—[laughter]—Donald Trump.\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. Don't boo, vote! Don't boo, vote! Booing is easy. I need you to vote.\nLook, let's talk about Mr. Trump. He's not really a plans guy, a fact guy. He calls himself a business guy. But America has got a lot of business men and women who have succeeded without hiding their tax returns or leaving a trail of lawsuits or workers who didn't get paid, people feeling like they got cheated.\nI mean, look, I keep on reading this analysis that, well, you know, Trump has got support from, like, working folks. Really? That—like, this is the guy you want to be championing working people? This guy who spent 70 years on this Earth showing no concern for working people, this guy is suddenly going to be your champion?\nAudience members. No!\nThe President. I mean, he spent most of his life trying to stay as far away from working people as he could. And now this guy is going to be the champion of working people? Huh? I mean, he wasn't going to let you on his golf course. [Laughter] He wasn't going to let you by in his condo. And now suddenly, this guy is going to be your champion? And so, yes, if you oppose raising the minimum wage, you should vote for Trump. You should also vote for Pat Toomey. You've got—a Trump-Toomey economy will be right up your alley.\nBut if you are actually concerned about paying your bills, growing the economy, creating opportunity for everybody, keeping the trend of rising incomes going and rising wages going and uninsured going down and poverty going down—if that's what you're looking for, this shouldn't even be close. If you want higher wages, better benefits, a fairer Tax Code, a bigger voice for workers, stronger regulations on Wall Street, then you should be voting for Hillary Clinton and Katie McGinty and Bob Brady to stand up for you.\nAnd if you're concerned about who's going to keep your family safe in this dangerous world, then the choice is even clearer. Look, I just came from overseas. Talk to the other leaders around the world. They don't even understand how this is close. Hillary has worked with our intelligence teams and our diplomats and our military. She's got the judgment and the temperament and the experience to meet any threat. There's no scenario that she will not have seen before. And she will see to it that our troops finish the job of defeating ISIL: doing it the right way, without resorting to torture, without banning entire religions from our country. She's prepared to be the next Commander in Chief.\nAudience members. Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!\nThe President. And then, you've got the Donald—[laughter]—who just last week went on Russian state television to talk down our military and to curry favor with Vladimir Putin.\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. He loves this guy. Loves this guy. Think about what's happened to the Republican Party. [Laughter] Right? They used to be opposed to Russia and authoritarianism, and fighting for freedom and fighting for democracy. And now their nominee is out there praising a guy, saying he's a strong leader because he invades smaller countries, jails his opponents, controls the press, and drives his economy into a long recession.\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. No, I—look, I'm actually being serious about it. Think about this. And then, when—and when the interviewer asked him, well, why are—why do you support this guy, he said: \"He's a strong guy. Look, he's got a 82 percent poll rating.\" [Laughter] Well, yes, so did—Saddam Hussein had a 90 percent poll rating. [Laughter] I mean, if you control the media and you've taken away everybody's civil liberties and you jail dissidents, that's what happens. If the pollster calls you up and says, do you support the guy who, if you don't support him, he might throw you in jail, you say yes, I love that guy. [Laughter]\nBut think about the fact that that is Donald Trump's role model. I mean, I have to do business with Putin. I have to do business with Russia. That's part of foreign policy. But I don't go around saying that's my role model. [Laughter] Can you imagine Ronald Reagan idolizing somebody like that?\nAudience members. No!\nThe President. He saw America as \"a shining city on a hill.\" Donald Trump calls it \"a divided crime scene.\" [Laughter] He's not offering any real policies or plans, just offering division and offering fear. And he's betting that if he scares enough people, he might just scare up enough votes to win this election. Audience members. No way! Boo! Never trump!\nAudience members. Dump trump! Dump Trump! Dump Trump!\nThe President. I mean, look, I believe Americans are not a fearful people. We don't look for being ruled. Our power comes from those ideals first put into place right here in Philadelphia: that all of us are created equal; that \"We, the people\" can \"form a more perfect Union.\" We believe in democracy. That's what we believe in.\nAnd we don't believe that one person is going to do it for us. It's what we can do together, achieved by us. And yes, it's hard and slow and sometimes frustrating to persuade people and work with people and form coalitions, but that's the necessary work of self-government.\nAnd that's what Hillary Clinton understands because she's been through it. She knows that in a democracy, in a big, diverse country like this one, it doesn't work if we just demonize each other and call each other names. She knows that love trumps hate. She knows that most issues aren't just black and white and that you've got to compromise to get things done, even when you're a hundred percent right. And she knows that for progress to happen, we have to listen to each other, and we have to see ourselves in each other, and we've got to fight for our principles, but also fight to find common ground.\nAnd these days, our politics doesn't always lend itself to those ideals. We get impatient. We want our progress right away. And we don't want to have to compromise, and we don't have to listen to other folks. But I promise you, when we stay at it, progress does happen.\nAnd if you don't believe it, ask the 20 million people who have got health care today who didn't have it. Ask that marine who serves his country without hiding the husband that he loves. Democracy works. But here's the thing, here——\nAudience member. We need some help!\nThe President. We've got somebody who fainted. This is what happens. They'll be okay. Just give them a little room. Everybody bend their knees one time. [Laughter] Just don't lock your knees. Keep on bending them a little bit. We'll do a little exercise right now. EMS folks, they're right in front. If you can find somebody. Drink some water.\nAudience member. We love you!\nThe President. I love you too. But bend your knees. [Laughter]\nBut listen, listen to this. You've got to want it. You've got to want democracy, not just on election day, but all the days in between. And this is where you come in. We can close the inequality gap in our economy. Hillary has got plans to make sure everybody has a shot, not just those at the top. But you've got to help her by voting for Democrats up and down the ticket. We've got to get a Congress back, and we've got to hold everybody we elect accountable for getting the job done.\nWe can reform our criminal justice system. But you've got to vote: not just for President, but for mayors and sheriffs and States' attorneys and State legislators. We've got to work with police and protestors until laws and practices are changed.\nWe can fix our broken immigration system, but we can't keep on sending Republicans to Congress who stand in the way. We've got to vote for leaders who see immigrants not as criminals or rapists, but who—as families who came here the same reason ours did: to work and to study and to contribute. We need leaders in Congress who know the American Dream is not something that a wall can contain.\nWe can keep making progress against climate change. This month was the hottest on record. This year is going to end up being the hottest on record. This is not somebody's imagination. This is not some liberal plot. It's a problem. But we've got to vote for people who actually understand that it's real. And we've got to engage not just young people on college campuses, but also single moms who are worried about gas prices and coal miners who are worried about providing for their kids. And Hillary has got real plans to do that.\nAnd if you don't think the stakes are high enough, just remember that for months now, the Republicans in the Senate have refused to do their job and fill a vacancy for the Supreme Court. Even though I nominated somebody with more Federal judicial experience than any nominee in history, they want to see Donald Trump fill it with somebody who sees the world as he does. Imagine that. Who would that person be?\nThe Supreme Court should be above politics. The people on the Bench make monumental decisions that affect every aspect of our daily lives, from a woman's right to choose to your right to vote.\nSo my most important message is, we cannot take this election for granted. We've got to fight for this thing. There are serious issues at stake in this election behind all the frivolous stuff that gets covered every day.\nAnd let me just make a comment about that. Because, I—look, I'm not running this time, but I sure do get frustrated with the way this campaign is covered. I'm just telling the truth. Guys in the back, I'm just telling you the truth about how I feel about this. Let—do you mind if I just vent for a second?\nYou know, the—you don't grade the Presidency on a curve. This is serious business. And when we see folks talking about transparency, you want to debate transparency? You've got one candidate in this race who has released decades' worth of her tax returns. The other candidate is the first in decades who refuses to release any at all. You want to debate foundations and charities? One candidate's family foundation has saved countless lives around the world. The other candidate's foundation took money other people gave to his charity and then bought a 6-foot-tall painting of himself. [Laughter] I mean, I—he had the taste not to go for the 10-foot version, but—[laughter].\nYou want to debate who's more fit to be our President? One candidate, who's traveled to more countries than any Secretary of State ever has, has more qualifications than pretty much anyone who's ever run for this job; and the other, who isn't fit in any way, shape, or form to represent this country abroad and be its Commander in Chief.\nSo somehow, as things go on, because we've become so partisan, our standards for what's normal have changed. And Donald Trump says stuff every day that used to be considered as disqualifying for being President. And yet, because he says it over and over and over again, the press just gives up, and they just say, well, yes, you know, okay. They just stop—\"I was opposed to the war in Iraq.\" Well, actually, he wasn't. But they just accept it.\nSo the bottom line is, is that we cannot afford suddenly to treat this like a reality show. We can't afford to act as if there's some equivalence here.\nTo be President, you have to do your homework, and you have to know what you're talking about, and you've got to apply steady judgment, even when things don't go your way. And you've got to make the tough calls, even when they're not popular, even when they take years to pay off. And you've got to be able to handle criticism without taking it personally, just brush it off, and then go ahead and get the job done.\nAnd that's something I learned. And that's what Hillary learned as a Senator and as a Secretary of State and as a First Lady. And yes, she's got her share of critics, just like I do. And she's been caricatured by the right and sometimes by the left. And she's been accused of everything you can imagine and has been subjected to more scrutiny and what I believe is more unfair criticism than anybody out here. And she doesn't complain about it. And you know what, that's what happens when you're under the microscope for 40 years.\nBut what sets Hillary apart is that through it all, she just keeps on going and she doesn't stop caring and she doesn't stop trying and she never stops fighting for us, even if we haven't always appreciated it.\nAnd look, I understand we're a young country, we are a restless country. We always like the new, shiny thing. I benefited from that when I was a candidate. And we take for granted sometimes what is steady and true. And Hillary Clinton is steady, and she is true. And the young people who are here, who all you've been seeing is just the nonsense that's been on TV. You maybe don't remember all the work that she has had to do and all the things she has had to overcome and all the good that has happened because of her efforts. But you need to remember. You need to understand this.\nAnd if you're serious about our democracy, then you've got to be with her. She's in the arena, and you can't leave her in there by herself. You've got to get in there with her. You can't stay home because, oh, I—she's been around for a long time. Well, you know what? This is not reality TV. Democracy is not a spectator sport. You don't tweet in your vote.\nAmerica is not about \"yes, he will,\" it's about \"yes, we can.\" Yes, we can. Yes, we can create more good jobs. Yes, we can create better schools. Yes, we can create safer streets. Yes, we can create a more secure world.\nAudience members. Yes, we can! Yes, we can! Yes, we can!\nThe President. We can bring about real change and real progress. And the time has come for me to pass the baton on, but I know that Hillary is going to take it and she's going to run that race and she will finish that race. And that's why I'm with her. That's why I'm fired up. That's why I'm ready to go. And I need you to join me.\nI need you to work as hard for Hillary as you did for me. I need you to knock on doors. I need you to make phone calls. You've got to talk to your friends, including your Republican friends. You need to go to iwillvote.com and register to vote by October 11. Then, you've got to go to the polls, and you've got to get people to go to the polls. And if you're willing to do that with me, we'll win in November. We'll elect Hillary Clinton the next President of the United States. We will continue on this journey to create a better America and a fairer America, a more just America, a more loving America, a brighter America.\nThat's what we're fighting for. That's why I need you. Let's get busy. Let's get to work.\nThank you, Philadelphia. God bless you. God bless these United States of America.", "timestamp": "2016-09-13", "title": "Remarks at a Campaign Rally for Democratic Presidential Nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania"}

And when other countries flout the rules to try and undercut American workers and farmers, we hold them accountable. That's what my administration has done consistently in taking more claims to the World Trade Organization than any other country, and that's exactly what we're doing once again today by filing our latest complaint against China before the WTO.\nChina's Government has set prices for wheat, corn, and rice well above market levels, which has led to unfair Government subsidies that are in violation of WTO rules. These unfairly distorted prices on important crops lead to overproduction in China and disadvantage American farmers who export these same crops around the world.\nThis is the 14th WTO case we've launched against China since I took office and the 23d overall, and we've won every case that's been decided. We're confident the case we're bringing today will be no different: it should bring an end to China's illegal subsidies, remove significant barriers on American exports, and level the playing field for American farmers and their families who rely on the rice, wheat, and corn industries and the hundreds of thousands of jobs they help support.\nBut it's not enough to enforce the existing rules. As our global economy evolves, we have to ensure America plays a leading role in setting the highest standards for the rest of the world to follow. That's what the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, is all about: putting American workers, farmers, and businesses first. It protects American innovation and intellectual property, enforces groundbreaking environmental and labor commitments, expands export opportunities for our farmers and businesses, and sets the highest benchmarks in history for holding America's trading partners accountable. It's all the more important that we finalize TPP soon, because as we speak, China is negotiating a trade deal of its own, one that would carve up the growing Asia-Pacific markets at our expense, risking American jobs, businesses, and goods. Unless we act now to set our own high standards, the fast-growing Asia-Pacific will be forced to play by lower standard rules that we didn't set. We can't let that happen.", "timestamp": "2016-09-13", "title": "Statement on the United States Trade Enforcement Action Against China"}

In his remarks, he referred to Democratic Presidential nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton; Republican Presidential nominee Donald J. Trump; and President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia. Audio was not available for verification of the content of these remarks.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118962", "text": "Thank you, everybody. Thank you so much. Everybody have a seat. Well, first of all, let me thank Jim and Crystal for their incredible hospitality and this beautiful home. And we are very, very appreciative of them.\nA couple other people I need to acknowledge. First of all, the Chairman of the DCCC, Ben Ray Luján is right here. A thankless job, but he's always got a smile on his face. [Laughter]\nAnd I have to introduce somebody who I believe will go down as one of the finest public servants we've ever had and has been a partner on every single thing I've done, especially the tough stuff, because she has principles, she's tough, she's smart, she's practical, and she cares about the right stuff. She cares about all these beautiful grandchildren that she constantly is bringing to these things. [Laughter] So I just could not be prouder of her: Nancy Pelosi.\nAnd let me mention New York's own, Steve Israel. Where is Steve? There he is.\nSo the tradition at these kinds of gatherings, because they're pretty intimate, is I'll just say a few things and then we'll open it up for questions and comments.\nJim stole some of my best lines. [Laughter] But let me just amplify the Census report that came out today, which—economists are different. So my chief economist Jason Furman explained to me that this is the Super Bowl for economists, the Census report. I didn't think it was as exciting as a Super Bowl. [Laughter] I wouldn't have bought commercials for this event. But this is the most comprehensive snapshot of the economy that we receive each year. And the headline news is that incomes rose last year more than any time on record. More than any time on record, over 5 percent.\nAnd what was particularly striking was that they rose for every demographic: every race, men and women, every quintile. The increases were particularly stark for the lowest income Americans and middle-income Americans, although everybody saw improvement.\nPoverty went down last year more sharply than any time since 1968. And the pay gap between men and women closed so that, although it is still there, still nagging, it is now the smallest that it has ever been. It confirmed the reports that we had already seen that the number of uninsured are lower than they have ever been in the United States.\nAnd if you combine that with some of the other statistics that Jim mentioned, the picture we have is not of an economy that is at full potential. There are still a lot of folks out there unemployed, underemployed. Because of a previous decade of flat or declining wage growth, income growth, there is still catching up to do. But what we see is a serious recovery from what was the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, one in which actually the economy contracted faster than it did in 1929. It's just that we stopped it faster and more effectively than they did during the Great Depression.\nNow, this is not a cause to run victory laps, because people do feel as if even if their own circumstances are better, they worry about are their kids going to be able to succeed. They worry about student debt. They worry about the vulnerabilities that were revealed as a consequence of the post-Lehman world. They worry about globalization. They worry about technology. They worry about foreign competition. And those fears are real, and they are justified.\nBut what it does argue is that we have been moving in the right direction, that the trend lines are sound, that good policy matters, that the decisions we made early—decisions that often were unpopular—paid off. It means that facts and evidence are important and that you need a President and a Congress that makes decisions based on facts and evidence.\nSo I think you kind of know where I'm going here. We have one Presidential candidate, one set of congressional candidates, who look at the facts, look at the evidence, study policy, and conclude that climate change is real; that budgets should add up; that we should be investing in infrastructure to put millions of Americans back to work, with ripple effects throughout the economy; that investing in early childhood education is a smart thing to do; that equal pay for equal work will benefit men and women and families; that raising minimum wages in an economy that is increasingly service based is not going to destroy jobs; that putting more money in the pockets of ordinary people and consumers will, in fact, be good for business; that we should be investing in research and development; that we have the capacity to provide health insurance for all Americans and do it smarter and better, with higher quality, more satisfaction, and ultimately lower costs, because we're investing more on the front end than on the back end.\nSo that's one set of folks. And then, you have another set of people who basically believe in the opposite: don't believe in climate change; insist on austerity even when that's bad economics; put forward tax breaks for folks who don't need them, but will explode the deficit; underfund human capital; underfund research; reject the idea that we can develop clean energy in a way that's good for our economy; think that the pay gap between men and women is imaginary or a matter of women's decisions; and want to make sure that women can make the decision to make less money, but not the decision to control their own bodies and their own health care. And it doesn't matter to them that the facts do not match their positions and have been repeatedly refuted.\nI mean, one of the things about having a crisis is, is that you actually end up having some interesting experiments playing themselves out over time. So the Republican recipe for economic recovery was actually tried for quite some time in Europe, and they still have not recovered from 2007. But it doesn't matter because their positions are based on ideology.\nSo I recognize the degree to which politics has been discouraging over the last several years. The Congress has been discouraging over the last several years, since Nancy Pelosi wasn't Speaker. And the degree to which the current majorities in the House and the Senate—but we're focused here on the House today—can't even pass their own priorities, so that I don't generally even have to veto anything because they can't get organized enough even to present the cockamamie legislation that they're interested in passing—[laughter]—I recognize must be discouraging for people.\nAnd we get all these strange distractions of—here's one that's coming up. There's a strong faction in the House of Representatives right now whose major priority is impeaching our IRS Commissioner. You're laughing. This is, like, a big deal. This has never happened before. And the reason, is not because this guy is venal or he somehow stole money or abused his office. The reason is, is because stuff that happened before he even got into office. He responded to inquiries from one of the many congressional hearings to try to ferret out a scandal and, I guess, left some documents out inadvertently, and they decided, well, this is a good reason to impeach the guy. This is crazy. And yes, no wonder then, people end up being discouraged and dispirited.\nSo we have made progress despite an opposition party, which has been now in the majority in Congress for the last 2 years, which is not functioning. Look, I recognize I am the head of the Democratic Party and that necessarily makes me a partisan. But I'm actually not somebody who believes Democrat—I think back to 2008, and I meant what I said. I don't think any party traditionally has a monopoly on what's right. I come from the Land of Lincoln. Richard Nixon set up the EPA. The Civil Rights Act was passed by Lyndon Johnson, but also a whole bunch of Republican votes. So it's not inevitable that this is what we deal with, but it is what's going on right now.\nAnd that is why you have to take this race so seriously. It is a cliché that every election is the most important in our lifetime. But I've got to tell you—[laughter]—this one? This one counts. You have a nominee of a major party that shows no awareness of just basic, rudimentary domestic or foreign policy; advertises his ignorance every day; who proclaims his role model for leadership is Vladimir Putin. Think about that.\nThis is the party that extolls freedom and America and the flag and Ronald Reagan, and whose main criticism of me lately has been my tyrannical abuse of power: that I'm trying to take away their guns and I'm filing executive actions and I'm circumventing the Constitution. And we're going to nominate the guy who actively promotes and admires a guy who jails dissidents and controls all state media, all media in his country, and hence has an 82 percent approval rating.\nCan you imagine what my approval rating would be if all those folks lined up in the back worked for me—[laughter]—and I was writing their stories? Wow. [Laughter] I'd be doing really well. I'm doing okay as it is, but—so you've got that, but also somebody who's explicitly tapping into some of the worst impulses in each of us, the notion that somebody who's not like me is bad, is dangerous, is not a real American.\nAnd we followed that path before. That's woven into our history. And it's woven into world history, and it usually turns out really badly.\nAnd we have a Congress that purports to want to be a champion for working class and middle class folks, but cannot describe any concrete proposals that would actually help the working class and the middle class and deal with the challenges of this new global economy.\nSo I say all this because this shouldn't be close, but it's close. The Presidential race we should win, but Donald Trump got the nomination, so weird stuff happens. [Laughter] The House we have a chance to win because the Republican nominee has revealed the dysfunction of that party for quite some time. But it's hard. Because of gerrymandering and entrenched incumbents, it's going to be challenging. But we have a chance.\nSo we have to make this investment now. And I'm not on the ballot, and in 6 months, I'll be a private citizen once again. But I have two daughters, and I hope I'll have some grandkids—not too soon. [Laughter] But sometime. And I genuinely believe that the basic character of this country and our capacity to meet the challenges that all of you are aware of is dependent on what happens now. The stakes are really high.\nSo I need all of you to step up. And if you do, I think that the American people will make the right choice and Nancy Pelosi will be Speaker again and Hillary Clinton will be President, and Chuck Schumer of New York will be Majority Leader. And we'll have a burst of productivity like we did the last time we had a Democratic President and Democratic majority, and we'll lay the groundwork for more prosperity and security in the future.\nThank you.", "timestamp": "2016-09-13", "title": "Remarks at a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Fundraiser in New York City"}
{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118886", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n**Please see below for a correction, marked with an asterisk.\n1:26 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. I do not have any announcements at the top, so, Kevin, we can go straight to your questions.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. So with the easing of sanctions on Burma, is the administration taking away its leverage to improve conditions for the Rohingya Muslim community and to force changes to that nation's constitution?\nMR. EARNEST: Kevin, I think, if anything, we're enhancing it. The more deeply that the United States engages in a country like Burma, the more success we can have in encouraging them to pursue reforms. I think that's been documented in the President's engagement with Burma over the last seven and a half years of his presidency.\nYou'll recall when President Obama took office, Aung San Suu Kyi, who is the leader of the country, and was in the Oval Office of the President of the United States earlier today, was a prisoner in her own house. So I think the progress that's been made in that country has been remarkable.\nAnd as the United States has pursued a policy of deepening our engagement in Burma, critics all along have suggested that there's a risk associated with that kind of engagement, and in some ways, that it was too soon for the United States to be pursuing that kind of engagement. So this was the criticism that we heard from some when the Obama administration decided to appoint an ambassador to Burma. People suggested that that was rewarding bad behavior. This is also criticism that we heard in advance of the President's first trip to Burma, the suggestion that it was too soon for the President to be visiting Burma.\nBut I think what we found at each stage is that by more deeply engaging with Burma, we have been able to influence and encourage greater reforms that are consistent with our national interest and consistent with our own values. And of course, there's more work that needs to be done. The President and Aung San Suu Kyi both acknowledged that in the Oval Office.\nWe certainly have been heartened by the increased commitment that we have seen from her government to addressing the human rights concerns in Rakhine State. We certainly welcomed her inclusion of Kofi Annan in those efforts. Providing that kind of international input on the process I think can give the international community greater confidence that Aung San Suu Kyi's government in Burma is taking those reforms seriously. And that's a good thing.\nQ: Domestic policy. The California congressional delegation is calling on the administration to approve a waiver that would allow undocumented immigrants to purchase unsubsidized health insurance through Covered California, that state's Medicaid program. Is that a concept that the administration is supportive of?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, I have to acknowledge I've not seen the letter that you're referring to, so I'm not sure I can respond to their specific request. As you know -- and I guess this is evident from their letter -- that the way that the Affordable Care Act is currently written, individuals who are undocumented immigrants are not eligible to collect benefits associated with the Affordable Care Act. I know that's been the subject of some fearmongering, or even outright lying on the part of Republicans.\nQ: And they are stressing the word \"unsubsidized.\"\nMR. EARNEST: So, I haven't seen that proposal, so I'm just not in a position to react to it. But we'll take a look at the letter and see if we can get you a response.\nAyesha.\nQ: More on the visit today. Senator Corker released a statement after the meeting with Suu Kyi saying that he was somewhat appalled by her reaction to his concerns about human rights violations in that country. I was wondering, during the President's conversations with Suu Kyi, what was his -- did he have any response to the way -- or what were the discussions about human rights, and did he come away with a similar feeling about her reactions to his concerns or to the U.S. concerns about human rights?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President made clear in the meeting that it's important for the Burmese government to uphold the human rights of all religious and ethnic groups inside of Burma. And we have seen, since Aung San Suu Kyi assumed office, a greater commitment to the pursuit of reforms that will protect human rights. There's been a greater effort to recognize the citizenship of the -- or the rights of the citizens of Burma in Rakhine State. And there has been the inclusion of Kofi Annan in that process, which is something that we welcome.\nAnd there certainly is more work that needs to be done, and there needs to be a sustained commitment to these kinds of reforms. That reflects the priority that the United States places on universal human rights and ensuring that they're protected by governments all around the world.\nI think all of you had a chance to hear directly from her in the Oval Office indicate that she intended to make that a priority. And we certainly would welcome those kinds of comments, because there's a lot of important work that remains to be done.\nQ: On the Dakota pipeline, there was a protest outside the White House yesterday -- I believe Senator Sanders spoke at that -- and there were protests around the country. So is the President following these protests at all? And does the administration have any response to -- I think Senator Sanders has introduced an amendment that would stop the Corps from issuing any permits for that pipeline until an environmental impact statement has been completed. Does the administration support that move?\nMR. EARNEST: I do not know that the President was aware of the protest yesterday. Obviously, the President was on the road for most of the day, so I don't even know if he was here when that protest was organized.\nI think I can just say in general that the administration's policy speaks for itself, which is that despite winning an order from a judge who indicated that the process had been properly followed, and that the Department of Interior and the Army Corps of Engineers could move forward with the project, the Army Corps voluntarily stated that they would pause the project to ensure that the consideration of everyone's views and perspective, particularly those who are most directly affected by the project, are carefully and properly considered.\nAnd so that will be the next step in the process. The President certainly believes that's an appropriate course of action. In this case, we're talking about individuals who are Native Americans. And there is a rather sad chapter in our history with regard to the federal government not effectively looking out for the concerns of Native populations in this country. And that's left a legacy, and it's one that this administration is certainly determined to address. In this instance, it means ensuring that the process that is in place for the construction of this pipeline has adequately considered the impact it will have on everybody who lives in the area, including tribal populations who live in the area.\nQ: Does the administration think it's time to overhaul the way these type of projects are permitted in general? I mean, obviously this isn't the first pipeline that has run into protest, and there have been a lot of these issues that are ongoing.\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah, I think that might be a little bit of an oversimplification of the situation. The Keystone Pipeline, which obviously was a subject of intense debate and public demonstration for a number of years -- the issues related to the construction of that pipeline are somewhat different than the issues that have arisen in the context of this one.\nSo in this case, the Army Corps has voluntarily indicated that they'll pause this project to ensure that in the context of this project, the concerns of everybody who could potentially be affected were adequately taken into account.\nThey've also indicated a willingness to go back and make sure that all infrastructure projects that they're involved in adequately consider the views and rights of affected populations, including tribal populations. And that's an appropriate step for them to take.\nMary.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. In the past 24 hours, we've seen the release of information hacked from the DNC, Colin Powell, even American Olympians -- hacks coming from groups with suspected ties to Russia. Is this another example of Russia attempting to meddle in the U.S. election? And what is the President considering? Or what recourse does the U.S. have to try and stem this flow of embarrassing leaks? Are new sanctions, for instance, on the table?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Mary, I think -- obviously I've seen the reports of the variety of cyber intrusions and leaks that have emerged in the last 24 hours or so. The United States has not made a formal determination in public about who may or may not be responsible for these kinds of -- for these incidents. The motivation for each of them I think is likely different. I know that you asked about it in the context of the election. I'm not sure that the reprehensible release of the personal health information of U.S. Olympians has anything to do with the election. It may have to do with some other things that have been well documented.\nBut what I can just say in general is that all this does serve as an illustration of how it's important for our policymakers to make cybersecurity a top priority. And unfortunately, the United States Congress has failed to do that.\nThere is more that Congress should do. The President included in his fiscal year 2017 budget a significant increase in funding for cybersecurity that would not just enhance our cyber capabilities but also improve our ability to work more effectively to investigate cyber intrusions when they occur and to work with the private sector to deter potential incursions. As we've discussed in here many times, the Congress refused to even have a hearing on that budget. And Republicans have essentially said that they're refusing to talk about that proposal to enhance our cybersecurity.\nThat's unfortunate. That's an indication that Republicans are failing to even discuss what should be a top national security priority, particularly given the widespread reports and the conclusion reached by some professionals outside the government that Russia is likely responsible. That certainly seems like something that should get the attention of Republicans in Congress.\nUnfortunately, it hasn't. And the good news, however, is that this administration has not just relied on Congress to take steps to try to protect the American people from cybersecurity. Over the last couple of years, we've seen the President convene a summit, bringing together technology experts, leaders in the private sector and national security figures to discuss what can be done to enhance our nation's national security.\nThe President signed an executive order designating new authority to the Secretary of Treasury that would allow him to impose financial sanctions on countries or individuals that are suspected of involvement with cyber intrusions. That is new authority that gives the United States government additional options when it comes to responding to these kinds of situations. The President has prioritized in his multilateral meetings, including most recently at the G20, the effort to establish internationally accepted norms when it comes to conduct in cyberspace. And we've gotten additional commitments from the Chinese with regard to some of those international norms. That enhances the security of the United States.\nAnd look, the time has come for Republicans in Congress to do their part, and we certainly would like to see them do more. I think the last thing that I will note here is that over the weekend, the CIA Director, John Brennan, was asked about this. And he noted that Russia -- and this is a quote here -- \"has exceptionally capable and sophisticated cyber capabilities in terms of collection, as well as whatever else it might want to do in that cyber sphere.\" So we have known this for quite a while. So I think this is an indication that the President and his national security team are not just keenly aware of the situation but have taken aggressive steps to try to counter it. And we would welcome Republicans in Congress doing their part for a change.\nQ: And on Syria, there reportedly is a significant difference of opinion, shall we say, between the Secretary of Defense and Secretary Kerry about partnering with Russia. If the ceasefire holds, is the President concerned about implementing or developing this next phase, whatever that may be, because of this disagreement?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let's start by acknowledging that the \"if\" that is included in your question is a sizeable one. There remains significant doubt inside the administration and around the world about the capacity and willingness of the Russians to fulfill the responsibilities that they've accepted in this arrangement. And that skepticism is not just well-documented, but I think entirely reasonable given the way that we have seen the Russians and the Assad regime behave over the course of the last year or two. So that's a big \"if.\" And I feel like that's an appropriate place to start.\nFrom there, the President and his Secretary of State have both spoken publicly about how deeply concerned the United States is about the humanitarian situation inside of Syria. And our efforts to engage diplomatically with the Russians is rooted in the knowledge that the Russians have more influence over the Assad regime than anybody else. And the Assad regime has been the chief impediment to the delivery of humanitarian aid to hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of innocent civilians that have been caught in the crossfire in Syria, including in places like Aleppo.\nSo this has been the best opportunity that the United States has to try to reduce the violence and allow for the unimpeded delivery of humanitarian assistance. And that's what we have been trying to -- that's the result that we have been trying to bring about.\nWhen the President discusses complicated issues, like Syria, with members of his national security team, he's not looking for a bunch of people that have exactly the same opinion. The President is not looking for a group of people to sit around the table with him in the Situation Room, who all nod their head every time that he speaks. What the President is looking for are informed experts who do their homework and who can make an argument, and assist him in crafting a policy that advances the best interests of the United States.\nThat's why the President is enormously proud of the people who serve on his national security team. At the same time, the President is entirely confident that once he's made a decision, that he can count on the members of his team to execute that strategy with excellence. And he's confident that every member of his national security team is committed to that goal.\nMichelle.\nQ: Many times when we've heard you talk about the President's goal on the trail, and in the instances where he's talking about the election, his goal is to support Hillary Clinton as the most qualified candidate. But what we heard a lot of yesterday in his speech was as if he was trying to prove that Donald Trump is not qualified. So would you say that that is now a big part of the President's goal when he's out there?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the President's goal is to ensure that he's succeeded in the Oval Office by somebody who is committed to building on the progress that we've made over the last eight years. And Secretary Clinton is the only candidate who has indicated that she's committed to building on that progress. I'd put her in the category -- as I was just answering Mary's question -- of somebody who obviously doesn't agree with the President on every single policy issue.\nBut when it comes to their values and their priorities, and their vision for the country that's rooted in expanding economic opportunity for the middle class, equality for all, advancing U.S. interests around the world, their visions are quite similar. And the President has got enormous confidence in her ability to lead this country in a direction that will continue to strengthen it and make progress in a direction that he's been fighting for, for the last eight years.\nQ: In the last couple of months, though, sometimes when he would be asked about the election, he would decline to weigh in, or he didn't want to go into a lot of detail. And that seems to have completely changed, especially given what we heard him say yesterday -- I mean, going into a great deal of detail. So what has changed to make him much more willing to -- is it just the way --\nMR. EARNEST: I think that's the second the campaign event that the President has done for Secretary Clinton, and so I wouldn't be surprised, in the context of those campaign events, he's talking more about the campaign. I think that's what's changed.\nQ: Literally, every time he's questioned by reporters, a question about the campaign comes up, and a question about Donald Trump comes up almost every single time. So he just seems much more willing now to go into detail, to attack Donald Trump, to hit out against the Republican Party with much more specificity, too, than he did before. So is it just the way that the campaigns have evolved? Does he feel that now is the time to do more of that? I'm just trying to get a sense of what he's thinking.\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah, I guess we're less than eight weeks before an election, and so the President has engaged some more on that argument.\nQ: Okay. And so does he feel that that -- I mean, are we going to hear more from him on that? Does he feel like this is --\nMR. EARNEST: The President certainly does intend to campaign extensively for Secretary Clinton. He's obviously got a day job that he's very focused on, serving as President of the United States. So, for example, next week he'll be devoting the majority of his week to participating in the meeting at the United Nation, of the General Assembly. The President did devote a lot of his time in the last couple of weeks to traveling overseas. So the President has got a busy schedule, but he certainly is going to look for every opportunity that he can to go out and advocate for Secretary Clinton's election for all the reasons that he detailed yesterday.\nQ: That's what I'm saying. I mean, often when we would ask, you would really highlight Hillary Clinton's qualifications, and that that's what he wanted to focus on. And you even would say that he doesn't really see his role as trying to win voters away from the Republican side necessarily, but to motivate the base and to highlight Hillary Clinton's accomplishments. That's what we heard again and again. So, at this point, does the President feel like focusing on those positive attributes is not enough, and now he wants to pinpoint things about the Republican campaign that he feels are wrong?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, no -- I think the President chiefly is determined to go and make an affirmative case in support of Secretary Clinton's campaign because he feels quite strongly that she is the most qualified and most effective person in America to succeed him. Fortunately, she is the person that's also been nominated by the Democratic Party to succeed him.\nSo the President is going to make an ardent, passionate case in support of her election. What's also true is there's a choice, and there's a clear contrast. And the President hasn't shied away from pointing out the contrast in their approaches or their experience, or their values either.\nQ: Yesterday we heard pretty strongly from Mitch McConnell that Republicans would not take up the Garland nomination even in a lame duck session, no matter how the election turns out. Did they make that clear in the meeting that leadership had with the President the other day? And are you willing to concede that this now is just not going to happen?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm certainly not going to concede that. It's a curious election strategy that Republicans are going to down to the wire insisting that they won't do their job. It's a curious way to make the case that you should be rehired for a job. But I'll let them struggle with that challenge.\nThe President continues to insist that Merrick Garland is the right person to represent the American people on the Supreme Court, to serve the American people on the Supreme Court. He's got more experience in the federal judiciary than any Supreme Court nominee in American history. He's somebody that Republicans have repeatedly described as a good man, a bright legal mind, and as a consensus pick.\nSo there's no excuse that Republicans have for not doing their job other than they're hoping that a Republican will get an opportunity to choose the next person on the Supreme Court. And that is an unprecedented injection of partisan politics into this process. Senator Graham said the same thing -- \"unprecedented\" is his word, not mine. And that's unfortunate, and I think it does risk further erosion in public confidence in our judicial system. But that's a result of Republican actions.\nQ: Did they talk about this in the meeting the other day?\nMR. EARNEST: I know this came up in the meeting, but I'll let the members of Congress characterize what comments they made to the President.\nJordan.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Senator Durbin said today that he wants Secretary Clinton to stick with Merrick Garland's nomination if she's elected, but she herself hasn't committed to doing that. Do you agree with Senator Durbin that if Garland isn't confirmed by the time the President leaves office, that the Secretary should stick with him?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, the President believes that the Congress should confirm his nominee to the Supreme Court, Merrick Garland. And as I pointed out to Michelle, I'm not willing to concede that the United States Senate will continue to not do their job. At some point -- well, look, we're going to continue to press the case that they should.\nIf that doesn't happen, then the responsibility will fall to the next President. And the President I think has made quite clear in unambiguous terms why he believes that Chief Judge Garland is the right person for the job. And hopefully that will get done before January 20th.\nQ: On another topic -- the Obama administration's proposal to take in 110,000 refugees next year. Senator Sessions, perhaps not surprisingly, was quite critical of this, and he proposed creating safe zones in Syria for refugees. I know this is something that the President has rejected before, but was there any internal discussions about revisiting that idea before you put out your revised number for next year?\nMR. EARNEST: No.\nMike.\nQ: On Burma, the President said in the Oval Office that sanctions would be lifted soon. Can you give us more specific timing, and whether that includes all sanctions or what might remain?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any update on timing. You can consult with my colleagues at the Treasury Department. Obviously they're responsible for administering these sanctions. And they'll have an announcement, I believe the President said, in coming days. And so we'll leave it to them.\nQ: Will all sanctions be lifted?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, we'll let the Treasury Department make the announcement about the change that the President has ordered.\nQ: On the -- something else. Senator Cruz has said he wants to attach to the CR his proposal to prevent the government from transferring control of the Internet domain names. Would that provoke a veto from the President if that were attached to the CR?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, first of all, we should point out the ironic position of the small-government advocate suggesting that the federal government should continue to be in control of Internet domain names. This is a -- the position that he has taken is, frankly, not really supported by anybody.\nObviously, the industry technology experts, business community, and the largest Internet companies -- like Facebook, Google and Twitter -- have described it as imperative that the transition move forward. And so it would be quite unwise for the United States Congress to block the transition.\nWe've made clear that the administration believes that Congress should pass a short-term CR that doesn't include any ideological riders. And the reason that Congress needs to do that is because Republicans have failed to fulfill their responsibility to fund the government, and they need, apparently, more time to try to work out budget bills for next year. So the President believes that they should pass a short-term CR, buy themselves enough time to do that work, and come back after the elections, and get it done. And the President doesn't believe that either of those -- that that process of extending the time that Congress has to do their work should be encumbered by a set of ideological riders.\nQ: Are you willing to say whether this ideological rider would provoke a veto?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, at this point, I think it is too early to get into the mode of saying which cockamamie proposals that are floated by Republicans would draw a veto threat from the President of the United States. So at this point, I think we'll just leave it at it should be free of ideological riders.\nI think that there are real questions that are raised by whether or not a continuing resolution that included a provision like the one that Senator Cruz has described is one that would pass either the Senate or the House, given the uniform opposition to what he is advocating.\nQ: And lastly, parallel to Michelle's question, did the congressional leaders and the President discuss their willingness to consider TPP ratification in a lame duck session? And what did they tell you?\nMR. EARNEST: I know this is an issue that came up, but I don't have additional details about the meeting to share at this point. And for what members of Congress told the President, I'd refer you to their offices.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, on hacking, you told Mary that there's been no determination in public of who is responsible.\nMR. EARNEST: That is correct.\nQ: Has there been one in private?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, decisions about making public any conclusions that have been reached about the investigation is something that the FBI will decide.\nQ: Is it your understanding it's still under investigation?\nMR. EARNEST: I think my colleagues at the FBI have indicated that it continues to be under investigation. So any details that are released about the investigation will be released at their discretion, based on what they believe enhances our national security interests and what advances the investigation.\nQ: On the meeting in the Oval Office today, I noticed your joint statement referred to the \"Republic of Myanmar.\" Is that now a new policy? Do you now refer to Burma as Myanmar?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think on a previous visit, we indicated that the government -- that the U.S. government was also willing to refer to the country as Burma. So I believe that the two names are, at this point, basically used interchangeably.\nQ: Interchangeable?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes.\nQ: And any guidance on timing of the veto of the 9/11 lawsuit bill?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have an update for you in terms of timing, but the President -- as you know, we received the bill on Monday evening, and the President does intend to veto it.\nRon.\nQ: On the hacking thing, is this just a matter of the FBI not being able to complete its work, or the administration not being able to determine who is behind all this stuff? Because there seems to be a disconnect between what we hear in public from, as you put it, so many professionals, and other administration officials -- the CIA Director almost insinuating that it's the Russians. But the administration, on the record, just can't seem to figure it out. What's the problem here?\nMR. EARNEST: Ron, I think for questions about the FBI investigation, you should go talk to the FBI.\nQ: So that's it? This is a legality? You have a sense of -- what more specifically did the President say to President Putin about the hacking problem? When he came out he talked about how we can't escalate this into an arms race and we need norms, so on and so forth. How pointed were their discussions about hacking specifically in recent months?\nMR. EARNEST: I think in talking about the conversation that he had with President Putin, President Obama acknowledged that he spoke rather directly to President Putin about a range of issues, including how seriously the United States takes cybersecurity. So their conversation was direct about that, but I don't have a whole lot of details to share.\nQ: Do you think that President Putin was left with the impression that the United States firmly believes that the Russians are behind some of these incidences?\nMR. EARNEST: I guess you have to ask President Putin's spokesperson what impression he was left with after the meeting.\nQ: And on Syria, you talked about how there is so much skepticism and doubt about the ceasefire, and we're in day two, so on and so forth. So are there active discussions underway? Is there an engagement between the United States and Russia about the military plan that would happen, even though there is this skepticism? Or is this skepticism and doubt blocking that? Because, again, you would think that this has to be carried out quickly, expeditiously. There should be some planning going on. You can't just start coordinating airstrikes out of the blue -- pardon the pun. But I'm trying to reconcile the skepticism with the actual need for a real solution on the ground.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the need for a real solution on the ground is one that addresses our most urgent concern, which is about the humanitarian situation inside of Syria. Right now, the United States is obviously working very effectively with our counter-ISIL coalition to take the fight to ISIL. And we've enjoyed important progress on the ground in Iraq and in Syria in taking back ground from ISIL, in taking senior ISIL leaders off the battlefield. The Department of Defense recently confirmed that the strike against Adnani succeeded. This was one of the leading ISIL figures that was responsible for organizing a lot of their external plots.\nSo our top priority overall is protecting the American people and protecting our national security. And that means going after urgent threats to our national security, like ISIL.\nQ: Is there, in fact, planning going on right now between the Russians and the United States military about how to execute airstrikes into Syria?\nMR. EARNEST: There's not. Right now, the United States and our 65 or 66 coalition partners are prosecuting our campaign against ISIL.\nQ: So if there's no planning, how could this actually begin in four or five days?\nMR. EARNEST: Ron, it's important for you to consider exactly the structure of this agreement. The structure of this agreement is that the Cessation of Hostilities is something that will be observed by all of the parties to the agreement, including the Russians and including the Assad regime, for seven days. And in that seven days, we will see the unimpeded flow of humanitarian assistance to those communities that need it the most, including in Aleppo. After we have seen that sustained commitment to the Cessation of Hostilities arrangement, then the United States would begin discussions about military coordination with the Russians, and not before then.\nAnd the reason for that is the United States is already making progress in targeting ISIL and in targeting other extremists, including al Nusra, which is the al Qaeda presence inside of Syria. That's been our top priority since the very first day that the President ordered military action inside of Syria a couple years ago.\nQ: It seems there are no military -- there are no humanitarian convoys moving yet.\nMR. EARNEST: We haven't seen the kind of -- the unimpeded flow of humanitarian relief that we'd like to see at this point. I know that Mr. de Mistura, the U.N. envoy, expressed his own significant concerns about this just yesterday. And we haven't seen the kind of movement that we'd like to see yet. But we're obviously monitoring the situation closely, and we continue to call on the Russians and the Assad regime to live up to the commitments that were made in the context of this arrangement.\nQ: On Suu Kyi meeting, one thing. Did the issue of her not being able to become president come up in their discussions and in the context of the discussions about lifting the sanctions or not?\nMR. EARNEST: I know there was a discussion about sanctions. The President referred to that in the pool spray. As it relates to this question about her eligibility for the presidency in Burma, I don't frankly know if that came up in their conversation, but we can check on it.\nQ: And if I could have one more. Do you ever watch the Dr. Oz Show? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: I can tell you that I've never seen the Dr. Oz Show.\nQ: Do you plan to watch the Dr. Oz Show at all?\nMR. EARNEST: Not today. (Laughter.)\nQ: No, it's tomorrow.\nMR. EARNEST: Not tomorrow either. (Laughter.)\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, the Obama administration is about to give nearly a $40-billion military aid package to Israel, which the State Department is calling the largest ever given to any country in American history. Why aren't you talking about it here at the White House, given what a tough relationship, well-documented in the public space, President Obama and Benjamin Netanyahu have had? And what do you make of some of the complaints that it's not enough?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I've only seen one person make that complaint. I think most people, including the Israeli government, including AIPAC -- which has not been shy about offering up their criticism of the Obama administration -- welcomed the completion of this agreement. Obviously the President made this a priority and identified the completion of a new memorandum of understanding as a national security priority three years ago now. So this agreement represents the culmination of a lot of work and a whole series of difficult negotiations, but negotiations that ultimately reflected the shared priorities between the United States and our closest ally in the Middle East, Israel.\nThe United States has, under Democratic and Republican presidents, made the safety and security of our Israeli allies a top national security priority. And I think this new memorandum of understanding is an indication that it's a priority that President Obama also shares. When it comes to the details of the memorandum of understanding, it's my understanding that it's being signed at the State Department right now. So I'll let the people who are involved in that event discuss the details of the memorandum of understanding, but I can certainly tell you from here that it reflects the high priority that President Obama has placed on the national security of our closest allies in the Middle East.\nQ: But given that it is the largest ever given to any country in the history of America, why isn't that happening here? And given what you know has been a very politically heated issue, and this President has been attacked because of the Iran deal, his support that you just said, unquestioned, towards Israel has been questioned by Republicans, by Israelis, and this has been a very heated issue. It would seem that you would want to broadcast this a bit more. Is there a reason it's being downplayed?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I would contest the notion that this is being downplayed. The President announced the fact that we were going to pursue this memorandum of understanding at a news conference in Israel, standing next to the Israeli Prime Minister. And that was back in 2013.\nQ: But that was before it was $38 billion dollars.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think what we have made clear all along is that this is a priority. The details are important, the details will be discussed by the President's national security advisor over at the State Department, and I think that's an indication of just how important this policy is and the priority that the President has made the completion of this memorandum of understanding.\nQ: On Russia, did any U.S. agency give any assistance to the World Anti-Doping Agency to come to their conclusion about who was responsible for hacking the information of American athletes? And are any U.S. agencies helping now?\nMR. EARNEST: As I learned today, the World Anti-Doping Agency is actually located in Montreal, Canada, and I know that they have indicated that Canadian authorities were investigating this cyber intrusion. And I would expect that at some point soon that U.S. authorities would be in touch with their Canadian counterparts about this. But I can't speak to any specific conversations that have taken place at this point.\nQ: So you don't question their conclusion that it was a group of Russian hackers?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm sorry -- can you say that again?\nQ: They have very publically said that they were Russian hackers who were responsible for this. Does the U.S. have any reason to question that conclusion?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, this is based on an investigation that was conducted by Canadian authorities. And look, I would expect that U.S. authorities would be in touch with the Canadians about it, but I don't have any of our own conclusion to share at this point.\nQ: On Russia, when the President was speaking yesterday at that political rally, he spent a lot of time talking about -- the comparison, Donald Trump to Vladimir Putin. Is there a reason he spent an amount of time doing that, given how delicate the diplomacy is with Russia right now on this Syria deal; given that the U.S. is now agreeing to share military intelligence with Russia? I know they're not there yet, but they came to that agreement and the President signed off on it. Doesn't he worry that that would damage the very fragile agreement?\nMR. EARNEST: No, the President is not worried about that. I think the President's comments yesterday say a lot more about the Republican nominee than they do about the Russian President.\nQ: But is there a reason he spent so much time talking about Putin?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think the President's -- the comments speak for themselves. I think he thought that was a rather illuminating declaration from the Republican nominee, to compare himself to somebody who Republicans -- or at least the type of leader that Republicans have historically expressed deep concerns about. So, again, I think this is -- the President was at a rally, talking about the campaign for President; took most of his time talking about the Democratic nominee that he's endorsed, but did also spend some time discussing the concerns that he had with the comments and conduct of the Republican nominee, as well.\nQ: One more question on the Democratic nominee that the President has endorsed. I'm sure you've seen the very public emails from former Secretary of State and General Colin Powell in regard to the President and Hillary Clinton. In one of those exchanges with a Democratic mega-donor, there was the quote, \"I don't think the President would weep if she found herself in real legal trouble. She'll pummel his legacy if she gets a change, and he knows it.\" Does the President disagree with that assumption?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I know that there's been a lot of reporting on this. I think at this point, I'm not going to comment on the leaked emails of -- the leaked personal emails of a private citizen. So I know there's been some coverage on this. I'll let news rooms across the country make their own coverage decisions about what they feel is appropriate for the American public to consider. But I'm not going to have any comments on the contents of the private email of a private citizen.\nScott.\nQ: Josh, within that higher target for refugees in fiscal year '17, is there a new target for just Syrian refugees?\nMR. EARNEST: My understanding is that the State Department at this point has not put together a country-specific breakdown in terms of the goals that they expect to meet next year. The State Department has set a goal of admitting 110,000 refugees to the United States during the next fiscal year. And I know that there are some regional targets that they have set and communicated to Congress. But at this point, no country-specific targets have been set.\nQ: What's the regional target for whatever region --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it's slightly more complicated than that, but I do have the regional breakdown here. It includes -- the regional target for FY2017 is 40,000 for the Near East and South Asia region.\nQ: And is that up from what it was the last --\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not sure what it was the last fiscal year. But the thing that I'd caution you on is that there's unallocated reserve in this breakdown of about 14,000. So there's a little flexibility in this process. I think the thing that I will just reiterate is that it's important for people to remember that individuals who are admitted to the United States under this program have to undergo more rigorous screening and vetting than any other individual that enters the United States. The President places our national security at the top of his priority list. And that certainly is true with regard to considering the admission of refugees to the United States. At the same time, the President believes that the United States has a responsibility, as a leader on so many issues around the world, to play an important role in bringing refugees to the United States.\nAnd this is something that the President expects to discuss at the U.N. next week. He's going to convene a meeting with leaders from around the world to talk about what more countries around the world can do to address the refugee problem that's been so prominent over the last couple of years.\nQ: At UNGA, will he talk specifically about the U.S. upping its own target and setting an example?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President would -- the President is quite proud of the commitments that you've seen from the United States in addressing this issue. With regard to the situation inside of Syria, the United States is the largest bilateral donor of humanitarian assistance to assist those countries that are trying to meet the needs of innocent civilians that are fleeing violence.\nAnd with regard to the increased commitment for fiscal year 2017, that represents a 57-percent increase over, I believe, that's fiscal year 2015. So the United States has ramped up our commitment in recent years in a way that reflects the responsibility that the United States has to lead on these difficult issues.\nJosh. Nice to see you here.\nQ: A couple questions on the President's comments in Philadelphia yesterday about Trump's taxes. Is it fair to take from the fact that he brought this up I believe twice in the speech, that the President believes that it's important or valuable for votes to have information on Trump's taxes, or to see those returns before they go to the polls in November?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President believes that there's an important tradition in American politics. For decades, candidates in both parties, in the spirit of transparency, have released their tax returns. I know Secretary Clinton has done that, and the President believes that's important.\nQ: So, in that vein -- you probably don't have a copy of the Internal Revenue Code up there at the podium right now.\nMR. EARNEST: I do not.\nQ: But under Section 6103G, the President --\nMR. EARNEST: You brought it with you, though.\nQ: I just cut out that -- (laughter.) \"Upon written request by the President, signed by him personally, the Treasury Secretary can furnish to the President or to employees of the White House Office the President may designate a return or return information with respect to any taxpayer named in such a request.\" And the section goes on to say that as long as you or others have the personal written direction of the President, you're free to go ahead and release that.\nSo would the President feel this is so important that he'd be willing to get those returns from the Treasury and make them public if voters really should have this information by November?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I've not heard of this potential option. I think it is rather unlikely that the President would order something like that. And so if there's more on this with regard to our position about the interpretation of the statute, we'll consult the lawyers and let you know.\nQ: But you'd say it's rather unlikely because that would raise other concerns, or because of the history of the White House in release of tax information under prior Presidents?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think there are a couple of principles here. Certainly one thing that is important and certainly something that's been prioritized in this administration is making sure that the work of the IRS is not affected with even the appearance of political influence. And in this regard, obviously the President has made clear that he's a strong supporter of Secretary Clinton in the presidential race.\nI think the second thing, though, Josh, is this -- no other presidential nominee in either party has ever been compelled to release their tax returns. They've all done so voluntarily. There's been no reason to resort to obscure sections of the tax code to try to find a reason to force them to release these tax returns. Candidates for at least a generation now -- again, in both parties -- have voluntarily released these tax returns and made them public.\nAnd the President feels -- I think made the point yesterday that the fact that there is one nominee who won't voluntarily make them public I think is something the American people should consider as they evaluate their choices for President of the United States.\nJulie.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Back on refugees for a second, then I have a couple on Burma. When the President announced this summit that he's hosting at the U.N. on refugees, the goal was to double the amount of refugees resettled around the world, if I'm not mistaken. The 110,000 that you all are proposing for the next fiscal year is not even close to doubling what the U.S. is doing right now. So I'm wondering, why the limitation? I mean, what's the reason that -- given the scope of the crisis, particularly Syrians, but the refugee crisis around the world -- why such a small number? Some of the groups that follow this issue say that this is far too few, and there are a number of critics on Capitol Hill who agree with that.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, Julie, I think the context here is important. This does represent a 57 percent increase in the commitment that the United States made just over the last couple of years. So I think that does represent a substantial increase in our commitment to addressing the refugee problem around the world.\nSecondly, the United States does play this important role as the largest bilateral donor of humanitarian relief to countries that are caring for Syrian refugees. Third, the United States, when it comes to working through the U.N. refugee program, admits more refugees through that program than the rest of the countries in the world combined admit through that program. That I think is an additional indication of just how committed the United States is to fulfilling our responsibility here.\nBut I think what we need to see is a greater commitment around the world to not just shunting this burden off to a handful of countries. And I think the other reality here is that the President's commitment to ensuring that the United States plays a leading role on this issue is not shared by a lot of people in Congress, including by a lot of people in the Republican majority in Congress. And that has an impact in terms of the resources that are dedicated to this effort. All of the vetting requirements that I was talking about earlier are not cheap.\nAnd so I'm sure the President would be willing to consider increasing this commitment further if Congress were prepared to provide the resources necessary to get it done.\nQ: So is he conceding then that the doubling of resettlement numbers around the world is not likely to happen during this conference? I mean, if the United States won't do it, and we play a leadership role, as you said, can other countries really be expected to do it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think we can certainly -- given the ramped-up commitment that the United States has shown both in terms of the financial assistance that's been provided and in terms of the increase in refugees admitted to the United States, I do think we can ask countries around the world to scale up their commitments in the same way the United States has.\nQ: Okay. And on Burma, on the sanctions, can you talk about the timing of at least the President's pledge to lift this national state of emergency? I mean, how much of this has to do with him wanting to do it before he leaves office and at a time when Aung San Suu Kyi is visiting? I mean, how much of it is really a substantive response to events on the ground in Burma?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think at this point, the decision has essentially been made and this is a decision that Aung San Suu Kyi indicated that she agreed with. She supported the decision to lift the national emergency, and now it's just a matter of making the regulatory changes necessary to put those changes into effect. So that will take some time, but as the President indicated, it's something that should be completed in the coming days.\nQ: Right, but my question is, why now? Why make the decision to do it now? I know you said you can't afford to wait forever, but what is it that's happened to date that has convinced the President -- you obviously did a round of this in May. You didn't take all the sanctions off and he didn't say he was going to take all the sanctions off. So what substantively has changed?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what substantively has changed is that the reason that this national emergency was placed into effect in the first place was concern about the undemocratic conduct of the military government that previously ruled Burma. And much of the concern in the United States was rooted in the way that that military government was treating Aung San Suu Kyi. She was imprisoned in her own house. That's an important reason why the national emergency was put into place.\nNow we've seen significant democratic reforms inside of Burma. No longer is Aung San Suu Kyi a prisoner in her own house; she's now the head of the government. So I think that does reflect important progress inside of Burma. And I think given that progress, I think it makes sense that the national emergency would be withdrawn and the sanctions lifted.\nThat said, we continue to want to encourage the pursuit of additional democratic reforms. As many have noted, there still is an undue role that the military plays in the government there. They're afforded about 25 percent of the legislative seats. And so I think that's an indication that there are additional democratic reforms that we'd like to see them pursue. There's additional work that needs to be done when it comes to protecting the human rights of every citizen of Burma. And Aung San Suu Kyi has made clear that that's a priority of her government, and she made that clear in private to the President of the United States and she made that clear in public when she spoke to reporters in the Oval Office, sitting next to the President of the United States.\nSo at this point, we want to continue to encourage those reforms. I think the last thing is -- and I think this is an indication of the influence that the United States has around the world -- while those sanctions are in place in Burma, they've had a significant chilling effect on the Burmese economy. Other countries -- other companies around the world have been reluctant to do business in Burma because they know of the presence of certain U.S. sanctions. Even if the business that they're seeking to conduct is consistent with, complies with U.S. sanctions, the fact that those sanctions exist has a chilling effect on the economy. And President Obama is convinced and recent history strongly suggests that greater economic ties between Burma and the United States will only serve to further incentivize additional reforms.\nSo that's the case that we've made, and I think that is the case that is most directly rooted in the experience that we've had over the last seven years in supporting the profound changes that have taken place in Burma to the enormous benefit of the Burmese people and in a way that advances the interest of the United States and the region.\nPreviously, this was essentially a closed government that just did business with China. Now this is a much more open government that does a much better job of prioritizing democratic principles, has improved its pursuit of universal human rights, and is interested in engaging with the United States of America. And that's something that benefits the American people not just economically but strategically when we're talking about our interests in the Asia Pacific.\nQ: Does the President see this as something he wanted to get done before he left office, given his engagement with Myanmar and his relationship with Aung San Suu Kyi?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the President was quite interested in making as much progress as we can to support the Burmese people and the Burmese government in pursuing democratic reforms. But the decision to lift the national emergency was driven by the progress they made in Burma, not by the election calendar in the United States.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I wanted to circle back just a bit on the agreement, on the seven-day reduction of violence, and the increased humanitarian aid deliveries. And I want to drill down just a bit on the language, because previously we've heard the expression \"Cessation of Hostilities,\" but this specific agreement calls for a reduction in violence. And I'm wondering, what's the difference? And why is there this sort of softer, if you will, language?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't think it's softer. I think it is an effort to try to describe the situation inside of Syria as clearly as we can, primarily because even though there's a Cessation of Hostilities among the parties involved in the agreement -- this is the Assad regime, the United States, Russia, a variety of opposition groups that have ties to the United States -- the Cessation of Hostilities does not in any way apply to ISIL and it doesn't apply to other extremists that are operating inside of Syria. The United States and our counter-ISIL coalition partners are going to continue to take airstrikes against ISIL targets. Opposition figures that are supported -- or opposition groups that are supported by the United States and our coalition partners are going to continue to seek to make progress on the ground against ISIL. They're not affected by the Cessation of Hostilities.\nQ: So it's semantics.\nMR. EARNEST: Largely. That's largely the difference, yes.\nQ: Would you acknowledge that there has been a rift between the Departments of Defense and maybe State because of some of the differences in language, meaning there are those at the Pentagon who feel like the goalposts have been moved just a bit by this agreement? Would you acknowledge that?\nMR. EARNEST: No, primarily because I'm not going to talk about private conversations of the President with his national security team. But as I mentioned in response to Mary's question, I believe, the President has indicated that on every issue -- not just national security issues but even some of the thorny domestic issues that we deal with -- that he wants his advisors to engage in a debate about the best path forward. He wants to hear the point of view of every member of his team. He wants to make sure that those individuals that are expressing a point of view are doing so based on having done their homework, based on their knowledge of the situation, based on a forceful, cogent argument about what path should be pursued.\nThe President has found that that kind of debate among his advisors leads to better decisions and enhances his ability as the Commander-in-Chief to make good decisions that advances the interests of the United States. So the President welcomes a vigorous discussion with his national security team, but the President also expects that once that he's made a decision, his team will move out on that decision and execute the strategy that he's laid out with excellence. And the President is entirely confident that that will happen in this case, too.\nBut, look, I'll just do what I did with Margaret, which is indicate that there's a big \"if\" involved. Before any sort of U.S.-Russia military cooperation is initiated, we need to see a sustained reduction of violence on the ground inside of Syria, and we need to see the unimpeded flow of humanitarian aid to hundreds of thousands if not millions of Syrians that desperately need it.\nQ: Let me ask you about Edward Snowden. I know you and I talked about it on Monday, and I just want to maybe take a different tack at it for just a second. He apparently told The Guardian newspaper that \"it will become pretty clear this war on whistleblowers doesn't serve the interests of the U.S.; rather it harms them.\" And I wonder if you would acknowledge that there's any logic to that argument and if you think that makes sense, would the President reconsider perhaps a pardon.\nMR. EARNEST: I don't think it makes sense because Edward Snowden is not a whistleblower. There actually is a specific process that is well-established and well-protected that allows whistleblowers to raise concerns that they have, particularly when it relates to confidential or classified information, to do so in a way that protects the national security secrets of the United States. That is not what Mr. Snowden did. And his conduct put American lives at risk, and it risked American national security.\nAnd that's why the policy of the Obama administration is that Mr. Snowden should return to the United States and face the very serious charges that he's facing. He will, of course, be afforded the rights that are due to every American citizen in our criminal justice system, but we believe that he should return to the United States and face those charges.\nQ: Has he or any of his representatives made a reach-out of any sort to the President?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any conversations or any communications between Mr. Snowden and the President of the United States.\nQ: And lastly, on Gitmo, my weekly ask. Where are we numerically? And is there any pending announcement for movement of detainees?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any changes that have been made since the last time you asked. We can certainly confirm those numbers for you -- I don't have them in front of me here. But the President and his team are continuing to do the important diplomatic work that's necessary to find suitable arrangements for those individuals that have been cleared for transfer, and that means finding other countries that are willing to cooperate with the United States to impose required security restrictions to mitigate any sort of risk that those individuals would pose to the United States. So that diplomatic work continues. I don't have any transfers to preview for you at this point, but I don't believe that we've made any announcements about a transfer since you and I last discussed it.\nLet's move around. Lalit.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. I wanted to ask you about a meeting the President had with the India Prime Minister last week in Laos. Can you tell us what they discussed? If they had any progress on India relationship and also on climate change?\nMR. EARNEST: Lalit, we'll see if we can get you some additional details about the meeting. I know that the President enjoyed the opportunity that he had to sit down with Prime Minister Modi. The two leaders have cooperated extensively on a range of shared priorities, particularly with regard to the climate agreement that was reached in Paris at the end of last year. The President is obviously engaged in an effort to encourage other countries around the world to join that agreement before the end of this year. And certainly Prime Minister Modi is well aware of the significance of this international agreement, and I know that he is supportive of the contents of the agreement because of the positive impact it would have on the future of his nation.\nTypically, when the President has the opportunity to sit down with Prime Minister Modi, they also -- they don't just talk about climate. They also talk about the other extensive ties between the United States and India, particularly with regard to the economy and with regard to national security. I know that was part -- I know both of those issues were a part of the discussion. But we'll see if we can get you a more detailed readout beyond that.\nQ: And secondly, it's not quite usual for the President to have eight meetings with the foreign leaders in two years' time frame. What kind of relations do the two leaders have?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think that's indicative of the important and valuable, even productive working relationship that President Obama has established with Prime Minister Modi. The President certainly enjoyed the opportunity to visit India a year and a half ago for the National Day, and he was honored to be the official guest.\nAnd the United States and India have been able to work together on a number of shared priorities. And there was a lot of skepticism, internationally, about whether or not the Paris climate agreement would be reached if India wasn't prepared to engage constructively in pursuit of a solution. But to his credit, that's exactly what Prime Minister Modi did, and he did that, frequently consulting with President Obama and other world leaders. But I think it's a testament to the fact that the world's two largest democracies, when we cooperate, can do incredibly important things not just for our two countries, but for the planet. And the President is proud of the legacy of the U.S.-India relationship that's been established under Prime Minister Modi and President Obama's leadership.\nQ: And if I may, when China had joined the U.N. Security Council on sanctions against North Korea, the Chinese foreign ministry is blaming the U.S. -- it said U.S. behavior for pushing North Korea towards nuclear program. Do you agree with the viewpoint?\nMR. EARNEST: I didn't quite understand the very end of your question.\nQ: The Chinese foreign ministry it's the U.S. behavior who did pushing North Korea towards nuclear weapons program.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I didn't see that statement from that Chinese MFA. I know that they released a statement shortly after the most recent nuclear test in North Korea indicating that they were supportive of additional steps by the international community to apply additional pressure to the North Koreans.\nObviously the United States is committed to working with our allies and partners in Northeast Asia to address the situation there. And our commitment to denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and stabilizing the situation on the Korean Peninsula is one that is shared not just with our allies in Japan and South Korea, but also the Chinese. And you can certainly anticipate additional engagement between the United States and China as we consider an appropriate international response to this latest nuclear test\nQ: Thank you, Josh. On nuclear test in North Korea, North Korea is ready to conduct additional nuclear tests anytime soon. Is there any communication with China and the United States before they seek nuclear test?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I've seen some news reports indicating the kind of intelligence assessment that you just relayed. What I can tell you is that the United States and China continue to consult closely about the situation in North Korea. We have a shared goal of denuclearizing and stabilizing the Korean Peninsula.\nThe United States also continues to keep an open line of communication with our allies in Japan and South Korea. And you probably noted that shortly after the nuclear test was conducted, the President was on the phone from Air Force One with Prime Minister Abe and with President Park to talk about the situation. I think that's an indication of how seriously the President takes the U.S. commitment to the safety and security of our allies in the Asia Pacific, including in South Korea and Japan.\nQ: If North Korea does a new nuclear test again, does the United States take military action to North Korea before --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what we have said is we have said we strongly believe that it's important for the North Korean regime to abide by their international obligations and to comply with U.N. Security Council resolutions. And their repeated provocations with regard to both testing of ballistic missiles and nuclear tests are flagrant violations of those U.N. Security Council resolutions and their international obligations. And the international community is united in insisting that they should not engage in those kinds of provocations.\nQ: There won't be strategic bombers in Korea to date. Is this just one-time showcase?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, considering that's happened before, I guess it's not a one-time showcase.\nJohn, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. Two brief questions. I'm sure you're aware and the President is aware that Congressmen Fleming and Huelskamp filed an unusual motion of impeachment of IRS Commissioner Koskinen that the full House will take up tomorrow in a direct up or down vote. Your reaction to that.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think that's an indication that they're focused on entirely the wrong priorities. I think to a certain extent, the people of Kansas have spoken on this, because, as I recall, Mr. Huelskamp lost his most recent primary. So I think he's engaging in exactly the kind of behavior that got him voted out of office.\nWith regard to Congressman Fleming, you would think that after his state had sustained such significant flooding damage, that his priorities might be focused on not irresponsible political games, but actually trying to represent the interests of the people of Louisiana, particularly after they've gone through such a terrible crisis. He apparently appears to be focused on some different things. And the people of Louisiana will also have an opportunity to weigh in on that at the ballot box in a couple of months here, too.\nQ: So the President has full confidence in Commissioner Koskinen?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President spoke to this yesterday, so with regard to the President's views, I'd refer you to his comments.\nQ: The other thing is that Congressman Babin of Texas said that in wanting to admit 110,000 refugees, he felt that the President disregarded advice from security experts that this could lead to terrorism in the United States and incidents that would be very, very bad in this country. Is that accurate at all? Did any of his advisors say that?\nMR. EARNEST: I have no idea what Congressman Babin is talking about. I suspect the national security experts that he's referring to may have given themselves that title -- I'm not sure it's one that they've earned.\nConnie, I'll go ahead and give you the last one.\nQ: Who signed the MOU?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm sorry.\nQ: Who signed the memorandum of understanding?\nMR. EARNEST: It's being signed at the State Department right now. There's a senior official at the State Department -- I believe it is Tom Shannon who is signing the memorandum for the United States. But you can check with them and they'll --\nQ: Do we have a similar --\nMR. EARNEST: Excuse me?\nQ: Do we have a similar (inaudible) with other Arab countries?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any new negotiations about a memorandum of understanding with regard to military assistance to other countries in the Middle East. But obviously the United States values the kind of national security cooperation that we have with partners throughout the Middle East. And certainly when the President met with some of our *Gulf Coast GCC partners at Camp David a little over a year ago, there was an opportunity for him to discuss additional cooperation between the United States and our partners in the region.\nThanks, everybody.\nEND 2:40 P.M.

It is so great to be in the great city of Canton.\nWe just got new polls from Bloomberg and CNN. We're up five points in Ohio, and the LA Times poll has us up 5 points nationwide.\nThe people of the United States are ready for change. They're ready to discard a failed political establishment that disdains, disrespects and looks down on hardworking people.\nThis election is about a choice between the control of an arrogant ruling class in Washington D.C. versus the hopes and dreams of everyday citizens.\nFor years, our leaders have looked out only for themselves.\nThere is no greater example of this in our country than Flint, Michigan. The city of Flint was once known as Buick City. More than 80,000 workers were employed by GM in 1970 – today, its less than 8,000. Forty percent of the city's residents are living in poverty. Violent crime is among the nation's highest.\nToday I went to Flint, Michigan to address the water crisis. The water crisis in Flint demonstrates failure at every single level of government.\nIt's tragic and it's heartbreaking, and it should never happen in the United States of America.\nThis is the catastrophe that happens when we build up other countries instead of our own.\nIt used to be cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Now, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint.\nWe are going to turn this around. We are going to bring our jobs back and protect our people.\nDriving through the city you see the shuttered homes and businesses, the dilapidated infrastructure.\nThis is what our politicians have done to this city, this is what our politicians have done to America.\nBut nowhere has the pain been worse than our inner cities. Democratic politicians have ran our inner cities for 50, 60, 70 years. Their policies have produced massive poverty, joblessness, and failing schools.\nThey've trapped Americans in suffering for years, and I'm running to offer a better future. Lower crime, better schools, more jobs – safety, security, opportunity.\nNow, I understand there are going to be some people in these communities who aren't planning on voting for me right now. I will campaign hard for their votes – we can't stay the course our country is on. If you keep voting for the same people, you'll keep getting the same results.\nI am willing to campaign anywhere. I am willing to go anywhere, visit anywhere, even if some voters openly oppose me in a community I will go there and ask them for their support.\nHillary Clinton calls people who aren't supporting her deplorable and irredeemable. I call people who aren't supporting me American citizens who are entitled to the same respect as anyone else – and I will not stop campaigning for every last American vote, in every last American community, right up until November 8th.\nI will take my message to communities that are 99% Democrat, or that have voted Democrat for generations. I am running to be President for all Americans, to represent all Americans, and to liberate our poorest citizens from crime and poverty and violence.\nThe economic policies of Hillary Clinton – on trade, on the economy, on immigration – have devastated the inner cities of America. Her policies are the problem; we are offering the solution.\nHillary Clinton believes in globalism – taking jobs from Flint and moving them to other countries. I am not running to be President of the world – I am running to be President of the United States. I am running to bring hope to Flint, to Canton, and to every party of this country.\nIf we don't break free from our partisan boxes, then nothing will ever change – it's time to vote for America and America First.\nHillary Clinton's refugee plans will cost $400 billion dollars in the long-term. That's enough money to rebuild the entire water infrastructure of the United States.\nPresident Obama just announced a 30% increase to refugee admissions, bringing the total to 110,000 refugees in just one single year.\nInstead of providing free healthcare and jobs to millions of refugees, we need to rebuild our inner cities and take care of Americans.\nOur support comes from every part of America, and every walk of life. You are cops and soldiers; mechanics and accountants; young and the old; black, white and Latino. You are moms and dads, children and grandparents, you are from cities small and large and in-between. But above everything else, you are all Americans.\nHillary Clinton's attacks on you display the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as Secretary of State, hide and delete her emails, destroy her phones with a hammer, put classified information in the reach of our enemies, lie to Congress, and sell government favors and access through the Clinton Foundation.\nNow the people who destroyed the emails are all pleading the fifth amendment in front of Congress.\nThere is no greater threat to Democracy than when a public official puts their office up for sale. Look at what she did with Russian Uranium, or with UBS bank, or with the contracts in Haiti.\nHillary Clinton's record as Secretary of State is one of historic failure. Just look at what she did to the Middle East – in Iraq, in Syria, in Libya. Not to mention her failures in Russia, China and North Korea.\nOne failure after another – all while raising millions and millions from her friends in Wall Street.\nThe policies of Hillary Clinton have produced only destruction overseas and poverty at home.\n1 in 5 American households do not have a single member in the labor force. Another 14 million people left the labor force entirely since 2009. And the national debt has doubled.\nI am running to reverse these policies, and to create a future of prosperity for all Americans.\nMy economic agenda can be summed up in three words: jobs, jobs, jobs.\nThat begins with a new America-First trade policy.\nHillary Clinton's bad judgement was seen in her support for Bill Clinton's NAFTA, her support for China's entry into the World Trade Organization, and her support for the TPP – she called it the \"Gold Standard.\"\nOhio has lost nearly 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, and 1 in 4 since China entered the WTO.\nOur trade deficit in goods with the world is now nearly $800 billion dollars.\nI will renegotiate NAFTA, I will defend your jobs, and I will bring back vehicle production to the United States of America.\nAmerica's trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost the state of Ohio more than 100,000 manufacturing jobs last year. Imagine how many more jobs would be lost if TPP was actually approved – which Hillary Clinton 100% would do if she ever got the chance.\nWe won't let that happen. But you have to get out and vote.\nMy first day in office, I am also going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight years. All needless, job-killing regulations will be cancelled. Millions of new jobs will come pouring in.\nWe are going to lift the restrictions on American energy.\nAlso on my first day, I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare.\nI will fight for you against the special interests, against the corrupt politicians, and against the powerful insiders. Let me be your champion.\nIn all things, it's time to put Americans first – and start taking care of each other.\nYesterday, I rolled out a plan to help our mothers and our families get affordable, quality childcare for their children.\nOn policy after policy, we are going to bring opportunity and prosperity to all Americans.\nI am going to lower you taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; I'm going to rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; I'm going to save your 2nd amendment [NRA endorsement]; I'm going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country, and yes, we will build the wall [Mexico will pay]; and I'm going to, so importantly, renegotiate your horrible trade deals, especially NAFTA – which is the single worst trade deal ever made by any country anywhere in the world and a one-way street for jobs out of the United States – and we will make great trade deals that put the American worker first.\nAnd Apple, and our other major companies, will start making their iPhones, computers and other products inside of the United States – not in China, and all over the world.\nWe don't make our products anymore in the United States, but we will again – like never before.\nWe will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals. We will rebuild our water infrastructure, and our EPA will abandon political agendas and focus on its core mission: clean air and safe water.\nAmerican cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.\nAmerican steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.\nAmerican hands will rebuild this nation – and American energy, mined from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.\nWe will put new American steel into the spine of this country.\nI will fight for every neglected part of this nation – and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\nIt is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.\nJobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.\nOnce more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.\nWe Will Make America Wealthy Again.\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\nAnd Will Make America Great Again.\nThank you, and God Bless!", "timestamp": "2016-09-14", "title": "Remarks at a Rally at Canton Memorial Civic Center in Canton, Ohio"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122573", "text": "Under President Obama's leadership, the multifaceted cooperation between the United States and Israel has reached unprecedented levels. This is particularly true with regard to the security of Israel. The new 10-year security assistance Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to Israel is the most recent reflection of President Obama's unshakeable commitment to Israel's security.\nUnder the new MOU with Israel, the Obama Administration has made the largest single pledge of military assistance in U.S. history:\n•      The total value of the new MOU, which covers FY2019- FY2028, is $38 billion ($3.8 billion per year). It will succeed the current $30 billion MOU signed in 2007, which will expire at the end of FY2018.\n•      This amount represents a significant increase over the current MOU by every measure, and will enable Israel to acquire additional advanced military capabilities from the United States.\n•      It includes $33 billion in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) funds and an unprecedented $5 billion commitment in missile defense assistance. This funding will be disbursed in equal increments of $3.3 billion in FMF and $500 million in missile defense funding each year for the duration of the understanding.\n•      In practical terms, the level of funding specified in the MOU will permit Israel to update the lion's share of its fighter aircraft fleet - including through the acquisition of additional F-35s - increase its missile defense, and acquire other defense capabilities needed to meet its threat environment.\n•      The multi-year missile defense commitment in the MOU will greatly facilitate long-term planning rather than missile defense assistance levels continuing to be appropriated year-to-year.\n•      The $500 million in annual missile defense funding under the MOU exceeds the average level of non-emergency support the United States has provided to Israel for missile defense over the last five years.\n•      Moreover, our decision with Israel to discontinue two anomalies in the defense relationship that no longer serve our mutual interests - Off Shore Procurement (the arrangement under the current MOU through which Israel has been uniquely permitted to spend 26.3 percent of its annual FMF package within Israel on non-U.S. products) and Israel's use of FMF funds to purchase fuel – means that Israel will spend more funding, as much as $1.2 billion per year, on the advanced military capabilities that only the United States can provide. The acquisition of additional U.S.-produced capabilities and technology provide the best means to ensure Israel preserves its Qualitative Military Edge (QME).\nUnder President Obama to date, Israel has received a record amount of Foreign Military Financing (FMF) funds:\n•      Israel remains the leading recipient worldwide of U.S. FMF. Since President Obama took office, the United States has provided Israel over $23.5 billion in FMF assistance (from 2009-2016).\n•      In FY2016, the United States provided Israel $3.1 billion in FMF assistance to support Israel's ability to defend against threats. This is in line with assistance provided in FY2014 and FY2015 and represented approximately 51.4% of the U.S. global FMF account in FY2016.\n•      For FY2017, which marks the ninth year of the current 10-year, $30 billion MOU between the United States and Israel, the Administration has requested $3.1 billion in FMF for Israel.\n•      This amounts to $8.5 million in FMF funding alone provided to Israel each day, helping it bolster its security and maintain its QME.\nPresident Obama has also provided Israel with unprecedented levels of missile defense funding:\n•      In addition to FMF funding, under President Obama's leadership, the United States has provided over $3 billion in missile defense funding for programs and systems for Israel.\n•      Since 2011, the United States has provided Israel with over $1.3 billion for the Iron Dome system alone. Iron Dome batteries and interceptors have saved an untold number of Israeli lives, particularly during the conflict with Hamas in 2014.\n•      During that conflict, when Israeli civilians were subjected to rocket fire, the President worked with Congress to successfully provide $225 million in short-fuse funding for the Iron Dome system above the $504 million that had already been provided to Israel in FY2014 for missile defense support.\n•      In addition to Iron Dome, the United States has invested significantly in the co-development of longer range defense systems such as David's Sling and Arrow-3.\n•      In FY2016 Israel received $487 million in missile defense support, including for David's Sling. Arrow-3, and Iron Dome.\n•      After successful joint tests of David's Sling and Arrow-3 last year, FY16 is the first year in which missile defense funding for Israel also included funding for coproduction of these systems– further deepening our missile defense cooperation with Israel.\nWith over $26 billion in total assistance during President Obama's tenure in office, Israel has been able to acquire new advanced capabilities to bolster its security:\n•      The United States provides Israel with unparalleled access to some of the most advanced military equipment in the world, including the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Using FMF, Israel is scheduled to receive 33 F-35 aircraft, the first two of which will be delivered to Israel in December 2016.\n•      Israel will be the first foreign partner to take delivery of this fifth-generation fighter aircraft.\n•      The United States has also provided Israel with several C-130 heavy-lift cargo planes; four SAAR 6 Corvettes; ten additional F-15 aircraft; Merkava tanks and Namer Armored Personnel Carriers; Hellfire missiles; the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) and other Precision Guided Munitions.\n•      In terms of missile defense, the United States has paid for the majority of the production costs for the Iron Dome system since 2011, the centerpiece of Israel's missile defense architecture.\nIn addition to FMF and missile defense funds, the United States under President Obama has provided other forms of valuable support to Israel:\n•      Signed by President Obama in December 2014, the U.S.-Israel Strategic Partnership Act authorizes $3 million to be spent on research pilot programs between Israeli government agencies and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\n•      The Department of Defense's chemical-biological defense response units work with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to provide equipment and training.\n•      The Department of Defense has sold or provided free of charge millions of dollars' worth of U.S. excess defense articles to the IDF, supporting their need for spare parts, weapons, and simulators to maintain their current fleets.\n•      Since FY14, the United States has allocated more than $47 million on research and development task plans for tunnel detection and mapping technologies.", "timestamp": "2016-09-14", "title": "Fact Sheet: Memorandum of Understanding Reached with Israel"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122669", "text": "\"We have to make sure all our kids are equipped for the jobs of the future – which means not just being able to work with computers, but developing the analytical and coding skills to power our innovation economy. In the new economy, computer science isn't an optional skill – it's a basic skill, right along with the three ‘Rs.'\"\nPresident Obama, January 2016\nJust 8 months ago, in his final State of the Union Address and subsequent weekly address, President Obama set a bold goal—every American student should have the opportunity to learn computer science (CS). The President's case was simple. More than nine in ten parents want CS taught at their child's school and yet, by some estimates, only a quarter of K-12 schools offer a CS course with programming included. However, the need for such skills across industries continues to grow rapidly, with 51 percent of all science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) jobs projected to be in a CS-related field by 2018.\nSince the President's call to action, strong momentum for CS education has been growing at all levels of government and in the private sector. Twelve states have taken concrete policy steps to expand CS education—and there are now 31 states that allow CS to count towards high school graduation. More than 100 organizations have already pledged more than $250 million to support CS education. Just this month, thanks to sustained Federal support over the past 8 years, a new Advanced Placement (AP) computer science course, AP Computer Science Principles, is launching and will be offered in more than 2,000 U.S. classrooms this fall, putting the course on track to be largest course launch in the history of the AP exam.\nTo mark this progress, and celebrate new commitments in support of the President's initiative, the White House is hosting a summit on Computer Science for All. Key announcements being made today include:\n•      More than $25 million in new grants awarded from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to expand CS education;\n•      A new CSforAll Consortium of more than 180 organizations, which will connect stakeholders with curriculum and resources, as well as track progress towards the goal of Computer Science for All; and\n•      New commitments from more than 200 organizations, ranging from expanded CS offerings within the Girl Scouts of the USA that could reach 1.4 million girls per year, to Code.org supporting professional development for 40,000 additional teachers, to new collaborations to bring CS to students in a variety of settings from African-American churches to family coding nights to tribal Head Start programs to students as Chief Science Officers.\nBackground\nThere are nearly half a million open tech jobs in the United States today, and that number is projected to more than double within the next 4 years. These jobs pay 50 percent more than the average private sector job. One recent analysis of 26 million job postings found that nearly half of all the jobs in the top quartile in pay require some coding knowledge or skills.\nAnd yet, CS is largely missing from American K-12 education. By some estimates in the past year, 75 percent of U.S. schools do not offer a single CS course with programming. Furthermore, even though research-based models exist that integrate CS into subjects such as Algebra, Science, History, and English, such integrated courses are rare.\nThis lack of access is even worse for communities traditionally underrepresented in CS and other science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. In 2015, only 22 percent of students who took the Advanced Placement Computer Science (AP CS) exam were girls, and only 13 percent were African-American or Latino students. In three states, no girls took the AP CS exam and in 10 states fewer than 10 girls took the exam. In 21 states, fewer than 10 African Americans took the AP CS exam. Furthermore, portrayals in entertainment media and widely-held stereotypes exacerbate this dynamic, with far more men than women depicted in technology roles in film and television.\nThese challenges in course access, bias and stereotypes are the reason why the Administration has progressively increased its focus on expanding access to CS. That is why the College Board, with NSF support, began developing a new AP Computer Science Principles course (AP CSP), designed with the goal to recruit and retain students who are typically underrepresented in CS fields. Instead of focusing solely on learning computer programming skills, the new AP CSP explores the creative aspects of programming, abstractions, algorithms, large data sets, the Internet, cybersecurity, and how computing addresses real-world problems. That course is rolling out nationally this month, with more than 2,000 classrooms already signed up, reaching an estimated 25,000 high school students in this academic year and putting AP CSP on track to be largest course launch in AP history.\nIt is also why, in 2013, President Obama called on every child to take the opportunity to code, and in 2014 became the first President to write a line of code. And it is why in 2015, the President launched TechHire to get more adults access to accelerated paths to tech careers. Today, there are over 50 TechHire communities across the Nation, with nearly 1,000 employers participating. Finally, more schools and communities are able to benefit from today's announcements thanks to President Obama's ConnectED Initiative, which is helping teachers implement modern digital learning strategies and has delivered broadband to tens of millions of American students in the classroom.\nIn his 2016 State of the Union address and subsequent weekly address, President Obama put forward a bold budget proposal, meaningful executive actions, and a broad call to action to give every student the chance to learn CS in school. Significant progress has been made in the last eight months:\n•      Federal agencies have announced new competitions, guidance, and support. The President signed the bipartisan Every Student Succeeds (ESSA) law in December 2015 to reform No Child Left Behind, which also expands the opportunities that states and districts have to offer CS and other rigorous STEM coursework. This spring, the Department of Education (ED) released a  Dear Colleague Letter to states, school districts, schools, and education organizations focused on how to maximize Federal funds to support and enhance CS education. In addition, ED's  Investing in Innovation competition included a priority for STEM education, including CS education, and its 21st Century Community Learning Center program launched a webpage of available CS education materials for its network of State Directors, site Directors, and front-line staff, and featured CS at the program's Summer Institute in July. In addition, the NSF has accelerated its efforts to expand access to CS. As a result, in the past 8 months, over 1,200 high school teachers have participated professional development through NSF-funded CS projects, preparing them to teach either Exploring Computer Science (ECS) or AP CSP.\n•      Twelve states have taken concrete policy actions to support CS education since the President's call to action: Colorado (allowing CS to count towards graduation), Delaware (designating CS as a statewide program of study), Florida (adopting new K-12 CS standards), Hawaii (integrating CS into other core subjects), Idaho (creating a CS curriculum), Indiana (adopting new K-8 CS standards), Louisiana (allowing CS to count towards graduation), Pennsylvania (allowing CS to count towards graduation), Rhode Island (setting a goal to get CS into all K-12 schools and reaching the half-way mark), Utah (establishing CS training and resources), Virginia (embedding CS into its K-12 standards), and West Virginia (requiring all secondary schools to offer a CS course this fall). In addition, 27 governors have called on Congress to support CS education.\n•      More than 100 organizations have already responded to the President's call to action. Since January, organizations have pledged more than $250 million pledged in philanthropic support, and the more than 100 commitment-makers to the President's CS call to action have already reached more than 1 million students and teachers with CS programming. For example, in the past 8 months and in support of the President's call to action, Apple announced Swift playgrounds, a new iPad app to learn coding, and nearly 12,000 students participated in coding sessions at Apple Camp this summer. Code.org has prepared more than 22,000 teachers to bring CS into their classrooms, including nearly 1,000 high school teachers. College Board has prepared 1,400 teachers to deliver the new AP CSP course in its summer institutes. The Iron Yard and Code Fellows, in collaboration with Operation Hope, last week  launched Tech Opportunity Fund with $45 million in diversity scholarships, and goal of awarding $100 million in scholarships over five years. National Center for Women & IT (NCWIT) welcomed over 2,500 new members into the Aspirations in Computing Community in 2016, now supporting over 7,000 technical young women. Oracle has planned nearly 40 additional teacher training events for this academic year with an anticipated reach of 600 teachers. More than 50 CEOs and public sector leaders have called on Congress to support CS. In addition, as part of the  United State of Women Summit, where the President  cited the importance of depicting more examples of women in STEM, Association of National Advertisers (ANA) Alliance for Family Entertainment (AFE) announced a new initiative called \"#SeeHer\" to incentivize advertisers, content creators and the media to develop and showcase content that portrays diverse women and girls authentically.\nNew Steps Being Announced by the Administration Today\nFederal announcements in support of CS education being made today include:\n•      More than $25 million in new grants being awarded by NSF. NSF is announcing today that it will award over $25 million in new grants in support of Computer Science for All by the end of this month for FY 2016. These awards accelerate NSF's ongoing efforts to enable rigorous and engaging CS education in schools across the nation by funding: development and evaluation of scalable professional development for teachers for instruction of ECS and AP CSP courses; creation and piloting of instructional materials for use in preK-8; development of best practices; research on mechanisms for implementation of Computer Science for All; and coaching, mentoring, master teacher corps, online communities of practice, and other support for newly trained teachers. NSF anticipates an additional $100 million investment over the next 4 years.\n•      CNCS will expand CS programs in six new communities. Through a collaboration with Google and the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) will provide enhanced CS programming for six underserved communities and youth around the country. Today's announcement commits an additional 11 AmeriCorps VISTA members and 7 AmeriCorps VISTA Summer Associates to supporting this effort in the following areas: Harlem, New York; San Francisco, California; Portland, Oregon; Dorchester, Massachusetts; Raleigh, North Carolina; and Omaha, Nebraska. Last year, this effort supported 12 AmeriCorps VISTA members who recruited and trained local volunteers across seven cities to deliver CS programming. In addition, AmeriCorps VISTA members designed Computer Literacy classes for parents, trained elementary school teachers on the CS First curriculum, increased accessibility to events like hackathons, and developed CS First Clubs at schools.\n•      Inter-agency working group to carry the ComputerScience for All initiative forward. The National Science and Technology Council, under its Committee on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math Education, has chartered a new interagency working group focused on meeting the goals of Computer Science for All. The working group is launching with the participation of more than 10 Federal departments, agencies, and offices, and will work to promote computer science education and coordinate activities between the Federal government and school districts, community organizations, non-profits, and the private sector.\n•      New report from the Department of Education on the future of STEM education. This week, ED is releasing a report entitled \"STEM 2026.\" The report shares the perspectives of a range of education practitioners and outlines major opportunities for enhancing P-12 STEM education over the next 10 years. The report includes substantial discussion of computer science, and the importance of including computational thinking and CS-related activities in STEM education.\nPrivate-Sector Commitments in Response to the President's Call to Action\nToday, more than 200 different organizations are announcing new commitments, showcasing the strong response to the President's State of the Union call to give every child the opportunity to learn CS, as well as his overall \"Educate to Innovate\" campaign to ensure all students have the tools to be innovators and problem-solvers.\nThese commitments focus on expanding access to CS education by:\n•      Engaging students where they are, and bringing CS to them. For example, Girl Scouts of the USA is committing to develop and launch a computer science progression for Girl Scout Daisy, Brownie and Junior levels (girls ages 4 -11), providing CS opportunities to as many as 1.4 million girls annually in the United States and overseas locations. In addition, Project Code Nodes, in collaboration with the Partnership of African American Churches and others, is setting the goal to establish coding clubs for 70 girls in economically disadvantaged communities in Charleston, West Virginia.\n•      Supporting families. For example, SignUp.com and the CSforAll Consortium are co-developing and launching this year an ‘idea center' on bringing CS to their school for the SignUp.com community of 8 million parents. In addition, MV GATE, SignUp.com and the National Watch D.O.G.S (Dads Of Great Students) volunteer network, with support from Capital One, will launch and promote the Family Code Night Event Kit to help more parents host a coding event at their child's school.\n•      Preparing teachers. For example, Code.org will launch a new course, CS Discoveries, to teach CS for grades 7 through 9; will expand its professional learning network from 25 organizations to 40 organizations; and support professional development for 40,000 additional CS teachers in time for the 2017-18 school year. In addition, department heads from more than 75 universities and colleges have agreed on behalf of their departments to take concrete actions to expand K-12 CS education, including collaborating with colleges and schools of education to support the in-service or pre-service preparation of CS teachers.\n•      Building a movement. For example, a new CSforAll Consortium is launching to monitor and celebrate progress towards the goal of Computer Science for All, and to connect stakeholders with curriculum and resources. The new consortium is led by CSNYC and a steering committee of the Association for Computing Machinery, Code.org, The College Board, Computer Science Teachers Association, and the NCWIT, and has a membership of over 180 organizations.\nFull details on all of today's announcements can be found here.", "timestamp": "2016-09-14", "title": "Fact Sheet: New Progress and Momentum in Support of President Obama's Computer Science for All Initiative"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "The President spoke at 12:27 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White House. In her remarks, State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi referred to former Secretary-General Kofi A. Annan of the United Nations.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118963", "text": "President Obama. It is an extraordinary pleasure for me to welcome State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi and her delegation to the White House. This is not her first visit to the Oval Office, but it is her first visit in her official capacity. And it represents a remarkable process that Burma is undergoing.\nWhen I was first elected, Daw Suu was still under house arrest. And because, in part, of advocacy by the United States and others in the international community, but more importantly, because of the courage and the strength and resilience of the Burmese people, what we've seen over the last several years is a transition to elections, a representative legislature that still has significant constraints from the previous military Government, but is giving voice to the hopes and dreams of a new generation of Burmese people. And as a consequence, now Aung San Suu Kyi, as State Counselor, Foreign Minister, is in a position with her Government to begin shaping a remarkable social and political transformation and economic transformation there.\nIn part, because of the progress that we've seen over the last several months, I indicated, after consulting with Daw Suu, that the United States is now prepared to lift sanctions that we have imposed on Burma for quite some time. It is the right thing to do in order to ensure that the people of Burma see rewards from a new way of doing business and a new Government.\nAt the same time, we're also going to be restoring the Generalized System of Preferences, which provides very important commercial and trading advantages for poorer countries as they enter into the global economy. And if you combine those two efforts, I think this will give the United States, our businesses, our nonprofit institutions, greater incentive to invest and participate in what we hope will be an increasingly democratic and prosperous partner for us in the region.\nIn addition to the political transition that's taken place, the economic reforms that are being initiated, Daw Suu has also helped to convene a peace conference so that the various ethnic groups and armed conflicts that have plagued this country for far too long can begin to be resolved. There's a process of beginning to reach out and address some of the ethnic minorities, including in Rakhine State, that historically feel discrimination. And so there's a broader process of transformation, reconciliation, and hope that has emerged in a country that for decades was burdened by a military dictatorship and closed off from the world.\nAnd I can tell you that when I visited as the first U.S. President ever to travel there, I could see the enormous potential that was about to be unleashed, and nobody represented that better than Aung San Suu Kyi.\nSo we are very hopeful about the future. We are hopeful about building on the friendship and partnership that we've already established, not just with the new Government, but more importantly, with the Burmese people.\nI would encourage Americans who have the opportunity at some point to travel to Burma, to do so. It is a beautiful country with a rich culture and wonderful people. And I think, if I'm not mistaken, there is a very welcome tourist industry that is developing.\nSo we look forward to partnering with you, Madam State Counselor, on a whole range of issues. And congratulations on the progress that's been made. It is not complete, and I think Daw Suu is the first one to indicate that a lot of work remains to be done, but it's on the right track. And if you had predicted 5 years ago that Aung San Suu Kyi would now be here sitting as the duly elected representative of her country, many people would have been skeptical. But it's a good-news story in an era in which so often we see countries going in the opposite direction.\nThank you.\nState Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi. Well, I need hardly say that I'm very happy to be here, because this is an opportunity for me to thank all the people of the United States who helped us along our democratic struggle. It's not yet at an end. We have reached a point where, as President Obama said, people did not expect us to reach 5 years ago, although we were quite confident that we'd get here. But now we have to go ahead.\nThere's so much that has to be done in our country. And our party always said the most important thing was national reconciliation and peace.\nIn my country, fighting has been going on for decades, ever since we became an independent nation. We've never known a time when there is peace throughout the country. There was always fighting going on at some time, or someplace or the other. There are officially 135 ethnic groups in our country, and to keep them all united and keep them all to one purpose is not an easy matter. But we think that we can do that. We think that we can do that because what all of us want is a truly democratic, federal union, a union in which we can create true strength out of diversity, in which we can celebrate our diversity as our greatest resource, our greatest richness. We are trying to do that now, and we are grateful to all our friends—of course, the United States more than included—who have been helping us in this process.\nBut unity also means prosperity, because people, when they have to fight over limited resources, forget that standing together is important. So we want to develop our material resources. We want to make sure that our people are better off materially in order to strengthen our political initiatives. It's not just a peace process; it's also the commission that we formed, headed by Dr. Kofi Annan, to look into matters in the Rakhine State. Communal strife is not something that we can ignore. It's too important; it's too serious for us to leave even until the next year.\nSo this is one of the first initiatives we have taken, forming this commission to look into communal strife and tensions within the Rakhine State. We want everybody who is a citizen of our country to be entitled to the full rights of citizens. And we want to make sure that everybody who is entitled to citizenship is accorded citizenship as quickly and as fairly as possible. And this is what we are trying to do in Rakhine. And we hope that the world will recognize that we are sincere in trying to bring together the different communities in what is a very poor state with tremendous potential.\nIf we could all come together, to help them to develop this potential and to eliminate the poverty that so destroys the unity, I think it would be helping not just one country, but the world at large, by proving that divisions can be overcome; that we can create unity out of diversity; that we can put aside suspicion and misunderstandings, and come to an agreement; that we can all put this together.\nThe United States Congress has been more than friendly towards our efforts towards democratic reform, and over the years, they have done many things for us. And as we all know, sanctions have been one of the many steps they took in order to push democratic reforms in our country. We think that this time has now come to remove all the sanctions that hurt us economically, because our country is in a position to open up to those who are interested in taking part in our economic enterprises. We would like to invite all of you to come to see our country, to see why you should invest there, and see how you can invest there in such a way that you will benefit from it as much as we can. I've always said that I have no use for businessmen who are incapable of making profits, so I expect your businessmen to come to our country to make profits so that they can make profits for us as well. If you can't look after yourself, you certainly can't look after other people. So we are very interested in successful companies, successful business enterprises coming to Burma, to looking around and to making new use of the opportunities open to them. Our new investment law will be adopted by the legislature quite soon, we hope within the next few weeks. And what with the lifting of sanctions and the new investment law, which I hope will be very attractive to many people all over the world, we think that our country is in a position to take off.\nBut for us, economic development is just part of the democratic process that we want to encourage in our country. There is still a lot to be done. We have a Constitution which is not entirely democratic because it gives the military a special place in politics. We are very—I am—[inaudible]—personally, very attached to our military because the army was founded by my father. And I want our military to be an honorable institution, loved and respected by the people, and capable of protecting and defending our rights and our honor in this world. But we do not think that politics is a place for the military.\nSo we will continue with our efforts to amend our Constitution, to make our country the truly democratic union that our founding fathers dreamt of. And we look to the United States and our friends to continue with us along the road of progress: progress politically, progress socially, and economically. And we look forward to the day when we can say that we, too, are in a position to help those less fortunate than we are in this world.\nNow I would like to take this opportunity to thank not just the people of the United States and the United States Congress and all the various nongovernmental organizations and individuals that have helped us, but also to President Obama personally for coming out to our country as the first American President ever to have done so and to recognize the potential of our people, especially our young people.\nThank you.\nThe President.

During the visit, State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and President Obama held a meeting on September 14 in the White House and adopted this joint statement.\nBoth leaders remarked on the tremendous change in Myanmar over the past five years, during which time Myanmar moved from a military government through a period of opening, held free and fair elections in November 2015, and inaugurated a new, democratically elected government in March 2016. State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi expressed her appreciation for the role played by the United States and other members of the international community in encouraging and supporting this transformation, and President Obama affirmed continued U.S. support for Myanmar's democratic transition. Both leaders noted that Myanmar's transition has allowed for a dramatic change in the bilateral relationship, creating opportunities to build a robust, multi-faceted partnership for the mutual benefit of both countries.\nThe State Counsellor reiterated to the President her commitment to furthering Myanmar's democratic transition by pursuing peace, national reconciliation, and inclusive growth. She expressed her belief that the 21st Century Panglong process, inaugurated on August, 31, 2016, would lead to a lasting peace with armed ethnic groups and help the people of Myanmar build an inclusive Union that embraced the country's rich diversity. She stressed her government's commitment to the resolution of the complex political, economic, and humanitarian challenges in Rakhine State and the development of the state's economic potential. Noting that peace, national reconciliation, and inclusive economic growth were mutually reinforcing, the State Counsellor described the range of economic policies the Government of Myanmar was pursuing to develop its economy. She stressed that Myanmar welcomes international investment to help promote strong, inclusive, and long-term economic growth and asked that the United States lift remaining sanctions on Myanmar to encourage this investment and in recognition of the steps Myanmar has taken toward democratization.\nThe President told the State Counsellor that the primary focus of U.S. policy toward Myanmar was to help Myanmar succeed. He reiterated that the United States would continue its strong support, both diplomatically and through assistance programs, for the priorities expressed by the State Counsellor. He welcomed the Myanmar government's initiatives to address the longstanding concerns of all communities in Rakhine State, including the establishment of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State chaired by Mr. Kofi Annan, former Secretary General of the United Nations. The President expressed his hope that all parties to civil conflict in Myanmar would seize the opportunity offered by the 21st Century Panglong process to seek peace and build the foundations for a democratic, federal Union through dialogue. The President affirmed the importance of the role of civil society in the pursuit of Myanmar's national development goals and the promotion and protection of human rights and democratic governance. The President expressed his commitment to helping Myanmar achieve inclusive economic growth, both through continued assistance and by changes to U.S. policy designed to encourage responsible investment in Myanmar. Concurring with the State Counsellor on the importance of the rule of law, the President said the United States would continue to support Myanmar's efforts to develop domestic institutions to promote the rule of law and would work closely with Myanmar and other partners in ASEAN to address regional and transnational challenges including nonproliferation and countering the scourge of drugs, terrorism, and extremism.\nThe President and the State Counsellor committed to mark this new era in the bilateral relationship by announcing a U.S.-Myanmar Partnership. This partnership, anchored by annual dialogues led by the U.S. Department of State and Myanmar's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, will allow the two countries to broaden and deepen their cooperation across a range of sectors. To further this effort, the President and the State Counsellor committed to collaborate on the following steps:\n• Recognizing the progress toward democratic transition that Myanmar has achieved, including through the election of a civilian-led government, and in an effort to support inclusive economic growth, the United States will terminate the National Emergency with respect to Myanmar and will revoke the Executive Order-based framework of the Burma sanctions program. • The United States will restore Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) trade benefits to Myanmar in light of progress on a number of fronts, including strengthening protections for internationally recognized worker rights. • The United States and Myanmar commit to continued cooperation in addressing remaining challenges, such as strengthening the rule of law, promoting respect for human rights, countering trafficking in persons, combatting corruption, and advancing anti-money laundering efforts and counter-narcotics activities. • The United States and Myanmar recognize their shared interest in enhancing bilateral economic engagement and exchanging views on laws and practices that affect bilateral investment flows and foreign investment, including the elements of a high-standard Bilateral Investment Treaty. • The United States and Myanmar recognized the important role of small and growing businesses in supporting inclusive economic growth. The United States intends to sign a loan guarantee with five local microfinance institutions to support over $10 million in loans to small businesses in Myanmar, which will increase access to food and support employment opportunities for communities in Myanmar. • The United States and Myanmar commit to continued cooperation in addressing remaining challenges, such as strengthening the rule of law, promoting respect for human rights, countering trafficking in persons, combatting corruption, and advancing counter-narcotics activities. • The United States and Myanmar are committed to advancing global health security. In 2017, Myanmar will complete and publish a Joint External Evaluation (JEE) of national capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats. The United States completed and published a JEE in 2016. • The United States and Myanmar will expand people-to-people ties including by augmenting English-language instruction with additional training for 1500 English teachers, by expanding U.S. educational advising across Myanmar by 50 percent for students interested in studying in the United States, and by launching a new exchange program for Myanmar leaders that will provide expertise in democratic governance. • The United States and Myanmar look forward to the arrival of the first group of Peace Corps volunteers, who will train English teachers as well as teach students in middle and high schools.", "timestamp": "2016-09-14", "title": "Joint Statement by President Obama and State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi of Burma"}

Over the past 8 years, my administration has time and again demonstrated this commitment in word and deed. Since fiscal year 2009, the United States has provided Israel with $23.6 billion in foreign military financing (FMF) funds and another $3.4 billion in funding for missile defense. The new 10-year memorandum of understanding (MOU) on security assistance that my administration signed with the Government of Israel today is just the most recent reflection of my steadfast commitment to the security of the State of Israel. The new MOU constitutes the single largest pledge of military assistance in U.S. history, totaling $38 billion over 10 years, including $33 billion in FMF funds and an additional $5 billion in missile defense funding. Both Prime Minister Netanyahu and I are confident that the new MOU will make a significant contribution to Israel's security in what remains a dangerous neighborhood. The continued supply of the world's most advanced weapons technology will ensure that Israel has the ability to defend itself from all manner of threats.\nFor as long as the State of Israel has existed, the United States has been Israel's greatest friend and partner, a fact underscored again today. This commitment to Israel's security has been unwavering and is based on a genuine and abiding concern for the welfare of the Israeli people and the future of the State of Israel. It is because of this same commitment to Israel and its long-term security that we will also continue to press for a two-state solution to the longstanding Israeli-Palestinian conflict, despite the deeply troubling trends on the ground that undermine this goal. As I have emphasized previously, the only way for Israel to endure and thrive as a Jewish and democratic state is through the realization of an independent and viable Palestine. Ultimately, both this MOU and efforts to advance the two-state solution are motivated by the same core U.S. objective that has been shared by all administrations—Democratic and Republican, over the last several decades, ensuring that Israelis can live alongside their neighbors in peace and security.", "timestamp": "2016-09-14", "title": "Statement on the Memorandum of Understanding Between the United States and Israel"}

With faith and passion, a sturdy work ethic and profound devotion to family, Hispanics have helped carry forward our legacy as a vibrant beacon of opportunity for all. Whether their ancestors have been here for generations or they are among the newest members of our American family, they represent many countries and cultures, each adding their own distinct and dynamic perspective to our country's story. In celebration of National Hispanic Heritage Month, we honor the contributions Hispanics have made throughout our history, and we highlight an important part of the rich diversity that keeps our communities strong.\nHispanic Americans have had a lasting impact on our history and have helped drive hard—won progress for all our people. They are the writers, singers, and musicians that enrich our arts and humanities; the innovative entrepreneurs steering our economy. They are the scientists and engineers revolutionizing our ways of life and making sweeping new discoveries; the advocates leading the way for social and political change. They are the brave men and women in uniform who commit themselves to defending our most cherished ideals at home and abroad. And their lasting achievements and devotion to our Nation exemplify the tenacity and perseverance embedded in our national character.\nMy Administration stands firmly committed to opening doors of opportunity for all Americans and addressing issues of vital importance to the Hispanic community. The unemployment rate for the Hispanic community has dropped steadily since I took office, and we have worked to support the growth and development of Hispanic-owned businesses. Last year, Hispanic Americans saw the largest gains of any racial or ethnic group in median income and experienced among the greatest reductions in poverty. We have fought to make home ownership more affordable and to raise the Federal minimum wage—which would benefit more than 8 million Hispanic workers. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, 4 million Hispanic non-elderly adults have gained access to quality, affordable health care, reducing the uninsured rate among Hispanics by more than a quarter. The high school graduation rate among Hispanic students is rising, and we have taken action to help more Hispanic students enroll in college. And by charting a new course in our relationship with Cuba, we are strengthening communication and bolstering relations between friends and family in both countries—reinforcing many ties to Latin America.\nOur Nation's remarkable story began with immigration. Today, we must continue seeking to make the promise of our Nation real in the lives of all people, including for those who are Americans by every measure except for a piece of paper. Through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, hardworking young Dreamers—including many Hispanics—have been given more opportunities to reach for their highest aspirations. I remain deeply committed to passing comprehensive immigration reform, and my Administration will continue doing all that we can to carry forward our Nation's legacy as a melting pot of the world. Through the work of the White House Task Force on New Americans, we are striving to support the integration of immigrants and refugees into our communities. We will continue to welcome those fleeing persecution, including those from the Western Hemisphere, and we will keep working to make our immigration system fairer and smarter.\nThis month, let us reflect on the countless ways in which Hispanics have contributed to our Nation's success, and let us reaffirm our commitment to expanding opportunity and building an ever brighter future for all. Let us embrace the diversity that strengthens us and continue striving to ensure the American dream is within reach for generations of Hispanics to come.\nTo honor the achievements of Hispanics in America, the Congress by Public Law 100-402, as amended, has authorized and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation designating September 15 through October 15 as \"National Hispanic Heritage Month.\"\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim September 15 through October 15, 2016, as National Hispanic Heritage Month. I call upon public officials, educators, librarians, and all Americans to observe this month with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-09-14", "title": "Proclamation 9493—National Hispanic Heritage Month, 2016"}

In Executive Order 13396, the President addressed that threat by blocking the property and interests in property of, among others, persons determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Secretary of State, to constitute a threat to the peace and national reconciliation process in Côte d'Ivoire, to be responsible for serious violations of international law in Côte d'Ivoire, or to have supplied arms to Côte d'Ivoire.

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118887", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n12:50 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: It's good to see you guys. Eight years ago today, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. And the financial shock following Lehman's demise has been described by students of history as possibly the worst in modern times.\nNext slide. But when President Obama took office in 2009, Wall Street's financial crisis was dragging Main Street into an economic crisis. More than 750,000 Americans were losing their jobs each month. Shortly after President Obama took office we were told that the economy had contracted nearly 4 percent in the last quarter of 2008. That was terrible news. But only later, when all the data came in, did we learn that it was actually twice as bad. The economic output declined at an annual rate of 8.2 percent at the end of 2008.\nYet, driven by the aggressive policies that President Obama put in place, our economy began growing just six months later, and has grown steadily since. We've grown faster than every other advanced major economy. The United States exceeded pre-crisis GDP levels per person in 2013, well ahead of countries who had experienced similar financial crises in the past and well ahead of other countries who faced the same global financial crisis that we did.\nHousing prices, stock markets, retirement savings and household wealth in the United States have also rebounded -- each plummeting in 2008 and early 2009; each dramatically up since.\nNext slide. Foreclosure rates, which soared, have also come back down to pre-crisis levels. Next slide. We lost nearly 9 million private sector jobs during the crisis, but we got private sector job growth going again within a year of President Obama taking office. We were told that passing Wall Street reform would kill jobs, but we've actually created more than 14 million private sector jobs since early 2010. The unemployment rate has been cut in half, from a high of 10 percent to less than 5 percent today. It's been holding at its lowest levels since before Lehman failed, and the U.S. economy reached 5 percent about four years ahead of when economists and some Republican candidates for President predicted just a few years ago.\nNext slide. We just learned earlier this week that the United States had the strongest wage growth on record in 2015, that typical household income was up $2,800 or 5.2 percent. In fact, in 2015, we saw wages grow fastest for low- and middle- income families. We saw poverty decline fastest for African Americans and Hispanic Americans whose poverty rates had been elevated relative to other groups of Americans.\nSo we've shown that with Wall Street reform we can create an economy that works better as a whole and works better for individual Americans.\nNext slide. 2015 also saw the fastest decline in poverty rates since 1968, with 3.5 million Americans and 1 million kids being lifted out of poverty. So the assertion that building a safer, stronger financial system is inconsistent with healthy, sustainable growth that benefits working families and the middle class has shown to be false.\nIn 2009, credible sources estimated that the direct cost of our financial crisis response to taxpayers would be nearly $2 trillion. Every day we saw headlines about a $182 billion bailout of AIG, or a $700 billion price tag on the TARP program. Yet, what wasn't focused on was that those were loans or investments that were paid back over time with interest to the taxpayers. The U.S. government got all of the taxpayer money back we put into the financial system and then some. So these investment generated a positive return for taxpayers across all of our financial crisis programs.\nWe were told the deficits would skyrocket. But under President Obama's leadership, they've come back down by nearly three-quarters, from 10 percent of GDP to around 3 percent. Even the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that has been such a strong watchdog to protect consumers from harmful practices is under assault by Republicans, despite having returned nearly $12 billion through enforcement actions to more than 25 million consumers who've been harmed.\nJust the other day I noted that Speaker Ryan sent a tweet critical of the CFPB right after it had shown exactly why they're still needed, by announcing a $185 million fine against a bank for setting up 2 million credit card and bank accounts that customers didn't ask for. This is just another example, shown by the broader economic trends, of Republicans not letting facts get in the way of their attacks on policies like Wall Street reform that actually help build a stronger economy here in the United States and better supports the middle class and working families that President Obama is determined to fight for.\nSo with that long intro on this anniversary day, we can go to your questions.\nDarlene, would you like to start?\nQ: Thank you. I wanted to start by asking about Syria.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay.\nQ: The U.N. Envoy here said today that there were some problems getting humanitarian aid to affected areas because Syria hasn't signed off on these permits that are needed for the convoys to start rolling in. Is the U.S. doing anything to try to help get these convoys rolling? And given that Syria has not yet granted these permits, does the White House think Syria is living up to its end of the ceasefire agreement?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Darlene, you have identified something that the United States continues to be deeply concerned about. I mentioned yesterday that despite the progress that we've seen with regard to the security situation on the ground in Syria, we haven't seen the corresponding improvement in the flow of humanitarian assistance. And the chief obstacle to that has been the Assad regime.\nI can't speak to the bureaucratic impediments that appear to be preventing this badly needed flow of humanitarian assistance. But what I can speak to is the responsibility that the Russians have to use their influence with the Assad regime to get the humanitarian assistance moving. There are hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Syrians who are in a desperate situation. And right now the trucks that could bring them lifesaving assistance are idling on the wrong side of the border. And that's the direct responsibility of the Assad regime and their benefactors in Moscow.\nQ: So it's up to Russia to step in?\nMR. EARNEST: The crux of this agreement has always been about Russia demonstrating the capacity and the willingness to use their influence with the Assad regime to reduce violence and allow humanitarian assistance to be provided. Most reports indicate that the violence has been significantly reduced since this arrangement went into effect, but we have not seen the kind of humanitarian assistance deliveries that we need to see.\nQ: On another subject, Hillary Clinton is returning to the campaign trail later this afternoon. The question was asked of you earlier this week and I don't think we got an answer, but do you know if the President has either spoken with her or otherwise communicated with her during the time that she was home recuperating?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any phone calls that President Obama has placed to Secretary Clinton in the last few days.\nQ: And lastly, the President is addressing the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute dinner tonight. Can you give us a little sense of what he's going to say there?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the President is certainly going to spend some time talking about how committed he has been to fighting for the kinds of policies that benefit middle-class families all across the country and benefit Hispanic families all across the country. And some of the statistics that I reviewed at the top are a clear indication of the success of that strategy. And I think the President will make a reference to his view that it's incredibly important that this strategy continue to be pursued under the next President.\nJeff.\nQ: Josh, going back briefly to Syria. France became one of the U.S. allies today to be critical of that U.S.-Russia agreement. They said that they'd like to see some more details of it. Is the United States sharing details of this agreement with allies like France? And if not, why not?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Jeff, I didn't see the specific comments, but the United States has certainly been in touch with our other allies and partners to help them understand exactly what we are trying to achieve. And I think countries like France that are as committed as we are to degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL understand how important it is for us to try to address the root cause of the violence and chaos that's allowed ISIL to spread in Syria.\nSo we'll continue to communicate with our allies and partners about the terms of this agreement and with the aims of this agreement.\nQ: Do you think their criticism is legitimate?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I haven't seen the precise details of it, so it's hard for me to evaluate exactly how credible it is. But I can certainly assure you and assure anybody in France that's watching if they have questions about this arrangement that we can certainly have a conversation with them about what the arrangements entail and what exactly our aims are.\nQ: On another topic. A self-confessed hitman testifying in Manila today said that President Duterte, when he was the mayor of a city where activists said many extrajudicial killings have taken place that he ordered those killings to happen. Does the White House have a reaction to that? And will that be brought up with the Philippines foreign minister this week?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I've seen the reports of that testimony. I think what I would remind you of, Jeff, is just that the President had the opportunity to talk about this when he was traveling in Asia. Obviously he did not meet with President Duterte in any sort of formal setting, but when asked about the degree to which human rights impacts our relationship with the Philippines, the President I think was quite clear about how important it is for those universal rights to be protected. And the United States has worked closely with the Philippines to address the security situation inside the Philippines. Some of that is driven by extremism and terrorists. But the drug trade in the Philippines has also contributed to violence in that country. And the United States has strongly supported efforts by the government in the Philippines to interdict the drug trade and to try to shut it down.\nIt's important however that as those kinds of operations and efforts are undertaken that universal human rights are protected. And engaging in that kind of law enforcement activity consistent with our commitment to human rights is important and we certainly encourage countries around the world, particularly our allies, to do exactly that.\nQ: All right. And lastly, North Korea, shortly before we came out, said today that it was ready to launch another attack against provocations from the U.S. and that was in response to overflights in South Korea. What is the White House reaction to that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Jeff, we continue to be deeply concerned about the provocations and destabilizing activities that are mounted by the North Korean regime. The United States is strongly committed to denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and standing should-to-shoulder with our allies in the Republic of Korea as they face the threat from North Korea. And that's not going to change.\nThere is an opportunity for the North Korean government to escape the deep isolation that they currently face. But it will require them to make a commitment to giving up their nuclear program and coming into compliance with the wide range of international obligations and U.N. Security Council resolutions that they currently ignore.\nSo we've been quite clear about what we believe the North Korean government should do. Thus far, they have chosen the path of confrontation and provocation. As soon as they're ready to consider an alternate path toward reconciliation the international community will be ready to engage.\nChris.\nQ: Josh, the ACC announced -- quickly followed suit with the NCAA and cancelled national championship games in North Carolina as a result of the state's law that prohibits transgender people from using the restrooms of their gender identity. Hillary Clinton already spoke out in favor of the actions of the NCAA. Does the President agree that the actions of these organizations were the right thing to do?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously these individual organizations are making their own decisions. Certainly the President agrees with the values that were articulated by the leaders of both the ACC and NCAA when they talked about their commitment to equality and justice for every American.\nWhen this issue first arose I believe it was earlier this spring, I made the observation that this kind of legislation wasn't just contrary to the values that are held by a lot of Americans who do have a commitment to justice and equality, it's also inconsistent with a smart business strategy. And we have seen private sector businesses and athletic organizations announce their intent to take their business elsewhere, outside the state of North Carolina.\nSo, again, I think that the President has got some concerns over the law, but it's apparent that business leaders and the leaders of athletic organizations have some more concerns, particularly when it comes to the impact that it could have on discriminating against athletes, coaches, or even fans.\nQ: Do you think the decisions to cancel events in that state reflect a national distaste for the law?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think when you consider sort of the wide variety of companies and organizations that have come forward, not just expressing concern with the law but actually making a choice to do business elsewhere, I think you are on solid ground in indicating that opposition to the law is quite widespread and that a wide variety of people are quite uncomfortable with the discriminatory impact that it has.\nIt's not just the NCAA and the ACC, which are collegiate athletic organizations. The NBA has moved the All-Star game. And any number of private sector companies made announcements curtailing their footprint inside the state of North Carolina, again, concerned about the discriminatory impact that this law could have on their employees or their customers or even their fans. So, again, I think this highlights a potential consequence that we discussed in here the very first time I was asked about it.\nQ: But you haven't spoken to the President specifically about these actions this week, about the law?\nMR. EARNEST: In terms of the -- when you say \"these actions,\" you mean the decisions that were announced by the NCAA and the ACC?\nQ: That's right.\nMR. EARNEST: I have not talked about that with him. I don't think we'd weigh in on the decisions that those kinds of private entities are making. But certainly they have described the kinds of values that are leading them to make those decisions, and those values sounds a lot like the values that President Obama has been fighting for, for the last eight years in the White House.\nMichelle.\nQ: You made some points on the economy before we started. And we heard Donald Trump today say that his plans would have the economy growing at a rate of 4 percent a year, which has been disputed by some experts already. But is there anything that you would like to add to those kinds of promises? Because a lot of people hear him say those things.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think -- I'll let others evaluate that proposals that are put forward by the candidates. I think what is clear is that President Obama has put forward and implemented a strategy that's been good for the American economy, that's been good for middle-class families, that's been good for reducing poverty, that's been good for shrinking inequality, and it's been good for growing out economy, particularly when you consider that no other advanced economy in the world has performed as well as the United States has under President Obama's leadership.\nAnd all of that happened even though the United States was in the depths of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression on the day President Obama took office. So in terms of having a test case for evaluating the success of the strategy that President Obama put forward, I think we have a particularly good one, and the results speak for themselves.\nQ: Does the President this week plan on vetoing the 9/11 legislation?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have an update for you on timing, but the President does intend to veto that legislation.\nQ: What's the level of concern that it could be overwritten?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think you don't have to have an advanced degree in math to understand the significant support that exists in the United States Congress for this bill. But the concerns that we have about this legislation are significant, and there are many members of Congress who are sympathetic to the argument. And I think the argument goes something like this: We have a system in this country for identifying, isolating, and even punishing countries that support terrorism. This process is actually one that is established by statute. This is a process where Congress and the administration work together to identify these countries and to isolate them.\nWe believe that is a much more effective way for the United States to respond to state-sponsored terrorism and to prevent countries from giving in to the temptation to sponsor terrorism. That's more effective than a patchwork system of legal decisions that could cloud the clarity that is needed to forcefully respond to state-sponsored terrorism.\nSo I think that's the nexus of -- that's the basic argument that we'd make. And I think there's a lot of sympathy to that argument on Capitol Hill, even if there are a lot of members of Congress who are a little intimidated by the politics. But that's not going to stop the President from taking a principled position and making a principled argument about the best way to protect the country and about the best way to protect the American people from terrorism.\nQ: Well, that's what I'm getting at. The fact that so many Democrats support this bill, but the White House feels exactly the opposite. Those members of Congress couldn't be swayed. So are they just wrong? Are they making a dangerous decision? Well, the decision is already made.\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I would acknowledge that they haven't been swayed. But the President continues to believe that this is an important principle to fight for, and we're going to continue to have conversations with members of Congress and continue to urge them to consider the most effective way for the United States to confront state-sponsored terrorism. We have a mechanism on the books that works well, that highlights effective cooperation among our national security agencies, the executive branch in the United States Congress. That is a more effective system, we believe, than a patchwork system of judges that could in some cases arrive at different conclusions about the culpability of individual countries and their role in terrorist activities.\nClarity is an effective tool. Identifying these countries has the effect of isolating them in the world. And that certainly has an impact on their ability to engage in terrorism or to harm the American people with terrorism. It also serves as a pretty effective deterrent for other countries that might be considering engaging in that kind of activity.\nQ: You've often hit out at Republicans for playing Congress -- playing politics with some of their pieces of legislation. So, in this case -- I mean, you'll speak to the sympathy that you say that there is on the Hill. So do you feel like in this case Democrats are being swayed or overrun by political pressures?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I think -- I mean, look, in this case there are a large number of Democrats and a large number of Republicans that have the same position. So I think you probably have to go ask them exactly why they've taken that position. I think I'm standing here articulating what is a principled position that the President has taken.\nAnd there is nobody here who is unable to understand why the politics of this are hard. I guess you might say the President might have a little bit more standing here in the face of these tough politics to make this argument given how strong his record is in fighting for 9/11 families. He's somebody who prioritized taking Osama bin Laden off the battlefield and bringing him to justice. That is a promise he made good on. President Obama has been a leading advocate of ensuring that first responders to Ground Zero get the kind of support and health care that they need for the risks that they took to try to save their fellow Americans and to rebuild at the site of this terrorist attack. And President Obama has used the occasion of 9/11 over the last eight years to speak powerfully and emotionally about how the families of those who were lost on 9/11 are a genuine inspiration to him and a testament to the resilience of this country.\nSo, look, maybe that gives the President a little more latitude to take this principled stand. But hopefully we'll succeed in persuading some members of Congress to join us.\nQ: So since this has passed, has the President himself reached out to members of Congress on this? And does he plan to?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any presidential-level engagement on this at this point. But there have been extensive conversations between members of the President's national security team and leading officials on Capitol Hill.\nAlex.\nQ: Senator Elizabeth Warren also marked the eighth anniversary of the financial collapse, but not with a PowerPoint. She did by sending a letter to FBI Director Comey, asking for the release of any documents related to the investigations into Wall Street's role in the financial collapse. Does the White House support the release of those documents? Is that something the American people deserve to have access to?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what the White House supports is Director Comey making the decision, independent of any sort of political influence, about the release of investigative material. So I'll leave it to him to find the most effective way to respond to that question. I think what Senator Warren does, though, underscore in her letter is how important it is for us to learn the mistakes that were made in the past, and to build a financial system and build safeguards into our financial system that won't put taxpayers on the hook for bailing out large financial institutions that make bad bets. That's what we've succeeded in doing in Wall Street reform.\nAnd there were many opponents of Wall Street reform who said they couldn't support the legislation because it would throw a wet blanket on the economy. They've been wrong. And we have enjoyed significant, even a historic period of growth, since this bill went into effect and was signed into law by the President of the United States. So it is an indication that we can put in place protections on Wall Street that will insulate middle-class families from the risky bets of Wall Street traders even as we strengthen the overall economy and contribute to strong economic growth, and contribute to growth in the stock markets and in the incomes of middle-class families.\nWe have enjoyed historic gains in both since President Obama signed that bill into law. So again, I think the strategy that President Obama has pursued is one that stands up to a lot of scrutiny when you consider the economic impact of those decisions.\nQ: And another subject. There's some disturbing details that are coming out of this investigation into a boot camp in Parris Island. A Muslim Marine was placed in a dryer by a drill instructor who turned it on several times. He later allegedly committed suicide during a suspected hazing incident. Now, a local paper, Beaufort Gazette, reported that a red dot investigation was actually prompted by a letter to the White House. How closely is the White House following this? Has the President been briefed?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Alex, I think everybody here has seen the news reports. I haven't spoken to the President about this, but I'd be surprised to -- he's the Commander-in-Chief, so I'm confident that he's aware of this situation and certainly aware of these reports.\nThere's no denying that the graphic details that are included in these reports are disturbing. The United States Marine Corps has indicated a commitment to investigating exactly what's happened. And I know that they'll take appropriate action to conduct that investigation and to hold accountable those who are responsible for any sort of misconduct. I know the Marine Corps has already said with regard to this incident that they take all reports of misconduct seriously.\nLook, the men and women in the United States Marine Corps hold themselves to an extraordinarily high standard of personal conduct. And the vast majority of men and women of the United States Marine Corps do exactly that. And that's all the more reason that reports of misconduct must be carefully and thoroughly investigated, and that's exactly what the Marine Corps is doing.\nQ: And so has there been any worry that this might be indicative of kind of a larger issue of the current climate with regards to Islamophobia or hostility towards the Muslim community?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I am confident that the -- well, let me say it this way. Obviously, the Commander-in-Chief is quite concerned about making sure that those young Americans who sign up to serve in our armed forces are in many ways placed under his care, and he takes quite seriously the responsibility that he has as Commander-in-Chief in ensuring that recruits to the United States military are treated with dignity and respect, and not subject to abuse and hazing, even as they undergo the kind of rigorous training that's required to meet the high physical and mental standards of serving in the United States military.\nSo that is something that this Commander-in-Chief has certainly prioritized. I'm also confident that the leadership at the United States Marine Corps has prioritized this, as well. But for the details of their investigation or for sort of any accountability measures that they determine are appropriate, I'll let them speak to that, primarily because if there is any sort of military justice proceeding, I don't want anything that I've said here to be perceived as interfering in that investigation or interfering in those proceedings. So I need to be a little circumspect.\nBut I can certainly say with confidence that the Commander-in-Chief wants to ensure that young Americans who sign up to serve in our military are afforded the respect and fair treatment that they deserve, particularly considering the sacrifice that they've indicated they're prepared to make for the country.\nQ: And just one more question.\nMR. EARNEST: Sure.\nQ: Do you have any more details about the First Family's visit to the Smithsonian African American History Museum yesterday? Have you had a chance to talk to him about it? Was there any exhibits that particularly stuck out to him?\nMR. EARNEST: I have not talked to the President about his visit to the museum last night. What I can tell you is the President will have an opportunity to participate in some of the festivities that are scheduled for the end of next week to mark the opening of the Smithsonian -- or the African American Museum that's been organized by the Smithsonian. So the President and the First Lady are quite enthusiastic about the opening of the museum. And we'll have a little more of an opportunity to talk next week about how they'll participate in those activities.\nJordan.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. The Senate today passed the Water Resources Development Act, which includes emergency funding for Flint and other communities affected by lead contamination. That House version of that bill doesn't contain that funding for various reasons. I'm wondering if the White House has taken any kind of position on this legislation that they support. Do you guys support the passage of this bill?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't seen the details of the bill, so I don't know that we've taken a specific position on it at this point. What we have indicated for quite some time is we do believe that Congress should provide additional resources to the state of Michigan and to the city of Flint to address the situation with regard to the water supply there. But how Congress chooses to do that is something that Congress is going to have to figure out. But this administration will continue to press them to make that a priority.\nToluse.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. In the interview on the radio earlier today, Hillary Clinton indicated that she might not nominate Merrick Garland if she's given to name a Supreme Court justice. And she said that she would take a look broadly and consider anyone who represents the diversity of this country. So I'm wondering if you a have a reaction to the fact that -- or to the idea that Hillary Clinton may, if she wins office, make a different choice than what the President did.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Toluse, I guess what I would say is if Senate Republicans are willing to do their job, it's not going to come to that. If Senate Republicans do their job, Merrick Garland is going to be serving in a lifetime appointment on the United States Supreme Court. And I know that that's an outcome that Secretary Clinton has indicated she strongly supports.\nWhen President Obama announced his decision to nominate Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court, she said the President made a good choice. She described Merrick Garland as somebody who's a brilliant jurist. Her opinion is one that's widely shared by Democrats and Republicans.\nThat's why what Republicans in the United States Senate have done has drawn so much condemnation not just from Democrats all across the country, but even some Republicans who are uncomfortable with the Republican argument that somehow Presidents are not allowed to nominate judges in their last year in office. There's no such provision that exists in the United States Constitution. That's ironic because many of these same Republican senators describe themselves as strict constructionists when it comes to interpreting the Constitution. Apparently that's maybe part of the Constitution that they haven't read.\nIn some cases, you might actually just question the intellectual honesty of some of these senators, particularly people like Senator Cornyn and Senator Cruz that are now advocating for the confirmation of Obama-nominated justices in Texas. You can't have it both ways. If they're concerned about vacancies on the federal bench in Texas, how can you not be concerned about a protracted vacancy on the highest court in the land, particularly when that vacancy we know has prevented the Supreme Court from being able to reach conclusions on some pretty tough questions?\nSo Republicans are playing politics with this issue in a way that's intellectually dishonest and ends up making it look even worse than most people already think they look, when you consider that Congress is pulling in the teens these days.\nSo I don't think there's anything that I've said in my admittedly long answer that Secretary Clinton would disagree with at all. And one thing we know that she agrees with is that Chief Judge Merrick Garland was a good choice by President Obama, and she believes that the United States Senate should do its job and that Republicans in the Senate should do their job, allow him to get a hearing, and that he should be confirmed to serve in a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court.\nQ: I want to ask you about something the President said at a fundraiser earlier this week. He said that this race shouldn't be close, but it is, and that weird stuff happens because Donald Trump won the primary. He said many time previously that he doesn't think Donald Trump will win the presidency. Given the fact that the polls are tightening, and he said this at this fundraiser, is he now more concerned that he will not be succeeded by a Democrat?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the point of the President's remarks is that he doesn't want people to be complacent. And I think there is plenty of evidence that we can point to even today that give the President confidence that his earlier prediction will be correct. But we sure can't take it for granted. And the President himself is not taking it for granted, given how high the stakes are. And that's why you're going to see the President so aggressively working between now and Election Day to ensure that he can, as he described it, hand the baton off to a successor that shares his values.\nQ: And just one more, on Senator Rubio. He introduced a bill on guns to basically try to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists in the wake of the Orlando shooting. I'm wondering if the White House has seen the bill and if you've had a chance to weigh in on it yet.\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't seen the bill, so why don't we take a look at the details and get back to you. But obviously this is an issue that we have been deeply concerned about for some time. So we'll take a look at the proposal that Senator Rubio has put forward, and we'll try to get you an answer on it.\nAndrew.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I wanted to follow up on some of Michelle's questions about the 9/11 bill. Are you waiting for Congress to adjourn before sending the veto?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Andrew, I just don't have an update for you in terms of the timing. Obviously, the Constitution gives the President 10 days to make a decision about whether to sign a bill or to veto it. And the President is going to veto it. I don't want to leave you with the impression that somehow the decision is up on the air. But the President will veto it within the next 10 days, and when that's been completed we'll let you know.\nQ: A different subject. Why are you not making the Syria deal public?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think that we have been quite clear about the details in terms of what the arrangement requires on both sides. Russians have made substantial commitments. The United States have made some commitments with regard to the conduct of opposition groups that we support. And our goal here is to reduce the violence across the country, increase the flow if humanitarian assistance, particularly in communities like Aleppo that need it really badly.\nAnd our goal is to not take our eye off the ball when it comes to applying significant pressure against ISIL. And after we have seen a sustained commitment on both sides to the Cessation of Hostilities, then potentially we could start cooperating with the Russians and further escalate the tempo of strikes against ISIL and other extremist groups that are operating in Syria, including al Qaeda's presence in Syria in the form of al Nusra.\nQ: You would acknowledge that sketching out those aims and sketching out the details is not the same as releasing the details?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I would acknowledge that it's different than releasing paperwork. But I think we have been quite clear about what the United States is committed to, and we've been pretty clear about what we expect the Russians to do.\nQ: Is it ( inaudible.)\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know. This is an agreement that was hammered out by Secretary Kerry. So with regard to the details of the document, I guess I'd refer you to the State Department. But again, I think it's quite clear exactly what it is the United States has indicated we're prepared to do. But we're going to need to see a sustained commitment on the part of the Russians to fulfilling their responsibilities before the United States provides the kind of military cooperation that we know the Russians would like to get.\nRon.\nQ: Given that nothing seems to be happening on the humanitarian part in Syria and that we have a clock ticking, so to speak, is the President personally engaged in trying to work this out so that this process moves forward?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not aware of any phone calls or meetings that the President has convened on this, in part because the whole point of this agreement is to apply pressure to the Russians to get them to use their leverage with the Assad regime to reduce violence and to allow the flow of humanitarian assistance. So what's really needed now is not for the United States to live up to our end of the bargain; we're already doing that. What's needed now is for the Russians to live up to their end of the bargain and use their influence with the Assad regime, to the extent that they're able to -- because that may be the other thing that's revealed here. Maybe the Russians don't have the kind of influence with the Assad regime that they claim to have.\nQ: But just given the stakes now, given that there are months left in the President's time in office, given the huge humanitarian crisis there, why would the President not get invested personally to try to make this thing happen now by applying more pressure on the Russians to exert the pressure that they can put on the Assad regime to get this done?\nMR. EARNEST: Ron, we already have, because we have made clear to them that they're not going to get the kind of military cooperation that they would like -- military coordination that they would like to get until we start to see that humanitarian assistance start flowing.\nSo we're applying maximum leverage. And again, it's going to be up to the Russians to deliver. And maybe they don't have the kind of influence that they claim to have. This is why you've heard me say many times that the Russians' credibility is on the line right now. And it is, and right now we're not seeing them live up to the kinds of -- the terms of the arrangement that they've agreed to.\nQ: So inasmuch as he spoke -- that the Presidents met recently, you would not expect a need for a follow-up conversation now? And again, with the clock ticking, with this -- I hate to use hyperbole -- but the last chance, perhaps, for something positive to happen to resolve this, what we would all agree is a terrible situation?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think -- well, there are a couple of things here. First of all, we have seen a reduction in violence; that is a positive outcome. There is a clearer path for the flow of humanitarian assistance as a result; that is a positive outcome. And what we're waiting is for the next step, which is the flow of humanitarian assistance to commence. And that just hasn't started yet.\nBut there is pressure on the Russians to get it moving. Because we know the thing that they're most interested in, which is being able to coordinate their activities with the United States military. That's something that they can't brag about in the international community because they don't have it right now. And the reason they don't have it right now is because they are either unwilling or unable to use their influence with the Assad regime to guarantee the delivery of this humanitarian aid.\nQ: At the Hispanic Caucus tonight, any expectation the President and Secretary will meet, talk, exchange pleasantries?\nMR. EARNEST: That's certainly a possibility. There's nothing formal planned at all. But there certainly is the possibility that they might see each other backstage.\nQ: But there's been no discussion trying to have a chat since the -- or beginning another moment in the campaign?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I'm not aware of any attempt to arrange a formal meeting.\nQ: The House passed this bill about the -- basically blocking Gitmo transfers. Your reaction? The President is going to veto this, obviously, if it gets that far, if the Senate passed it.\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, I think we've made a strong case for why the President believes it's in our national security interest to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. Those individuals who are currently in the prison at Guantanamo Bay who cannot be transferred safely to other countries can be detained in the United States at a much lower cost, so we could save significant taxpayer dollars.\nKeep in mind we are already detaining hardened, dangerous criminals in the United States. So this doesn't require us to do anything differently than we've already been doing. We've already been doing this kind of thing. And that's why the President believes that this is just a matter of common sense.\nHe's not the only one who believes this. President George W. Bush advocated for the closing of the prison at Guantanamo Bay. National security officials who served in high-ranking positions in the Bush administration believe that closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay is in the best interest of our national security. Military officials who dedicated their lives to protecting this country have indicated that they believe that the prison at Guantanamo Bay should be closed and that doing so would enhance our national security.\nSo the President and the bipartisan group of experts allied with him have made a powerful and persuasive case about closing the prison. And again, I understand the politics of this are tough, but when it comes to America's national security, at some point that should rate higher on the priority list than an individual's reelection prospects.\nQ: And as the process continues to try and find places to transfer those approved for transfer, it is -- you have acknowledged that there are efforts to find new countries where some of these detainees might go to in addition to the places where they've already gone to over the years. That is a possibility?\nMR. EARNEST: I certainly wouldn't rule out that there might be countries who would be taking Gitmo detainees for the first time.\nQ: But you're not acknowledging that there are currently negotiations, discussions underway with other countries to expand the possibility?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not going to talk about any of the ongoing negotiations.\nQ: And just lastly, looking ahead to the United Nations next week, can you give us any kind of a preview of what the President's priorities are? This is arguably his last -- one of his last appearances on the world stage. What are his thoughts going into this? What is he trying to accomplish? Do you have any more detail about specific meetings? We know about the refugee summit, so on and so forth.\nMR. EARNEST: We'll have additional information tomorrow about the President's trip to New York and his visit to the United Nations next week. A couple things that I guess I can point out -- the first is, one hallmark event that the President will convene while he is there is an international gathering of world leaders to discuss what countries around the world can do to address the refugee crisis.\nThere are too few countries around the world that are bearing a significant burden in the form of hundreds of thousands and, in some cases, even millions of individuals who fled their home country to try to avoid violence. And there's more that the international community and that the world must do to help those countries bear that burden.\nAnd we've talked about what the United States has done. We have ramped up the number of refugees that have been admitted to this country over the last couple of years. We've done that without cutting corners when it comes to our national security. Refugees who enter the United States continue to be the most vetted group of individuals that entered the United States. The United States is also the largest bilateral donor of humanitarian assistance to try to meet the needs of those who are fleeing violence. So the United States has done a lot. But we believe that there is more the international community can do to respond to this situation. And that's something that the President will talk about with his counterparts at the United Nations.\nThe President will also give a speech at the U.N. General Assembly. I believe that's scheduled for Tuesday morning. And the President will use that speech to talk about some of the progress that we have made in unifying the international community to take on some significant threats; that the international response that we've mobilized to address climate change, or to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, or to counter ISIL, or even to confront the refugee crisis I think serves as a model for how the world can address problems moving forward.\nAnd the ability of the international community to coordinate on shared challenges is going to be critical to the kind of safer, more prosperous planet that we'd all like to see. President Obama is quite proud of the role that he has played in that process and the role that the United States has played in leading that process. And he is hopeful that his successor will pick up the mantle and do the same thing.\nBut we'll have a more detailed preview in the days ahead.\nQ: Is there a phone call?\nMR. EARNEST: We'll work out the details on that.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, you mentioned again today that President Obama looks forward to doing more campaigning for Mrs. Clinton. And last night, at a campaign rally in Ohio, Donald Trump was critical of the President's campaigning. He said, why isn't he working instead of going out campaigning? Can you respond to that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Mark, the President obviously has been working to balance his responsibilities. His number-one priority is serving the American people as the President of the United States. And he spent the last 10 days or so traveling across the Pacific Ocean and certainly has had a number of meetings with his counterparts overseas. Just yesterday, he had a bilateral meeting with the democratically elected leader of Burma, something that we can only now recently say exists in that country. And as I was just describing to Ron, President Obama is going to spend several days in New York, representing the interests of the United States at the United Nations.\nSo all of those basic responsibilities of the presidency will come first, and they will have an impact on the amount of time that he'll be able to spend advocating for Secretary Clinton's reelection. But President Obama has been a successful President in part because of his ability to do more than one thing at a time. And he certainly does intend to devote some of his time and attention to advocating for Secretary Clinton, because the President recognizes that the stakes in this election are as high as ever. And he made that case in New York on Tuesday night.\nQ: So you're saying it's legitimate for a sitting President not running for election to campaign for others?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President, understandably, has quite strong feelings about the future of the country. And he's got quite strong opinions about who is the best person to replace him. I think it makes a lot of sense that President Obama would make those views known publically.\nI think what's interesting and what is unique about the situation that President Obama is in -- most Presidents who are in their eighth year don't have the political standing to make a forceful case for their successor. But President Obama actually is in a situation where his approval rating with the American public is in the high 50s, according to many polls, and that certainly gives him a lot of influence in making a case for politics. And I think that might be the best explanation for the complaints of the Republican nominee.\nQ: At that rally last night, Donald Trump questioned aloud what the costs of Air Force One are for when the President is campaigning. Is that a question you can answer for him? Or me?\nMR. EARNEST: Not for him. (Laughter.) But there is a formula that's calculated by the Air Force and so there are some numbers that we can produce for you on this.\nQ: Can we get that formula?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what they can do is they can provide you with some information about costs. The other thing that you know is that those costs are regularly reported by the Democratic National Committee as well.\nQ: Will they report the reimbursements?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, that's correct.\nPaul.\nQ: Two questions, Josh. Coming back to the deficit. You're correct when -- you know how I am about numbers -- when you said that the deficit has fallen sharply, that's correct, but the CBO does estimate, in fact, that in this current fiscal year, which ends in two weeks, it's actually going to go up about a third in this final year. Why is it up so sharply this final year of the President's term?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it certainly wasn't helped by the significant tax breaks that Republicans in the Congress passed at the end of last year for wealthy corporations and wealthy individuals. But that was the product of a compromise that President Obama signed into law at the end of last year, the budget bill.\nI don't think President Obama has ever been in a position where he has said that our efforts to promote economic growth and to improve our country's fiscal situation are done. There's more work that we need to do. And in fact, that's why the President is spending so much time advocating for Secretary Clinton, because she's got a good strategy for continuing to strengthen our economy, continuing to make our tax code more fair and, yes, continuing to address the fiscal health of the United States of America.\nI think the point that I'm making is that when President Obama took office, we were being flooded with red ink. Now, some of that is a testament to the weakness in the economy and the financial crisis, but critics of the President's approach said that what the administration was doing would make the problem worse. They were dead wrong. The situation has improved significantly. But there is more work that we need to do, and in fact, that's exactly why the President is interested in making such a strong case for Secretary Clinton -- because he does believe that she is the right person for the job who can strengthen our economy, make our tax code more fair, and have a positive impact on the fiscal situation of the country.\nQ: I want to follow up with something that Mark said. Your point was that the President's numbers are high enough that he should be able to make a compelling case in favor of Mrs. Clinton, right? Other Presidents have had actually higher approval numbers at this point than the President has -- Eisenhower in 1960 did not campaign enough for Nixon and he lost. Clinton had higher numbers at this point in 2000, did not campaign for Gore and he lost. Is the President going to spend sufficient time on the trail in October to push her over? Because he really hasn't done all that much so far.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, each of these situations is unique. And I think the point that I'm making is that rarely in history, and certainly not in recent history, have we had a situation in which there was a President in his eighth year who was as well-regarded by the public and by his party's nominee and felt strongly enough in supporting his party's nominee to be a force on the campaign trail.\nAnd, again, in some cases -- there are a variety of explanations for why the stars haven't aligned in that way in recent, previous years, but because they have in this situation, the President is in a rather unique position to make a persuasive case to the electorate. And I think my point is I think that that unique and uniquely strong political positioning is the explanation for the criticism from the Republican nominee.\nQ: He's done one or two things so far. No trips to Florida, no trips to Ohio. What's on the agenda for the --\nMR. EARNEST: Stay tuned. We'll get the opportunity to visit those fine communities before Election Day.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I want to ask you about hacking for just a minute. We've talked previously about cyber espionage being a major issues. The President has spoken about it with various leaders from around the world. And yet at times it seems as if there's this hesitancy to have a specific declaration accusing the Russians of hacking incidents. So I'm just wondering, what's the reason behind sort of the hesitancy to make a specific attribution? Is it because then you'd have to do something in response to it? Tell me about that. What is the administration's policy in that respect?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think hesitance is a word that our critics may use; it's certainly not one that I would use. Some of the reports that we have seen about cyber intrusions are under the close scrutiny of the FBI. And we've got the foremost experts in the United States government trying to get to the bottom of what exactly happened and trying to figure out what we can do to prevent it from happening again or in other places.\nQ: It seems like an open secret, though, in Washington. It's not like they're going to blame it on Canada. People here widely feel like it's Russia. I know they're studying it, but I'm sure they have enough evidence at this stage to sort of have a direction in which they're going. Would you agree with that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I'll let the FBI speak to what evidence they've been able to amass. But I think that they're also cognizant of the fact that as soon as they make a declaration like that most people are going to understandably be interested in seeing that evidence. And some of that evidence may not be something that we want to show. We don't necessarily want to reveal sources and methods that the FBI uses to conduct these kinds of investigations.\nThat's part of it. But it certainly does raise broader policy questions with regard to our response, because I think that would be the other understandable question that people would ask, that once you have made a formal announcement about an individual or an entity or a country or a criminal enterprise being responsible for a particular cyber intrusion, I think it's an entirely legitimate question to ask what's the response going to be.\nAnd formulating an appropriate response in this area is something that the President and other policymakers have acknowledged is rather complicated. We're in unexplored territory here. And the President is quite interested in trying to establish international norms, rules of the road about what's appropriate and what's not, and also making a determination absolutely out what is an appropriate level of a response.\nThe other thing about this, Kevin, that's relevant here is the United States also may be in a position where we want to respond but not announce it in advance, or maybe not announce it ever. The President has acknowledged that the United States has substantial capabilities in this area -- more substantial than anybody else's.\nSo there are a lot of factors that go into this. But any sort of decision to reveal information about the investigation is going to come from my colleagues at the FBI. And any sort of decision to attribute the intrusion to an individual or an entity or an organization or a country is something that will be carefully considered by the President and his national security team in close consultation with the FBI, given the significant policy consequences that are raised by blaming someone.\nSo that's the situation that we face right now. But this situation is certainly one that has certainly attracted the attention of the U.S. government's foremost experts on cybersecurity and they certainly, as we've seen, attracted the attention of the President of the United States.\nQ: I want to circle back on the Dakota pipeline. We talked about it earlier this week, and you mentioned that the Army Corps of Engineers really was asking just -- a pause, we just want to take a closer look at effect. The statement by DOJ, DOI and the Army Corps effectively came right after a judge essentially said go ahead and go forward with this particular project. What was the timing reasoning behind the ask for another delay?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, they're not asking for a delay. They're actually going to pause the project.\nQ: Why?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, because I think they want to make sure -- I think people across the country can understand that when the government is engaged in a significant infrastructure project near your house or near your property, I think you want the government to be rigorous about making sure that interests of people who live in the area are carefully considered. And that's exactly what's happening.\nQ: Yes, but don't you think the judge went through all that in the suit itself? I mean, in making that determination it's not as if they didn't have lots of evidence that they looked at to ensure that the safety of this project could go forward. They looked at all the different evidence along the way. I'm just wondering why, after the judge said, yes, go ahead and go forward, the administration said maybe it's worth another look.\nMR. EARNEST: Actually I think what the judge said is that you have the approval to go forward if you'd like. And what the Department of Interior and the Army Corps of Engineers committed to do is going above and beyond the legal requirements to make sure that the interests of people who live in the community were appropriate factored in.\nSo, look, there are people in both parties who are committed to this idea of private property rights and making sure that the interests of private citizens and private landholders are factored in when the government is making decisions. And I would expect that people in both parties would be pretty sympathetic and actually quite supportive of the government's decision in this case to make sure that people who live in the area of this infrastructure project have had their concerns and their rights properly considered.\nQ: Last one on that. When a petroleum group in North Dakota says this is an example -- another example of executive overreach, what do they have wrong?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I haven't seen the argument and I'm not really sure exactly how much merit it has. The truth is the administration is committed to a system that is focused on the interests of local communities. And that certainly is something that the administration has made a priority. That notwithstanding, while President Obama has served in office we've seen thousands of miles of pipelines be constructed in the United States, and the oil and gas industry has been producing at record levels. So I think it's a little hard to say that the Obama administration has gotten in the way when you consider the productivity of this industry during President Obama's tenure in office.\nBut I think you certainly can say that the Obama administration is interested in going above and beyond legal requirements to make sure that the interests of local citizens, local property owners and people who happen to live in the community are properly taken into account when a large infrastructure project like this is being considered.\nQ: On Gitmo, is it classified information the amount the United States pays other countries to take on detainees, the transfers, or is there cash exchanged? How does that work?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there are individual diplomatic negotiations that take place between the United States and other countries to find an appropriate setting where individuals can be safely transferred in a way that doesn't pose an undue threat to U.S. national security. Because of the interests that our partner countries may have in the confidentiality of those arrangements, I think it's entirely that when it comes to their national security that we're not advertising the details of those arrangements.\nBut those arrangements are always predicated on protecting the American people. And in fact, the transfer cannot go through until the Secretary of Defense has personally certified that sufficient arrangements have been made to ensure the safety and security of the American people after the transfer has taken place.\nCheryl.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. On the CR, did the White House send a specific request, funding request for the Louisiana flooding and Flint, Michigan to be put on the CR?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Cheryl, as you know, the administration has been working closely with officials on the ground in Louisiana to determine what resources are going to be necessary to meet the immediate needs of the people in Louisiana who were affected by the flooding, but also to make sure that the state of Louisiana and the people of Louisiana have the resources that they need to come back stronger than ever.\nAnd the President made a commitment when he traveled down there last month that even after the attention on this disaster had waned in the national media that the Obama administration was going to make sure that we followed through.\nSo my colleagues at FEMA and the Department of Housing and Urban Development have been working very closely with officials in Louisiana to determine what kind of assistance is needed. And the question I think really now for Congress is, are they going to be prepared to do what's necessary to help the state of Louisiana recover? The one thing that the people of Louisiana have going for them is that they've got a Democratic governor and a Democratic President who are firmly behind them and who are committed to making sure that they have the resources that they need to rebuild their communities and to rebuild their lives.\nThe question now is, are the Republicans that they elected to represent them in Congress going to get the job done? And what they have going for them is Republicans are in the majority in Congress, so, presumably, if those Republicans that they elected to represent them in Congress are effective they're going to be able to prevail on the members of their own party to support legislation to rebuild those communities. If they do, they can count on the support of the Democratic President to sign that bill into law, and the can count on the Democratic governor to get the job done effectively.\nBut it's a real open question when it comes to how effective their Republican representation in Congress is. But I guess the one thing that -- I guess the other thing they have going for them is that there's an election in about eight weeks, so if they have concerns about how effective their representation is in Congress then they'll have an opportunity to do something about it.\nQ: So I guess the question is sort of the delivery method. Should disaster funding be on the CR or should it be on a later supplemental bill down the road?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, that's something Congress is going to have to figure out. The President believes that they should get it done as soon as possible. And if they want to wait for a CR, do it separate from a CR, add it to the CR, whatever it is that they want to do, the President believes that Congress should get this moving and get it to his desk so he can sign it into law and we can start bringing some additional relief to the people of Louisiana who have been through a pretty tough summer.\nFred.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I've got a few items. I wanted to ask about the situation in the House yesterday with the IRS Commissioner. The House Republicans were willing to delay -- were going to try to vote on impeachment yesterday, and then they delayed it. They're going to have a hearing in the Judiciary next week. Is the President concerned about this? Is he angry about this at all that the House Republicans are moving on Commissioner Koskinen?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Fred, for the President's view -- he actually talked about this when he was up in New York on Tuesday. So we can get you a transcript of those remarks.\nQ: And also, with regards to the Zika funding, if the GOP does not budge on the Planned Parenthood issue, spending on that, would the President be willing to sign a bill with it? Or would he be willing to forego any additional Zika --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, right now, the bill that the House has passed that includes a variety of ideological riders, including banning funding for Planned Parenthood and confederate flags -- that didn't pass the Senate. So the President certainly is not going to support a Zika bill that's freighted with a bunch of ideological riders. But it appears that it's not going to get through the Senate either.\nQ: But if it did --\nMR. EARNEST: It will not. We tested the proposition.\nQ: If the President were willing to, then the Senate Democrats would probably go along with it.\nMR. EARNEST: I don't think that's really the way that Senator Democrats make their decisions. I think if our experience has shown us anything in the last few years, they've got minds of their own.\nQ: And one more issue. There's been conflicting reports about whether the President is looking at doing a no first strike pledge with regards to nuclear attack. Would there be a pause on that given the kind of aggression North Korea has shown with their test launches?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Fred, I know that there's been a lot of public discussion and speculation about this issue. I don't really have a lot of insight to share on any sort public discussions that may or may not be going on inside the administration. Suffice it to say that the President has made important progress over the last seven years in trying to realize his vision of a world without nuclear weapons. And the President's going to keep fighting to make progress in that direction until his last day in office.\nJohn Bennett.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. On Tuesday, the President talked about criminal justice reform getting done in the context of the next President and the next Congress. Has he concluded that this just isn't going to get done before January 20th?\nMR. EARNEST: No, the President is determined to continue to press Congress to seize the common ground that exists. There's bipartisan support for criminal justice reform. There are conservative Democrats -- sorry -- there are conservative Republicans and progressive Democrats, both of whom have forcefully articulated their view that we need to reform our criminal justice system to make it more fair and more just.\nSo, unfortunately, this is an issue that's gotten bogged down in the kind of dysfunction that's not served the America people very well, and the President's been disappointed by that. But the President is going to continue to urge members of Congress and he's going to continue to urge people in both parties that have influence over members of Congress to encourage them to make this a priority and try to get this done. And the lives of millions of Americans can be improved if we can implement some of these reforms.\nQ: That was a different way he described when it could pass. It was all about the need to elect Democrats so that it would pass. Why the change there?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, the President strongly supports bipartisan criminal justice reform, but we haven't seen as much progress on that as we had hoped we would see at the beginning of the year. So I think the point is that if it doesn't get done this year, the President is hopeful that the next Congress will be one that includes more people who are supportive of those reforms and in most cases that means electing democrats.\nYes ma'am.\nQ: Thank you. So the Office of the Director of National Intelligence -- back to Guantanamo for a moment -- released its latest report today and it confirmed that at least two more Guantanamo Bay detainees released under Barack Obama's administration have returned to the fight. I'm wondering if you can speak any further to those conversations that the U.S. has with these nations that are accepting detainees and just speak to those two detainees released under Obama.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think what we have seen is that that report indicated that the so-called recidivism rate is below 6 percent and that's an indication of how rigorous the process is when we are negotiating with other countries around the world to take these detainees and impose requirements that don't put the United States or the American people at risk.\nOne of the things that I think is true is I do think this is a good illustration of how bankrupt the argument is on the other side. Over the weekend, former Vice President Cheney -- not one to miss out an opportunity to make a political argument out of 9/11 -- published an op-ed in a British tabloid, appropriately enough, criticizing the President's support for closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay. And in that op-ed he identified at least two individuals who he said were a good illustration of why he opposed closing the prison. He said these were two individuals who used to be in Guantanamo Bay and had been released, and had returned to the battlefield and posed a risk to the United States.\nHe left out two key facts -- at least two key facts in his op-ed. The first is, he didn't note that those two individuals that he named in the op-ed were individuals who were released while he was sitting in the Vice President's office. He also didn't note that those two individuals were taken off the battlefield while Barack Obama was sitting in the Oval Office.\nSo I think that's a pretty good illustration of the wisdom and strength of the approach that President Obama has taken when it comes to closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\nJohn, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thanks a lot, Josh. I just wanted to get your state of the campaign midway through September, and the President up in Philadelphia, as you know, on Monday. And you were intimately involved in the President's campaign for President back in 2008 and also 2012. Would you acknowledge that the level of excitement that existed for President Obama, when he was campaigning for President in 2008, is not there right now for Hillary Clinton and her run for the White House?\nMR. EARNEST: Well I think that requires a lot of polling analysis that I'm not prepared to do.\nQ: What's your feel for the campaign? Because you're on the ground floor, you understood what it was like 2008 -- and some of the excitement. I'm curious as to whether you see this right now for Mrs. Clinton.\nMR. EARNEST: I regularly warn people of drawing conclusions about the feeling on the ground and assessing the state of the electorate when they're inside the District of Columbia. I think people who are serving on the ground in battleground states like North Carolina and Florida and Arizona and Georgia are in a much better position to evaluate just the excitement and enthusiasm and organization that exists on the ground in support of both candidates.\nAnd I know that some of the people that I worked closely with on the President's campaign in 2008 are also intimately involved in Secretary Clinton's campaign, so they may be in a better position to try to assess for you what kind of excitement and enthusiasm they're seeing out there on the campaign trail.\nI can tell you that President Obama is quite personally excited about this race, and I think he conveyed that pretty persuasively in his remarks. And I think anybody who was at his event on Tuesday in Philadelphia would note that there wasn't just a lot of enthusiasm for him and for his speech in that crowd, but I know that a couple of times he was interrupted with chants of the name of the Democratic nominee. So I think that's an indication that that crowd was, to borrow a phrase, pretty fired up and ready to go. And hopefully we'll see a lot more of that over the next seven or eight weeks.\nThanks, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 2:15 P.M.

{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "note": "Speech as delivered.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119148", "text": "\"Hello! Hello, CHCI! It is so great to be back here with so many friends and to see so many young people here because that fits the theme this year: educate, engage, vote. And I can't think of better marching orders for the next 54 days. [Cheers.] And anyone who just heard the congresswoman knows we cannot be on the sidelines. This is the most consequential election in our lifetimes.\nI want to recognize the Institute for all you do to inspire the next generation of Latino leaders. Last year, I had the chance to spend time with some of the CHCI interns and fellows. It really was like seeing the future of America in one room. I can't wait to see everything that they achieve. And I can't wait, if I'm fortunate enough to be president, to put some of them to work!\nAnd I want to thank all my friends in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. You fight every single day to lift up the Latino community – when the cameras are rolling and when the cameras are off, at home in your districts and here in Washington. And no one understands better than you the pivotal moment we're at right now – not just for Latinos but for our country.\nMy friends in the caucus have traveled to every battleground state, registered voters. You've stayed focused no matter what kind of outlandish and offensive comments we have heard from my opponent and his supporters. By the way, I personally think a taco truck on every corner sounds absolutely delicious.\nNow, here's a confession: Running for president is never easy, but it shouldn't be, right? But tonight I have the ultimate challenge: speaking after President Obama. He's always a tough act to follow, in more ways than one.\nI, for one, don't think the President gets the credit he deserves for rescuing our economy from another Great Depression. Think of what we've achieved these last eight years. American businesses have created 15 million new jobs since the recession. Twenty million Americans have health coverage – and no one has seen a bigger drop in uninsured rates under the Affordable Care Act than Latino Americans. We got more good news this week. A report came out showing that poverty is going down, and incomes for American families are going up, and Latino families have seen the biggest increase of all.\nNow, that doesn't mean we rest on our laurels by any stretch. Our work is far from finished. But I am more confident than ever that our best days are still ahead of us. I believe with all my heart that the American Dream is alive and it's big enough for everyone to share its promise. That doesn't mean that lots of people are still not hurting, because I know they are. And when you hear a presidential candidate spewing bigotry and hate, it's easy to get discouraged. But we're here because we know this election is a choice between not just two people but two very different visions for our America's future.\nEither we're going to make our economy work for everyone, or just those at the top.\nEither we're going to fear our differences, or embrace and celebrate our diversity.\nEither we're going to pit Americans against each other and deepen the divides, or we're going to be stronger together.\nToday, as you know, we're in the midst of Hispanic Heritage Month. In classrooms across America, children will study Dolores Huerta and Cesar Chavez, Juliбn and Joaquнn Castro, Justice Sotomayor, Roberto Clemente and Laurie Hernandez, Gloria Estefan and Lin-Manuel Miranda, and countless others – names we know and names we might not know, but every one of whom has enriched this country for generations.\nWhether you're Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Latin American, Afro-Latino, whether your family just arrived or has been here since before the United States even existed [cheers], you're not strangers. You're not intruders. You're our neighbors, our col-leagues, our friends, our families. You make our nation stronger, smarter, more creative. And I want you to know that I see you and I am with you, and time and again – time and again we have seen that when we invest in the community, when we make it possible for Latinos to get the health care you need, get the education you desire, compete for jobs, start new businesses, pursue your dreams, all of America benefits.\nAs I said this afternoon in North Carolina, we are in the final stretch of this election. And I intend to close my campaign the way I began my career, fighting for kids and families. That's been the cause of my life. It will be the passion of my presidency. So tonight I want to mention two things I'll do in the first 100 days of my administration to help families in every corner of America.\nFirst, we do need to create an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. There's something wrong when Latinos are 17 percent of our country's population but hold only 2 percent of its wealth. We've got to work together to connect more Latinos with good jobs that pay good wages, with more opportunities to get the skills they need, to go to college, to launch new ventures, to build wealth that can be passed on to your kids and your grandkids. So we're going to make, in my first 100 days, the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II, jobs in infrastructure, manufacturing, technology, innovative, clean energy.\nAnd we're going to cut red tape and taxes and expand access to capital for small busi-nesses, including the Latino-owned small businesses that create so many jobs and so much growth in communities everywhere. And I want to give a particular shout-out to Latina small business owners. Not everyone knows this, but you are among the fastest-growing group of entrepreneurs in America. And we're going to put families first with new solutions that reflect the way people live and work today. Supporting families with paid family leave, earned sick days, and affordable childcare isn't a luxury, it's a necessity. When families are strong, America is strong.\nAnd that brings me to another important family issue. In those first 100 days, I will send a proposal for comprehensive immigration reform to the Congress. My proposal will keep families together, and it will include a path to citizenship. Now, I know this isn't the first time you've heard it. In fact, people have been making the same promise for more than a decade. But I believe with all my heart that some things are too important to give up on. I've been called a lot of things; I've never been called a quitter.\nAnd in this election – in this election, we have a chance to show that comprehensive immigration reform isn't just the smart thing to do, it's what the American people demand. And you know how we'll show that? Well, I hope to have a Democratic Congress next January. [Cheers.] But no matter what, on my first day in office I will reach out to Republicans and say, this is your chance to help millions of families and show that your party, the party of Lincoln, is better than Donald Trump.\nAnd while we're fighting for comprehensive immigration reform, we're going to keep families together. When the deadlocked Supreme Court put DAPA and expanded DACA on hold for 5 million immigrants, it was devastating to millions of families. But the court didn't actually rule on the substance of the case. And as I've said repeatedly, I believe DAPA and expanded DACA are squarely within the President's authority, and will I protect them and keep fighting for them.\nBut in addition to defending DAPA and DACA, there's more we can do. We need a simple, straightforward system where other people with sympathetic cases who are contributing to their communities can make their case and be eligible for deferred action too. Like people who experience and report extreme labor abuses. And we won't stop there. We're going to end family detention, close private detention facilities, and stop the raids and roundups. No child should have to say goodbye to their parents every morning not knowing if their mom or dad will be there when they get home.\nSo here's the bottom line. Comprehensive immigration reform will not only be the right thing to do, but it will add $700 billion to our economy and enable America to be what it's always been – a place where people from around the world can come to reunite with family, start new businesses, pursue their dreams, apply their talents to American growth and innovation.\nNow, I know this has been a long road and we wouldn't be where we are today without your persistence and the quiet courage of families in every state of our union, and we certainly wouldn't be here without the bravery of the young men and women who have risked their very place in the United States by coming forward and fighting for their own future and the future of millions of others. They helped change the conversation. And when President Obama created DACA, it changed their lives.\nRight now, 750,000 undocumented young people in America are going to school, working, and planning for their future. They're DREAMers in much more than name. I've met so many. I've listened to their stories. They've done everything we've asked of them and made our country stronger in return.\nSo when Donald Trump promises to rip that all away on Day One, when he promises to round up and deport all of the 16 million people living and working among us, including American citizen children who were born here to parents who are undocumented, these are the faces I see.\nI picture Astrid Silva – who I met in Las Vegas. Many of you know her story: She came to this country from Mexico at the age of four with nothing but a doll, a cross, and the dress she was wearing. Now she's in her 20s, advocating for the rights of everywhere.\nI picture a young man I never met, whose high school teacher wrote me a few months ago to share his story. His teacher told me that his former student was funny, enthusiastic, and patriotic. He played the drums in the school marching band and after graduation in 2005, proudly enlisted in the U.S. Army. Before shipping off to Iraq, he stopped by the school so everyone could see him in his new uniform.\nHe was, his teacher wrote, 'as respectful and optimistic as any student who ever entered my classroom.' He was also a DREAMer, brought here as an undocumented child. He loved America, and hoped one day to earn his citizenship. But in April 2007, while on a mission in Baghdad, he was killed by an improvised explosive device. He was just 19. The Army called him a hero and he was posthumously granted the American citizenship he'd always wanted.\nAll these years later – his teacher still treasures his memory. And this teacher wanted me to know – he wanted me to know that despite what Donald Trump may say, immigrants are not rapists and criminals. The truth is, this young man may not have been born here, but he represented the best values of our country.\nWe teach our children that America is one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Not just for people who look a certain way or worship a certain way, but for all. Everywhere I go, people tell me how concerned they are by the extreme policies and divisive rhetoric they've heard from my opponent – from the racist lie about Mexican immigrants that launched his presidential campaign to his racist attacks on a federal judge.\nAnd every time we think he's hit rock bottom, he sinks even lower. His latest target? A minister in Flint, Michigan who respectfully asked him not to use her pulpit for political attacks. He called her a nervous mess.\nHow insulting, how dead wrong. Reverend Faith Green Timmons is not a nervous mess – she's a rock for her community in trying times, and she deserves better and so does America. And again today, he did it again. He was asked one more time, 'Where was President Obama born?' And he still wouldn't still say 'Hawaii.' He still wouldn't say 'America.' This man wants to be our next president? When will he stop this ugliness, this bigotry?\nNow, he's tried to reset himself and his campaign many times. This is the best he can do. This is who he is. And so we need to decide who we are. If we just sigh and shake our heads and accept this, then what does that tell our kids about who we are? We need to stand up and repudiate this divisive rhetoric. We need to stop him conclusively in November in an election that sends a message that even he can hear. We need to set the kind of example we want for ourselves and our children and our grandchildren\nParents and teachers are already worried about what they're calling the 'Trump Effect.' Bullying and harassment are on the rise in our schools, especially targeting students of color, Muslims, and immigrants.\nAt a high school basket game in Indiana, white students held up Trump signs and taunted Latino players on the opposing team with chants of 'Build the wall' and 'Speak English.'\nDonald Trump is running the most divisive campaigns of our lifetimes. His message is you should be afraid – afraid of people whose race or ethnicity is different, or whose religious faith is different, or who were born in a different country. There's no innuendo or dog whistles anymore. It's all right out there in the open now. So we've got to come back twice as strong and twice as clear.\nJust this week, a mother in Florida wrote to me about her 11-year-old son, Francisco. He's proud to be American, Colombian, Ecuadorian, and Puerto Rican. As he calls it, a 'potluck' of Hispanic heritage. And Francisco has been following this election very closely, his mother told me. He wears his 'Love Trumps Hate' pin every day and refuses to take it off. When his father warned him that might make him a target for bullies, Francisco looked his father in the eye and he said: 'I was always told to stand up for myself and what I believe in. And I believe Trump is wrong.' And good for you, Francisco.\nThat's what we have to do in this election, and that's what so many of you are doing already: standing up to the bullying and bigotry wherever it comes from.\nTogether, we must send this resounding message, and we need to inspire a level of turnout that will help us win up and down the ticket.\nWe've set an ambitious goal of registering and committing 3 million people to vote in this election that would not have otherwise voted, and we can't do it without you. Nearly half of Latinos in America are under 35, and we need you to show up and make your voices heard in this election.\nSo we're going to keep asking for your help. Keep hitting the campaign trail. Please talk to your friends, your neighbors, your community – everyone you see between now and November 8th. Tell them to go to hillaryclinton.com, or text JOIN, J-O-I-N to 47246 to get involved. This election is too important for anyone to sit on the sidelines, as we heard from Congresswoman Sanchez.\nSo let's stand up for a future where we put families first. Where we build bridges, not walls.\nAnd yes, together we can prove love trumps hate. Thank you all very much.\"", "timestamp": "2016-09-15", "title": "Remarks to the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute in Washington, D.C"}
{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "note": "Speech as delivered. Secretary Clinton was introduced by Jamestown resident Martha Soltani.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119158", "text": "\"Thank you. Thank you all. Hello, everyone. It's great to be here at UNC Greensboro. I want to thank Martha for that wonderful introduction. It means so much to have her here along with her wonderful daughter, Sara, and her mother, Barbara. And the story she told is really one that motivates me every day because it is kids like Sara that led me to politics in the first place to try to make our country and our world better for them. So to see Sara grown up and thriving is very special, and your whole family's support really means the world to me. Thank you, Martha, Sara, Barbara\nI have to say it's great to be back on the campaign trail. As you may know, I recently had a cough that turned out to be pneumonia. I tried to power through it, but even I had to admit that maybe a few days of rest would do me good. And I'm not great at taking it easy, even under ordinary circumstances. But with just two months to go until Election Day? Sitting at home was pretty much the last place I wanted to be.\nBut it turns out having a few days to myself was actually a gift. I talked with some old friends. I spent time with our very sweet dogs. I did some thinking. The campaign trail doesn't really encourage reflection, and it's important to sit with your thoughts every now and then. And that did help me reconnect with what this whole campaign is about.\nPeople like me – we're lucky. When I'm under the weather – now, I just want to have a conversation, and other people can wave their arms and their signs. But I want you to think with me for a minute about how I certainly feel lucky. When I'm under the weather, I can afford to take a few days off. Millions of Americans can't. They either go to work sick, or they lose a paycheck, don't they?\nLots of Americans still don't even have insurance, or they do but it's too expensive for them to actually use. So they toss back some Tylenols, they chug orange juice, and they hope that the cough or the virus goes away on its own.\nLots of working parents can't afford childcare, which in many states costs as much as college tuition. So for millions of moms and dads, if they get sick, there's no backup. They're on their own, aren't they?\nThat's the story for too many people still in America. When illness strikes, or an accident happens, you feel you're on your own. If you lose your job or can't afford college, you're on your own. If your aging parent starts needing more help, and you don't know what to do, you're on your own.\nLife events like these are catastrophic for some families, but mere bumps in the road for others. I have met so many people living on a razor's edge, one illness away from losing their job, one paycheck away from losing their home. And that goes against everything we stand for as Americans. Because some things should not come down to luck. Some things should be within reach for everyone, no matter what. Like financial security. Like affordable health care. Like the peace of mind that comes with knowing that if something goes wrong, your family will be okay. And above all, the knowledge that no matter what, your president is fighting for you and will always have your back.\nThat right there, that's why I got into this race. I am running for everyone working hard to support their families, everyone who's been knocked down but gets back up. The factory workers on their feet all day, and the nurses looking after patients all night. I'm running for young people like so many of you here, who dream of changing our world for the better, and for all the parents and grandparents supporting those dreams by dedicating every dollar they can spare to your education.\nI'm running for the LGBT teenager here in North Carolina who sees your governor sign a bill legalizing discrimination and suddenly feels like a second-class citizen. And if anyone wonders what the costs of discrimination are, just ask the people and businesses of North Carolina. Look at what's happening with the NCAA and the ACC. This is where bigotry leads, and we can't afford it – not here, not anywhere else in America.\nI'm running for women like Janelle Turner. Back in May of last year, Janelle was diagnosed with breast cancer. She went through nearly six months of very tough treatments. Last October, she brought her eight-year-old daughter to one of our rallies in Iowa and they made a huge sign that read, 'Thirteenth chemo yesterday. Three more. Hear me roar!' Wouldn't you want to meet the woman behind that sign? Well, I sure did. So we got talking, and we've stayed in touch. She keeps promising me she'll see me at the inauguration. And I tell her I'll keep working to get there, but she'd better be there too.\nI'm running for her and all the mothers and fathers trying to get and stay healthy so they can be there for their kids. But perhaps most of all, I'm running for those kids. Standing up for children has been the work of my life. As a lawyer with the Children's Defense Fund, as First Lady in Arkansas, in the White House, as a Senator, I have fought for kids housed in adult jails, kids who have been neglected and abused, kids who couldn't get health insurance because of pre-existing conditions, kids with disabilities so they could go to school. You heard today from someone I've known for a long time, now grown up and a lovely young woman, Anastasia Somoza. I learned from my family and my Methodist faith that we are each called to do all the good we can for all the people we can for however long we can. And to me, that means making sure all our children have the chance to live up to their God-given potentials.\nSo when I meet a little girl in Nevada terrified that her parents are going to be deported, it hits me right in the gut. When I meet a little boy in Flint, Michigan, who can't drink the water at home or in school because it's poisoned with lead, that gets me going. All I want to do is get to work making things better for them.\nThat's why I care so much about national security too. I want to give our kids a safer world. To me, that means a world with strong allies, more friends, fewer enemies, and fewer nuclear weapons. It also means leading the fight against climate change so we can leave our kids a health planet.\nMy opponent in this race disagrees with me on every one of these fronts. Just a few days ago he said that if another country's troops taunted ours – not fired at them, but taunted them, just taunts – he'd responded – he would respond by blowing them out of the water. He would start a war over that. That is just one more reason, my friends, why the stakes in this election are as high as any in our lifetimes.\nI've been involved in politics in one way or another for many years. It is not an easy business. It can get rough and I've built up some defenses. When it comes to public service, I'm better at the 'service' part than the 'public' part. But this is why I do it, and this is who I'm in it for: to make life better for children and families. And that's what this race has always been about for me.\nWell, now we're in the final stretch. There are just 54 days till Election Day. Just 54 days till the most consequential vote of our lifetimes. And just a little more than a month until early voting starts here in North Carolina. Let's make these days count, particularly here, because you know what your governor and legislature tried to do – make it harder for young people to vote, harder for people of color, harder for people with disabilities, harder for the elderly. There can't be any more motivation than that to make sure every young person, every person of color, every person with a disability, every older person turns out and votes.\nSo in these final days, let's try to tune out all the chatter and the nonstop analysis that doesn't often have much to do with what the next president has to do to create good jobs, to create opportunity, to make it possible for every young person to afford to go to college or get the skills that you need for the jobs of the future. Let's talk about what really matters.\nAnd here's my promise to you. I'm going to close my campaign the way I began my career and the way I will serve as your president should you give me that great honor – focused on opportunities for kids and fairness for families.\nNext week, I'll go to Philadelphia to talk about challenges facing our young people; in Florida, to focus on building an economy that welcomes everyone's contributions, in-cluding people with disabilities; then I'll be back here in North Carolina, to meet with more working families. From now until November 8th, everywhere I go, I'm going to talk about my ideas for our country. My campaign has rolled out detailed plans in 38 different policy areas – yes, somebody actually counted. Everything from reining in Wall Street to creating good-paying jobs to fighting Alzheimer's to supporting people with autism. You see, I have this old-fashioned notion that if you're running for president, you should say what you plan to do, how you're going to get it done, and how you're going to pay for it. You can read it all on my website, hillaryclinton.com. We even put it in a new book called, you guessed it, Stronger Together. Get a copy of it because it tells you everything Tim Kaine and I intend to do.\nNow, like a lot of women, I have a tendency to over-prepare. I sweat the details, whether we're talking about the exact level of lead in the water in Flint, or how many North Carolina kids are in early enrichment programs, or the precise interest rate on your student loans right down to the decimal. Because you know what? It's not a detail if it's your kid. It's not a detail if it's your family. It's a big deal. And it should be a big deal to your president.\nNow, I confess, I'll never be the showman my opponent is, and that's okay with me. Just look at – look at the show he put on with Dr. Oz today. But I am going to deliver for you and your family, just like I did for Sarah all those years ago with the Children's Health Insurance Program, that gave her the chance to be the extraordinary young woman she is. And I'll tell you something else. People accuse me of all kinds of things. You probably have seen that. But nobody ever accuses me of quitting. And I will never give up, I'll never walk away, no matter how tough the going gets. I'm actually asking Americans to hold me accountable for my ideas and hold my opponent accountable for his.\nWe don't need a president who says the minimum wage is too high. We need a president who knows that Americans deserve a raise to get to a living wage. We don't need a president who wants to take away people's health coverage. We need a president who wants everyone to have quality, affordable health care. And we don't need a president who apparently thinks only married people deserve paid leave and only mothers stay home with kids. We don't need someone who rushes out a half-baked plan just weeks before an election after decades of ignoring or putting down working moms. We need a president who has spent years fighting for these issues, who has a plan to support all families in all their various shapes. Ask yourself which candidate you can count on to be on your side, respect your family, stand up and fight for you and your kids.\nThat is who you should vote for on November 8th because as Michelle Obama said in her fabulous speech at the Democratic convention, when we go to the polls this November, the real choice isn't between Democrat or Republican. It's about who will have the power to shape our children for the next four years of their lives. It's also about the kind of country we want to be and what we want to leave behind for future generations. People have to decide, are we going to make our economy work for everyone or just those at the top? Are we going to bring people together or pit Americans against each other and rip our country apart? Are we going to work with our allies to keep us safe, or are we going to put a loose cannon in charge who would risk everything generations of Americans have worked so hard to build?\nNow, I have a lot of confidence in the American people and in our country. My opponent keeps running us down, saying we're weak, a disaster, an embarrassment. Every time he says things like that, I think about Janelle and her strength in the face of cancer, or Martha and Sarah in the face of their health challenges, and that little boy in Flint, who gets up every day and goes to school even though he can't drink the water. See, my opponent has America all wrong. There's nothing we can't do when we come together as one nation, set big goals, and pursue them.\nAnd the American dream – the American dream is big enough for everyone to share in its promise. So if you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage, that no one who works full-time should have to raise their child in poverty, join us. If you believe that every man, woman, and child in America has the right to affordable health care and women should be free to make our own health decisions, join us. If you believe – if you believe your working mother, wife, sister, or daughter deserves equal pay, then join us. Get involved these last 55 days. Go to hillaryclinton.com or text 'join,' j-o-i-n, to 47246. We need volunteers right here in North Carolina. We can't do this without you.\nAnd remember, the presidential race isn't the only one this fall. We've got a lot of im-portant statewide races. Let's come together and send Deborah Ross to represent the people in the Senate. Starting on October 20th, you can register and vote early at the same time at any one-stop early voting site in your county. So the heat is on. Spread the word. Tell your friends, your family, your neighbors. If you share our vision for America's future, come be part of helping us shape it. We do not have a minute to lose.\nWe have so many blessings. Now it's our job to deliver on those and to make sure every single person, and particularly every child, no matter who they are, what they look like, or who they love, is part of the American dream now and way into the future. Let that be our message. Let that be our mission. Please come out and help us fight, fight for you, fight for our children, fight for our families. Let's make America all that it should be. Thank you and God bless you!\"", "timestamp": "2016-09-15", "title": "Remarks at the University of North Carolina in Greensboro"}
{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "note": "As prepared for delivery.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119209", "text": "Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you.\nToday, I'm going to outline a plan for American economic revival – it is a bold, ambitious, forward-looking plan to massively increase jobs, wages, incomes and opportunities for the people of our country.\nMy plan will embrace the truth that people flourish under a minimum government burden, and it will tap into the incredible unrealized potential of our workers and their dreams.\nRight now, 92 million Americans are on the sidelines, outside the workforce, and not part of our economy. It's a silent nation of jobless Americans.\nLook no further than the city of Flint, where I just visited. The jobs have stripped from this community, and its infrastructure has collapsed. In 1970, there were more than 80,000 people in Flint working for GM – today it is less than 8,000. Now Ford has announced it is moving all small car production to Mexico.\nIt used to be cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Now, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint.\nWe are going to turn this around.\nMy economic plan rejects the cynicism that says our labor force will keep declining, that our jobs will keep leaving, and that our economy can never grow as it did once before.\nWe reject the pessimism that says our standard of living can no longer rise, and that all that's left to do is divide up and redistribute our shrinking resources.\nEverything that is broken today can be fixed, and every failure can be turned into a great success.\nJobs can stop leaving our country, and start pouring in. Failing schools can become flourishing schools. Crumbling roads and bridges can become gleaming new infrastructure. Inner cities can experience a flood of new jobs and investment. And rising crime can give way to safe and prosperous communities.\nAll of these things, and so much more, are possible. But to accomplish them, we must replace the present policy of globalism – which has moved so many jobs and so much wealth out of our country – and replace it with a new policy of Americanism.\nUnder this American System, every policy decision we make must pass a simple test: does it create more jobs and better wages for Americans?\nIf we lower our taxes, remove destructive regulations, unleash the vast treasure of American energy, and negotiate trade deals that put America First, then there is no limit to the number of jobs we can create and the amount of prosperity we can unleash.\nAmerica will truly be the greatest place in the world to invest, hire, grow and to create new jobs, new technologies, and entire new industries.\nInstead of driving jobs and wealth away, America will become the world's great magnet for innovation and job creation.\nMy opponent's plan rejects this optimism. She offers only more taxing, regulating, more spending and more wealth redistribution – a future of slow growth, declining incomes, and dwindling prosperity.\nThe only people who get rich under Hillary Clinton's scheme are the donors and the special interests.\nIn Hillary Clinton's America, we have surrendered our status as the world's great economy, and we have surrendered our middle class to the whims of foreign countries.\nNot one single idea she has will create one net American job, or create one new dollar of American wealth for our workers. The only thing she can ever offer is a welfare check. Our plan will produce paychecks, and they're going to be great paychecks for millions of people now unemployed.\nIn the course of this campaign, I have travelled all across this country and I've met the most amazing people. Every day, I've seen the goodness and character of our country, and brave citizens proudly fighting through hard times and difficult circumstances.\nIn many parts of our country, the hard times never seem to end. I've visited cities and towns in upstate New York where half the jobs have left and moved to other countries.\nPoliticians have abandoned these places all over our country and the people who live there.\nWorse still, politicians have heaped scorn and disdain on these wonderful Americans. My opponent described tens of millions of American citizens as deplorable and irredeemable – how can Hillary Clinton seek to lead this country when she considers its citizens beyond redemption?\nThe hardworking people she calls deplorable are the most admirable people I know: they are cops and soldiers, teachers and firefighters, young and old, moms and dads, blacks, whites and Latinos – but above everything else, they are all American. They love their families, they love their country, and they want a better future.\nThese are the forgotten men and women of America. People who work hard but don't have a voice.\nI am running to be their voice, and to fight to bring prosperity to every part of this country.\nToo many of our leaders have forgotten that it's their duty to protect the jobs, wages and well-being of American workers before any other consideration.\nI'm not running to be President of the world. I'm running to be President of the United States – and as your President, I will fight for every last American job.\nWe are the nation that tamed the West, dug out the Panama Canal, won two World Wars, and put a man on the moon.\nIt's time to start thinking big once again.\nThat's why I believe it is time to establish a national goal of reaching 4% economic growth.\nIn working with my economic team, we've put together a plan that puts us on track to achieve that goal. Over the next ten years, our economic team estimates that under our plan the economy will average 3.5% growth and create a total of 25 million new jobs. You can visit our website to see the math.\nThis growth means that our jobs plan, including our childcare reforms, will be completely paid-for in combination with proposed budget savings.\nIt will be deficit neutral. If we reach 4% growth, it will reduce the deficit.\nIt will be accomplished through a complete overhaul of our tax, regulatory, energy and trade policies.\nRight now, under Obama-Clinton policies, the economy grew only 1.1 percent last quarter – that translates to millions of lost jobs.\nThis is the weakest so-called recovery since the Great Depression.\nOver the last 7 years, the economy grew only 2.1 percent, the slowest period in seventy years. Had the economy grown under Obama at the same rate as Reagan, it would have meant 10 million more jobs.\nPerhaps most shockingly, 1 in 6 men aged 18-34 are either in jail or out of work.\nMeanwhile, another 2 million Hispanic-Americans have been added to the ranks of those in poverty.\nOn top of it all, the Obama-Clinton policies have doubled the national debt. It took more than 230 years for the United States to accumulate it's first $10 trillion dollars in debt – it took President Obama only eight years to add another $10 trillion.\nNow, it would be one thing if that money had been used to completely rebuild our nation, our military, and our infrastructure.\nInstead, the opposite happened. We doubled our debt and, in return, we have dilapidated infrastructure, failing schools, a badly depleted military, and another 14 million people who have left the workforce.\nNever has so much money been spent so poorly.\nBut we're going to turn that all around. Here's how.\nIt begins with bold new tax reform.\nAs outlined in Detroit, our tax plan will greatly simplify the code and reduce the number of brackets from 7 to 3. The 3 new brackets will be 12, 25 and 33, but low-income Americans will pay no income tax at all – in fact, our plan will remove millions and millions of workers from the income tax rolls entirely.\nBy lowering rates, streamlining deductions, and simplifying the process, we will add millions of new jobs.\nIn addition, because we have strongly capped deductions for the wealthy and closed special interest loopholes, the tax relief will be concentrated on the working and middle class taxpayer. They will receive the biggest benefit – it won't even be close.\nThis is a working and middle class tax relief proposal.\nThe tax relief for these workers will be expanded by my childcare proposals that I have worked on with my daughter, Ivanka.\nThese proposals are a central element of our comprehensive tax reform and economic growth plan.\nFamilies will be able to fully deduct the average cost of childcare from their taxes, including stay-at-home parents. Because this deduction is capped, it will disproportionately benefit working and middle class families. The less you make, the larger a share of your income you can exclude from taxation.\nParents will also be able to enroll in tax-free dependent care savings accounts for their children or elderly relatives. Low-income households will benefit from both an Expanded Earned Income Tax Credit – in the form a Childcare rebate – and a matching $500 contribution for their savings accounts.\nA married couple earning $50,000 per year with two children and $8,000 in child care expenses will save 35% from their current tax bill.\nA married couple earning $75,000 per year with two children and $10,000 in child care expenses will receive a 30% reduction in their tax bill.\nBy contrast, someone earning $5 million will receive virtually no change in their tax bill at all.\nOne of our greatest job creation measures is going to be our 15% business tax rate – down from the current 35% rate, a reduction of more than 40 percent. An explosion of new business and new jobs will be created. It will be amazing to watch.\nWe will also allow U.S.-based manufacturers to fully expense the cost of new plants and equipment.\nOn top of that, we will bring back trillions in business wealth parked overseas and tax it at a 10% rate. Some people say there are $2 trillion dollars overseas, I think it's $5 trillion. By taxing it at 10% instead of 35%, all of this money will come back into our country.\nWe will turn America into a magnet for new jobs – and that means jobs in our poorest communities.\nNext, comes regulations.\nOne of the keys to unlocking growth is scaling-back years of disastrous regulations unilaterally imposed by our out-of-control bureaucracy.\nRegulations have grown into a massive, job-killing industry – and the regulation industry is one business I will put an end to.\nIn 2015 alone, federal agencies issued over 3,300 final rules and regulations, up from 2,400 the prior year. Every year, overregulation costs our economy $2 trillion dollars a year and reduces household wealth by almost $15,000 dollars.\nI've proposed a moratorium on new federal regulations that are not compelled by Congress or public safety, and I will eliminate all needless and job-killing regulations now on the books.\nThis includes eliminating some of our most intrusive regulations, like the Waters of The U.S. Rule. It also means scrapping the EPA's so-called Clean Power Plan which the government itself estimates will cost $7.2 billion a year. This Obama-Clinton directive will shut down most, if not all, coal-powered electricity plans in America. Remember what Hillary Clinton said? She wants to shut down the miners, just like she wants to shut down the steel mills.\nWe're going to put our great miners and steel workers back to work.\nEnergy reform is central to our plan as well\nAccording to the Heritage Foundation, by 2030, President Obama's energy restrictions will eliminate another half a million manufacturing jobs, reduce economic output by $2.5 trillion dollars, and reduce incomes by $7,000 dollars per person.\nHillary Clinton wants to go even further, and her plan could cost the economy $5 trillion dollars.\nA Trump Administration will lift restrictions on all sources of American energy production. According to the Institute for American Energy Resources this will:\nincrease GDP by more than $100 billion annually\nadd over 500,000 new jobs annually\nincrease annual wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 years\nincrease federal, state, and local tax revenues by almost $6 trillion over 4 decades\nincrease total economic activity by more than $20 trillion over the next 40 years.\nIn addition, we will streamline the permitting process for all energy infrastructure projects, including the billions of dollars in projects held up by President Obama – creating countless more jobs in the process.\nFinally, comes trade – the foundation for everything\nAmerica's annual trade deficit with the world is now nearly $800 a billion a year – an enormous drag on growth.\nBetween World War II and the year 2000, the United States averaged a 3.5% growth rate. But, after China joined the World Trade Organization, our average growth rate has been reduced to only 2 percent.\nPredatory trade practices, product dumping, currency manipulation and intellectual property theft have taken millions of jobs and trillions in wealth from our country.\nIt is no great secret that many of the special interests funding my opponent's campaign are the same people profiting from these terrible trade deals. The same so-called experts advising Hillary Clinton are the same people who gave us NAFTA, China's entry into the World Trade Organization, the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, and now the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\nThe verdict is in. All of the special interests that the media race to for comment have been proven wrong about every single deal they've promoted – every lie and every prediction has crashed upon the rocks of reality.\nOur manufacturing base has crumbled, communities have been hollowed out, wages have declined, and households are making less today than they were in the year 2000.\nI have proposed a detailed plan to reform our trade policies and bring vast new jobs and wealth to America. This includes the following steps:\nI'm going to direct the Secretary of Commerce to identify every violation of trade agreements a foreign country is currently using to harm our workers. I will use every tool under American and international law to end these abuses, and I will use our greatest business leaders and finest negotiators – and I know who you are, many of you are in the room.\nWe are going to start with NAFTA, which is causing so much damage to our country. We will entirely renegotiate NAFTA into a deal that will either be good for us or will be terminated until a brand new and productive deal can be signed.\nWe are also going to keep America out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\nNext, I am going to instruct my Treasury Secretary to label China a currency manipulator, and to apply tariffs to any country that devalues its currency to gain an unfair advantage over the United States.\nI am going to instruct the U.S. Trade Representative to bring trade cases against China. China's unfair subsidy behavior is prohibited by the terms of its entrance to the WTO, and I intend to enforce those rules.\nIf China does not stop its illegal activities, including its theft of American trade secrets and intellectual property, I will apply countervailing duties until China ceases and desists.\nJust the single action of enforcing intellectual property rules alone would add millions of new American jobs. According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, improved protection of America's intellectual property in China would add 2 million jobs a year to the United States every single year.\nWe are going to stop the outflow of jobs from our country, and open a new highway of jobs back into our country.\nHere is how the plan adds up\nWe are proposing a $4.4 trillion tax cut that will score as $2.6 trillion under a dynamic growth model, which is how taxes should be scored. This includes the childcare plan.\nOur economic team has further modeled that the growth-induced savings from trade, energy and regulation reform will shave at least another $1.8 trillion off of the remaining cost.\nThat leaves around $800 billion dollars. This money can all be saved through simple, common sense reforms. If we save just one penny of each federal dollar spent on non-defense, and non-entitlement programs, we can save almost $1 trillion over the next decade – again this is spending that does not touch defense, and that does not touch entitlements.\nIf our plan exceeds the 3.5% ten-year growth average, then our jobs proposal will actually reduce the deficit. Savings will be compounded by the fact that people who are currently receiving unemployment or welfare will finally be able to find jobs.\nThis is the most pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-family plan put forth perhaps in the history of our country.\nThis is what our new future will look like\nI am going to lower you taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to unleash American energy; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; I'm going rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; I'm going to save your 2nd amendment; I'm going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country, and yes, we will build the wall [Mexico will pay]; and I'm going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, especially NAFTA – and we will only make great trade deals that put the American worker first.\nAnd we are going to put our miners and our steelworkers back to work.\nWe will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.\nAmerican cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.\nAmerican steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.\nAmerican hands will rebuild this nation – and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.\nWe will put new American metal into the spine of this country.\nJobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.\nWe Will Make America Wealthy Again.\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\nAnd Will Make America Great Again.\nThank you, and God Bless!", "timestamp": "2016-09-15", "title": "Remarks to the Economic Club of New York at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122571", "text": "\"Adopting the insights of behavioral science will help bring our government into the 21st century in a wide range of ways - from delivering services more efficiently and effectively; to accelerating the transition to a clean energy economy; to helping workers find better jobs, gain access to educational opportunity, and lead longer, healthier lives.\"\n— President Barack Obama, September 15, 2015\nOver the past seven and a half years, President Obama has empowered his Administration to tackle complex policy challenges using evidence-based approaches to improve the lives of Americans. As part of this approach, in 2014 the Administration recruited and created the first-ever Social and Behavioral Sciences Team (SBST)—a cross-agency group of applied behavioral scientists, program officials, and policy makers charged with translating cutting-edge research insights about how people make decisions and act on them into improvements in Federal policies and programs.\nBuilding on SBST's first year of results, one year ago President Obama issued an executive order directing Federal Government agencies to apply behavioral science insights to their programs to better serve the American people.\nThe past year showcases the impact of this approach. SBST's portfolio has included more than 40 different collaborations with agency partners and has tracked three major themes:\n•      Tackling some of the most important policy challenges facing the Nation, such as ensuring access to affordable health insurance for the millions of Americans who still lack coverage, expanding economic opportunity for workers and their families, and reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to help protect Earth's climate.\n•      Leveraging a broader set of strategies to enhance program effectiveness, from changing how programs communicate with individuals, to modifying the way programs are administered, to informing the design of policy.\n•      Drawing on the best available evidence and rigorously testing impact to inform recommendations about what to scale and what to improve. In this spirit, SBST reports the results of all of its completed projects, including projects that did not yield statistically significant improvements.\nTo mark this past year of progress, today the White House is hosting a Summit on Behavioral Science Insights and releasing the SBST Second Annual Report. Among other results, SBST pilots led to a 53 percent increase in workplace savings plan enrollment rates by military service members and resulted in more than 4,800 new enrollments and over $1 million dollars in additional savings in just one month; a 63 percent increase in the rate at which small family farmers obtained small-business loans; and a doubling in the rate at which student loan borrowers in default contacted default-resolution representatives. In addition, the Administration is releasing new guidance to agencies to support continued implementation of the behavioral science insights Executive Order. This guidance will help agencies identify promising opportunities to apply behavioral science insights to their policies and programs.\nAdditional Details on the Social and Behavioral Sciences Team's Past Year of Work\nWhat follows is a snapshot of SBST's projects and results from the past year, which demonstrates the power of using behavioral science insights to improve program outcomes. A more comprehensive and detailed set of descriptions of SBST projects can be found in the Second Annual report.\nPromoting Retirement Security\n•      Increasing retirement security for military service members through automatic enrollment, active choices, and email prompts. Enrollment in the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), the Federal government's workplace savings plan, by military service members remains relatively low at approximately 43 percent, compared with over 87 percent for civilian Federal employees. To boost TSP participation, the Department of Defense (DOD) and SBST piloted having service members make an active \"Yes\" or \"No\" choice about whether to contribute to TSP upon their arrival at a new military base, which led to an 8.3 percentage-point increase in TSP enrollments. If scaled up to military bases across the country, this intervention could help promote retirement security for the service members and their families who undertake more than 640,000 transfers to new bases each year. DOD and SBST also sent emails about TSP designed using behavioral science insights to nearly 700,000 service members, which led to 4,831 new enrollments and over $1 million dollars in additional savings in the first month of the pilot. Finally, SBST has been advising DOD on a policy change that will automatically enroll all new service members into TSP starting in 2018.\n•      Encouraging myRA enrollment for workers who lack access to workplace savings plans through timely prompts at tax time. Roughly 68 million workers lack access to employer-sponsored retirement savings accounts. In response to this need, the Department of Treasury (Treasury) created myRA, a starter retirement savings account. To promote enrollment, Treasury and SBST inserted prompts about myRA into online tax preparation software near the point at which filers choose how to receive their income tax refund. Preliminary findings show that highlighting the potential tax benefits of  myRA was a more effective tool for encouraging tax filers to open a myRA account than highlighting other benefits.\n•      Assisting the public with making informed decisions about when to claim Social Security retirement benefits through improved information presentation. Social Security retirement benefits are the foundation of retirement security for tens of millions of Americans and represent 85 percent of total income on average for lower-income individuals over 65. Individual choices—including the age at which individuals claim Social Security benefits, whether and how much to work in retirement, and how to manage claiming decisions jointly with one's spouse—play an important role in how well these benefits protect against the risks of outliving one's savings. The Social Security Administration (SSA) and SBST are piloting opportunities to help the public make more informed decisions about claiming Social Security retirement benefits.\nAdvancing Economic Opportunity\n•      Ensuring low-income children obtain, and retain, access to free or reduced-price school meals through expanded automatic enrollment and improvements to the application process. Every year, eligible low-income students are at risk of missing out on free or reduced-price school meals offered under the National School Lunch Program (NSLP). To help ensure access to the program, the White House and the Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) have launched a new round of pilots that will allow states to use Medicaid data to automatically enroll students who qualify for either free or reduced-priced meals. To help eligible students retain access to school meals, FNS and SBST collaborated with over 70 school districts in the 2015–2016 school year to better communicate school-meal verification requirements to households—for example, by personalizing communications and encouraging households to take pictures of their documentation with their mobile phones for electronic submission. For the 2016–2017 school year, FNS and SBST are initiating a process change that will provide families with more time to complete their verification requirements.\n•      Expanding access to credit for small family farms through targeted outreach. Since farming often produces irregular income and requires large capital investments, the USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA) runs a program that offers small-dollar loans, known as microloans, to farmers in need. To promote microloan take-up, FSA, USDA's Economic Research Service, and SBST sent outreach letters to farmers detailing customized steps for applying for a microloan and personalized contact information for their local loan officers. Letters increased the percent of farmers who obtained a microloan by 63 percent.\nImproving College Access and Affordability\n•      Helping student-loan borrowers manage their debt by prompting the choice of more-affordable repayment plans and promoting annual recertification among those already in plans. The Department of Education (ED) and SBST sent student-loan borrowers information about income-driven repayment plans (IDR), which link monthly payments to income. A single email significantly increased IDR application rates, with more than 6,000 additional applications generated during the pilot period by borrowers with approximately 300 million dollars in outstanding debt. To help borrowers already enrolled in IDR plans avoid monthly payment increases, ED and SBST also sent a series of messages to nearly 300,000 borrowers reminding them to recertify their IDR plans. Indicating the exact amount by which borrowers' monthly payments would increase if they did not recertify led to an 8 percent increase in recertification rates, relative to messages that simply indicated average payment increases.\n•      Encouraging borrowers in default to rehabilitate their loans by highlighting the consequences of inaction and providing borrowers with call-in times. Each month, roughly 125,000 Federal student loan borrowers who have not made a payment in 360 days enter into default on their loans. If defaulted borrowers fail to take action, they face serious penalties including a collections fee, damage to their credit, wage garnishment, and forfeiture of Federal tax refunds. To avoid these penalties, ED offers borrowers the chance to enter into a loan-rehabilitation agreement. SBST and ED encouraged rehabilitation by sending messages to borrowers in default. Emphasizing the consequences of inaction generated 41 percent more calls to default resolution representatives than emails emphasizing the benefits of taking action. Moreover, scheduling borrowers to call in at a specific appointment time increased the call-in rate 61 percent compared to the email emphasizing consequences of inaction.\n•      Reducing the burden of student debt for individuals with disabilities through data matching and streamlined application processes. ED offers Federal student loan relief—the Total and Permanent Disability discharge—for borrowers with certain types of disabilities. ED and SSA shared administrative data to identify around 400,000 student-loan borrowers receiving Social Security Disability Insurance who potentially qualify for a discharge of their debt. ED and SBST notified these borrowers of their potential eligibility and informed them of a streamlined version of the application form.\nResponding to Climate Change\n•      Supporting consumer adoption of renewable energy sources through active choices and other decision-support tools. Adoption of green power plans remains low at roughly 700,000 customers nationwide. SBST has initiated a dialogue with the Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy to identify the potential behavioral barriers underlying low take-up of clean energy, as well as a suite of behavioral tools that can be used to address these barriers. For example, behavioral-science research indicates that prompting consumers to select a power plan from among clean and non-clean options (rather than defaulting them into a standard electricity plan) and presenting plan options in ways that facilitate informed decision-making can improve take up. SBST will work to identify voluntary state and private-sector partners to test and evaluate these approaches on a wide scale in the coming years.\n•      Testing different approaches for improving understanding of climate change and climate patterns among non-scientists. To help households, communities, and decision-makers better understand and adapt to the effects of rising global temperatures, SBST, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the University of Maryland have worked to help the United States Global Change Research Program improve their \"climate indicators,\" which convey important information about climate patterns to non-scientists. This pilot yielded mixed results. For example, simplifying a graph showing changes in the Annual Greenhouse Gas Index increased successful interpretation of the indicator by 18 percentage points, but did not significantly increase how well people were able to draw inferences from the indicator.\nSupporting Criminal Justice Reform\n•      Empowering the re-entry population to thrive in their communities by developing a handbook that articulates concrete steps for individuals to take before and after their release. To help the 40,000 inmates who are released from Federal prison each year successfully reintegrate into their communities, the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) designed a prisoner re-entry handbook. SBST contributed to the content and structure of this handbook using insights from behavioral science. For example, BOP and SBST developed three checklists featuring action steps inmates and former inmates can take before and after their release, as well as accompanying resources to support these actions. In many cases, the timing and proper sequencing of actions is important for preventing setbacks. For example, encouraging individuals to obtain a birth certificate prior to release can accelerate their getting a government-issued photo ID and applying for work. SBST also recommended that individuals be addressed as \"community members\" and provided ideas for how to destigmatize subjects such as mental health. The handbook has already been distributed to 20,000 individuals due to be released from prison.\n•      Strengthening community policing and trust between law enforcement officers and the communities they serve. The President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing published a comprehensive report in 2015 with concrete recommendations for law enforcement, local governments, community organizations, and other stakeholders. SBST is distilling the report's recommendations into specific actions community members, including parents, youth, and researchers, can take. Using these actions as a guide, SBST is developing an interactive \"Community Action Deck\" to facilitate community-level dialogue and advocacy. The deck will contain roughly 30 cards articulating concrete steps communities can take toward different goals—for example, creating a community advisory board to engage law enforcement proactively on issues about which the community cares. Each card will include an example of one community that has successfully implemented that action.\nAssisting Job Seekers\n•      Helping unemployed individuals return to work more quickly through changes to the way unemployment insurance benefits are administered. With job openings now above pre-recession levels, one priority is helping workers connect with those jobs more quickly. The Department of Labor (DOL), the State of Oregon, and SBST are developing a pilot that would modify how unemployment insurance benefits are paid, offering workers benefits over the course of their unemployment spell that are initially higher than the standard amount, but step down over time. This pilot would build on a current Oregon-SBST pilot that is helping job seekers create and follow through on personalized work search plans and on a Utah-SBST pilot that is waiving retrospective work-search reporting requirements in favor of submitting a prospective work-search plan. In addition, SBST and Utah have worked together to begin addressing unemployment insurance recipients as \"job seekers\" rather than as \"claimants.\"\n•      Facilitating the development of modern jobs and skills data platforms to effectively support labor market outcomes for workers. DOL, the University of Chicago, and SBST are collaborating to support the DataAtWork project, which pools skills and jobs data, employs advanced analytical techniques to generate an understanding of what kinds of skills are being supplied and demanded, and makes the results available to workers and the organizations that support them. SBST has been conducting research to help understand labor market needs of both employers and job seekers. This research will facilitate the development of tools that can better match people to training opportunities and job openings given their unique needs and skills.\nHelping Families Get Health Coverage and Stay Healthy\n•      Supporting health-insurance-plan choice through streamlined plan presentation and decision-support tools. Tens of millions of Americans now choose health-insurance coverage within Federal programs that offer a selection of private plans, including the Medicare Part D prescription drug program and the Health Insurance Marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and SBST are working to streamline plan presentation and facilitate choices within the Federal Health Insurance Marketplace; the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services and SBST are working to assist beneficiaries with the selection of their Medicare Part D prescription drug plan; and SBST and the Office of Personnel Management are updating the tools available to Federal employees for choosing health insurance plans in the Federal Employees Health Benefits program. In addition, SBST and HHS are designing direct outreach to the roughly 8 million families who paid a penalty for lack of coverage in 2014 to ensure that individuals who failed to enroll for health coverage in past years are aware of their options in future years.\n•      Helping to keep families safe from the health risks posed by lead in drinking water through evidence-based communications. As part of the Administration's response to the high levels of lead in Flint's public water supply, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and SBST designed outreach and educational materials to get clear, actionable information on reducing lead exposure and accessing free bottled water and filters into the hands of Flint residents quickly. Building on this work, SBST is exploring a broader collaboration with EPA to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of information about lead in water nationwide.\n•      Minimizing the risks of foodborne illness by redesigning a food handling safety label. Approximately 48 million cases of foodborne illness occur in the United States each year, resulting in roughly 128,000 hospitalizations and 3,000 deaths. To reduce foodborne hazards, the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has developed a Safe Handling Instructions label that is required on all raw meat or poultry products. SBST is partnering with FSIS to redesign the Safe Handling Instructions label using evidence from behavioral science about the most effective ways to communicate instructions and motivate subsequent action.\n•      Addressing child- and maternal-health issues world-wide through form redesign, text-message reminders, and personalized counseling. Since 2014, USAID and SBST have been collaborating to improve child and maternal health, which has included launching and evaluating a mobile-based vaccination platform in Mozambique that allows officials to keep track of vaccine supply and remind caregivers who have missed appointments to attend upcoming ones. In 2016, selected USAID Missions joined SBST Fellows and academic experts for the first ever USAID International Behavioral Design Workshop. Projects emerging from this workshop include: increasing the number of pregnant women who receive preventive treatment for malaria by redesigning referral forms with USAID/Nigeria; increasing HIV medication adherence among high-risk populations using text-message notices and transportation subsidies with USAID/Ethiopia; and offering personalized and simplified counseling on healthy pregnancies with USAID/Nigeria and its partners.\nImproving Government Effectiveness and Efficiency\n•      Promoting compliant participation in refundable tax credits through timely, simplified notices. Together with the Department of Treasury's Office of Tax Policy, tax-software developers, and academic researchers, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is using data-driven methods to guide its administration of refundable credits. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) sent over $66 billion in income assistance to more than 27 million working families in 2015, but millions of individuals, many who do not have children, fail to claim the credit each year, either by filing a return and failing to claim the credit, or by not filing at all. One project tested the impact of mailing notices with information about tax filing and EITC participation to potentially eligible individuals who did not file a tax return in recent years. The notices resulted in a modest, but statistically significant, higher rate of tax filing, which in turn increased EITC claims. Conditional on filing, there was no significant difference in the fraction of individuals claiming the EITC, which suggests that the primary barrier to increasing EITC claims for this population is getting individuals to file a return.\n•      Strengthening Federal managerial performance through a new professional-development tool. Improving employee morale and engagement is a priority across Government. The Performance Improvement Council, DOL, DOE, and SBST developed and evaluated a new professional-development tool for Federal managers. The tool consists of an eight-module course to help managers develop eight specific traits that research shows are present in successful managers. SBST also designed a \"growth mindset\" intervention, which emphasized that managerial abilities are not fixed, but can be learned and strengthened over time. Research demonstrates that managers with a growth mindset are more engaged and support a culture that leads to increased worker productivity. The program concluded in early September 2016 and results will be made available soon.", "timestamp": "2016-09-15", "title": "Fact Sheet: New Progress on Using Behavioral Science Insights to Better Serve the American People"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122572", "text": "Today, President Obama will designate the first marine national monument in the Atlantic Ocean, protecting fragile deep-sea ecosystems off the coast of New England as the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument. The new national monument – which encompasses pristine underwater mountains and canyons – will provide critical protections for important ecological resources and marine species, including deep-sea coral and endangered whales and sea turtles.\nPresident Obama will make this announcement in remarks today at the 3rd annual Our Ocean Conference in Washington D.C. Hosted by Secretary of State John Kerry, the conference brings together leaders from around the world to mobilize for the health and resilience of our shared ocean.\nToday's action follows President Obama's decision last month to expand the Papah?naumoku?kea Marine National Monument off the coast of Hawaii by 442,781 square miles, creating the world's largest marine protected area. These actions reflect President Obama's commitment to the goals of combatting climate change and protecting our ocean, in a way that respects local communities, economies and native practices.\nBy permanently protecting these resources and reducing other threats to their respective ecosystems, these actions will also improve ocean resilience in the face of climate change, and help to sustain the ocean ecosystems and fishing economies in these regions for the long run. These priorities are also reflected in the President's budget where the Administration continues to call on Congress to grow our investment in ocean research and support dedicated programs that build coastal community and marine ecosystem resilience in the face of climate change.\nBeyond the important impact of these actions for all Americans, U.S. leadership is yielding dividends globally. Thanks in part to the strong example set by President Obama and the United States, more than twenty countries attending this week's Our Ocean Conference will announce the creation of 40 significant new marine protected areas, totaling nearly 460,000 square miles of ocean. When combined with the Papah?naumoku?kea expansion, the nations of the world have protected more than 900,000 square miles of ocean in 2016, exceeding last year's record of more than 730,000 square miles.\nNortheast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument\nToday's designation will protect 4,913 square miles of marine ecosystems with unique geological features that have been the subject of scientific exploration and discovery since the 1970s. These features include three underwater canyons deeper than the Grand Canyon, and four underwater mountains known as \"seamounts\" that are biodiversity hotspots and home to many rare and endangered species. Scientific expeditions to this region have yielded new discoveries including species of coral found nowhere else on Earth and other rare fish and invertebrates. Additionally, the canyons and seamounts provide habitat for protected species such as sea turtles and marine mammals, including endangered sperm, fin, and sei whales and Kemp's ridley turtles. The newly protected marine area in the Northeast will be jointly managed by the Department of Commerce and the Department of the Interior.\nAccording to a study released earlier this year by the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), ocean temperatures in the Northeast are projected to warm close to three times faster than the global average. Additionally, the first of several assessments to analyze the impacts of climate change on fish stocks and fishing-dependent communities, found that warming oceans are threatening the majority of fish species in the region including salmon, lobster, and scallops. In September 2015, 145 prominent marine scientists wrote a public letter voicing their conclusion that the threats to the unique marine environment in this region warranted permanent protection to preserve intact ecosystems. Today's designation will help build the resilience of that unique ecosystem, provide a refuge for at-risk species, and create natural laboratories for scientists to monitor and explore the impacts of climate change.\nToday's action also responds to nearly half a century of calls to protect this fragile area and builds on extensive engagement with numerous local officials, businesses, conservation organizations, commercial and recreational fishermen, and members of the public. In September of 2015, NOAA hosted a public meeting in Providence, Rhode Island to discuss permanent protection of this area. Since that time, senior Administration officials have visited the region repeatedly to engage with elected officials and stakeholders, including meeting locally with members of the commercial fishing industry, to gather data and information and to understand the potential impacts of permanently protecting marine areas.\nAs a result of this extensive engagement, today's designation is designed to reflect the unique marine environment in the northeast Atlantic and recognize the unique role that fishing plays in the region's economy and culture. Specifically:\n•      The geographic boundaries of the monument have been narrowly tailored based on the best available science and stakeholder input.\n•      Recreational fishing will be allowed within the boundaries of the monument.\n•      Red crab and lobster fisheries will be provided with seven years before being required to exit the monument area, to allow these fixed-gear fisheries to transition their operations.\n•      Other commercial fishing operators will not have to change their practices immediately and will have 60-days to transition from the monument area.\nIn addition, the Administration is committed to continue addressing economic impacts on northeast fisheries, building on our ongoing efforts to help New England fisherman that have faced hardships due to changing stock abundance. Specifically, NOAA is committed to working with Congress to fully utilize existing programs, including those that support:\n•      low-interest loans for vessel rehabilitation, acquisition of new vessels, aquaculture, shoreside fisheries facilities, and gear repair or upgrades;\n•      surveys in partnership with industry;\n•      innovation in stock assessment science; and\n•      programs and actions aimed at reducing costs, reducing discard mortality, and increasing flexibility and efficiencies.\nNOAA will also be engaging with stakeholders in the region to discuss grant programs that may be relevant including Bycatch Reduction and Engineering Program, the Fisheries Innovation Fund, Electronic Monitoring and Reporting Grants, and the Saltonstall-Kennedy Grant Program. And the Administration will be engaging with other stakeholders to discuss efforts to help support a strong and resilient sustainable fishery in the northeast region.\nIn addition to supporting businesses as they adjust to a changing climate, the Administration will explore opportunities to advance and implement changes in ocean and fisheries management to address these same forces. For example, NOAA recognizes the potential impact of climate shifts on species ranges and abundance and is working to assess those impacts on fishery management plans. Specifically, NOAA will be releasing the northeast region's Climate Science Regional Action Plan in the next month. This report will focus on fisheries in the mid-Atlantic and New England, and will prioritize the science needed to evaluate the expansion northward of fish species. These studies will provide the data that the regional fishery management councils and Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission need to better manage the catch of changing stocks in the region and along the coast.\nPresident Obama's Record on Marine Conservation\nSince taking office, President Obama has sought to lead the world in marine conservation by taking bold action to protect our ocean and marine ecosystems. In addition to protecting more land and water than any administration in history – including creating the world's  largest marine protected area last month – President Obama has taken many steps to combat illegal fishing, revitalize the process for establishing new marine sanctuaries and promote ocean stewardship through the use of science- based decision making.\nUnder President Obama, this administration has:\n•      Prioritized maintaining healthy ocean ecosystems and building ocean resilience as part of our global climate strategy.  More\n•      Established the first-ever National Ocean Policy to improve the health of our ocean, support our economy and better understand how our activities impact the ocean.  More\n•      Formed the National Ocean Council's Governance Coordinating committee to include state, tribal, and local leaders in a unified ocean strategy.

In his remarks, he referred to Proclamation 9496, signed September 15, which established the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118972", "text": "Thank you, everybody. Have a seat. Well, thanks, John, for the introduction and the vision to create this conference.\nI am obviously grateful to John Kerry for a whole host of reasons. But one thing that we all owe to John is his conviction that a healthier ocean and a healthier planet are about more than just our environment, they are also vital to our foreign policy and to our national security. And so he has elevated the profile of climate change, ocean protection to the point where we have conversations about this not just in the Oval Office, but in the Situation Room. And that is critical in helping us mobilize all of Government around the issues that all of you care so deeply about.\nAnd it is no wonder that John feels this way. Our Secretary of State is the descendant of sea merchants and sailors. He's a Navy veteran himself. So, in a lot of ways, the ocean is in his blood. Many years ago, John's father passed to his son a sailor's love of the sea, its wonder and its beauty and its power. But John's dad also loved what he called \"the sailor's environment\": reading the weather and the waves and the different ways that one adapts to the ocean.\nOf course, the problem that confronts all of us today is that we're asking far too much of our ocean in asking it to adapt to us.\nAnd John's right that this is also personal for me. I grew up in Hawaii. The ocean's really nice there. [Laughter] And anybody who grows up on an island—certainly, those of us who grew up in Hawaii—learn to appreciate very early on its magic, how it inspires awe, and sometimes, if the waves are a little too big and you've gone a little too far out, how it inspires fear—[laughter]—and a healthy respect.\nAnd the notion that the ocean I grew up with is not something that I can pass on to my kids and my grandkids is unacceptable. It's unimaginable. And so the investment that all of us together make here today is vital for our economy, it is vital for our foreign policy, it's vital for our national security, but it's also vital for our spirit. It's vital to who we are.\nDangerous changes in our climate, caused mainly by human activity; dead zones in our ocean, caused mainly by pollution that we create here on land; unsustainable fishing practices; unprotected marine areas, in which rare species and entire ecosystems are at risk— all those things are happening now. They've been happening for a long time. So if we're going to leave our children with oceans like the ones that were left to us, then we're going to have to act. And we're going to have to act boldly.\nAnd that's why the pledges and the partnerships from all of you at Our Oceans Conference are so vital. The more than $4 billion that governments and philanthropies committed towards conservation at the first two gatherings, here in Washington and in Chile; the more than 2 million square miles of ocean we came together to protect over these last 2 years, and what you'll add to those totals this week through more than 100 new initiatives and contributions—all of that's going to make a difference. It's probably not enough, but it's a pretty good down payment. And more importantly, it's signaling the fact that just as we did with the Paris Agreement, increasingly, we are able to construct an international architecture that addresses some of these most vital environmental challenges in a serious way. One of the reasons I ran for President was to make sure that America does our part to protect our planet for future generations. And I am very proud that America has become a global leader in the fight against climate change, from tripling the electricity we get from wind, multiplying solar electric power more than thirtyfold, to the Clean Power Plan that will limit the pollution we spew into our skies, to our role in rallying nearly 200 nations around the Paris Agreement and our work that continues to bring it into force this year.\nWe cannot truly protect our planet without protecting our ocean. I have not gone to as many countries as John has. Few humans have. [Laughter] And I've got to say, by the way, he never looks tired—[laughter]—which is impressive. But whenever I go abroad, including to many of the countries that are represented by heads of state and Foreign Ministers and other high-ranking officials here, I set aside time to talk to young people. And they rarely ask about poll numbers and political gaffes and whatever is flashing across the little trailer at the bottom of the newscast. They give you a sense of what's really important: what haunts them and what inspires them.\nAnd on my very first overseas trip as President, I held a town hall in France, where a young woman asked me about sustainability. Then, a few days later in Turkey, the first question I got was about climate change. The same thing happened last year in Malaysia. Just last week, in Laos, another young person asked me what I'm doing to protect our lands and waters.\nSo the generation behind us, they understand what's at stake.\nIt's been said that we don't inherit the Earth from our parents so much as we borrow it from our children. They know that. Our children prove every day that they care deeply about this planet. Their right to inherit a healthy planet is a sacred responsibility for all of us. And how we treat our oceans is a big part of that burden.\nNow, at an Oceans Conference, with a bunch of experts, I assume I don't have to tell you that oceans are pretty important. [Laughter] The—you guys know this. But for those of you who are listening outside the hall, it is the dominant feature of our planet. It's why we share a blue marble, as opposed to a brown or gray one. Our oceans feed us, protect us, regulate our climate, our weather, anchors industries from transportation to tourism to trade of all kind. The health of our planet's oceans determine in large part the health of our own bodies and the health of our economies. And while it is our oceans' contours that shape our coastlines, it is what we decide and do here that will shape our oceans' future.\nAnd that's why my administration has protected more waters than any in history. We established the first-ever national oceans policy, which brings together government leaders with fishermen and boaters and researchers and everyday citizens and ensures the decisions we make and resources we use are grounded in science. We cracked down on illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing. We've created and expanded marine sanctuaries. And, as John mentioned, just last month we created the largest marine protected area on Earth. It is now twice the size of Texas, home to more than 7,000 species, including some that are endangered and threatened.\nOur conservation efforts and our obligations to combat climate change, in fact, go hand in hand because marine areas already have enough to worry about, with overfishing and ship traffic and pollution, like those patches of plastic waste floating in the Pacific and the invisible pollutants like carbon that we cannot see. The more of those threats that we eliminate through conservation, the more resilient those ecosystems will be to the consequences of climate change.\nSo today we're building on this approach by establishing the first marine national monument in the Atlantic. We're protecting fragile ecosystems off the coast of New England, including pristine underseas canyons and seamounts. We're helping make the oceans more resilient to climate change. And this will help fishermen better understand the changes that are taking place that will affect their livelihood, and we're doing it in a way that respects the fishing industry's unique role in New England's economy and history.\nSo I'm proud of what America's done, that we are doing our share. But it's no secret that we're all going to have to do a lot more, and we're going to have to do it fast. And that's why it's so critical that the tradition of this conference continues after John and I leave this office. That the EU so quickly raised its hand to host next year's Our Ocean Conference is a testament to the fact that these challenges demand collective action and deserve the world's attention. It's a recognition of the reality that the ocean's health is our health, and we've got our work cut out for us.\nThe ocean acts like a sponge, absorbing most of the extra heat caused by our greenhouse gases. And it's been growing warmer and more acidic for decades now. In other words, the very chemistry of our oceans is changing, which is risking marine life and rippling all the way up the food chain. As oceans warm and sea levels rise, our lives and livelihoods are likely to change too: homes becoming uninhabitable, floods devastating communities, crops withering, industries like fishing disrupted. Cultures that have coexisted with the ocean for millennia are forced to flee to higher ground.\nThis is not a far-off problem; it's happening as we speak. It's happening here in America. By the end of this century, nearly one in five homes in John's hometown of Boston could be at risk; the same for a quarter of the homes of my childhood home of Hawaii.\nI spent my childhood on those shores, looking out over the endless ocean, and was humbled by it. And I know that, in a contest between us and the oceans, eventually, the oceans will win one way or the other. So it's us that has to adapt, not the other way around.\nOur oceans' very vastness, however, presents another threat: We don't touch the depths of the ocean in the course of our day. We don't see it—we don't see the effects of climate change every single day with our own eyes. We just see this great, big ocean; we assume that it's too big to be wrecked. It's easy, as a consequence, to dismiss the urgency of the challenge. But part of what I hope this conference is about is recognizing that we cannot shy away from problems because they're too big. We cannot pretend that the problems don't exist because we're going to have to make some changes in our own ways of doing business in order to confront them. Instead, we have to come together, and we've got to find solutions. And we can.\nOne of the most—well, let me close with two stories, I'm going a little off script. One of the most encouraging things that I heard this year, a year full of tough news in various places around the world, is the news that many of you heard that the hole in the ozone was actually shrinking. Now, for those of us of a certain age, you'll remember, that was quite worrisome. We weren't really sure what the ozone layer did, but the idea that there was a big hole in it was a problem. [Laughter] And I remember as we slowly began to phase out aerosol deodorant cans, which were kind of noxious anyway, because when you sprayed them, you couldn't breathe, so you knew they weren't really that good for you—[laughter]—it felt like a nice thing to do. But I don't know about you. I was not convinced that this was actually going to solve the problem and that whatever it is that was going to happen to these ozone layers up there, that it was just going to keep on getting worse.\nAnd lo and behold, just this year, we get reports back that actually that hole that we had blew in the ozone layer began to shrink. And by the way, we figured out other ways to produce deodorant. [Laughter] I say that because it gives you a sense of human ingenuity. When we make up our minds to do something, we can do it.\nThe same was true with acid rain in much of North America. People were skeptical, thought it was going to be too expensive to try to figure this out. We figured it out. Nobody talks about it anymore. My kids don't know what acid rain is. That has to be a cause for optimism.\nThese are problems we can solve. And part of the power of conferences like this is to insist on human agency, to not give in to hopelessness, or to suggest that somehow this—these problems are just too big. We can solve them. We just have to have the will to pursue collective action.\nAnd the second thing I'll just end with is the trip we took to Midway, which is right in the center of this new marine preserve. And as many of you know, this is a historic monument not only for conservation reasons, but because this was a major turning point for the war during World War II. At its peak, it—there were about 5,000, 6,000 troops on this island. Now there are exactly 45 people and 3 million birds, I think it is. [Laughter] The population—the bird population had shrunk drastically, and then we figured out that if you eliminated some of the people and the rats that the people had brought to the island, the birds would actually do pretty good. And they are thriving.\nAnd so we drove around and went to a beach in which there were six or seven turtles on—lying in the sun. And we have sea turtles down in Hawaii. In fact, they nest up around Midway and then come down to Oahu and the beaches where I used to bodysurf. But we'd never see them on the beach. But up in Midway, they didn't have people chasing them away, and so they felt pretty comfortable. It turns out, they like sun when we're not overcrowding the beaches.\nAnd then we went out snorkeling. And the coral was purple and it was orange, and there were monk seals sunning themselves on some rocks. And one of them dove in, which made one of the people on my team, who I shall not name, pretty nervous. [Laughter] And we spent the afternoon looking at this incredible variety of fish. And we had to leave before 5:30 because that's when the birds start coming back, and then you're plain stuck, because you can't fight the birds.\nAnd that, too, was a great cause for optimism because it reminded us that nature is actually resilient if we take care to just stop actively destroying it; that it will come back. And certainly the oceans can come back if we take the steps that are necessary. I saw it. It was right there, evidence of the incredible power of nature to rebuild itself if we're not consistently trying to tear it down.\nSo I wanted to leave you with those two images just to remind us that what you are doing here is important and that we can be successful. It is going to require work. It is going to require vision. It will require occasional sacrifice. But as long as we make sure that the sacrifices are not borne just by a few people, but are spread broadly and fairly and justly, then my hope is, is that my children and your children and our grandchildren, they'll be able to take that trip to Midway at some point, and they'll be able to watch seals swimming through water. And they'll thank us for it. And we will have done what is probably the most important thing that you can do on this planet Earth, and that is, make sure that you're making it just a little bit better for future generations.\nThank you very much, everybody.", "timestamp": "2016-09-15", "title": "Remarks at the Our Ocean Conference at the Department of State"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "This proclamation and its attached annex were published in the  Federal Register  on September 21.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118968", "text": "By the President of the United States of America\nA Proclamation\nFor generations, communities and families have relied on the waters of the northwest Atlantic Ocean and have told of their wonders. Throughout New England, the maritime trades, and especially fishing, have supported a vibrant way of life, with deep cultural roots and a strong connection to the health of the ocean and the bounty it provides. Over the past several decades, the Nation has made great strides in its stewardship of the ocean, but the ocean faces new threats from varied uses, climate change, and related impacts. Through exploration, we continue to make new discoveries and improve our understanding of ocean ecosystems. In these waters, the Atlantic Ocean meets the continental shelf in a region of great abundance and diversity as well as stark geological relief. The waters are home to many species of deep-sea corals, fish, whales and other marine mammals. Three submarine canyons and, beyond them, four undersea mountains lie in the waters approximately 130 miles southeast of Cape Cod. This area (the canyon and seamount area) includes unique ecological resources that have long been the subject of scientific interest.\nThe canyon and seamount area, which will constitute the monument as set forth in this proclamation, is composed of two units, which showcase two distinct geological features that support vulnerable ecological communities. The Canyons Unit includes three underwater canyons—Oceanographer, Gilbert, and Lydonia—and covers approximately 941 square miles. The Seamounts Unit includes four seamounts—Bear, Mytilus, Physalia, and Retriever—and encompasses 3,972 square miles. The canyon and seamount area includes the waters and submerged lands within the coordinates included in the accompanying map. The canyon and seamount area contains objects of historic and scientific interest that are situated upon lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government. These objects are the canyons and seamounts themselves, and the natural resources and ecosystems in and around them.\nThe canyons start at the edge of the geological continental shelf and drop from 200 meters to thousands of meters deep. The seamounts are farther off shore, at the start of the New England Seamount chain, rising thousands of meters from the ocean floor. These canyons and seamounts are home to at least 54 species of deep-sea corals, which live at depths of at least 3,900 meters below the sea surface. The corals, together with other structure-forming fauna such as sponges and anemones, create a foundation for vibrant deep-sea ecosystems, providing food, spawning habitat, and shelter for an array of fish and invertebrate species. These habitats are extremely sensitive to disturbance from extractive activities.\nBecause of the steep slopes of the canyons and seamounts, oceanographic currents that encounter them create localized eddies and result in upwelling. Currents lift nutrients, like nitrates and phosphates, critical to the growth of phytoplankton from the deep to sunlit surface waters. These nutrients fuel an eruption of phytoplankton and zooplankton that form the base of the food chain. Aggregations of plankton draw large schools of small fish and then larger animals that prey on these fish, such as whales, sharks, tunas, and seabirds. Together the geology, currents, and productivity create diverse and vibrant ecosystems.\nThe Canyons\nCanyons cut deep into the geological continental shelf and slope throughout the mid-Atlantic and New England regions. They are susceptible to active erosion and powerful ocean currents that transport sediments and organic carbon from the shelf through the canyons to the deep ocean floor. In Oceanographer, Gilbert, and Lydonia canyons, the hard canyon walls provide habitats for sponges, corals, and other invertebrates that filter food from the water to flourish, and for larger species including squid, octopus, skates, flounders, and crabs. Major oceanographic features, such as currents, temperature gradients, eddies, and fronts, occur on a large scale and influence the distribution patterns of such highly migratory oceanic species as tuna, billfish, and sharks. They provide feeding grounds for these and many other marine species.\nToothed whales, such as the endangered sperm whale, and many species of beaked whales are strongly attracted to the environments created by submarine canyons. Surveys of the area show significantly higher numbers of beaked whales present in canyon regions than in non-canyon shelf-edge regions. Endangered sperm whales, iconic in the region due to the historic importance of the species to New England's whaling communities, preferentially inhabit the U.S. Atlantic continental margin. Two additional species of endangered whales (fin whales and sei whales) have also been observed in the canyon and seamount area.\nThe Seamounts\nThe New England Seamount Chain was formed as the Earth's crust passed over a stationary hot spot that pushed magma up through the seafloor, and is now composed of more than 30 extinct undersea volcanoes, running like a curved spine from the southern side of Georges Bank to midway across the western Atlantic Ocean. Many of them have characteristic flat tops that were created by erosion by ocean waves and subsidence as the magma cooled. Four of these seamounts—Bear, Physalia, Retriever, and Mytilus—are in the United States Exclusive Economic Zone. Bear Seamount is approximately 100 million years old and the largest of the four; it rises approximately 2,500 meters from the seafloor to within 1,000 meters of the sea surface. Its summit is over 12 miles in diameter. The three smaller seamounts reach to within 2,000 meters of the surface. All four of these seamounts have steep and complex topography that interrupts existing currents, providing a constant supply of plankton and nutrients to the animals that inhabit their sides. They also cause upwelling of nutrient-rich waters toward the ocean surface.\nGeographically isolated from the continental platform, these seamounts support highly diverse ecological communities with deep-sea corals that are hundreds or thousands of years old and a wide array of other benthic marine organisms not found on the surrounding deep-sea floor. They provide shelter from predators, increased food, nurseries, and spawning areas. The New England seamounts have many rare and endemic species, several of which are new to science and are not known to live anywhere else on Earth.\nThe Ecosystem\nThe submarine canyons and seamounts create dynamic currents and eddies that enhance biological productivity and provide feeding grounds for seabirds; pelagic species, including whales, dolphins, and turtles; and highly migratory fish, such as tunas, billfish, and sharks. More than ten species of shark, including great white sharks, are known to utilize the feeding grounds of the canyon and seamount area. Additionally, surveys of leatherback and loggerhead turtles in the area have revealed increased numbers above and immediately adjacent to the canyons and Bear Seamount.\nMarine birds concentrate in upwelling areas near the canyons and seamounts. Several species of gulls, shearwaters, storm petrels, gannets, skuas, and terns, among others, are regularly observed in the region, sometimes in large aggregations. Recent analysis of geolocation data found that Maine's vulnerable Atlantic puffin frequents the canyon and seamount area between September and March, indicating a previously unknown wintering habitat for those birds.\nThese canyons and seamounts, and the ecosystem they compose, have long been of intense scientific interest. Scientists from government and academic oceanographic institutions have studied the canyons and seamounts using research vessels, submarines, and remotely operated underwater vehicles for important deep-sea expeditions that have yielded new information about living marine resources. Much remains to be discovered about these unique, isolated environments and their geological, ecological, and biological resources.\nWhereas, the waters and submerged lands in and around the deep-sea canyons Oceanographer, Lydonia, and Gilbert, and the seamounts Bear, Physalia, Retriever, and Mytilus, contain objects of scientific and historic interest that are situated upon lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government;\nWhereas, section 320301 of title 54, United States Code (the \"Antiquities Act\"), authorizes the President, in his discretion, to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be national monuments, and to reserve as a part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected;\nWhereas, it is in the public interest to preserve the marine environment, including the waters and submerged lands, in the area to be known as the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument, for the care and management of the objects of historic and scientific interest therein;\nWhereas, the well-being of the United States, the prosperity of its citizens and the protection of the ocean environment are complementary and reinforcing priorities; and the United States continues to act with due regard for the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea enjoyed by other nations under the law of the sea in managing the canyon and seamount area and does not compromise the readiness, training, and global mobility of the U.S. Armed Forces when establishing marine protected areas;\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by section 320301 of title 54, United States Code, hereby proclaim the objects identified above that are situated upon lands and interests in lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument (monument) and, for the purpose of protecting those objects, reserve as a part thereof all lands and interests in lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government within the boundaries described on the accompanying map entitled \"Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument,\" which is attached hereto, and forms a part of this proclamation. The Federal lands and interests in lands reserved consist of approximately 4,913 square miles, which is the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected.\nThe establishment of the monument is subject to valid existing rights. All Federal lands and interests in lands within the boundaries of the monument are hereby appropriated and withdrawn from all forms of entry, location, selection, sale, leasing, or other disposition under the public land laws to the extent that those laws apply, including but not limited to, withdrawal from location, entry and patent under mining laws, and from disposition under all laws relating to development of oil and gas, minerals, geothermal, or renewable energy. Lands and interest in lands within the monument not owned or controlled by the United States shall be reserved as part of the monument upon acquisition of title or control by the United States.\nManagement of the Marine National Monument\nThe Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior (Secretaries) shall share management responsibility for the monument. The Secretary of Commerce, through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, shall have responsibility for management of activities and species within the monument under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the Endangered Species Act (for species regulated by NOAA), the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and any other applicable Department of Commerce legal authorities.

Brewer of Arizona.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119016", "text": "Michelle and I were saddened to learn of the passing of former Arizona Governor Rose Mofford. Rose was once fired from a government position because her boss \"felt it was better to have a man in that particular job.\" But she was undeterred, eventually rising to become secretary of state and then Governor, the first woman in Arizona to hold that office. In all, her career in public service spanned more than a half-century.

On National POW/MIA Recognition Day, we pause to remember our servicemen and women who never returned home. The hardship experienced by prisoners of war and by the family members of those who have gone missing in action is unimaginable to most Americans; it is our country's solemn obligation to bring these heroes back to the land they served to defend, and to support the families who, each day, carry on without knowing the peace of being reunited with their loved ones.\nThe United States does not leave anyone behind, and we do not forget those who remain missing. We will never stop working to bring home those who gave everything for their country, nor cease in our pursuit of the fullest possible accounting for all who are missing. We are working to fulfill this promise by strengthening communication with the families of those service members missing or taken prisoner. And as Commander in Chief, I am committed to living up to this responsibility.\nThe men and women of our Armed Forces face unthinkable conditions and bear the painful cost of war. Theirs is a debt we can never fully repay, though we will continue striving to remain worthy of their sacrifice. In honor of those who have not yet come home, and the families who struggle with the fear of unknown fate, we renew our fierce commitment to our patriots in uniform and pledge to do everything we can to bring those missing or held prisoner home.\nOn September 16, 2016, the stark black and white banner symbolizing America's Missing in Action and Prisoners of War will be flown over the White House; the United States Capitol; the Departments of State, Defense, and Veterans Affairs; the Selective Service System Headquarters; the World War II Memorial; the Korean War Veterans Memorial; the Vietnam Veterans Memorial; United States post offices; national cemeteries; and other locations across our country. We raise this flag as a solemn reminder of our obligation to always remember the sacrifices made to defend our Nation.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 16, 2016, as National POW/MIA Recognition Day. I urge all Americans to observe this day of honor and remembrance with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-09-15", "title": "Proclamation 9495—National POW/MIA Recognition Day, 2016"}

It is always great to be here, with one of the most festive—maybe a little wild—caucuses in Congress, especially to kick off Hispanic Heritage Month.\nI want to thank Michelle for her introduction, for her leadership. And give it up for your outstanding chair, Congresswoman Linda Sánchez; CHCI's new president and CEO Domenika Lynch; and all the tremendous public servants that we have here tonight, especially everybody in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.\nAudience member. Amen.\nThe President. Amen? Is that what I heard? [Laughter] Amen. [Laughter]\nNow, I've got to admit that I'm having trouble accepting that this is my final trip here as President.\nAudience members. No!\nThe President. But on the bright side, Michelle is not having trouble accepting it. [Laughter]\nAudience member. We love you, Obama!\nThe President. I love you too!\nBut it is hard to believe that it was 8 years ago I came here as a candidate for this office. And I had no gray hair. [Laughter] I said that we could create opportunity not just for those at the very top, but for everybody who was willing to work hard, so that they could afford health care and college and retirement, and give their kids a better life, what Sarah Palin called \"that hopey-changey stuff.\" [Laughter]\nWell, tonight I'm back here as President to say thank you. Thank you for your support. Thank you for your friendship. Thank you for your tireless efforts to deliver on that promise. Because for all the places that we've fallen short, and for all the work that remains to be done, I am back here tonight more optimistic about the future of America than I have ever been.\nAnd why not? Together we fought our way back from the worst recession in 80 years. We turned around an economic free fall. We helped lift our auto industry to set new records. Our businesses created more than 15 million new jobs. Together, we declared health care is not a privilege for a few, but a right for everybody. And we have secured health insurance for another 20 million Americans, including 4 million Hispanic Americans.\nOur high school graduation rate is at an alltime high. More Hispanic students are graduating high school and college than ever before. We strengthened our relationship with Mexico and Central America and opened up a new chapter with the people of Cuba. We brought nearly 200 nations together around a climate agreement that could save our planet. We affirmed that love has no limits, and marriage equality is now the law of the land.\nJust this week, we discovered how much our efforts are starting to pay off in ways that really matter to American families. Audience member. Thanks, Obama!\nThe President. Thanks, Obama! [Laughter]\nWe learned that last year, across every race, across every age group in America, incomes rose, and poverty fell. The typical household income grew by about $2,800, which is the single biggest 1-year increase on record. We lifted 3.5 million people out of poverty, the largest 1-year drop since 1968. The number of Americans without health insurance continues to fall, and in each of these areas, Latino Americans made some of the largest gains: the fastest income growth, the biggest drop in the poverty rate, the greatest gains in insurance coverage. That's why, all in all, Hispanic families are feeling more optimistic about their prospects today than they did 8 years ago.\nBy so many measures, our country is stronger and more prosperous than it was when we started this journey together. And we couldn't have done it without the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, who has been with me every step of the way.\nNow, none of this was easy. There were some tough years in there. You had fiscal showdowns and Government shutdowns and pandemics and oil spills and pirates. You all remember the pirates? [Laughter] I mean, the only thing we haven't had to deal with is, like, the asteroid or the aliens. [Laughter]\nAudience member. Don't jinx us!\nThe President. That's true. Good point. [Laughter]\n[At this point, the President knocked on the wood podium.]\nThe President. Shouldn't have mentioned the aliens. [Laughter]\nBut we overcame all that. We overcame all that, and most of all, we proved that change doesn't happen overnight. It doesn't happen in one term. It doesn't happen even over the course of one Presidency, but change is possible. Progress is possible.\nAudience member. Si, se puede!\nThe President. Si, se puede. We're here again tonight because we know that we've got more work to do, but we know that if we put in the effort, change can happen.\nAudience member. That's right!\nThe President. You know firsthand the challenges we still face, challenges that often affect the Latino community harshly. When Governors refuse to expand Medicaid, that hits Latinos harder than most. When folks block an increase in the minimum wage or refuse to expand paid family leave, that hurts the pocketbooks of millions of Hispanic families. So we've got to make sure this recovery reaches all Americans. We've got to help more students not just get to college, but finish college. We've got to reform our criminal justice system, and we've got to protect our children from the madness of gun violence. And yes, we've got to finally make meaningful, effective immigration reform a reality in this country.\nNow, I'm proud of the executive actions I've taken to modernize our system. I'm proud of the work we've done to help show more than 740,000 DREAMers that the country they grew up in, the country they love, believes that they are worthy of this country's blessings, just like your kids, just like my kids. But if we're truly going to fix this broken system, then we're going to have to push back against bluster and falsehoods and promises of higher walls. We need a comprehensive solution that works for our families and our businesses, that grows our economy, that enhances our culture. We need an approach that upholds our tradition as a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws. And it is possible to do that.\nIt's possible to insist on a lawful and orderly system while still seeing students and their hard-working parents not as criminals, not as rapists, but as families who came here for the same reasons that all immigrants came here: to work and to learn and to build a better life.\nAnd look, throughout this political season, the talk around these issues has cut deeper than in years past. It's a little more personal. It's a little meaner, a little uglier. And folks are betting that if they can drive us far enough apart, and if they can put down enough of us because of where we come from or what we look like or what religion we practice, then that may pay off at the polls.\nBut I'm telling you that's a bet they're going to lose. We've seen this kind of ugliness and anger and vitriol before. That kind of politics sometimes may carry the day in the short term.\nI know that there are a lot of folks who had this notion of what the \"real America\" looks like, and somehow, it only includes a few of us. But who is going to decide who the real America is?\nAudience members. We are!\nThe President. Who is to determine that in this Nation of immigrants, in a nation where unless you are a Native American, you came here from somebody—someplace else, that you have a greater claim than anybody here?\nSo we can't let that brand of politics win. And if we band together and if we organize our communities, if we deliver enough votes, then the better angels of our nature will carry the day, and progress will happen. But it's going to take all of us. This is not something that a President can do alone. It's not something the next President will be able to do alone either, no matter how tough she is.\nSo we've got to work to get a Congress that's willing to act on immigration reform. That means we need more than just the people in this room tonight. We're going to need some fresh faces under the Capitol Dome. It's going to take work on all of our parts. And I have faith, because over these last 8 years, every time I've fallen short, every time I've faced doubts or been taught a tough lesson or experienced a loss, what got me through has been you. You've picked me up. CHC has picked me up.\nIt's knowing that I've got allies like Linda and Rubén and Charlie and Nydia fighting tooth and nail on the Hill and back in your home States, even on tough votes. It's knowing that you're fostering the next generation of leaders, including more than 40 of your former fellows that have helped lead the way in my administration. It's knowing you're giving folks like Diego Quiñones a chance. Where's Diego? Is Diego here? There he is back there.\nSo when Diego was 7 years old, Diego moved to Arkansas from Mexico with his parents. And his dad took a job repairing and building wooden pallets, which is a lot of hard work, calloused hands. A few years later, his dad opened up his own business. So Diego was waking up at 5 a.m. and loading and unloading pallets by hand, working every weekend through high school. And his family didn't have a lot of money, but they had belief, faith in America. Because as he says—and I'm quoting here—\"If you come here and work hard, eventually, you will succeed.\" And today, thanks to DACA, Diego's the first in his family to graduate from college. And now he's a fellow here at CHCI. And one day he hopes to go into government himself and make things better not just for Latino kids like him, but for every single person in the United States.\nIt's young people like that, that keep me going: folks who prove that immigrants aren't somehow changing the American character, immigrants are the American character. That's who we are. It's the DREAMers full of optimism. The moms and dads working long hours to give their kids a better shot. The entrepreneurs who came here to start new businesses and put Americans to work. And the teachers and the nurses and the lawyers who wake up at the crack of dawn to get ahead. And the folks who clean up after us. And the folks who care for our grandparents. The folks who are so proud of this country that they carry a pocket Constitution in their breast pocket.\nThat's the America I know. That's the America I believe in more strongly than ever. So thank you for picking me up every step of the way. Thank you for making this country great. We've got more work to do. But we will keep on making progress and create a brighter future for everybody in this country we love. Si, se puede. Thank you.\nThank you, CHCI. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2016-09-15", "title": "Remarks at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute Annual Awards Gala"}
{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118888", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n11:55 A.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good morning, everybody. It's nice to see you all. As advertised, and as you can see, I'm joined at the podium today by Mayor Kasim Reed from the great city of Atlanta, Georgia, and by Governor John Kasich of Ohio. Both of them have indicated their strong support and their strong belief that Congress should approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and they had an opportunity to discuss that with the President in the Oval Office for about an hour or so this morning. And I invited them to discuss it here this morning with all of you, as well.\nEach of them has prepared some brief opening remarks. We'll give them a chance to have their say briefly, and then we'll open it up to questions.\nSo, Mayor Reed, do you want to start, or Governor Kasich?\nMAYOR REED: Good morning. I want to begin by thanking President Obama for giving us the opportunity to join us in expressing our enthusiastic support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership today. I'm honored to be among the bipartisan gathering of leaders that included governors, CEOs, financial individuals from the financial sector, former Treasury Secretary.\nLast fall, I was honored that the city of Atlanta was selected to host the final round of negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership. In our judgment, it's the most progressive trade agreement in U.S. history. I'm also proud that more than 100 mayors have stayed shoulder-to-shoulder with the President in the effort to pass TPP.\nIn Atlanta, small businesses are the backbone of our local economy and the primary drivers of growth and innovation. Nationally, we all know that they represent more than 98 percent of businesses in our country. But only about 1 percent of those businesses -- small businesses are engaged in international trade. When we pass TPP, I'm confident that that number will increase.\nThe TPP, which was finalized in February 2016, will reduce barriers and focus on small business exports by cutting tariffs and reducing non-tariff barriers, opening the fast-growing Pacific Rim region of the world. The 12 countries in the TPP represent about 40 percent of global GDP and account for about one-third of global trade.\nMetro Atlanta right now is already the 13th largest exporter in the U.S. with more than 150,000 jobs in the metropolitan Atlanta region that is supported by the TPP. Georgia exported 37 percent of its goods, about $14.4 billion to TPP countries in 2011, and we expect that number to continue to climb. Nationally, 11.7 million jobs are supported by countries that make up the TPP market.\nAnd we came today because we intend to see that this bill is passed. And the President asked for our thinking on how it will get passed. One of the best quotes that I've heard around TPP came from a former U.S. ambassador, and he said something that I think resonates certainly with our group. What he said was, is that people who run for office often campaign against trade, but people who become President of the United States end up supporting trade.\nThere are a number of very important reasons for us not to let this matter fail, and the most important in my mind really is determining who's going to set the rules of the road. We have been working on this transaction for more than five years. The President and Ambassador Furman have done an exceptional job negotiating a very favorable agreement that is now becoming known to the world. If we want to make sure that the United States continues to lead and continues to set the rules of the road with 40 percent of the global GDP, we need to get this deal done.\nOne of the other factors that isn't mentioned enough is that the TPP group also forms the basis for more than 40 percent of future GDP growth. And so, once again, we think that it is in America's vital interest and in the interest of small towns across the United States of America to see that this bill is passed. Businesses that engage in international trade are more successful, pay higher wages to their workers. And so we have come together to make sure that in this season, with so much political noise and gamesmanship, that a bill that is vital to the United States long-term interest doesn't get left aside.\nAnd with that, I would like to bring forward the Governor of Ohio, Governor Kasich. Thank you.\nGOVERNOR KASICH: Thank you, Mayor.\nI think the Mayor has done a great job of laying out the economics implications of this agreement. I think we now have a unique opportunity, again, to put country in front of politics.\nI think many of the people that are in the Congress of the United States understand what this is all about. They understand the implications of trade. But there's one other thing that I think they all understand, and all of us in this room need to reflect on this. The two nations that most vociferously oppose this agreement are China -- you look at Xi. I'm astounded every day about another repressive technique that he uses to control his people, even going so far as to try to regulate or dismantle the youth involvement in politics in China.\nXi has been very repressive. And not only that. We're all clearly aware that it's been the reluctance of Xi and the Chinese to put the pressure that needs to be put on North Korea. They walked away from it, leaving the rest of the world wondering what to do, and bringing up issues about mutual security.\nVladimir Putin probably wakes up every day thinking about how he can complete the work he started in the Crimea, thinks about Ukraine and how much he'd like to gobble it up, or even the kind of actions he's now taking that threatens the Balkans -- I'm sorry -- the Baltics.\nSo, folks, it's really pretty simple. Economically, trade always makes sense. Are there losers in trade? Yes, there are. And that's why it's important that we have a system that can retrain people for the jobs of the future. Frankly, if you don't trade, you hurt consumers. If you don't trade, you hurt innovation. If you don't trade, you withdraw from the world. But from the geopolitical sense, it is absolutely critical that the United States stand with many of these nations that are, in some ways, economically weak -- including a nation like Vietnam, that is now asking us to work with them to develop a strong partnership that would have an economic underpinning. But that economic underpinning is absolutely going to lead to a strengthened sense of America's influence in Asia.\nCould you imagine if the United States of America decided, as I told one congressman this morning, if we turned our back on those nations in Asia that are looking to us in a great sense of partnership to give them the courage and the strength to stand against a rising China? So both from an economic point of view and a geopolitical point of view, where would we be if we turned this down?\nThis is what gives us a unique opportunity again in this city -- that I've come to not quite understand -- that these kinds of issues is where politics goes out the window and where the good of America has to be represented and has to be respected.\nI appreciate the President inviting the group that we had in there this morning. He's very passionate about the need to do this. He's willing to work with those who were both for and against, and he's willing to really put his shoulder to the wheel.\nFor me, I've got two 16-year-old daughters. I worry about the future of this country. America can't afford to lock the doors and lower the blinds and ignore the rest of the world. We're a force for good. And this TPP will help us not only on the economic side, but will also allow us to continue to be a strong world leader for good.\nRepression, lack of human rights, lack of democracy that some of these opponents to this deal support is not something that the United States should take lightly. I would call on my former colleagues in the House and the Senate to think here over the next couple weeks about the implications of saying no, and what it will mean for our future, and the fact that they can cast a vote that can strengthen our country and our alliances around the world. To me, that's what's at stake. And, frankly, that's why I'm here today.\nMR. EARNEST: Thank you, Governor.\nScott, do you want to start?\nQ: The President described it as a strategizing session. Can you guys talk a little bit about what strategy you've come up with, since I don't think politics is going to go out the window, how you're going to put political pressure on the House and Senate?\nGOVERNOR KASICH: Well, I think part of it is the President of the United States, in a quiet way, without press conferences or blaring trumpets, needs to meet with a group of people who we know are not likely to support this but they don't want to see it die. I understand politics. Sometimes people can just sort of register their objection and kind of leave the floor or leave the meetings and let matters proceed. I think that's part of it.\nI also think that the business community -- I was never a big fan of this Import-Export Bank, but the business community did a very effective job in talking about the fact that this is about jobs. We had a great, brilliant woman in there today, the head of IBM, and I think the suggestion to her is to make sure that the employees of IBM let members of Congress know that this is about my job, this is about my family, this is about my community.\nSo I think there's multiple ways in which this message can get out, but I also happen to think the national security message is something that should resonate with every single member of Congress.\nSo I think there will be an aggressive move on this. I guess I'm an optimist -- I kind of think that at the end of the day, with the right appeals, people put their country ahead of political concerns. And I saw it the entire time I was here for 18 years, and I've seen it in the state of Ohio -- with the right group of people being involved, you can pull things out and have a good victory.\nMR. EARNEST: Mayor Reed, do you want to add to that?\nMAYOR REED: I do. We think a few things. One, we think that this is a country-first moment, and we believe that if you have a strong feeling and belief in American exceptionalism that you need to be a part of this effort. And we think that that is going to help us carry the day.\nWe also happen to believe that there are a number of folks who should demonstrate and have great affection for this President, certainly at this point in his tenure, and we intend to compete vigorously for their support. And so there will be the strategy of the facts, which is that this is the right thing for America. We cannot leave 40 percent of future GDP growth to the whims and fortunes of the Chinese. We don't think that that's the smart approach. And we think that that will move us part of the way.\nAnd then we think that another part of the way will be with those individuals who are loyal to the President and who want to help him get this bill across the line. And there is a very strong feeling that there will be a moment when that vote is appropriate.\nWhat we can't do is be sitting on our hands and be on our heels. And so that's why we're here today, to start having a very detailed approach to how we're going to get this done at the right moment with a broad, bipartisan coalition.\nMR. EARNEST: Josh.\nQ: Governor Kasich, we couldn't help but notice in the Oval Office earlier that you were shaking your head when the question came up about your party's presidential nominee reinjecting the birther-ism issue into the election. Could you take a little into what was going through your mind?\nGOVERNOR KASICH: Well, what I was really thinking is that Bruce Springsteen has to be really happy, because \"Born in the U.S.A.\" is probably going to sell a lot more albums. That's as far as I would go. I mean, what am I thinking about it? I'm here for TPP and what's happening in the world, not talking about where somebody was born.\nMR. EARNEST: Ron.\nQ: Can I just ask -- when you were talking about how politicians run against trade but then change their position, essentially, are you saying that both of the leading candidates for President are now doing something disingenuous and that they are both wanting to flip their position at some point, regardless of the outcome of this election? What does it say about our politics and what does it say about --\nMAYOR REED: Oh, no, I'm not casting aspersions on either of the candidates. What I'm saying is, if you just look at history, despite what has happened in the campaign process, when people actually occupy the office and look at the data and see what it does for the American people, the 11.7 million jobs that are being supported and the 11 partner countries here, that once people are in office and have the awesome responsibility of the presidency, they change.\nThat said, to get to your question, my sense isn't that either of these candidates would flip, which is why I think it's so important that we pass TPP right now. Because I actually don't believe that it will flip. But this needs to get done for the United States of America, and there will be a moment to get it done. And as you know from being in this town for a long time, you can't just jump up and try to engage in this process -- you've got to stay at it.\nQ: Right, if you don't think they'll flip -- this is a concern that a lot of leaders in Asia expressed, the President acknowledged that in his comments. They wonder what the future is, and America's credibility is on the line here. So what do you say to them when, admittedly, you think there's going to be a problem for this deal, even if it passes, come January?\nMAYOR REED: Here's what I think will happen. I think if we pass this deal, it will be honored by the next President of the United States. And I think it's very important that we pass this deal, and it's a priority for the President. What the President made clear in no uncertain terms was that this was a priority and he was willing to work very hard on it.\nGOVERNOR KASICH: I want to say something that concerns me. We had an article today in The Wall Street Journal. I get reactions like, well, you're a Republican, why are you supporting something that the President wants? We cannot get to the point in America that because a Democrat wants something that you happen to agree with, you can't agree with him. There's plenty of things that I disagree with President Obama on. But the idea that I'm a Republican and, therefore, I can't work with Democrats; or you're a Democrat, and you can't work with Republicans -- how does anybody think that the issues of debt, Social Security, Medicare, health care, any of these issues are going to be resolved when we spend all of our time fighting with one another?\nYou see, I don't recognize this town much anymore. Because now it's become so much about politics. And when politics is the order of the day, and partisanship trumps country, we drift. We drift as a nation. And I'm extremely concerned about what I see. This is a moment for people to begin to reverse that, to think deep inside of themselves about what matters when it comes to public service.\nQ: But, Governor Kasich --\nMR. EARNEST: Hold on, hold on, hold on.\nMargaret.\nQ: You're probably not going to want to hear this, but I'd like to take what you just said and segue back to the 2016 race then. I think the issue is not that everyone is trying to drag you away from TPP and into a different conversation. It's that the dominant conversation is the one about the election that's about to happen. You're now a month and a half, two months before the election. Donald Trump just came out and did like a \"drop the mic\" moment where he said that he's the one who resolved the birther controversy; it was Hillary Clinton's fault that there ever was one. Does this go to your point about partisanship trumping -- trumping? -- the good of the country. I think -- we're not trying to distract you from --\nGOVERNOR KASICH: Look, in a presidential campaign -- we've seen a lot of them and every one, of course, is always defined as the most important one we've ever had in our history. But the fact of the matter is, is that that goes on. But this vote, ultimately, by the current Congress of the United States gets decided by the current makeup of the United States Senate and the United States House.\nAnd I happen to believe -- well, I don't want to try to ever project how anybody else is thinking. But this is a serious matter. And when I see the presidential campaign going on -- it's almost a surreal 21st century presidential election, that if you and I had drafted a movie script about everything that was going to be happening on both sides with both candidates, or even the whole process, they would have thrown us out of their offices out in Hollywood because they would said, this is a fiction that goes well beyond any fiction that would be acceptable.\nSo I understand that. But we have to stay focused on the things that matter. And I'm focused very much on the things that matter in my state. And now with this, I'm focused not only on something that affects my state, but something that affects my country.\nSo I watch with some surprise. But I also have to tell you how amazed I am with the fascination of the media on really easy stories, things that get eyeballs and generates ratings, and therefore generates money. Look, I like the media. I was once in the media. I may be back in the media again. But there's a point at which I think that journalists need to -- you have to be responsible. You report whatever story you want, any story you feel strongly about. But if the issue is how many clicks can I get, and how much can I get paid, then that drifts into an area that I think we all have to think about, because I believe we all have to live a life a little bigger than ourselves. And so, food for thought.\nQ: But, Governor, I got to ask you. Respectfully, you ran for President on this issue -- other issues, as well. And you lost.\nGOVERNOR KASICH: Yes.\nQ: Donald Trump ran opposing this, calling it the worst trade deal in the history of mankind or something. And he won. Hillary Clinton opposed it. Bernie Sanders opposed it. How is it right for Congress in a lame duck session to go against what was clearly the will of the voters through the elections process?\nAnd I've got to just ask you one more thing on Donald Trump. Do you agree with Hillary Clinton that he owes the President an apology for five years denying that he was born in America, for denying the obvious?\nGOVERNOR KASICH: I'm the person that's usually pretty direct, but I'm not stepping on my own message today by talking about that.\nNow, number two.\nQ: It's got to bug you, right?\nGOVERNOR KASICH: Oh, there's a lot of things that bug me. The chili dip shot on the 15th hole bugs me. (Laughter.) This is just life. This is politics. But, look, Jon, I don't happen to believe that with these specific issues -- whether it's the wall, or whether it's trade -- you give me $2 billion worth of publicity, and I probably could even beat you, Jon.\nBut here's the thing that I want to suggest. I have never been an ideological supporter of free trade. The ideologues used to come to me and were frustrated with me. David Dreier is one of them -- from California. Well, what's wrong with you? Or Kemp, or any of these people. But when you look at these agreements in a real sense -- and this one, much different than even NAFTA. Because, Jon, this is China. This is Russia. These are fledgling countries in Asia, and we want to pivot to Asia, we're going to have to do this.\nI think there's something that the Mayor said that's fairly accurate. You know, sometimes in campaigns people will say things only to find out later, oops. I used to say during the campaign, do you know how many promises people make when they run for President and they never carry them out? But, look, this is an opportunity for the Congress to carry out its responsibility.\nAnd because somebody didn't support a trade agreement who's running for President -- so what? We disagree with Presidents. I disagree with this President on a lot of things, okay? But I happen to agree with him strongly on this thing. So I don't think because we have this presidential election that somehow the Congress that's sitting there shouldn't be able to move forward on this agreement, particularly when I think it's vital. And I don't think it's those issues that really are the ones that -- I think there are a lot of people in America who feel very frustrated, they feel very vulnerable.\nYou know how I understand it? Because I grew up in it. Where I grew up, in McKees Rocks, was a town if the wind blew the wrong way people found themselves out of work. And sometimes simple proposals to solve difficult problems sell, but they never work. Then never work. Blaming somebody's loss of a job on somebody from Mexico that came in and took your job -- that's a simple way to scapegoat. No matter who they are. Whether it's\n-- or Bernie and his business of the only reason why you don't have something, because all the rich people in the world, they took what you had -- I just think that's just wrong. And I know it's boring to have complicated solutions to complicated problems, but we'll end up back there. We will end up back there, mark my words, or we will drift.\nQ: Who is --\nMR. EARNEST: Hold on. Hold on. Are you on the ballot? (Laughter.)\nGo ahead.\nQ: Governor Kasich, to follow up on what you were just laying out, are you saying, then, as the Mayor suggested, that this is just pure political expediency on the part of both the Democratic and the Republican presidential nominees to oppose this free trade deal? And what do you think that streak of protectionism in both parties is being fed off of?\nGOVERNOR KASICH: Well, I think Hillary was once for it, until she was against it. I think that's a -- is that a quote from some other campaign? (Laughter.) So she moved there.\nQ: And you (inaudible.)\nGOVERNOR KASICH: Oh, I have no idea. That's why I want to do this now, because you've got to get this done. I'd love to think it could happen next year. I'm not convinced it can happen after this year.\nNo, what I'm suggesting -- and I'm not questioning where either of the candidates' real heart is. I can't discern where their heart is. But what I can say is oftentimes when people run -- you know, when I ran for governor there were a lot of things that I thought I could do -- when I got in there, I said, oh, you know what, it's not that simple. I can actually tell you I remember saying I was going to abolish the Highway Patrol -- they're like armed revenue agents -- until I figured out what they did. So sometimes as you run, you don't have the sense of the heaviness, the gravity of decision-making.\nAs the Mayor will tell you, it's very hard to be the mayor of Atlanta. You know, when you run for mayor of Atlanta, I'll bet he said I'm going to do this and do that, and then you get in and you still stick to your principles, but with sophistication and understanding, leaders evolve. They don't change. I mean, this is not like you change colors or anything like that. But you learn more and you lead.\nAnd so I don't know where these candidates will ultimately be, but what I know is there's a chance for the House and the Senate to actually do something. And here's what I do believe. I believe there are people both in the House and the Senate that will play pure politics with our future to take care of themselves. And let me also suggest to you, when that's what you do, when you leave Washington you didn't accomplish anything other than -- what? Obstruct?\nLook, I've been involved in more fights on Capitol Hill than about anybody -- within my party and with the other party. But at the end, you have to accomplish something. And sometimes politics today in this town, it's overwhelming. As we all know. What, are we kidding ourselves? There's too much politics and not enough caring about being an American. Am I right?\nThank you.\nQ: If I could just follow, Governor. Whether you're in Parma or mayor in Dunwoody somewhere, I just want you to make it really simple for the guys driving the pickup truck who just wants to understand why this matters -- because I think when you're awash in it, it's easy, maybe, to make the compelling argument in a room like this. But for people who are not dealing with this day to day, they want to know how is this going to affect my life, this TPP.\nMAYOR REED: Well, I'll tell you, there is a receptionist that I think we almost got disciplined because the Republican governor of the state of Georgia and I showed up to urge the President to support funding of the deepening of the Port of Savannah, which happens to be one of the fastest-growing ports in America. And ultimately, it was funded. You go to the Port of Savannah, you see those jobs that everybody in America is talking about. You see a longshoreman that can put his kids through school and know that his children are going to go to college.\nAnd so the kind and quality of jobs that everybody is talking about in America comes from investments in international trade.\nThe Port of Savannah supports 150,000 jobs in the metropolitan region. That's why I was sitting next to a Republican governor, asking that the Port of Savannah receive support -- not Atlanta. So I think what we have to do is to go back to jobs. All of this is a competition for talent. I happen to believe that technology is a far more destructive force in many areas than global trade.\nGlobal trade is just more convenient to whack at because you don't want to beat up on your iPad or your computer, because we love them all so much. So it's easy to talk about global trade. I go back to jobs, jobs, jobs. Businesses that engage in international trade, we're only 1 percent of small businesses. Just imagine if we take our small businesses and move them from 1 to 4, to 5 percent -- the impact it has on our GDP.\nAnd finally, I'll close with this. I love America. And right now, America makes up somewhere between 21 to 23 percent of global GDP. What are we going to do to make sure that that stays the case? To the extent that we maintain the influence and America's wealth, we ensure that our values can be shared across the country. So, one, I think a deep love of country, and where are we generating the highest quality of jobs that are exactly the kind that we've been talking about over the last 12 to 16 months.\nGOVERNOR KASICH: Good job, Mayor. Look, I mean, first of all, for the consumer, you shut down trade, you will get products that cost more and don't have quality. So to the truck driver, I mean, you want to have textiles or cars or whatever it is that are not as good and cost you more, go ahead.\nSecondly, I know those truck drivers. I grew up in a blue-collar town. They love our country. Our folks in the truck-driving, blue-collar world don't want to turn power over to the Chinese or the Russians. They love America. That's another given.\nLet me tell you one other thing. We are a country -- we are now a knowledge nation. We supply the ideas, the brainpower to move things to bring about progress. Progress defined is improving our standard of living. That truck driver is worried about his or her kids. The biggest problem we have today is that our education system at all levels is not preparing our children for the jobs of today and the jobs of tomorrow. Furthermore, we also don't have the capability to retrain somebody. And we want to talk about somebody left behind? Yeah, a 53-year-old man or woman who one day heard they were out of work and now they don't know what to do.\nYou see, the whole system has broken down. We have an education system that reflects the way we lived a hundred years ago. We've got a higher education system that costs too much and doesn't appropriately provide kids with the skills that they need. And we do not have a job-retraining system in this country. That should come with any trade deal because there will be some people who will be displaced.\nBut, you know, where I grew up in Pittsburgh, we had steel mills. For anybody that reads The New York Times, on Sunday, there was an incredible article about 500 people in Pittsburgh growing to a thousand who are involved with Uber in autonomous vehicles. We may no longer make the iPhone -- we don't manufacture the iPhone, but we created the iPhone, and these knowledge jobs pay a lot more.\nSo to that truck driver, you're going to get your children a good education. We're going to train them for an entire lifetime, and they're going to be living in an exciting world of drones and autonomous vehicles and iPhones and Skype and all this incredible stuff that we see every single day. We can't go backwards to buggy whips. We have to go forward to these exciting, new innovations that will mean more wages, better jobs, more consistent work, but we need to change everything.\nI mentioned to the President before I -- he and I had a little bit of time together. The whole education system -- it all needs to be changed. I want to ask you -- you all have children -- I think Josh is going to wrap this up -- do you think we're training your children for the jobs of today, the jobs of tomorrow? Most young people will have between five and 10 jobs in a lifetime. Are we giving them the resilience, the knowledge, and the capability to be flexible and to have a great life? We need to do that for our kids. We need to forget about politics and everything else, and start to do it.\nJosh, thank you.\nQ: If you were the nominee, would you be endorsing TPP, sir?\nGOVERNOR KASICH: I was for it when I was running.\nQ: Will you endorse Donald Trump?\nQ: But at the White House?\nGOVERNOR KASICH: Of course. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: I'm happy to talk about TPP at additional length -- (laughter) -- I've got some of my own thoughts to get off my chest -- or anything else that may be on your mind today.\nJosh, do you want to get us started?\nQ: Sure. Let's go to the Syria deal, actually, since we're getting closer to the end of this test period for the ceasefire. And I'm wondering if you can comment on the perception that's out there now that the State Department and the Pentagon are basically taking public their strong disagreement about whether this deal with Russia is a good idea, whether we can cooperate with Russia, the Pentagon publically threatening not to even implement it, the State Department essentially saying, well, look, Obama agrees with Kerry. Is part of the President's goal today to try and say to the heads of those two agencies, like, look, you need to kind of get along on this?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there's a lot there. Let's start with the President's meeting later today. As all of you know, the President every couple of weeks gathers his national security team together to discuss the effectiveness and progress of our strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. The next installment of those meetings will take place later today at the White House. And this is consistent with the kinds of meetings that you've covered before. This is one that had long been planned, and it's been on the books, in fact, before the agreement that Secretary Kerry reached with his Russian counterpart at the end of last week.\nAs it relates to the President's national security team, as I mentioned earlier this week, the President didn't staff up his national security team with yes men and yes women. The President staffed his national security team with experts who are determined to offer the President their best judgement about the best way to protect the American people and to protect our national security.\nThe President expects to receive advice based on their differing perspectives, their different experiences, and their different expertise. What the President also expects is that once he has made a decision that his team -- all components of the team -- move out to execute that strategy with excellence. And the President has no doubt that that's exactly what will happen as it relates to our latest effort to reduce the violence in Syria, address the terrible humanitarian situation, continue to pressure ISIL, and facilitate the kind of political transition inside of Syria that is long overdue.\nIn terms of those goals that I just articulated, those are widely shared across the administration, including at the Department of Defense and at the State Department. And both sides -- I would say everybody who is sitting around that table in the Situation Room today understands the situation inside of Syria is extraordinarily complicated. And there aren't a lot of good options available to the United States. But the option that has been made available at the President's direction, thanks largely to the tenacity of Secretary Kerry, is this effort to apply pressure to the Russians to see if they will use the influence that they have with the Assad regime to reduce the violence, allow for the free flow of humanitarian assistance, and facilitate negotiations around a political transition.\nThere are no other legitimate options that have been presented. And it's not as if there is an alternative that's been presented by somebody inside the administration or outside, for that matter, that anybody thinks is actually an alternative, long-term solution to this problem. So what the President is pursuing, with the support of this national security team, is the best option that is available to advance the interests of the United States, to reduce violence in Syria, to address the humanitarian situation inside of Syria, and bring about the kind of political transition that would address the root causes of the chaos and violence inside of Syria.\nQ: And the Associated Press, along with our colleagues at Gannett and Vice, sued the FBI today over our request for contracts related to the FBI getting into that iPhone that was used in the San Bernardino case. You've spoken quite a bit about the administration's pride in its record with compliance with Freedom of Information Act requests. Would the White House like to see the FBI comply with the FOIA request related to this case?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Josh, I'm just not going to be able to comment on what you acknowledge is the subject of litigation as of today. The FBI and the administration have tried to be as transparent as possible about this situation. Given the sensitive nature of the topic, we've been quite limited in what we've been able to discuss publicly. But at this point, there is a process that has been initiated by your news organization and others, and I'm confident that the Obama administration will comply with the law.\nRoberta.\nQ: Josh, Vietnam had been expected to quickly ratify the TPP. But earlier today, Vietnam indicated that it would not be -- it would hold off on that ratification. And we saw during the Asia trip President Obama spent a lot of time talking with the leader of Vietnam at the dinner and other meetings. I'm wondering if he had a head's up that this wouldn't be happening, and what your assessment is of the implications for where -- TPP on a broader scale.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Roberta, I can't speak to any of the private conversations that the President had with his Vietnamese counterpart. I know that he did not have an opportunity to have a detailed discussion with his Vietnamese counterpart at the ASEAN meetings. I think what I can say in general is, in the context of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Vietnam, as a country, has made some rather substantial commitments that are consistent with American values and with America's economic interests in Southeast Asia. These reforms include significant human rights and labor reforms that would lead to a more level playing field for U.S. businesses that are interested in selling goods in Vietnam.\nCritics of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and trade agreements like this often cite Vietnam as exactly the kind of country that engages in unfair trading practices that disadvantages American workers and has a negative impact on our economy. They have not -- those critics have not presented an effective strategy for countering Vietnam's unfair trading practices. President Obama has. That's exactly what the Trans-Pacific Partnership is about.\nVietnam, in the context of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, has agreed to raise their labor standards and to better protect human rights. That's exactly the outcome that we're looking for. That's why the President is such an ardent advocate of this. And you had an opportunity to hear from Governor Kasich and Mayor Reed to talk about how do you make the case to the American public about why this is important.\nMy version of that argument is I think it's pretty simple. There's widespread acknowledgement that the U.S. economy and U.S. businesses and U.S. workers are under increasing pressure and increasing competition from overseas. And the question really for policymakers in the United States is what are we going to do about it. And critics of the Trans-Pacific Partnership have not put forward any solutions. They don't have a strategy, aside from complaining, bemoaning the situation.\nThe President has put forward a very specific strategy that has the potential to show very tangible benefits about the very concerns identified by the self-proclaimed champions of America's workers. So the President has a solution that will work, but it's going to require Congress's agreement to implement the deal because -- news flash -- people around the world expect the United States to lead the way.\nAnd President Obama has lead the way by negotiating a trade agreement that is in the economic and strategic interests of the United States. And now it's time for Congress to show some leadership -- both when it comes to looking out for our interests overseas, but also when it comes to looking out for the interests of America's workers.\nQ: The decision by Vietnam then, how big a setback is it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't think it's a setback yet. I think the real stumbling block, the real impediment, the obstacle here is Congress. And I don't think there's any indication that -- well, let me say it in the affirmative. There's every indication that Vietnam will move forward with these critically important reforms once Congress has approved the deal.\nQ: Do you have any other -- do you have any insight on when the President is going to veto the JASTA legislation? And can you talk at all about what kind of work is underway to maybe kind of adjust the bill or tweak the bill, tweak the legislation to make it -- to address some of the concerns that the White House has expressed?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have an update for you on timing. Once the President has vetoed the bill, we'll be sure to let all of you know. We continue to make our forceful, principled argument to members of Congress. There's openness to our argument; there's even sympathy for our argument. We just need to turn that into votes, and we'll continue to make the case.\nJoe.\nQ: Josh, now that Donald Trump has said President Obama was born in the United States, do you see that as a disavowal of the birther movement? And do you think, as Hillary Clinton has said, the President is owed an apology, or the voters are owed an apology?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think I'll leave it to other people to analyze and evaluate the comments of the Republican nominee. There are plenty of people who are eager to do that -- I'm not one of them. With regard to an apology, I don't think the President much cares.\nQ: Hillary Clinton has called this whole business bigoted. Are you willing to go that far? Are you willing to call it racist?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, Secretary Clinton is somebody who, I think for understandable reasons, is commenting on and giving voice to her own conclusions about the comments of her opponent. There are plenty of other people who also are interested in doing that, but I'm not one of them.\nQ: Should the country move on from this issue, or do you think it's appropriate for it to remain a political matter up to the election?\nMR. EARNEST: I think when the President released the long-form version of his birth certificate in this room five years ago, he was hoping that people would move on.\nQ: But should Donald Trump's positions on this through the years remain an issue through the election?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, when it comes to their support for -- when it comes to voters making a decision about who they're going to support in the presidential campaign, they'll use their own criteria, including the comments and positions of the individual candidates, in determining who they're going to support in the election.\nQ: Is the issue settled? And what was the effect? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, when the President released the long-form version of his birth certificate five years ago, he expected that the issue was settled.\nJon.\nQ: But I have a question on this. So the President may not care what Donald Trump did, and I can tell he doesn't care at all, but there are a lot of people in this country that are deeply offended that for five years, Donald Trump questioned whether or not the President of the United States was actually an American citizen, that he was actually born in this country. They were offended by that behavior. They felt it was driven by either racism or bigotry or whatever else. Shouldn't Donald Trump be held to account for that? Is that -- I think that's what Joe is asking. Is that an issue that should be over, that people should move on? Or should Donald Trump be called to account for what he has said for the past five years?\nMR. EARNEST: I think in a variety of contexts I have readily acknowledged that elections are about accountability. And so if there are people who have the views that you've described --\nQ: Do you not acknowledge that? I mean, do you think people have those views?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm confident there are plenty of people with a variety of views out there. So I guess --\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nMR. EARNEST: It is, isn't it? My point is, if there are people that do have strong feelings about this, they have a unique opportunity to make those feelings known at the ballot box if they choose to do so. But, ultimately, people are going to have to make up their own minds about this.\nQ: Now, Trump said two other things. He first acknowledged the President was born in the United States, but he also said that it was the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2008 that started this whole thing.\nMR. EARNEST: There's no evidence to support that.\nQ: And he said that he is the one that ended it all. Is Donald Trump the one that finally ended all this? Is Donald Trump the reason why the world now knows the President was born in the United States?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I don't think that's the case, either. (Laughter.)\nQ: So one for three? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Ron.\nQ: Just to follow up, if I can, can you take a step back and why do you think that this issue resonated? And will you accept that there are a significant number of people in this country who agreed with Donald Trump and who still may question the President's -- you've seen these polls that suggested there are people who still think the President is Muslim, so on and so forth. What accounts for that in this country?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, there have been people who have been speculating and even writing books on this question for years. So, again, people are welcome to formulate their own analysis. But the President, as he said in the Oval Office, he's hopeful that people are going to be focused on the most important issues facing the country. And this isn't one of them.\nQ: Well, I guess some people would argue that it is one of the most important political issues facing the country -- not the question of where the President was born or not, but the fact that there are a significant number of people in the country who this whole argument resonates with, and that these are, in large part, the people who have made Donald Trump the nominee of the party, to some extent. That's the issue. And does the President or you -- does the President not think that this is a significant issue that needs to be addressed in this country? And why does this still exist?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, the beauty of our democracy is there is ample opportunity for there to be a vigorous debate. And there is an opportunity for people to debate those issues, the issues that you've just raised, if they so choose.\nThe President is going to be making a forceful case for Secretary Clinton on the campaign trail because of his belief that she is going to fight for middle-class workers in this country; that she has the temperament and judgement and experience to lead the country and ensure that our national security interests are represented and advanced and protected around the world. And the President is able to speak to those qualities based on his personal relationship with Secretary Clinton, and based on the fact that he's the one that's been responsible for doing the job over the last eight years.\nSo he's got a cogent, forceful case that he'll make based on the issues that he believes are most important in the election. And he certainly is hopeful that people across the country will be persuaded by that case. But, look, people will have an opportunity to draw their own conclusions and cast a vote based on whatever criteria they determine is most important.\nQ: And you said there's a National Security Council meeting this afternoon -- is that -- it's not on the schedule, is it?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, it is on the schedule. The President will be --\nQ: Not on the public guidance.\nMR. EARNEST: It was not on the guidance last night, but there won't be public access to the meeting. They'll just be meeting in the Situation Room. But this is part of the regular series of meetings that the President has done.\nQ: So is the President going to make remarks, as he has after the meeting at the Pentagon and Treasury?\nMR. EARNEST: No, he will not today.\nQ: And just lastly, the question I asked you yesterday about Syria -- obviously that will come up in this meeting I would think, to some extent.\nMR. EARNEST: It certainly will.\nQ: Beyond this meeting, is there anything else that the President is doing that -- where he is personally engaged in trying to break this impasse that still has humanitarian aid that is not getting through? I think we're at four or five days now into this seven-day window.\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, the situation on the ground in Syria is deeply concerning. There continue to be populations of innocent Syrians who are not receiving the humanitarian assistance that they badly need. The United States has fulfilled our responsibility to ensure that those opposition forces have complied with the request to ensure that that humanitarian assistance can flow to the areas where it's needed most. The Assad regime, however, has not. They have not complied with the requests to do what's necessary to allow that aid to move.\nAnd that is squarely the responsibility of President Putin and the Russians. The Russians are the ones that are party to this agreement. They are the ones that have made a commitment to use their influence with the Assad regime to reduce the violence and allow humanitarian access. And either the Russians are unable to live up to the agreement -- maybe they don't have the juice and influence that they claim to have and that we all thought they had, or maybe they're just unwilling. But in either case, it means that they're not living up to the terms of the arrangement.\nQ: Is this arrangement just crumbling before our eyes?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I don't think that's the case because part of the arrangement has --\nQ: Is there anything that you've seen over the past couple of days that gives you hope that something positive is going to happen here -- the trucks can start rolling?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, first of all, I think the immediate impact has been that there has been a significant reduction in violence across Syria. That's a positive development. But we have not seen the corresponding freedom of movement for trucks delivering humanitarian assistance. And that is also a high priority. That's something that we also need to see happen. And we haven't because it's been blocked by the Assad regime. And that is something that is the direct responsibility of the Russian government.\nMargaret Brennan.\nQ: Josh, did the President make a decision earlier this week to allow U.S. forces to work alongside the Turks in northern Syria, as is being reported?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Margaret, what the United States has committed to do is to support efforts of the Turkish government to clear ISIL from what had recently been a previously contested area along their border. And a month or so ago, the Turks took action, with the support of the United States and our coalition partners, to launch an offensive against ISIL forces along the border. And they're continuing -- those efforts along the border are continuing, and those efforts continue with the support of the United States.\nQ: But that's not just from the air anymore. That is on the ground, U.S. forces on the ground, alongside the Turks. That is what you're addressing?\nMR. EARNEST: That's correct. I'm not going to be able to provide a detailed, operational status update in terms of exactly where they are and what they're doing, but there are a variety of ways that the United States can provide support to Turkish forces that are doing this work, and that includes U.S. forces on the ground.\nI'll just point out that the actions that the Turks are taking are consistent with the request that we have been making to the Turks for more than a year. And we have been pleased to see the Turks pursue this kind of decisive, strategically significant action that will aid our efforts to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. It also will enhance security along the Turkish-Syria border and hopefully put an end to the kind of violence that has spilled over into Turkey.\nI know the Turkish government and the Turkish people have been deeply concerned about some of the terrorist attacks that they had seen, and the United States has been deeply concerned about that violence as well. And that's yet another reason why we are supporting their efforts to eradicate ISIL from this border region, to secure that border, and better protect the Turkish people.\nQ: You acknowledged Syria is going to be part of the conversation during the NSC meeting today. The State Department said earlier that John Kerry told his Russian counterpart that the idea of the U.S. and Russian military working together would not happen until aid flows through. Are you revisiting -- is the administration revisiting that decision to establish the joint operations center?\nMR. EARNEST: No, there's no revisiting of the arrangement that was reached and announced last week. The arrangement is quite clear that the kind of military cooperation that the Russians have been desperately seeking for quite some time will not occur until they follow through on their commitment to persuade the Assad regime to reduce violence and allow humanitarian assistance to reach populations in need.\nQ: So President Obama still is willing to partner with Vladimir Putin on this?\nMR. EARNEST: Only in the context of the agreement, though. So, as we've been saying since last week, the Russians need to deliver on their commitments. The Russians are the ones who are most interested in enhanced military cooperation. That's the Russian ask. But that Russian request will not be granted until they fulfill the commitments that they have made in the context of getting the Assad regime to reduce violence and allow for humanitarian assistance to reach the populations that need it the most.\nQ: John Kerry said earlier this week that this was the last shot, diplomatically, for the White House to try to persuade Assad to do all these things. Do you see us at that point, that at this meeting today, President Obama would look at whether his premise of finding a way to talk him into doing the right thing is just not worth it? I mean, is it truly the last shot at a diplomatic deal under this administration?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, Secretary Kerry -- I referred earlier to his tenacious efforts to broker this agreement. And in the months that he's been trying to do that, he and I and others have been asked about a Plan B. And I haven't seen anybody articulate what a Plan B would look like.\nQ: And he said there was none.\nMR. EARNEST: Right. So I guess the point is that this is why you've heard me say many times that Russia's credibility is on the line here. The world is watching, and we're going to find out if Russia has the kind of influence with the Assad regime that they claim to have. And we'll find out if they are willing to use that influence to protect their integrity and to live up to the terms of the arrangement. And if not, if they are unwilling to do so, it's unclear what the alternatives are.\nQ: But, arguably, American credibility is also at risk here if you continue to provide diplomatic cover when it appears that Assad has no intention to follow through this deal, nor does Russia have the ability, as you've suggested, to follow through to this deal. So do you see American credibility now at risk? Is there reason for this to be the last shot?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I don't see American credibility on the line, because the United States of America has lived up to our commitments, and our commitment has been to look for a way to reduce the violence in Syria, to enhance the provision of humanitarian assistance to those who need it the most, and to expedite a political transition inside of Syria that everybody acknowledges is necessary -- with the possible exception of Bashar al-Assad himself.\nAt the same time, we have also been making important progress against ISIL -- both in Iraq and in Syria. And that includes continuing to take back territory from ISIL, continuing to support Iraqi forces as they do so, continuing to support opposition forces in Syria who take back territory from ISIL. We continue to enjoy success in taking senior ISIL figures off the battlefield. Earlier this week, the Department of Defense confirmed that they had succeeded in carrying out a strike against a senior ISIL plotter, Adnani, who was a senior figure in that terrorist organization. As we continue to apply pressure to their leadership, and continue to make progress on the ground against ISIL, we are making important progress even as we try to deal with the terribly thorny situation inside of Syria.\nQ: So you're not at the point of calling off this deal? You're not at the point -- even though the U.N. has said that they're not getting any compliance from the Assad regime in letting in aid trucks? You are willing to just let the clock keep ticking on this, the only leverage being the possibility of future military operations with the Russians?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we know that that's significant leverage because we know that the Russians have been publicly asking for that for more than a year.\nThe second thing is that leverage has succeeded in reducing violence inside of Syria since this arrangement was announced and went into effect. But we haven't gotten everything that Russia committed to provide, which is sufficient leverage on the Assad regime to allow for the delivery of humanitarian assistance. And that is a critical part of this arrangement. And military cooperation will not go forward until that element of the arrangement has been completed.\nQ: Will President Obama speak to President Putin at any point about this? Or is this left to their chief diplomats?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any conversations that are planned at this point. If there is a conversation like that, we typically let you know about it. But right now, there is nothing to be negotiated. It's clear what everybody has agreed to. It's also clear who hasn't lived up to their end of the bargain, and that's the Russians.\nQ: It's not that clear what everyone has agreed to because there's actually no text that's been released. But that's another matter. When do you think you could do that?\nMR. EARNEST: I think there's been a rather clear description of exactly what the stages are in this arrangement. And it's not as if -- I guess to that point, Margaret, it's not as if the Russians are claiming somehow that they've done everything that they agreed to do. In the readout of his telephone call with Secretary Kerry, Foreign Minister Lavrov acknowledged that they had not yet fulfilled their responsibilities to get the Assad regime to provide that humanitarian assistance. So it's not as if the Russians are claiming that they lived up to their end of the deal.\nSo, again, I think there is a lot of clarity around what the arrangement looks like even though the paperwork has not been released.\nMargaret Talev.\nQ: Thank you. Josh, President Obama, of course, is going up to New York for the UNGA next week and will have leaders -- meetings with leaders. Hillary Clinton also has I think what her campaign called bilats. I don't know if it's a bilat if they're not -- anyway, with at least the Egyptian leader, and the Ukrainian, probably some others to be announced. Is it appropriate for a presidential nominee to have meetings on the sidelines at the U.N. with world leaders? Would it be appropriate also if Donald Trump did it? And can you talk about to what extent the President maybe is coordinating with the administration on some of these meetings and what gets discussed?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Margaret, it certainly is not uncommon for presidential candidates to travel overseas. President Obama did that when he was running for this office in 2008, and while he was traveling overseas he had the opportunity to have meetings with the elected leaders of other countries. So I don't think that there's anything significantly different about doing that when those foreign leaders travel to the United States.\nI can't speak to the degree of coordination between the administration and the Clinton campaign with regard to setting up those meetings. But there's nothing about the occurrence of those meetings that we find objectionable. After all, Mr. Trump flew to Mexico a few weeks ago to meet with the Mexican President. And again, as I noted at the time, it was consistent with what other candidates for President have done in the past.\nQ: I wanted to ask you also a follow-up question about earlier today. If we could get like the Colin Powell email version of what President Obama was actually thinking -- (laughter) -- when he saw Donald Trump's statement today -- which we're obviously not going to. It might be different than what he wanted to disclose publicly. What I'm wondering is are you kind of holding back kind of an emotional response to this because the President has specifically said that he doesn't want that to be the White House's posture? Or is it a strategic issue that President Obama actually thinks it's not good for Hillary Clinton's prospects to focus on the birther issue? Is it more like a personal request like this just needs to stop, or is it more of a strategic statement that --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I did have an opportunity to talk to the President about this issue earlier today. It was not -- it was prior to Mr. Trump's brief statement earlier today. And, look, I think the President -- what the President told all of you in the Oval Office is consistent with what he told me in the Oval Office a few minutes before, which is that this is serious business that we're engaged in here today at the White House. The President believes that it's important for us -- for the Congress to follow through and approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership. And there are strong bipartisan agreement about that.\nWe have leading figures in the Republican Party, including Governor Kasich, who stood here with leading figures in the Democratic Party to advocate for the completion of this agreement -- not just for economic reasons, but also for strategic ones as well. That's where the President believes the attention of the country should be because of the significant consequences for our country's future.\nQ: Are you saying that your reluctance is more about keeping the message on TPP today, and you may well in the days to come hear much more about precisely what he thinks about this?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I would not expect -- I would not clear your calendar in anticipation of a lengthy presidential discourse on this topic.\nFrancesca.\nQ: Speaking of meeting, President Obama met with Secretary Clinton last night, the White House has confirmed --\nMR. EARNEST: That's correct.\nQ: Did he have an opportunity to talk her about the situation in Syria last night, or perhaps the trade deal, which she says she disagrees with him on? Maybe gave her a get-well card?\nMR. EARNEST: In the conversation I had with him this morning, I asked him about his conversation with Secretary Clinton. They did have an opportunity to visit for about 15 minutes or so. The President -- it was a casual conversation so there was not a detailed policy discussion on Syria or anything else, frankly. But, look, they do what old friends do when they run into each other after not having seen each other in a while, which is that President Obama asked Secretary Clinton about her grandkids. She gave him an update and showed him some pictures. And I think it's an indication of exactly what their relationship is like.\nThe President also told her about how much fun he had on the campaign trail earlier this week and that he's really looking forward to spending more time over the course of the fall campaigning in support of her effort to take the presidency. And he's excited about that prospect because he's enthusiastic about her candidacy. And he told her that, and presumably she was glad to hear that. And then she went to deliver her remarks.\nQ: How many more times can we expect him to be so enthusiastic for her on the trail?\nMR. EARNEST: We'll give you an update about the President's planned travels over the course of the fall. The President certainly has some significant responsibilities here at the White House. So, for example, next week he's going to be devoting most of his time in New York to meeting with world leaders and participating in the activities that are part of the U.N. General Assembly. But the President will leave Washington on late Sunday afternoon because he's going to spend some time Sunday evening in New York helping to raise money for the Democratic Party in pursuit of -- in support of Secretary Clinton's presidential campaign.\nQ: Just to follow up on that. Would you say maybe one more time, two more times? Could you give us a range of how many more times?\nMR. EARNEST: How many more times that he'll be --\nQ: That the President will campaign for her, not necessarily fundraising, but doing the sort of events that we saw him do this week.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, certainly more than one or two. We've got about seven or eight weeks to go here. Next week, again, will be consumed primarily with the President's official responsibilities as President of the United States. But after that, the President will be able to devote more time to another priority of his, which is advocating for Secretary Clinton's election.\nChris.\nQ: Josh, I asked you a lot of questions a while back about the administration guidance regarding discrimination against transgender students in schools and litigation against that guidance by the Attorney General. That issue has now reached the Supreme Court in the form -- as a result of a separate but related lawsuit inaudible.) The ACLU has called on the Court to not take up that case. But where does the administration stand? Would the White House welcome the Supreme Court taking up this issue?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Chris, I have to admit, I'm not aware of the latest step in the process that you're referring to here. Given the fact that this is an issue that's being litigated in the courts, there's not much that I can say beyond what we've already said, which is that in offering the guidance that was provided by the United States Department of Education, they were being responsive to requests that they had received from school administrators, teachers and parents from all across the country. And in an effort to provide professional, expert advice, based on the best practices of other education professionals, they offered some advice and they issued some guidance.\nBut this is something that's being discussed in the courts. The administration's top priority is the safety, security and dignity of every single kid in American schools, and that's going to continue to be our priority.\nQ: But the President, when that guidance came out, predicted that the courts would resolve the issue. Wouldn't a decision from the Supreme Court indicate that that guidance enhanced the safety and security --\nMR. EARNEST: When it comes to our legal strategy, I'd refer you to the Department of Justice.\nCheryl.\nMR. EARNEST: Thanks, Josh. On TPP, when the President goes to New York next week for the U.N., will he be meeting with leaders or holding any sort of meetings specifically to discuss TPP?\nMR. EARNEST: We'll have some additional details about the President's schedule in New York later this afternoon -- a couple of my colleagues will be convening a conference call to discuss the President's schedule in New York.\nQ: And then, real quick, does the White House have any date in mind that it would like to submit the actual TPP for ratification to Congress?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, as we've said in the past, we're going to continue to coordinate with Speaker Ryan's office and Leader McConnell's office to design the best path forward here when it comes to securing legislative approval of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. So I don't have any updates in terms of timing, but once a decision like that is made, it will be made in coordination with Leader McConnell's office and Speaker Ryan's office.\nQ: And did they give you any guidance yet that you can discuss?\nMR. EARNEST: We've had some conversations about it, but I don't have any details to announce at this point.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I want to circle back on TPP for just a second and some of the comparisons to NAFTA. Previously, you have suggested that some of the provisions in TPP would sort of eradicate some of the problems that were borne out of NAFTA, but I distinctly remember the sale of NAFTA was it will be great for you, trust us, Americans. The American people remember that. How is this not different?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it is different, and the reason it's different is that the improved labor and environmental standards that were side agreements to NAFTA are enforceable in the context of TPP. So these core components that level the playing field for American businesses and American workers are fully enforceable, which means --\nQ: -- skepticism, though, because people are like, look, they promised us a bunch of stuff with NAFTA, and it didn't pan out.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess the President has raised his own concerns about NAFTA, and it included the fact that some of those key provisions that are important to protecting U.S. businesses and U.S. workers were not enforceable. In this agreement, in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, they are enforceable, which means that if other countries aren't living up to their terms of the agreement when it comes to leveling the playing field, then they're in violation of the agreement and can be kicked out.\nQ: Are you familiar with TISA?\nMR. EARNEST: I am not.\nQ: It's part of the services agreement that's being negotiated right now between the United States, the EU, and 22 other nations. It's sort of an Uber TPP if you will. Can you give me sort of an administration update on how those negotiations are going?\nMR. EARNEST: I'd refer you to my colleagues at USTR. We'll see if we can get you some additional information about it, but I'm not aware of the status of the ongoing negotiations.\nQ: Okay. Last one. We've talked previously about Syria being effectively this mash-up. We've talked about de-confliction, because there's so many different interests that are there -- more than 60 countries apparently working with the U.S., you have the U.S., you have the Russians, you have the Syrians. As we continue to work now with the Turks and others in this environment, what's the President's level of concern that American lives are increasingly at risk without an agreement forged with the Russians?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, what we have been able to work with the Russians is to effectively de-conflict their military activities with ours. So that's different than coordination and cooperation, because we're not sharing intelligence information in a way that allows us to coordinate our activities. But what we are is sharing enough information to make sure that the Russian military, when they're operating either in the skies or on the ground in Syria, are steering clear of the United States and our coalition partners.\nWith regard to coordinating our activities with Turkey and others, Turkey is part of our 65-member coalition that is effectively coordinating all of our efforts. So Turkey and the United States, for example, are working together and that only enhances the security of U.S. forces that are operating there.\nBut I've not heard anyone downplay the risk that our men and women in uniform are assuming in carrying out counter-ISIL operations against targets in Iraq, or in Syria, for that matter. Our men and women in uniform are bearing a significant burden. They are putting their lives on the line for our national security. We owe them a deep debt of gratitude.\nThe Commander-in-Chief is keenly aware of that. He talked about it at the news conference in Laos at the end of his trip a little over a week ago, and he talked about his deep admiration for the sacrifice that our men and women in uniform make. And one of those sacrifices that thousands of Americans are making right now is to serve our country in Iraq and in Syria in support of our counter-ISIL campaign and in support of the strategy that the President has laid out to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\nIt's dangerous work. They're putting themselves at risk. And we are deeply grateful for the responsibility that they've assumed that makes our country safer.\nOkay? Thanks.\nJ.C., I'll give you the last one.\nQ: For some obvious reasons, my students from Catholic University are here today joining this briefing. The question is, do millennials really hold the key to this election and will they get out and vote? The youth, the young voters, the first-time voters.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, when President Obama ran for this job in 2008, his candidacy and his message inspired millions of young people all across the country to get engaged in our political process for the first time. One of the real legacies of President Obama's campaign and tenure here in the White House is the degree to which he succeeded in engaging the youngest generation of Americans in questions of politics and in the broader public debate.\nSo there's no denying how important a role young people play in American politics. And that certainly is -- they'll continue to play that role in this presidential election. And I know that there is a lot of thought and effort and energy that's going into persuading them to support Secretary Clinton's campaign.\nQ: President Obama was a unique individual with a certain energy that really inspired young people. Do you believe that either candidate can have the same kind of influence on the youth vote?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, I think what President Obama often -- the case that President Obama repeatedly made in the context of the election was that he was eager to give voice to a new generation of Americans and fight for the kinds of priorities that they've identified in their own lives -- reducing the cost of a college education, making sure that people in the United States of America aren't discriminated against just because of who they love, making sure that the United States continues to play a leading role in fight climate change and fighting carbon pollution.\nThe President also made commitment to go in and enhance the national security of the United States, and reduce the number of young people from the United States that were serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. And more than 90 percent of the troops that were serving our country overseas in Iraq and Afghanistan when he took office have come home.\nSo the President has made good on a lot of promises, and I think he made good on the promises that he made to America's young people. Hopefully both candidates will be making a forceful case to pursuing the kinds of priorities that young people are still concerned about, and, like I said, I'm confident that Secretary Clinton's team is very focused on making that precise case.\nOkay? So I don't have a written week ahead in front of me but -- (Eric Schultz places a piece of paper on the podium.)\nQ: You do now. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Well if I can read Eric Schultz's handwriting then I will try to do it.\nAs I mentioned earlier, the President will depart the White House late Sunday afternoon, headed for New York, and he will participate in a fundraiser in New York in support of the Democratic Party and Secretary Clinton's presidential campaign.\nOn Monday, the President -- this is late morning -- the President will participate in a roundtable fundraising event to benefit the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\nOn Tuesday, the President will deliver remarks at the opening session of the United Nations General Assembly. After his remarks, he'll attend a luncheon that's hosted by U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. That afternoon, he'll attend a CEO roundtable and participate in a refugee summit. This, of course, are a set of activities that the United States has organized to focus international attention on the plight of refugees and to get other countries around the world focused on what kind of commitments they can make to supporting the needs of people who have had to flee violence.\nLate Tuesday afternoon, the President will participate in a family photo with other world leaders who are attending the U.N. General Assembly. And then that evening, he will deliver remarks at a reception for the heads of delegations who are attending the United Nations General Assembly.\nOn Wednesday, in New York, the President will participate in the U.S.-Africa Forum, and then return to D.C. late Wednesday afternoon. I should point out that, over the course of his three days in New York -- Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday -- the President will have a couple of bilateral meetings, and we'll have more information on those meetings later today.\nOn Thursday, the President will award the 2015 National Medal of Arts and National Humanities Medal here in the East Room of the White House. And then on Friday, he'll host a reception for the opening of the African American Museum in the East Room of the White House.\nAnd then next Saturday, a week from tomorrow, the President and First Lady will attend the opening ceremony of the African American History on the National Mall. The President will deliver remarks at that ceremony.\nSo, with that, I hope you all have great weekend, and I look forward to seeing many of you in New York.\nQ: Thanks, Josh.\nMR.

{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "note": "Speech as delivered. Secretary Clinton was introduced by president of the Black Women's Agenda, Gwen Hess.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119159", "text": "\"Hello, B-W-A. I thank you all for that warm welcome. There's nowhere I'd rather be than right here with all of you this morning.\nPlease everyone be seated. This is such a great opportunity to lift up the work that so many of you have done for years -- your organizations, individually -- and I am grateful for it because it has helped to guide me in a lot of the work that I've been privileged to do.\nI want to thank Gwen Hess for her introduction. I want to acknowledge, it's always great to see a woman serve as president in any setting.\nI want to congratulate today's honorees. Everyone is so deserving of this recognition. I also want to acknowledge a few others. We have some fierce members of Congress with us today, women whom I admire, who have been my colleagues and friends and with whom I am looking forward to continuing our work: Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, Congresswoman Gwen Moore, Congresswoman Yvette Clarke, Congresswoman Stacey Plaskett.\nAnd I want to give a special shout out to Congresswoman Joyce Beatty. When I saw Joyce recently, she said, 'Well, you are coming, aren't you?' And I said, 'I'm working hard to get it set.' And I am so proud that it did work out, and I thank Joyce for that extra push.\nI also want to acknowledge someone who had such a profound effect on my life, in every way, someone whom I admire and love, Marian Wright Edelman. This audience is filled with longtime friends and people I went to Wellesley College with that became life-long friends to me, and so many of you who have been on the front lines -- everyone associated with The Black Women's Agenda, I'm thrilled to be with you. I'm thrilled to be associated with you. I'm also thrilled to be back on the campaign trail. As the world knows, I was a little under the weather recently. The good news is, my pneumonia finally got some Republicans interested in women's health.\nLooking back, I know, I should have followed my doctor's orders to rest, but, my instinct was to push through it. That is what women do every single day, and I felt no different. Life has shown us that we do have to work harder at the office while still bearing most of the responsibilities at home -- that we always need to keep going because our families and our communities count on us. And I think it is more than fair to say, that black women have an even tougher road.\nAnd you, your daughters, your granddaughters -- I was pleased to meet Gwen's beautiful granddaughter earlier -- leave the house every morning, put on that game face that we all practice, and enter a society that consistently challenges your worth. With the images you see, the lower pay that so many take home, that try to silence your voices and break your spirits; yet, you remain fierce in the face of these challenges. We see that every day in the businesses you start, the art you create, the children you teach and the communities and organizations you lead. While your stories are often missing from the history books -- make no mistake -- you are the change makers, the path breakers, and the ground shakers. And, you are proof that yes, indeed, black girl magic is real.\nNow, I've been blessed to see this magic's influence on kids and communities up close for decades, starting with my first job after law school working with Marian at the Children's Defense Fund. Marian's belief was that every single child had worth and potential and deserved the opportunity to live up to their god potential with the tools and the support that every child needs. And that if we just improve the odds a bit for those suffering in poverty, they could flourish. So she led our team into some very poor communities. We met kids who had dropped out of school because they couldn't afford textbooks or transportation. Some didn't have decent clothes and stayed home to avoid being humiliated in class. Some had untreated medical and dental problems that made it practically impossible for them to learn. Those stories really hurt my heart.\nBut Marian always believed we could deliver help and hope if we never ever gave up. So she taught us ways to think creatively, as well as strategically-- to take our advocacy and turn it into action and results. She sent me to New Bedford, Massachusetts, to go door to door looking for children who weren't in school. That was back before we had a legal requirement that every child, regardless of disability, deserved to get an education. I met a young girl in New Bedford and sat and talked with her on the small back porch of her house. She told me how badly she wanted to learn, but couldn't because schools weren't accessible or welcoming. So Marian had us get to work and change that.\nWe gathered evidence and built a coalition. We helped convince Congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilities. Marian showed me that to drive real progress, you have to change both hearts and laws. You need both understanding and action. And there is no question, I'm here today because of her example. I also want to recognize pioneers like Barbara Jordan and Shirley Chisholm, who sacrificed and struggled so that I and so many other women running for office could soar. I'm here because of friends and colleagues, like Donna Brazile, Reverend Leah Daugherty and Congresswoman Marcia Fudge — three black women who ran the Democratic National Convention in July. It was a great four days.\nIt goes to show that black women deserve more than a seat at the table. It's past time you had a fair chance to run the meeting. And let's be clear: I would not be the Demo-cratic nominee for President of the United States were it not for black women like all of you who made noise at the polls this year in support of our campaign -- who did surrogate events, went to barber shops and beauty salons and cafes, got on local radio and local TV to make the case. We've come far together.\nAnd as I said yesterday in North Carolina, I'm going to close my campaign the way I began my career all those years ago at the Children's Defense Fund, and the way that I will serve as your president should I have the great honor of being elected: I will be focused on opportunities for kids and fairness for families. The American people deserve something to vote for, not just against.\nAnd together -- together, we are going to make this a freer, fairer and stronger nation.\nWe're going to fight for the parents struggling to balance family and work and push for affordable child care, paid family leave, and yes, finally, equal pay for women.\nWe'll fight for the young girls who want a fair chance in life, which is why we'll make universal pre-k available so that every child -- no matter what they look like or where they live -- can rise up and be prepared to fulfill their academic destiny.\nWe are also going to do a lot to emphasize STEM education, particularly for girls and women, and I thank the agenda for making that a priority!\nWe'll fight for the entrepreneur who said that more businesses die in the parking lots of banks than anywhere else, which is why we're going to increase access to capital, and we are going to help African American women continue to represent the fastest growing segment of women-owned businesses in America right now.\nWe are going to invest in communities that have been left out and left behind. Urban reinvestment and restructuring that is going to give more people decent housing, access to jobs, the transportation to get to those jobs, rural communities that are too often ignored and denied the services they need. I am a fan of Jim Clyburn's '10-20-30' plan. I am going to do everything I can to push that forward.\nWe'll remember the pain of the Mothers of the Movement and fight for a criminal justice system that actually delivers justice and a future where everyone has respect for the law and is respected by the law. And we are going to pass common-sense reforms to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people and keep our communities safe.\nWe'll remember the families neglected in Flint and take action so that no child's life is ever put at risk again when brushing their teeth or drinking a glass of water at din-ner. We'll advocate for everyone concerned about their parents and grandparents as they age, and lift up caregivers and home care workers so older Americans can live in comfort and with dignity.\nAnd we're going to protect and enhance Social Security, which is the main source of income for older women. We'll stand-by-side to make sure that all of our rights are respected and protected – civil rights and women's rights, LGBT rights, worker's rights and, of course, voting rights.\nWe are coming together at a pivotal moment for our country. Now I do believe that every election is important. But this one feels different, doesn't it? That's because it is. The next 53 days will shape the next 50 years. The future of our children and grandchildren hangs in the balance.\nOn one hand, we have my opponent, Donald Trump, and in recent weeks, he's tried to restrain himself and clean up his image. But as Maya Angelou once said, 'When some-one shows you who they are, believe them the first time.' And we know who Donald is. For five years, he has led the birther movement to de-legitimize our first black president. His campaign was founded on this outrageous lie. There is no erasing it in history.\nJust yesterday, Trump again refused to say with his own words that the president was born in the United States. Donald's advisors had the temerity to say, 'He's doing the country a 'service' by pushing these lies.' No, he isn't. He's feeding into the worst im-pulses -- the bigotry and bias -- that lurks in our country.\nBarack Obama was born in America, plain and simple. And Donald Trump owes him and the American people an apology. So, my friends, there is no 'new' Donald Trump. There never will be. Donald Trump looks at President Obama after eight years as our president. He still doesn't see him as an American.\nThink of how dangerous that is. Imagine a person in the Oval Office who traffics in conspiracy theories and refuses to let them go – no matter what the facts are. Imagine someone who distorts the truth to fit a very narrow view of the world. Imagine a president who sees someone who doesn't look like him, and doesn't agree with him, and thinks, 'That person must not be a real American.'\nDonald Trump is unfit to be President of the United States. We cannot become insensitive to what he says and what he stirs up. We can't just accept this.We've got to stand up to it. If we don't, it won't stop.\nIn addition to the president, Donald Trump looks at a distinguished federal judge, born in Indiana, and he sees a Mexican, not an American. He looks at a Gold Star family and sees them as Muslims, not patriotic Americans. He looks at women and decides how our looks rate on a scale of one to 10. I look at America, I see everyone. I see our great diversity, which is one of our core strengths, not our burden. We know who Donald Trump is. Now it's time for our country to show who we are and reject his divisive vision.\nThat's why this election is so important. As Michelle Obama said at the Democratic Convention, 'When we go to the polls this November, the real choice isn't between a Democrat or Republican.' It's about who will have the power to shape our children's lives for the next four years. It's also about the kind of country we want to be, and what we want to leave behind for future generations.\nWe are at our best when every person gets to share in our nation's promise, contribute to its progress. 'Stronger Together' is not just our campaign slogan. It's the guiding principle for the future we need to build. So Americans, we need to ask themselves: Are we going to make our economy work for everyone or just for those at the top? Are we going to bring people together or pit Americans against each other and rip our country apart? Are we going to work with our allies to keep us safe or are we going to put a loose cannon in charge who would risk everything that generations of Americans have worked so hard to build?\nNow in many ways, the profound choice is up to the women in this room. African American women turned out to vote more than any other group of Americans in 2012. This year, once again, you have your hands on the wheel of history and you can write the next chapter of the American story.\nKeep up the great work with your Four for 4' campaign. Make sure we get as many people registered and then to the polls as we possibly can. People say to me all time, 'I just -- I don't know what to do about Trump and his supporters and the things he says and inciting violence and all of the terrible activities that are happening this election year.'\nWell, here's what we can do. Let's reject the cynicism, the bullying, the divisive rhetoric that my opponent uses to make us afraid of each other, afraid of our differences, afraid of our future. I know that all of us in this room are ready to stand up against this ... to rise up for our families, our communities, but most importantly, to show up at the polls this November.\nWith our power and strength, I know -- I believe this, or I would not be standing here before you, I would not have run again for president, I would not deal with all the in-coming brickbats that are hurled my way if I did not in my heart believe with every fiber of my being that together we can build a future where, yes, love trumps hate.\nThank you very much. Thank you.\"", "timestamp": "2016-09-16", "title": "Remarks to the Black Women's Agenda Symposium in Washington, D.C"}

It is so great to be in my second home, Florida, and in the city of Miami where I have so many wonderful friends and employees.\nNew polls have just come in, and we're leading in battleground states all over this country – including four points here in Florida. LA Times has us up 6 points nationwide.\nCome November 8th, we are going to win Florida and we are going to win the White House.\nIt's going to be a victory for the people – it's going to be a victory for the workers, the families, the Veterans, the everyday citizens.\nAnd it's going to be a victory for those who haven't had reason for hope in a long time.\nI'm campaigning in every community, and every part of this country, for every last vote. I am running to be a President for all Americans.\nI just had the most amazing afternoon in Little Haiti and I'm going to be campaigning hard for their votes. What incredible people.\nOur support comes from all regions, all backgrounds and all walks of life. You are cops and soldiers, carpenters and welders, accountants and lawyers, young and old, rich and poor, black, white and Hispanic – but above all else, you are American.\nJust today, I was honored to get the endorsement of recipients of the Medal of Honor and many of our amazing military leaders. We now have the endorsements of more than 160 top generals and Admirals.\nWe also have the support of 16,500 Border Patrol Officers – as well as law enforcement officers across the country.\nAnd we have the support of millions of patriotic Moms and Dads who go to work every day and make this country run.\nWhile my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you hardworking American patriots who love your family and love your country.\nClinton's campaign relies on the tired tactic of smearing opponents who question her policies as racists. It's the oldest play in the Democratic play book – and Americans have had enough.\nThey want solutions, and they want better lives – not more petty attacks from failed and discredited politicians.\nPeople who want their immigration laws enforced, and their borders secured, are not racists. They are patriotic Americans of all backgrounds who want their jobs and families protected.\nPeople who warn about Radical Islamic Terrorism are not Islamophobes. They are decent American citizens who want to uphold our tolerant values and keep our country safe.\nPeople who support the police, and who want crime reduced, are not prejudiced. They are concerned and loving citizens whose hearts break every time an innocent child is lost to preventable violence.\nYet, while she lives behind gates and walls and guards, and raises millions from hedge fund managers and Wall Street donors, she slanders and smears working people who just want a fraction of the security enjoyed by our politicians.\nHer comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as Secretary of State, hide and delete her emails, destroy her phones with a hammer, put classified information in the reach of our enemies, lie to Congress, and sell government favors and access through the Clinton Foundation.\nIt's the same attitude of arrogance and entitlement that explains why she has never taken accountability for the disasters she created in Libya, Syria, Iraq, Iran and all over the world. It's the same reason why she won't take responsibility for her central role in unleashing ISIS.\nHer policies have created disaster overseas, and poverty at home. I am running to reverse these failures, and create a New American future.\nThat future begins with prosperity at home.\nMy economic agenda can be summed up in three words: jobs, jobs, jobs.\nOne of my highest priorities is to bring jobs into our inner cities. African-Americans communities have suffered horribly as a result of failed Democratic leadership.\nDemocrats have run these inner cities for half a century. They control the mayors' offices, the school boards, the city councils, and the seats in Congress – and all they have delivered is more poverty, more crime, and more failing schools.\n45% of African-American children under the age of 6 now live in poverty. More than 3,000 have been shot in Chicago this year alone. 58% of African-American youth are not working.\nThese are the results of the policies embraced by Hillary Clinton, and everyone knows that if she's elected the inner cities will get nothing but more pain and more suffering.\nHillary Clinton has been there in Washington for 30 years – her disastrous record speaks for itself.\nThe only people she delivers for is her donors.\nI am going to deliver for you, the American people.\nIf we lower our taxes, remove destructive regulations, unleash the vast treasure of American energy, and negotiate trade deals that put America First, then there is no limit to the number of jobs we can create and the amount of prosperity we can unleash.\nMy first day in office, I am going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight years. All needless, job-killing regulations will be cancelled. Millions of new jobs will come pouring in.\nWe are going to lift the restrictions on American energy – which means at least another half a million new jobs a year.\nThat's just the beginning.\nAlso on my first day, I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare – this will instantly save another 2 million jobs.\nI am also going to completely reform our trade deals. We are going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to China, and keep America out of the TPP. We don't need another massive multinational deal that ties us up and binds us down.\nAnother major reform is going to be school choice. I've outlined a plan to provide every disadvantaged child in America the freedom to choose the private, public, magnet or religious school of his or her choice.\nThis will help lift millions of poor African-American and Hispanic children out of poverty.\nSince President Obama came into office, another 2 million Hispanic-Americans have fallen into poverty. This is unacceptable. To the Hispanic community I say: we are going to protect your jobs, we are going to build up your schools, and we are going to deliver safety and opportunity for your children.\nEarlier this week, I also rolled out a plan to help our mothers and our families get affordable, quality childcare for their children.\nOn policy after policy, we are going to provide opportunity, prosperity and security for all Americans.\nWe are also going to stand with the Cuban people in their fight against communist oppression.\nThe President's one-sided deal for Cuba benefits only the Castro Regime. But all of the concessions that Barack Obama has granted the Castro Regime were done through executive order, which means the next President can reverse them – and that is what I will do, unless the Castro Regime meets our demands. Those demands will include religious and political freedom for the Cuban people.\nLet's also talk about Venezuela.\nVenezuela is a beautiful, vibrant, and resource-rich country, filled with amazing and hardworking people. But Venezuela has been run into the ground by socialists.\nThe next President of the United States must stand in solidarity with all people oppressed in our hemisphere, and I will stand with the oppressed people of Venezuela yearning to be free.\nHere, in America, I will push to expand freedom for all of our people.\nI am going to lower you taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; I'm going to rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; I'm going to save your 2nd amendment; I'm going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country, and yes, we will build the wall and I'm going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, especially NAFTA – and we will make great trade deals that put the American worker first.\nWe will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.\nAmerican cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.\nAmerican steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.\nAmerican hands will rebuild this nation – and American energy, mined from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.\nWe will put new American steel into the spine of this country.\nI will fight for every neglected part of this nation – and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\nIt is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.\nJobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.\nOnce more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.\nWe Will Make America Prosperous Again.\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\nAnd Will Make America Great Again.\nThank you, and God Bless!", "timestamp": "2016-09-16", "title": "Remarks at a Rally at the James L.

{"author": "Michelle Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=120911", "text": "MR. WOODRUFF: Well, what an honor is it to be here today. I have a chance -- first of all, I want to tell both of you that my wife, who is also my commander --\nMRS. OBAMA: As it should be. (Laughter.)\nMR. WOODRUFF: -- she wanted to say hi to both of you and what you're doing for the veterans out there. I also want to mention, I just had a chance to -- and I had the chance to see President Bush at the Invictus Games, where it was such a clear indication of how absolutely committed he is to this. Certainly, Will Reynolds, who is an amazing person, who is out there winning everything -- and I had a chance to talk to President Bush about what he's doing. President Obama, too, of course -- he deeply committed to this.\nAnd it's interesting, I just talked to Mrs. Obama backstage here, that I had a chance to see him in Laos. And one of the topics there, of course, was what he thought about Vietnam and the war there. And Laos, of course, too. We've got a lot of undetonated bombs that are still in the ground there.\nAnd I asked him, all of those veterans, we looked at the time -- he and I were born August 1961, so he's two weeks older than me. We asked about that, what was going on. And we looked at war so differently back in the 1960s and the 1970s because there were drafts, and certainly we were not attacked on our turf leading into that war. And I said, those veterans that did serve there in Laos and Vietnam, do you call them heroes? And he said, absolutely, we call them heroes. This is not something reserved just for the more recent wars with voluntary wars.\nIn my experience here -- which, as Will said, one we never really expected, having been wounded in the wars -- we've experienced a lot of not diminishing attention, but now the wars really came to an end-ish, as they say, there's not as much attention that's being given to those that served in the country. And I'd love to hear from you what it's like to be in the White House and to have that kind of power and influence on an issue that is extremely important.\nMRS. BUSH: Well, I would say for sure one thing is worry. You worry in the White House when you know that there are troops in harm's way, and you think about them every single night when you get in bed. And there, where you're in the lap of luxury, really -- beautiful house where your sheets are changed every single day -- I mean, it really couldn't be more luxurious -- and you think when you get in bed about our troops are laying out on the ground somewhere. And so I would say that the main thing about having troops in harm's way when you live there is that you worry about them all the time, every single day.\nMRS. OBAMA: Well, and just we've had the honor and the experience to visit our wounded at Walter Reed and many military hospitals. And that is a sobering experience. I mean, one of the things that Barack and I have talked about is that when we first came into office, the first term, our visits would last for hours because there would be 25, 50, 75 folks that we'd be seeing, going room to room, many with devastating injuries. And now, today, just last week he went to visit, and he was there for 30 minutes, because there are fewer of our men and women who are being injured in war. And that feels good. I mean, that's something that a Commander-in-Chief thinks about before they pop off about going to war. Because when you've spent time on a base and you know these men and women, and you know their families, you don't just talk about war like there are no implications. It's serious business, and lives are changed forever.\nSo I would hope that any Commander-in-Chief that would have the privilege of serving would understand that these are real lives and real families that are impacted.\nMR. WOODRUFF: When there is a story that does come out of somebody, or maybe a large group, the significant injuries in the war -- is it long conversations that you have with the President, with your husband, that night?\nMRS. BUSH: After visiting at Walter Reed or whatever, yeah, sure. I mean, we'll talk about them and think about those families. In many cases, the families were there with them, around them. There's one injured warrior that I know who now we still see who had such a severe head injury.\nMRS. OBAMA: He was at the Invictus Games.\nMRS. BUSH: We didn't think we would ever see him again; that that would be it. And he's one of the warriors that George has painted. And he painted him with this scar in his head that he has still, but with his little child on his lap. Because what a lot of warriors will say is that their families are what saw them through. One couple that George painted -- he painted him, a portrait of him, but he painted his wife with him, because this man said his wife was always there, always with him. And he had also suffered a head injury, where he needed the help that she could get him. He's doing great now. But George didn't just do his portrait by himself, but painted her in it because he credited her with his recovery.\nMRS. OBAMA: You know, Bob, I just wanted -- meeting our servicemembers, spending time on military bases, fundamentally changes who you are as a civilian. And I know that was true for me, because when we -- I was like most Americans. I had limited connection to the military community, and it wasn't until Barack's campaign in 2008 that I started meeting military spouses and hearing their voices, voices that you don't hear in regular conversation. And we talked about all the challenges that working mothers had -- financial worries, worrying about raising your kids. But with these women mostly, there were the worries of multiple deployments, understanding that these families are moving their kids every two years in service of their country, worrying about whether there are adequate special-ed programs in the schools they're moving to. And doing all of this with a grace and a pride that would -- that blew me away.\nAnd that's one of the reasons why I'm such an advocate for this community. I wish every American had an opportunity to sit down, to go to a base, to meet with families, to meet with servicemembers, to sit down with our veterans -- because we would think differently about our challenges as individuals. Let me tell you, it makes me inspired to work harder. Because I think, as Laura said, here we are sitting in the White House; we have no reason to complain when we have 1 percent of our country serving and sacrificing for the rights and freedoms for the rest of us.\nSo that has been a profound opportunity for me, and one of the reasons why I will always champion these men and women and their families as long as I can breathe.\nMR. WOODRUFF: It's interesting that -- I'd like to talk about children, too, because both of you had the chance to have your kids live with you there in the White House, and both of you during times of war. I should mention also real quickly that -- I didn't hear the full introduction, but Will Reynolds also has four kids. And he's gone through what he's gone. And it gives you a certain amount of different perspective on thing if you do have a child who's in the midst of something significant, and I would say most times moving, emotional, maybe even difficult.\nBut during these times, for both of you, what was it like when you had kids there when this was happening, and knowing very well that the Commander-in-Chief was the one ultimately responsible for this, and probably you're the first ones that they turned to?\nMRS. BUSH: Well, I think back -- Barbara and Jenna were freshmen in college when we moved to the White House. So they didn't live there. They'd been there, of course, so much -- and their grandparents --\nMR. WOODRUFF: There were invited to come. (Laughter.)\nMRS. BUSH: Yeah. (Laughter.) They were invited to come. But they had been there as seven-year-olds when their grandparents moved there. So they knew the White House just like we did, because they visited them so often. But when I wrote my book and look back through my schedule, I saw that right after September 11th, the weekend after September 11th, that Barbara and Jenna came home to the White House. And I knew that they came home because they wanted to be with their dad, and they wanted to be with us. And they felt great insecurity, really, off at the University of Texas and off at Yale, freshmen, after the attacks. And they wanted to be there with him.\nAnd then I noticed that a month or a month and a half after that, our childhood friends from Midland, Texas came. And I knew that those boys -- men that we knew as boys -- wanted to be with George; that they just wanted to be there with him. And I think that is really -- no one talked about war. That wasn't the conversation. The conversation was, we just want to be with you. And I think that's really important, and I think that's the way the children are too. You don't want them to be worried about decisions their father makes. You want them to just feel the security and love that every parent wants their children to feel.\nMRS. OBAMA: You just want home to be home. And you want that for the President, because they need that refuge with all that they handle over the course of a day. You want them to come up on that elevator, come on to the second floor when they open those doors to the residence, and they can breathe. They don't need kids hammering them with, \"Dad, why don't you do this?\" (Laughter.) Sometimes Malia and Sasha will do that. It's like, every now and then at dinner it's like, what were you thinking? (Laughter.)\nBut for the most part, home is home. And that helps keep kids normal. I've said this time and again: My greatest concern coming into the White House was making sure my girls came out whole and normal, and decent and kind, just like I would expect them to if we were living on the South Side of Chicago. And it takes work to keep White House life normal for the kids.\nMRS. BUSH: When is it normal?\nMRS. OBAMA: It's not normal. (Laughter.) You know, we pretend --\nMRS. BUSH: -- slumber party with 30 friends.\nMRS. OBAMA: Oh, my goodness. And you try to pretend like it's normal. It's like, yeah, yeah, just ignore the guys with the guns. (Laughter.) I remember one parent-teacher conference at the lower school, and Barack went, and there were SWAT guys on top of the roof of the school. And Malia was like, \"Dad, really? Really?\" (Laughter.) \"Do they really have to be up there?\" And it's like, yeah, honey, they do. Let's just keep walking. Just keep going. Just keep going.\nMR. WOODRUFF: But they've got to put up with that even after they leave. There's going to be security --\nMRS. OBAMA: Well, the security -- it's different for\nMRS. BUSH: It's a different level.\nMRS. OBAMA: It's a different level. So we don't want to talk about it too much, but it's not the same as what it will be for the former President and the former First Lady. And they're all singing, \"Hey, we're out of here, and we get to ditch our agents pretty soon!\" (Laughter.) But it's a different level of security.\nMR. WOODRUFF: I'm really hoping that my four kids actually get back to normal when I leave ABC News. (Laughter.) Is that going to happen, too? But after I was hit, though, I had to tell my little kids -- I said, all right, there's a new rule, I'm not going to go cover wars anymore. So now I'm over in Asia reporting. So I said, well, I can at least do stories about conflict. Conflict is not war.\nWe spoke about the -- both of you have accomplished so much. Military Service Initiative, of course, which was your, Mrs. Bush. And of course, Joining Forces, that you worked on, as well. And both of you have worked together, I think, better than most. I mean, I think somebody said that you should tell the husbands to behave themselves compared to the others.\nBut what have you accomplished? More or less than you expected in terms of what you're doing for those veterans? And when I talk about veterans, I'm not just talking about those wounded in the wars. About 25 percent are considering to have been wounded. The rest have gone out with transitions when they come back, some to a new civilian world. But what have you done for them that's the most important, and is it more than you expected? Or less?\nMRS. BUSH: Well, I think in general there there's just a feeling that people support that military and that it starts at the top. And it's very different, as you said, from Vietnam, when Vietnam -- my generation, when they came home from war, were spit upon. And that's not the way it is now. And I think that's really great. I hope that our returning veterans really feel the gratefulness and the support of the American public.\nAnd I know -- you know this too, Bob; you're talking about it -- the thousands of veteran support groups, little mom-and-pop groups that have sprung up all over the United States because people do want to support our returning vets. And the other thing we should look at is what an asset they are. There have been 2.5 million post-9/11 vets. And I think about another million will be transitioning out in the next year or so. And think about the asset that is for our country. These people who chose to serve, who volunteered to serve, and now they want to come home. And it's up to us, the rest of us, to figure out how we can help them keep serving in our communities and make a life with themselves that they're happy with, and deal with the trauma that a lot of them have, the trauma of war.\nMRS. OBAMA: The thing I've been most pleased about with Joining Forces is that it's really been a call to partnership with all sectors -- corporate sector, with our faith communities, with our schools, our educators, our medical community. And what we have seen is that when you ask, people step up without hesitation. And that's the power of our platforms, is that a lot of times, if Laura or I ask for help, people are very receptive. The business community has created millions of jobs for our veterans and our military spouses because of an ask that we made -- millions of jobs, helping them get the training to be able to retain those jobs and to advance within those jobs. And the same is true for military spouses, as well.\nWe've been pleased with our local leaders who have answered the call to end veterans homelessness, which was part of our call with Joining Forces. The notion that we have even one single veteran living on the streets should be just considered a travesty to all of us. Well, there are many mayors, some governors, some states, who have essentially eliminated veterans homelessness because they've answered that call.\nThe Hollywood community has stepped up. We work closely with writers and producers who have helped to develop plotlines that involve our military families, our military community. Because part of integrating those stories into everyday life helps to normalize these men and women and their families, and familiarize the rest of the civilian community with those issues in sort of a non-preachy way.\nSo I've just been pleased --\nMR. WOODRUFF: You've done your entertaining, as well. I think it was two days ago you were on Ellen DeGeneres, weren't you -- at CVS?\nMRS. OBAMA: Well, we weren't talking about veterans. I don't know what she was doing. (Laughter.)\nMR. WOODRUFF: What is the purpose of that? You've been on television shows. You've been on --\nMRS. OBAMA: Well, usually, when we do an appearance, Ellen -- you sort of try to make things fun, because my motto is, you get people to laugh and then you can get them to listen.\nMR. WOODRUFF: That is mandatory with her, yes.\nMRS. OBAMA: Yeah, and with most Americans. I think people respond differently when there's a little humor, and people feel like you're opening -- you're making yourself vulnerable. Then you seem less like the First Lady and more like a neighbor, a friend. But what we were able to do on her show was really to highlight a number of initiatives, including the work we've been doing with Healthy Eating, and the work that Steph Curry has been doing.\nWe had Bradley Cooper on to highlight 22Kill. Bradley Cooper, for example, has been a tremendous support around the issue of military health for our veterans and our servicemembers. And Bradley is kind of cute -- (laughter) -- and he's a little distracting. But if you stop and listen to what he said on Ellen -- he was promoting the importance of ensuring that the suicide rates among our military members is reduced. And in order to do something about it, you have to know that it's a problem.\nSo people are watching Ellen. They're not always watching the nightly news, I'm sorry.\nMR. WOODRUFF: Except ABC, of course. (Laughter.)\nMRS. OBAMA: Except ABC, of course.\nMR. WOODRUFF: Just wanted to make sure you knew that.\nMRS. OBAMA: But our view is, we got to reach people there they are and to tell these stories.\nMR. WOODRUFF: But humor works. I know that we've seen this before. Nobody wants to talk seriously all the time, for those that have been hit. Humor is a great one. My wife always tells me I got rocks in my head -- which kind of technically is the case.\nMRS. OBAMA: You had those before, right? (Laughter.) I'm just -- I'm just speaking for her.\nMR. WOODRUFF: Oh, you spoke to her, did you? (Laughter.) That is correct. Of course, I use my aphasia when she asks me to go clean the garage. And I said, what is a \"garage\"? I don't even know what it. (Laughter.) But that works extremely well.\nSo much has been done -- I know that in our experience, that early when the wars began well more than a decade ago, is we concentrate on those that come back on recovering to get out of the hospital and get the best treatment that they can. But also, the next step was to figure out a way to let them get back into their civilian world when they return to their community. And then of course the next one was jobs. And I think that the number -- this may be right -- is that I think that the rate of unemployment with the veterans now is lower than the civilian numbers, the rate for unemployment. (Applause.)\nThe other one, Mrs. Bush, was -- and I know this is one of your concentrations, too, which is exactly what we've been learning over time -- which is, I think most of the attention was largely to those that were visibly wounded. And now we have to realize there's a lot that are invisible. And why is that you pursuing that now is one of your major concentrations?\nMRS. BUSH: Well, because that is really one of the most long-lasting effects of being in trauma like that. And so one of the things that George has done with both the bike rides and the golf is, a lot of people recover from those invisible wounds if they're playing a sport. They can do it with a sport. And so those are two things he's done. And, of course, that's the whole idea behind Invictus, and that is to have a sport to go to, to get over those invisible wounds.\nBut another thing -- when I moved back to Texas, with a group of people I grew up with, we founded a conservation group called Texas By Nature. And we just hosted a conference on Monday at Houston Methodist Hospital in Houston about the benefits of being outside for mental health. And one of the people that spoke was a colonel who suffered from PTS, about how being outside, just even being able to see green -- there's research, not a lot of research, that proves it. But they say that if you just go outside some.\nAnd one of the researchers that talked, talked about this problem that a lot of people have where they ruminate over a problem. He called it rumination. And you spend a lot of time where something is going through your mind and going through your mind. And it's really even bad for your brain because you start to produce also of cortisol. And of course, that's what PTS can be, where you go through your mind the trauma, and you see your best friend being shot over and over and over. And to be able to get out of that, to be able to go outside and get out of it, or use a sport or some other way to get out of it, is very helpful with post-traumatic stress.\nThe other thing that George has tried to do is take the disorder -- the \"d\" out of the PTS. It's an injury; it's not a disorder. And if people are -- if they're diagnosed with a disorder, then they think it hurts them, that they won't be able to get a job if they have a disorder. But you can improve from an injury.\nMRS. OBAMA: And that's the work that we need to do around mental health and how the military can be so helpful. Because mental health affects all Americans. One in five Americans is dealing with some kind of mental health diagnosis. And the challenge that we face is there is still a stigma. So people are not -- they don't feel good about identifying and getting the help that they need. Sometimes it's viewed as weakness. And when you think about that, it's ludicrous. Like Laura said, it's an illness. Could you ever imagine claiming that a cancer patient seeking chemotherapy as somehow being weak? Or you would tell somebody with a heart disease to just toughen up. But that's sort of where mental health is.\nAnd our military can play a big role in changing the conversation around mental health for the entire country. Because we know these men and women are heroes. We know that they're brave. We understand what's happened. And if they can be brave enough to step up and get the help they need, perhaps that will help some kid in some community who's depressed and maybe thinking about suicide. Maybe the research that is happening for our veterans and wounded warriors can be translated --\nMRS. BUSH: Can help everybody.\nMRS. OBAMA: Exactly. Can help everybody.\nAnd that's one of the reasons, with Joining Forces, we've been working with something called The Campaign to Change Direction. And the goal there is to help the rest of the nation understand the five signs that they need to look out for when somebody has mental health, sort of like CPR training or training for use of a defibrillator. Yeah, that thing.\nBut everyone should be aware -- employers, teachers, educators -- so that when you see the signs, you know how to identify them and you can find the resources to get that person the help they need. And this is true for many military spouses, as well. It's not just the servicemembers. I mean, the stresses of being a caregiver, the stresses of being that spouse that is dealing with four kids while their spouse is deployed -- I mean, we have to make sure that these individuals feels like they can reach out when they need help and that they're not drowning all alone.\nSo this is one of the many ways that the work that we do with the military community can be translated into positive impacts for the rest of the society.\nMR. WOODRUFF: And I was going to ask you right before you said it, about PTS versus post-traumatic stress disorder. There was a movement that developed over time -- exactly that. Because there was this stigma. When you talk about employment and just getting back to your world, is that that was one that people didn't understand and they were not going to hire somebody with one they cannot identify. And that has changed over time. I think the number of stigmas has really dropped down.\nMRS. BUSH: But it really is important for people who are suffering in any way to reach out, for the veteran as well as for the family. And veterans are slow to say, I need help. They are tough. They pride themselves on it. And they don't want to jeopardize their chances of getting the job by saying, I need help. So I think there are a lot of ways. I've seen some ads, actually, on television about talking. One man told George about seeing his best friend shot next to him, and he said he couldn't get it out of his mind. And then he wrote him a letter afterwards, and he said, you know, I've never told anyone that. And George said, you waited until you told your former Commander-in-Chief, and you haven't told anyone else? Because those are things people need to be able to talk about. They need to have somebody that listens to them and that they can talk about and tell is, because that's how you slowly get over it.\nMR. WOODRUFF: You know, you mentioned identification. Anyway, I want to talk about spouses. You mentioned spouse again, and children, because that's another one that -- so many times we have heard this, especially early on in our world of the wounded, and all -- whether wounded or not -- is that the ones that don't get any attention or credit is the spouses, whether it's a man or woman, a husband or a wife. Those that served are the ones that get all the attention. And that's changing over time. And a lot of it is what you two are doing.\nMRS. OBAMA: Yeah, I've had so much fun working with military spouses. You talk about highly skilled servicemembers. I mean, military spouses, they are smart, they're resilient, they are multitaskers. Amazing -- to the tee. They are great spokespeople. They are great managers. They're great leaders. But many of them have had their careers disrupted because they're supporting a spouse. When you're moving every two years, how do you keep up with your job? One of the issues that we worked on with Joining Forces was military spousal licensing. So you imagine that you have a job that requires any kind of license -- even an aesthetician or a social worker, you name it. If you moved to a base in another state, there was no reciprocity. So a lot of military spouses had to go through hours of retraining, spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to get recertified just to work in their profession.\nMR. WOODRUFF: Is that nurses, too, doctors?\nMRS. OBAMA: It involved any job with a license. There was no reciprocity. At the start of Joining Forces, that was one of our key issues. And we put a call out to all the governors. We has one of the first meeting at one of the governors conferences. And we were like, hey, come on, people, you can do this. And it was one of those things where a lot of the governors didn't realize their states didn't have reciprocity. They just hadn't thought about it.\nSo slowly we started to see state legislators. Because this is one of these -- this is like a no-brainer, nonpartisan issue. This is a win-win. Just get it done. Well, from start until now, we now finally have all 50 states who have military spousal licensing reciprocity going. (Applause.)\nBut we would have never known that had we not had the conversations with these men and women, to hear their challenges, to see what they were going through, to find out what kind of things we could do on the ground. I mean, what would change their lives? And this is just one of them. And to talk about the military kids -- I mean, the challenges of moving a kid, finding the right programs. If you've got a great special-ed program that your kid is in, and you're moving to another base, you don't know if that school is going to have that same program.\nSo the level of advocacy and research, the skill that it takes to be a military spouse, to be able to get your kid -- to keep your kid on track. If any parents out here -- you just think about your kids and what it takes to get them from kindergarten to twelfth grade sanely, in one school. The average military kid attends seven, eight, nine, ten schools in their entire primary and secondary school education. And these kids are still graduating on time. They are still at the top of their class. They are still amazing. But there is a parent at home that's doing a lot of heavy lifting to make that happen, a lot of advocating. And one of Jill's initiatives has been working -- Jill Biden, my partner in Joining Forces, a Blue Star mom in her own right -- has been working with the education community on a range of these issues, as well.\nSo there's so much that we need to know about the challenges that military families face. They are holding up this country just as much as the men and women who are serving on those front lines. And they're just as proud and just at reticent to complain or ask for help. So it's up to us to step up for them.\nMR. WOODRUFF: So that's why your President won the second term? So he didn't have to move the kids? (Laughter.)\nMRS. OBAMA: (Laughter.) The reason he won was that he wanted to make sure that his teenage girls had agents through high school. (Laughter and applause.) Men with guns. That was a great motivator.\nMR. WOODRUFF: My kids -- my wife and I moved to 10 different cities. And my son, by the time he was 11, it was his eighth city, and I wasn't even in the military. So at least I had some way to relate to it.\nMRS. OBAMA: Was that the rocks in your head thing that happened? No, just kidding.\nMR. WOODRUFF: How many times are you going to say that? (Laughter.) Okay, it's true.\nThe other thing that's interesting to talk about -- First Ladies and the history, to see Cokie talk about it and great historians to talk about this -- is that if you compare to what you're doing now as First Ladies, compared to what the First Ladies did before, it would be interesting to see in history some of them went to the war zones and worked, or dealt with those that came back; one almost physically with the blood. But the number of hours that you put into it, if you compared them, what do you think? Is it just much more unending in terms of the participation by First Ladies in all this?\nMRS. BUSH: I think First Ladies have been pretty active forever, always.\nMRS. OBAMA: Yes, just think Eleanor Roosevelt. Drop the mic on that one. (Laughter.)\nMRS. BUSH: They used to think -- well, they thought this about Lady Bird Johnson, isn't that sweet that she likes flowers? (Laughter.) The First Lady likes flowers. And she was really one of the very first conservationists that talked about using native plants.\nMR. WOODRUFF: So that takes us then to the next step, which is -- I know, Mrs. Bush, you're always doing this well after you left. What are you going to do when you go? What's going to be your priority in terms of all the work? You've done everything many, many initiatives even other than the veterans one. And I'm not going to ask you which one is going to be -- what you're going to concentrate on the most. But how do you really think you will be involved in this as time goes by? Do you think this is going to be for the rest of your life for both of you?\nMRS. OBAMA: Yes, absolutely. What else are we going to do? (Laughter.)\nMRS. BUSH: The fact is you really have a podium, really, always. People still listen to Barbara Bush, don't you think? I certainly do. (Laughter and applause.)\nQ: Do you obey her? (Laughter.)\nMRS. BUSH: So it's a really wonderful. It's just great for us to be able to have the opportunity to contribute to things and do things and keep working on what we're -- and these are all issues that don't ever -- you never get to just rub your hands. We took care of that.\nMRS. OBAMA: Right, that's right. And say, done, finished.\nMRS. BUSH: They're all things that you have to work on -- literacy or whatever, forever.\nMR. WOODRUFF: I know you mentioned. Go ahead --\nMRS. OBAMA: No, I was just going to say to do this, you have to have a strong public service bone sort of built in you. A And I know that's true for me. It's true for my husband. Long before he ran for office, we left corporate law. And we were working with kids and mentoring. He was a community organizer. I worked for the city government. That's sort of what you do. And you don't stop because there's always something to do. So I can't imagine that I'll leave here and really kick my feet up and say, oh, well, good luck with that.\nMRS. BUSH: Well, you will a little bit. (Laughter.)\nMRS. OBAMA: I'll do that a little bit. You're right. Yes.\nMR. WOODRUFF: What's going to be your hobby? Mrs. Bush, you told me that President Bush is now taking painting on as one of his main things, and I think we're going to get a book in Wednesday, I mean in March, sorry -- I would like you to have it on Wednesday day. (Laughter.) But we'll have it then. Did he did* a great painting of you?\nMRS. BUSH: No. (Laughter.) He was not successful in a painting of me.\nMRS. OBAMA: Oh no.\nMRS. BUSH: But he has painted portraits of wounded warriors that he's gotten to know and has a book coming out in March with their portraits, and then he wrote their stories.\nMR. WOODRUFF: And he's donating all the profit --\nMRS. BUSH: Yeah, the profits go to the military service initiative.\nMR. WOODRUFF: -- to my foundation. (Laughter.) I was just joking about that.\nMRS. BUSH: I mean, there is life after the White House -- not quite as luxurious. Believe in me, no new sheets every day. (Laughter.)\nMRS. OBAMA: That's okay. (Laughter.)\nMR. WOODRUFF: So then we're going to have a brand new administration coming very soon. You can't win any more terms, it's not Roosevelt anymore.\nMRS. OBAMA: That's fine. (Laughter.)\nMR. WOODRUFF: Your kids are going to have to move and do something. But what -- do you have some advice to the next First Lady or First Gentleman that comes into the White House about how to deal with initiatives, generally, but largely for operating out of the White House. I know there's a lot of remarkable organizations that are doing so much for the veterans. They have a chance to go and they visit the White House and it changes their attitude a lot. But is there anything specifically that you would tell to the next --\nMRS. OBAMA: I would hope that, as with previous administrations, that this next administration will prioritize our servicemembers, our veterans, and our families. It should be high on the list. I mean, there is something that everyone can do to support this community, but the Commander-in-Chief, the First Family, the Second Family, the Vice President -- they have an obligation to set that tone -- I think Laura said that earlier. With this platform, you can raise the bar high on this issue. So I would hope that this responsibility comes with the house, and that every administration will try to top the next one in what they do for these men and women. Whatever you call it, whether it's Joining Forces or you name it something else, but the work of making sure that this country never forgets the service and sacrifice, particularly when it comes to our Gold Star families, that we hold them in our hearts, that we don't just honor them with words but we do things that impact their lives. As much as Laura and I have done, there's still so much work to be done, everything is not fixed. So there's plenty for the next administration to do and I think -- I would urge all of our veteran's organizations -- our Blue Star moms, our Gold Star families, everyone -- to keep the pressure on the next administration. Hold them accountable. Ask the same important questions that you've asked of these presidencies to make sure that we never go back to the time of Vietnam War, where a veteran comes home and they're afraid to even identify as a servicemember.\nI'll never forget -- when I realized we were having an impact was the time we went to a VA center and there was a gentleman, Mr. Black, who came up after our conversation about what was going on at the VA center, we had highlighted it, and he said, you know, I have never been more proud to be a veteran than now. He said, I used to never tell anybody that I was a veteran because I never knew what their reaction would be. And he said, now, every day, I don't leave the house without something that identifies me as a veteran because I don't care where I am, people are going to stop me, they thank me. They say, thank you for your service, we're so proud of you. He said, now I don't leave the house without something that identifies me as a veteran.\nAnd that just -- that warmed my heart. And that's something we have to think about for all these men and women who are going to be transitioning. Our women veterans -- there will be more and more women veterans out there. We have to hold them up and let them know that we're grateful.\nMRS. BUSH: And a lot of the Vietnam vets now will also be coming back to go into the VA because they're the age to do that, and some of them may have injuries, brain injuries, that were never really identified before. So we'll start to see I think a big number of Vietnam vets now coming into the VA hospitals.\nMR. WOODRUFF: Right, and I think people just assume there's really no battles going on, but we're going all over the world with more conflicts and more special ops and CIA and underground kind of operations. That's going to continue for a long time. And hopefully we're not going to have another major war again.\nBut sometimes I say -- this is a little bit maybe too emotional about it, but I never looked back about -- the good thing about getting blown up, if there is such a thing, is that it's been so satisfying, so fulfilling to have this relationship with a group of Americans who have served and have done so much, partly because they volunteered, my own 25-year-old son and my 22-year-old daughter don't have to join the military unless they really want to.\nBut how has that been for you? I know this as well -- to some degree, it's an obvious answer to it, but have you ever cried much?\nMRS. OBAMA: Oh, God, yes. I cry all the time. But it's more tears of pride. I am moved by this community -- moved deeply. Because when we talk about pride of country, when we talk about citizenship, when we talk about all the things we want -- we want a strong defense, we want to beat back terrorism -- all of this is resting on the shoulders of this one community. As I said, 1 percent of the country who is stepping up to serve to protect the freedoms of us all. And we can't just talk strong defense if we're not taking care of these men and women -- not just during their service, but after.\nSo, yes, I do get emotional. I get emotional when I see a young man with all his limbs blown off at Walter Reed, and I see a young family sitting there. And I wonder, what are they going to do? And then a few months later, I see that young man with his prosthetics and the next month, I see him walking, and then next year, you see him competing in the Invictus Games. It clutches your heart in a way that you can't imagine.\nWe've been able to follow those journeys, to watch people go from traumatic injury to victory. And there is a strength and a power to that, that you just can't --\nMRS. BUSH: And just a resilience of people and of America -- our whole country. I think it's very -- we're so lucky to live where we live.\nMR. WOODRUFF: Which is another reason why it's so important for you to concentrate on the invisible wounds, too, because our medicine advancement -- I'm actually working on an hour for PBS about this, about how medicine -- that's been another thing about the war, is that one of the positive aspects of it is medical advancement.\nSo now the civilian world of medicine is now saving lives never before. People say if I was hit five years before I was hit, I would not be living right now. But it does create other invisible wounds that last forever. So it's going to need even more, and that's one thing you're going to concentrate on when you go, which is remarkable.\nI want to thank both of you for what you're doing. I haven't sadly done the research of how much previous First Ladies have done for the veterans. I know that we have brand-new wars that were sort of after the Cold War before, but you have really, again, you've done more than anybody expected and your influence has been remarkable.\nSo I just want to thank you personally, and I think from everybody here, for doing what you're doing. (Applause.)", "timestamp": "2016-09-16", "title": "Remarks by First Lady Michelle Obama and Former First Lady Laura Bush in a Discussion with Bob Woodruff at the National Archives"}
{"author": "Michelle Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=120912", "text": "MRS. OBAMA: Hey! (Applause.) How are you guys doing? Wow! Thank you, guys. Look at you. My goodness. (Laughter.) Oh, my goodness. Well, listen, let's started here. You guys have been standing up for a while, right? (Applause.) So let's start talking about some stuff.\nFirst of all, let me just say I am thrilled to be here today to support the next President and Vice President of the United States -- Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine! (Applause.) Yes!\nI have to do a few thank-yous before we go in. I want to thank Henry for that wonderful introduction, for sharing his story. I want to thank all the members of Congress who are here today. Representatives Bobby Scott, Gerry Connolly. And I also want to recognize our outstanding DNC Chair, Donna Brazile. (Applause.) I hear she lit it up, right? And I want to thank Charity for her fabulous remarks. (Applause.) And of course, I have to recognize another great First Lady of Virginia, right here, Dorothy McAuliffe, who is here. So glad that she could join us. And, of course, to all of you, our students of George Mason University! Look at you all. (Applause.)\nNow, let me say, it is so hard to believe that it is less than two months to Election Day, and that my family is almost at the end of our time in the White House.\nAUDIENCE: Noo!\nMRS. OBAMA: Yeah, it's almost time. And let me say -- I have to say --\nAUDIENCE: Four more years! Four more years!\nMRS. OBAMA: No -- no. (Laughter.) Let me say this: You have me and Barack working on your behalf for the rest of our lives. So no need to worry. (Applause.) We're going to be here.\nBut let me just tell you, this time is really bittersweet for me. It's a time of real transition for me and Barack and our girls. My husband is going to need a new job. (Laughter.) I'm going to have to find a job. We're going to be moving to a new home, so we'll have to pack. We got to get the old house cleaned up so we can get our security deposit back. (Laughter.)\nBut in all seriousness, this isn't just a time of transition for my family -- but for our entire country -- as we decide who our next President will be. And transitions like this can be difficult. They involve a lot of uncertainty. And we saw that in 2008 when Barack was first elected.\nI don't know if many of you were old enough to remember -- (laughter) -- you remember? But back then, people had all kinds of questions about what kind of President Barack would be. Things like, does he really understand us? Will he protect us? And then, of course, there were those who questioned -- and continued to question for the past eight years, up through this very day -- whether my husband was even born in this country.\nAUDIENCE: Booo --\nMRS. OBAMA: Well, during his time in office, I think Barack has answered those questions with the example he's set -- by going high when they go low. (Applause.) And he's answered these questions with the progress that we've achieved together, progress like bringing health care to 20 million people. (Applause.) Creating 15 million private sector jobs. Helping millions of young people, like all of you, afford college. (Applause.) Expanding LGBT rights and marriage equality, marriage equality is now the law of the land.\nAnd we just learned that, last year, the typical household income rose by $2,800 -- (applause) -- which, by the way, is the largest one-year jump on record. (Applause.) And 3.5 million people were lifted out of poverty. That's the biggest one-year decrease in poverty in nearly 50 years. (Applause.) You hear me? All right.\nBut even after all this progress, it's understandable that folks are feeling a little uncertain as we face the next transition. So the question is, for all of you and all of us, for the nation, is: How do we sort through all the negativity and the name-calling in this election, and choose the right person to lead our country forward?\nWell, as someone who's seen the presidency up close and personal, here's what I've learned about this job. First and foremost, this job is hard. Okay? This is the highest-stakes, most 24/7 job you can possibly imagine. The issues that cross a President's desk are never easy, none of them. They're never black and white.\nI mean, just think about the crises this President has faced these last eight years. In his first term alone, Barack had to rescue our economy from the worst crisis since the Great Depression. He had to make the call to take out Osama bin Laden. (Applause.) He had to work to stop millions of gallons of oil that were gushing into our Gulf Coast. He had to respond to devastating natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and so much more.\nSo when it comes to the qualifications we should demand in a President -- to start with, we need someone who is going to take this job seriously; someone who will study and prepare so that they understand the issues better than anyone else on their team. And we need someone not with good judgement, but with superb judgment in their own right. Because a President can hire the best advisors on Earth, but let me tell you, five advisors will give five different opinions. And the President, and the President alone, is always the one to make the final call. Believe me.\nWe also need someone who is steady and measured, because when you're making life or death, war or peace decisions, a President can't just pop off. (Applause.) Finally, we need someone who's compassionate, who's unifying force, someone who will be a role model for our kids; someone who's not just in this for themselves, but for the good of this country. See, at the end of the day, as I've said before, the presidency doesn't change who you are -- it reveals who you are. (Applause.) And the same thing is true of a presidential campaign.\nSo if a candidate is erratic and threatening, if a candidate traffics in prejudice, fear and lies on the trail, if a candidate has no clear plans to implement their goals, if they disrespect their fellow citizens, including folks who have made extraordinary sacrifices for our country -- let me tell you, that is who they are. That is the kind of President they will be. Trust me, a candidate is not going to suddenly change once they get into office. Just the opposite, in fact. Because the minute that individual takes that oath, they are under the hottest, harshest light there is, and there is no way to hide who they really are.\nAnd at that point, it's too late. They're the leader of the world's largest economy, the Commander-in-Chief of the most powerful military force on Earth. With every word they utter, they can start wars, crash markets, change the course of this planet.\nSo who in this election is truly ready for this job? Who do we pick? Well, for me, I'm just saying -- it is excruciatingly clear that there is only one person in this election we can trust with those responsibilities, only one person with the qualifications and the temperament for that job. And that is our friend, Hillary Clinton. (Applause.)\nWe know that Hillary is the right person because we've seen her character and commitment -- not just on the trail, but over the course of her entire life. We've seen her dedication to public service; how after law school, she chose to be an advocate for kids with disabilities. She fought for children's health care as First Lady, for quality childcare as a Senator.\nAnd when she didn't win the presidency in 2008, she didn't throw in the towel. She once again answered the call to serve, keeping us safe as our Secretary of State. And let me tell you, Hillary has the resilience that it takes to do this job. See, because when she gets knocked down, she doesn't complain or cry foul. No, she gets right back up, and she comes back stronger for the people who need her the most.\nAnd here is what is also true -- and I want you all to think about this. Hillary is one of the few people on this entire planet -- and clearly the only person in this race -- who has any idea what this job entails, who has seen it from every angle. Hear me: the staggering stakes, the brutal hours, the overwhelming stresses. And here's the thing -- she still wants to take it on. (Applause.) See, because she believes that she has an obligation to use her talents to help as many people as possible. That is why she's running.\nNow, let me tell you, that is what dedication looks like. That is what love of country looks like. So when I hear folks saying they don't feel inspired in this election -- well, let me tell you, I disagree. I am inspired. Because for eight years, I have had the privilege to see what it takes to actually do this job.\nAnd here's what I absolutely know for sure -- listen to this: Right now, we have an opportunity to elect one of the most qualified people who has ever endeavored to become president. (Applause.) Hillary has been a lawyer, a law professor, First Lady of Arkansas, First Lady of the United States, a U.S. Senator, Secretary of State. Do you hear me? (Applause.)\nSee, that's why I'm inspired by Hillary. I'm inspired by her persistence and her consistency, by her heart and her guts. And I'm inspired by her lifelong record of public service. No one in our lifetime has ever had as much experience and exposure to the presidency -- not Barack; not Bill -- as he would say, nobody. And, yes, happens to be a woman. (Applause.)\nSo we cannot afford to squander this opportunity, particularly given the alternative. Because here is what we know -- that being President isn't anything like reality TV. (Applause.) It's not about sending insulting tweets or making fiery speeches. It's about whether or not the candidate can handle the awesome responsibility of leading this country.\nSo, George Mason, Virginia, as you prepare to make this decision, I urge you, I beg of you to ignore the chatter and the noise and ask yourselves: Which candidate really has the experience, the maturity, and the demeanor to handle the job I described to you? Which candidate's words and actions speak to the future we want for our country and the values we share -- values like inclusion and opportunity, service and sacrifice for others?\nYour answers to these questions on Election Day will determine who sits in the Oval Office after Barack Obama. And let's be clear: Elections aren't just about who votes, but who doesn't vote. And that is especially true for young people like all of you. In fact, in 2012, voters under the age of 30 provided the margin of victory for Barack in four key battleground states: Pennsylvania, Ohio, Florida, and right here in Virginia. (Applause.) Right here. Without those votes, Barack would have lost those states, and he definitely would have lost that election -- period, end of story.\nSo for any of you who might be thinking that, \"my vote doesn't really matter,\" that one person can't really make a difference in this election, I want you to consider this: Back in 2012, Barack won Virginia by about 150,000 votes. Now, that may sounds like a lot. But when you break that down, the difference between winning and losing this state was only 31 votes per precinct. Thirty-one votes. He won Ohio. The difference there was just -- in Ohio, the difference there was just nine votes per precinct. Do you hear me? In Florida, the difference was six votes per precinct. Take that in for a moment. Take that in. Those are real numbers. That's how elections, especially the presidential election, are won and loss on a handful of votes.\nSo there are plenty of states where each of you could swing an entire precinct and win this election for Hillary Clinton just by getting yourselves, your friends and your few family members registered and out to vote. (Applause.) But it's going to take work. Yes, we can! (Applause.) It's going to take work. It's going to take work.\nAUDIENCE: Yes, we can! Yes, we can!\nMRS. OBAMA: We can do this. We can, and we must.\nBut here's the thing -- it's not enough to just come to a rally. It's not enough to just get a few selfies. (Laughter.) It's not enough to just get angry and just speak out. We also have to work and make that change, and take action. And that starts with electing folks who will stand with you and fight with you. And that's why you need to get yourself and everyone you know registered to vote today. And we've got volunteers here. I want you all, if you're not registered, I want you to find them before you leave. Find them and get registered before you leave this building.\nAnd then we need you to roll up your sleeves and get to work, making calls, knocking on doors, thinking about those handful of votes that you could carry, and get people out on Election Day. Again, you can sign up to volunteer with any of the staff who are here. So get it done. Right, George Mason? (Applause.) Work your hearts out.\nAnd as you're working your heart out for Hillary, if you start to feel tired or discouraged by all the negativity in this election, if you want to just hide under the bed and come out when it's all over, I want you to remember what's at stake. The choice you make on November 8th will determine whether you can afford a college tuition. It will determine whether you can keep your health care when you graduate.\nOn November 8th, you will decide whether we have a president who believes in science and will fight climate change -- or not. (Applause.) You will decide whether we have a president who will honor our proud history as a nation of immigrants -- or not. (Applause.) You will decide whether we have a president who thinks that women deserve the right to make their own choices about their bodies and their health -- or not. (Applause.)\nAnd here's the thing. At a time when incomes are rising by thousands of dollars, when millions of people are being lifted out of poverty, ask yourselves: Is now really the time to fundamentally change direction when we're making so much progress?\nAUDIENCE: No!\nMRS. OBAMA: I mean, do we really want to go back to the way things were before Barack was President?\nAUDIENCE: No!\nMRS. OBAMA: A time of economic crisis, stagnant wages when we were losing nearly 800,000 jobs a month. Or do you want a President who will keep moving this country forward? (Applause.)\nWell, that's what's at stake. So we can't afford to be tired or turned off -- not now. Because while this might feel like a time of uncertainty and division, I have never felt more hopeful about the future of this great nation. Let me tell you. I feel this way because for the past eight years, I have had the great honor of traveling from one end of this country to the other. And let me tell you, I have met just some of the most amazing people -- people from every conceivable --\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Ellen!\nMRS. OBAMA: And Ellen. (Laughter and applause.) But people from every conceivable background and walk of life. And time and again, I've seen proof of what Barack and I have always believed in our hearts: that we as Americans, we're fundamentally good folks, and we all truly want the same things. I mean, that's the thing. We're not that different.\nTime and again, Barack and I have met people who disagree with everything we've ever said, but they still welcome us into their communities. They keep their minds open, willing to listen. And while we might not always change each other's mind, we always walk away reminded that we're really not that different.\nFolks in this country are working long hours to send their kids to college just like my mom and dad did for me. They're helping raise their grandkids just like Barack's grandparents did for him. They're teaching their kids the exact same values that Barack and I are trying to teach our girls: that you work hard for what you want in life and you don't take shortcuts; that you treat people with respect, even if they look or think differently from you; that when someone is struggling, you don't turn away, and you certainly don't take advantage. No, you imagine walking a mile in their shoes and you do what you can to help, because that's what we do in America. (Applause.)\nWe live in a country where a girl like me, from the South Side of Chicago, whose great great grandfather was a slave, can go to some of the finest universities on Earth. We live in a country where a biracial kid from Hawaii named Barack Obama -- (applause) -- the son of a single mother -- can become president. A country that has always been a beacon for people who have come to our shores and poured their hopes and their prayers, and their backbreaking hard work into making this country what it is today. That is what makes America great. Don't ever forget it. (Applause.)\nAnd here's the thing. I know in my heart that we deserve a president who can see those truths in us, a president who believes that each of us is part of the American story and we're always stronger together. We deserve a president who can bring out what is best in us -- our kindness and decency, our courage and determination, so we can keep perfecting our union and passing down those blessings of liberty to our children.\nLet me tell you this. I have never been more confident that Hillary Clinton will be that president. (Applause.) So here's what I'm pledging. From now until November, I'm going to work as hard as I can to make sure that Hillary and Tim Kaine win this election. I need your help to do that, as well. Are you with me? (Applause.) I can't hear you. Are you with me? (Applause.) You got to roll up your sleeves. You got to get to work, make it happen. Virginia will make the difference in this election. Are you ready, Virginia? (Applause.)\nThank you all. God bless.", "timestamp": "2016-09-16", "title": "Remarks by the First Lady at a Hillary for America Campaign Event at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia"}

I am really pleased to be joined by this outstanding, bipartisan group to reemphasize how important it is for us to be out there and set the rules for the global economy.\nAs all of you know, I just returned from my 11th trip to Asia. This is the most populous, fastest growing part of the world. It is an area where we have the potential to sell American goods, promote American business, and help American workers, because we know that export industries tend to pay higher wages and are oftentimes some of the most successful companies in the world. And precisely because 95 percent of our markets are outside of the United States, and because for us to succeed in this increasingly integrated economy, we've got to make sure that we've got a level playing field and that American workers and American businesses are able to compete fairly.\nWhat we've done over the last several years is negotiate what we call the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, which is a high-standard trade agreement that makes other countries lower their tariff barriers so that there aren't taxes on U.S. goods that are sold there, that gets other countries to raise their labor standards so they're not undercutting U.S. workers, that gets other countries to raise environmental standards so that as we do our part to conserve the planet, other countries are doing their fair share. And after a lot of negotiations, we've got what is the most progressive, effective trade deal that we've ever seen.\nAnd this bipartisan group made up of business leaders, mayors and Governors, Republicans and Democrats, national security leaders and military leaders, the reason they're here is because they know this is important for our economy and they know that this is important for our national security and our standing in the world.\nRight now China is pushing hard to create their own trading regime out in Asia. And I promise you that China is not going to be setting up a bunch of rules that are going to be to the advantage of American companies and American businesses. If we are not in there and making sure that fair trade is established in the Asia market, we're going to be cut out.\nAnd I know that politics these days tends to look at trade as something that is negative. But if you talk to the farmers and the ranchers and the manufacturers and the service industries that are dependent on us selling American exports around the world, they will tell you we've got to get this done.\nSo I just want to say thank you to this outstanding group. We're going to spend some time strategizing about how we can get the message out. It's frustrating, I think sometimes, that there's so much misinformation floating around on this. But the good news is, is that people whose business it is to make sure that America has a strong position in the world and that our economy is improving understand that this needs to get done. We've got over a hundred mayors who signed up to make sure that this gets done. We've got Democratic and Republican Governors who are going to push to make sure that this gets done. We've got chambers of commerce and business leaders who are going to work really hard to make sure that people have the right information. But if you're frustrated about rules of trade that disadvantage America, if you're frustrated about jobs being shipped overseas and other countries selling goods into our country freely when we can't sell our stuff into other countries freely, then you want to get this thing passed. You want to get this thing done.\nAnd I thought it was important for people, even though we're in an election season, to know that this is not something I'm letting up on. I don't have any more elections to run, and the reason that I'm pushing this so hard is because I know and other countries know and China know that if we get this done, advantage America. And if we don't, then we're going to be disadvantaged for a long time to come.\nAnd it's the right thing to do. And even if the politics of it sometimes are tough, we're going to keep on making sure that we position ourselves as well as we can to be able to compete not just next year or 5 years from now, but 20 and 30 years from now.\nAll right? Thank you very much, everybody.\nThe President's Birthplace/2016 Presidential Election\nQ. Mr. President, Donald Trump is now finally acknowledging that, yes, you were born in America. Your reaction?\nThe President. I, Jonathan [Jonathan Karl, ABC News], have no reaction. And I'm shocked that a question like that would come up at a time when we've got so many other things to do. Well, I'm not that shocked, actually. [Laughter] It's fairly typical. We got other business to attend to. I was pretty confident about where I was born. I think most people were as well. And my hope would be that the Presidential election reflects more serious issues than that.\nAll right? Thank you.

Passionate debates and intense negotiation gave way to lasting compromise, and a document emerged that became the bedrock of America. Signed on September 17, the Constitution of the United States has steered our country through ever-changing times. It guides us as leaders on the world stage and safeguards the fundamental rights of our citizens. And it guarantees that the greatness of our Nation never depends on any one person—it requires the full and active participation of an engaged and vibrant citizenry.\nThe vision of self-government laid out in our Constitution is dependent on Americans doing the hard and sometimes frustrating—yet always essential—work of citizenship. Being a citizen is a responsibility that challenges each of us to stay informed, to speak out when something is not right or not just, and to come together to shape the course our country will take. Citizenship is a commitment, calling on us to stand up for what we believe in and to exercise our rights to protect the rights of others. The Bill of Rights and other amendments added in the decades that followed have paved the way for progress, and they embody a truth held since our founding: the simple but powerful idea that people who love their country can change it for the better.\nAmerica is more than a piece of land—it is an idea, a place where we can contribute our talents, fulfill our ambitions, and be part of something bigger than ourselves. Each year on Citizenship Day, we celebrate our newest citizens who raise their hands and swear a sacred oath to join our American family. The journey they have taken reminds us that immigration is our origin story. For centuries, immigrants have brought diverse beliefs, cultures, languages, and traditions to our country, and they have pledged to uphold the ideals expressed in our founding documents. They come from all around the world, mustering faith that in America, they can build a better life and give their children something more. That is why I was proud to create the White House Task Force on New Americans, which is helping to build welcoming communities around our country and enhance civic, economic, and linguistic integration for immigrants and refugees. Through the Task Force, Federal agencies and local communities are working together to raise awareness about the rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of citizenship—and to give immigrants and refugees the tools they need to succeed.\nAs a Nation of immigrants, our legacy is rooted in their success. Their contributions help us live up to our founding principles. With pride in our diverse heritage and in our common creed, we affirm our dedication to the values enshrined in our Constitution. We, the people, must forever breathe life into the words of this precious document, and together ensure that its principles endure for generations to come. In remembrance of the signing of the Constitution and in recognition of the Americans who strive to uphold the duties and responsibilities of citizenship, the Congress, by joint resolution of February 29, 1952 (36 U.S.C. 106), designated September 17 as \"Constitution Day and Citizenship Day,\" and by joint resolution of August 2, 1956 (36 U.S.C. 108), requested that the President proclaim the week beginning September 17 and ending September 23 of each year as \"Constitution Week.\"\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim September 17, 2016, as Constitution Day and Citizenship Day, and September 17 through September 23, 2016, as Constitution Week. I encourage Federal, State, and local officials, as well as leaders of civic, social, and educational organizations, to conduct ceremonies and programs that bring together community members to reflect on the importance of active citizenship, recognize the enduring strength of our Constitution, and reaffirm our commitment to the rights and obligations of citizenship in this great Nation.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-09-16", "title": "Proclamation 9497—Constitution Day and Citizenship Day, Constitution Week, 2016"}

They have served as critical stewards of our environment and natural resources. Toiling day in and day out in rural communities across our country, their dedication and dogged work ethic provide us with food, fuel, and other necessities, sustaining our people and our communities. Throughout National Farm Safety and Health Week, we honor their significant contributions by reaffirming our commitment to bolstering programs and practices that promote health and safety on America's farms.\nMillions of farmers and their families face a variety of unsafe conditions when they wake up for work each morning. Extreme weather, and exposure to livestock or hazardous chemicals can pose threats to their safety. Much of their work takes place in dangerous environments and with potentially harmful equipment, such as wells, silos, and grain bins. And putting in long hours of physical labor can also cause illness or injury. Our farmers and ranchers are exposed to too many of these dangers, and we must ensure they are equipped with the tools, trainings, and resources they need to take proper precautions and safety measures in their workplaces.\nTo reduce work-related accidents and deaths among farming communities, my Administration has encouraged regular participation in health and safety programs. Increasing awareness of proper procedures is crucial, and farmers and farmworkers can improve their safety practices by correctly handling materials and inspecting machinery, paying careful attention to instructions and labels on products and equipment, and practicing and communicating plans for emergency response. Because many farms and ranches are family businesses, we have partnered with people across our country to help formalize youth farm safety education to improve farm safety for children.\nThe best farmers in the world have enriched our Nation and driven our agriculture sector forward; it is our shared duty to ensure their health and safety, because we all have a stake in the well-being of those who provide us with food and energy. By maintaining safe work environments and taking steps to practice caution on our farms, we can minimize risks and increase productivity in one of the greatest and most essential industries in America.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 18 through September 24, 2016, as National Farm Safety and Health Week. I call upon the agencies, organizations, businesses, and extension services that serve America's agricultural workers to strengthen their commitment to promoting farm safety and health programs. I also urge Americans to honor our agricultural heritage and express appreciation to our farmers, ranchers, and farmworkers for their contributions to our Nation.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-09-16", "title": "Proclamation 9498—National Farm Safety and Health Week, 2016"}

Since 1999, the number of overdose deaths involving opioids, including prescription opioid pain relievers, heroin, and fentanyl, has nearly quadrupled. Many people who die from an overdose struggle with an opioid use disorder or other substance use disorder, and unfortunately misconceptions surrounding these disorders have contributed to harmful stigmas that prevent individuals from seeking evidence-based treatment. During Prescription Opioid and Heroin Epidemic Awareness Week, we pause to remember all those we have lost to opioid use disorder, we stand with the courageous individuals in recovery, and we recognize the importance of raising awareness of this epidemic.\nOpioid use disorder, or addiction to prescription opioids or heroin, is a disease that touches too many of our communities—big and small, urban and rural—and devastates families, all while straining the capacity of law enforcement and the health care system. States and localities across our country, in collaboration with Federal and national partners, are working together to address this issue through innovative partnerships between public safety and public health professionals. The Federal Government is bolstering efforts to expand treatment and opioid abuse prevention activities, and we are working alongside law enforcement to help get more people into treatment instead of jail.\nMy Administration is steadfast in its commitment to reduce overdose deaths and get more Americans the help they need. That is why I continue to call on the Congress to provide $1.1 billion to expand access to treatment services for opioid use disorder. These new investments would build on the steps we have already taken to expand overdose prevention strategies, and increase access to naloxone—the overdose reversal drug that first responders and community members are using to save lives. We are also working to improve opioid prescribing practices and support targeted enforcement activities. Although Federal agencies will continue using all available tools to address opioid use disorder and overdose, the Congress must act quickly to help more individuals get the treatment they need—because the longer we go without congressional action on this funding, the more opportunities we miss to save lives.\nToo often, we expect people struggling with substance use disorders to self-diagnose and seek treatment. And although we have made great strides in helping more Americans access care, far too many still lack appropriate, evidence-based treatment. This week, we reaffirm our commitment to raising awareness about this disease and supporting prevention and treatment programs. Let us ensure everyone with an opioid use disorder can embark on the road to recovery, and together, let us begin to turn the tide of this epidemic.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 18 through September 24, 2016, as Prescription Opioid and Heroin Epidemic Awareness Week. I call upon all Americans to observe this week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities that raise awareness about the prescription opioid and heroin epidemic.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-09-16", "title": "Proclamation 9499—Prescription Opioid and Heroin Epidemic Awareness Week, 2016"}

Your stories are not featured in the news, you have no demonstrators taking to the streets on your behalf, you have no special interests taking up your cause, and politicians ignore your cries for help. But I never will.\nI have met many incredible people during the course of this campaign. But nothing has moved me more deeply than the time I've spent with the families of the Remembrance Project, and the incredible strength and courage you've shown in your often lonely fight for justice.\nYou are heroes. And your actions will help us to save the next thousand American citizens from losing their brothers, sisters, sons, daughters or parents.\nThe most fundamental duty of government is to protect American lives. Anyone who fails to understand this is not fit to hold public office.\nEvery day our border remains open, innocent Americans are needlessly victimized. Every day Sanctuary Cities are left in place, innocent Americans are put in harm's way. Every day we fail to enforce our laws is a day when a loving parent is at risk of losing their child.\nIt's happening every single day.\nAll across this country, dining room tables have an empty seat at the family dinner table, because our government abandoned its duty and failed to enforce the laws.\nThere are a lot of numbers in the immigration debate. But let me give you the most important number of all. That most important number of all is the number of American lives it is acceptable to lose in the name of illegal immigration. Let me tell you what that number is: ZERO.\nOur nation should not accept one lost American life because our country failed to enforce its laws. What do you tell to the mother, who just buried her daughter, because someone was released at the border who should have been sent home?\nWhat do you tell to the young boy, who will grow up without a dad, because a criminal was deported five times but was allowed to keep coming back into the country?\nWhat do you tell the wife, who has lost her husband, because a Sanctuary City released an illegal immigrant from behind bars?\nThis must end. And it must end right now. Not one more American life should be given up in the name of open borders.\nJust look at what's happened in the last few days.\nLast week it was reported that authorities detained an illegal immigrant in the Austin area who is responsible for nearly a dozen sexual assaults and had been previously deported five times within a three-year period.\nEarlier this week, in Kansas, a Sheriff's Department Master Deputy was killed, apparently by an illegal immigrant. The driver was previously arrested for a DUI in California in 2001 and for a traffic violation in Kansas in 2013. Deputy Collins was killed only hours after his daughter's fourth birthday.\nA few days ago, two correctional officers in California were critically wounded after being shot by an illegal immigrant who overstayed his visa. This individual had been convicted for child rape and was slated to be deported – but his home country refused to take him back, so he was simply released. One of the victims has six children, is an Air Force Veteran, and a high school football coach – the other victim is a mother and a grandmother.\nWhen Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State, the matter of this country refusing to take back their deported citizens came before Hillary Clinton's desk. But she failed to take forceful action, and ignored the federal law requiring her to suspend visas to countries that don't take back their citizens.\nAccording to a report from the Boston Globe, from the year 2008 through 2014, nearly 13,000 criminal aliens were released back into U.S. communities because their home countries would not take them back. Most of these 13,000 releases occurred on Hillary Clinton's watch – she had the power and the duty to stop it cold and she didn't do it.\nNow, my opponent will never meet with you. She will never hear your stories. She will never share in your pain.\nShe will only meet with the donors and the special interests and the open border advocates.\nHer plan calls for total amnesty in the first 100 days, which means Obamacare, Social Security and Medicare for illegal immigrants. Her plan calls for catch-and-release on the border. Sanctuary Cities. Ignoring visa overstays. Closing detention centers. And a virtual end to immigration enforcement in the United States of America.\nHillary Clinton has even announced that she plans to go around Congress and implement amnesty by executive order – violating our Constitution and putting the entire nation in grave peril.\nHillary Clinton is the first person to ever run for the Presidency of a country effectively proposing to abolish the borders around that country.\nBut the media doesn't want you to know any of that. So they'll never ask her any questions about her plan. Like how she'll afford to give lifetime welfare and entitlements to illegal immigrants, or how many people will be victimized because of the illegal immigrants that will be released from federal custody – or at the border. She's not asked to explain what she'll say to the American workers who lose their jobs when she prints out millions of work permits for those here against the law.\nYour cause, and your stories, are ignored by our political establishment because they are determined to keep our border open at any cost. To them, your presence is just too inconvenient.\nBut help is coming. On November 8th, we are going to win the White House and we are going to deliver justice for every American family and every American victim.\nTogether, we will save American lives – and prevent the next thousand American parents from suffering the same fate as the people in the room today.\nSince 2013 alone, the Obama Administration has allowed 300,000 criminal aliens to return back into U.S. communities – these are individuals encountered or identified by ICE but who were not detained or processed for deportation.\nAccording to the federal government's own data, there are more than 2 million convicted criminal illegal immigrants inside the United States right now. However, this figure does not even include the many individuals who have committed crimes but escaped justice, fled the jurisdiction, or were otherwise never caught. Many crimes committed by people here illegally remain open cases.\nAt the same time, hundreds of individuals who have been given visas and refugee admissions into this country have subsequently been charged with terrorism. We are admitting people here with no idea who they are or what they believe.\nWhether it's drugs, terrorism or violent crime, our government is utterly failing in its core mission to defend and protect the people of this country. The Border Patrol Agents, who endorsed me, warned that Hillary Clinton's plan would put the entire country in grave danger – they called it radical, deeply dangerous, and warned it would trigger an unprecedented national crisis.\nLet's just remember our goal – to prevent the next family from suffering the same terrible fate.\nThat is what is at stake in this election.\nSo I am now going to invite some of the bravest people I know to come up to the stage and speak.\n[INVITE FAMILIES TO SPEAK]\nThese wounded American families have been alone. But they are alone no longer.\nI am here standing with you. The American people are here standing with you. And come November, your long awaited day of justice will finally arrive.", "timestamp": "2016-09-17", "title": "Remarks at the Remembrance Project Luncheon at the Omni Houston Hotel at Westside in Houston, Texas"}

I've delivered a few hundred of these weekly addresses over the years, and you may have noticed a theme that pops up pretty often: The Republicans who run this Congress aren't doing their jobs. And guess what? Congress recently returned from a 7-week vacation, and they've only got 2 weeks left until their next one. But there's a lot of business they need to get done first.\nFirst, even as we're seeing more and more Zika cases inside the United States, they've refused to fund our efforts to protect women and children by fighting Zika in a serious way.\nSecond, they still need to provide resources to help the people of Louisiana recover from last month's terrible floods and to help communities like Flint recover from their own challenges.\nThird, they have made Merrick Garland, a Supreme Court nominee with more Federal judicial experience than any other in history, wait longer than any other in history for the simple courtesy of a hearing, let alone a vote, all because they want their nominee for President to fill that seat.\nAnd there are plenty other bipartisan priorities they should finish this year as well: passing criminal justice reform; attacking the opioids epidemic; funding Joe Biden's Cancer Moonshot; finishing a transpacific trade agreement that will support American jobs and boost American wages; and passing a budget that will make sure all of America's priorities are funded without resorting to shutdown threats and last-minute gimmicks. And none of this list even includes some other big priorities that should get done. It's been almost a decade, for example, since Congress voted to raise the minimum wage.\nNone of these things should be controversial. All of it is within our reach. This is America; we can do anything. We just need a Congress that works as hard as you do. At the very least, we should expect that they should do their jobs and protect us from disease, help us recover from disaster, keep the Supreme Court above politics, and help our businesses grow and hire.\nSo if any of these priorities matter to you, let your Congressperson know. And if they still refuse to do their jobs, well, you know what to do in November. Our Government only works as well as the people we elect.

And Michelle says, \"That's right.\" [Laughter] She gave a speech yesterday. A bunch of young people were chanting \"Four more years,\" and she said, no, no, no. [Laughter] She's ready. [Laughter]\nBut we do want to take this opportunity just to say thank you; to say thank you for your support over the years, to say thank you for your friendship, to say thank you for your prayers. I mean, as I just look across this auditorium, there are so many people here who lifted us up, who steadied us when things got tough.\nWhen we began this journey coming on 10 years now, we said this was not about us. It wasn't about me. It wasn't about Michelle. It wasn't just to be a Black President or the President of Black America. We understood the power of the symbol. We know what it means for a generation of children, of all races, to see folks like us in the White House. And as Michelle says, we've tried to be role models, not just for our own girls, but for all children, because we know they watch everything we do as adults. They look to us as an example. So we've taken that responsibility seriously. And I've been so blessed to have a wife and a partner on this journey who makes it look so easy and is so strong and so honest and so beautiful and so smart. But we're all—we're just thankful because you guys have lifted us up every step of the way.\nNow, we know, however, that what matters most for our community is not just the symbol, not just having an African American President. It's having a President who's going to do his or her darnedest to make the right decisions and fight the right fights. And think about the fights that we've waged together these past 8 years. Together, we fought our way back from the worst recession in 80 years: turned an economy that was in free fall, helped our businesses create more than 15 million new jobs. We declared that health care is not a privilege for a few, but a right for everybody; secured coverage for another 20 million Americans, including another three million African Americans. Our high school graduation rate is at an alltime high, including for African American students. More African Americans are graduating from college than ever before.\nTogether, we've begun to work on reforming our criminal justice system: reducing the Federal prison population, ending the use of solitary confinement for juveniles, banning the box for Federal employers, reinvigorating the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, pushing to make sure police and communities are working together to make sure that our streets are safe and that our law is applied equally. We're giving opportunities for kids so that they don't get in the criminal justice system in the first place. And I want to thank all of you who've helped us reach nearly 250 \"My Brother Keepers\" communities across the country.\nAnd just this week, we learned that last year, across every race and age group in America, incomes rose, and poverty fell. Folks' typical household incomes rose by about $2,800, which is the fastest growth rate on record. Lifted 3.5 million people out of poverty, including one million children, the largest one-year drop in almost 50 years.\nBy so many measures, our country is stronger and more prosperous than it was 8 years ago. And none of it's been quick. None of it's been easy. None of it has come without a fight. And so much of our work remains unfinished. But then, we knew that we would not solve all of our challenges in one year or one term or even one Presidency, not even in one lifetime, because we understand better than anybody that this is the story of America, that the project of America is never finished. It is constantly a work in progress.\nAnd what has always made us unique is our capacity to change: our conviction that change doesn't come from some ruler, but it comes from the bottom up, from us, from the actions we take, whether it's women seeking the right to vote, or a young John Lewis leading a mighty march in Selma. We do our part to slowly, steadily, make our union a little bit more perfect. We know that. And that's what we've done these past 8 years. And now that's what we have to keep on doing.\nYou may have heard Hillary's opponent in this election say that there's never been a worse time to be a Black person. [Laughter] I mean, he missed that whole civics lesson about slavery and Jim Crow and—but we've got a museum for him to visit. So he can tune in. [Laughter] We will educate him. [Laughter]\nHe says we've got nothing left to lose, so we might as well support somebody who has fought against civil rights and fought against equality and who has shown no regard for working people for most of his life. [Laughter] Well, we do have challenges, but we're not stupid. We know the progress we've made, despite the forces of opposition, despite the forces of discrimination, despite the politics of backlash. And we intend to keep fighting against those forces. When Governors refuse to expand Medicaid that hits the folks most in need, we'll fight.\nAudience member. That's right!\nThe President. When folks block an increase to the minimum wage or refuse to expand paid family leave or won't guarantee equal pay for equal work that hurts the pocketbooks of every family and African American families, we will fight. When we're not investing in the schools that our kids deserve, when one group of Americans is treated differently under the law, when there are those who somehow think it's wrong to make sure that folks have access to affordable housing or are unwilling to do what it takes to make sure our veterans get the benefits that they've earned or aren't helping to sign folks up for health insurance, we will not stop our march for justice. We will not stop pushing for the security and prosperity of all people. That doesn't stop with my Presidency. We're just getting started.\nAnd when people—when across this country in 2016, there are those who are still trying to deny people the right to vote——\nAudience member. That's right!\nThe President. We've got to push back twice as hard. Right now, in multiple States, Republicans are actively and opening—openly trying to prevent people from voting: adding new barriers to registration, cutting early voting, closing polling places in predominantly minority communities, refusing to send out absentee ballots, kicking people off the rolls, often incorrectly.\nThis should be a national scandal. We are—we were supposed to have already won that fight. We're the only advanced democracy in the world that is actively discouraging people from voting.\nAudience member. That's right!\nAudience member. It's a shame!\nThe President. It's a shame. And then, they try to justify it by telling folks that voter fraud is rampant. Between 2000 and 2012, there were 10 cases of voter impersonation nationwide. Ten. People don't get up and say, I'm going to impersonate somebody and go vote. [Laughter] They don't do that.\nMeanwhile, some of the same folks who are trying to keep you from voting turn a blind eye when hundreds of thousands of people are killed by guns. Imposing voter ID restrictions so that a gun license can get you on the ballot, but a student ID can't—apparently more afraid of a ballot than a bullet.\nAudience member. Come on!\nThe President. So, no, our work is not done. But if we are going to advance the cause of justice and equality and of prosperity and freedom, then we also have to acknowledge that even if we eliminated every restriction on voting, we would still have one of the lowest voting rates among free peoples.\nAudience member. That's not good!\nThe President. That's not good. [Laughter] That is on us.\nAnd I am reminded of all those folks who had to count bubbles in a bar of soap, beaten trying to register voters in Mississippi, risked everything so that they could pull that lever. So if I hear anybody saying their vote does not matter, that it doesn't matter who we elect, read up on your history. It matters. We've got to get people to vote.\nIn fact, if you want to give Michelle and me a good sendoff—and that was a beautiful video—but don't just watch us walk off into the sunset, now. Get people registered to vote. If you care about our legacy, realize everything we stand for is at stake. All the progress we've made is at stake in this election. My name may not be on the ballot, but our progress is on the ballot. Tolerance is on the ballot. Democracy is on the ballot. Justice is on the ballot. Good schools are on the ballot. Ending mass incarceration, that's on the ballot right now.\nAnd there is one candidate who will advance those things. And there's another candidate whose defining principle, the central theme of his candidacy, is opposition to all that we've done.\nAudience member. That's right!\nAudience member. Preach!\nThe President. There's no such thing as a vote that doesn't matter. It all matters. And after we have achieved historic turnout in 2008 and 2012, especially in the African American community, I will consider it a personal insult, an insult to my legacy, if this community lets down its guard and fails to activate itself in this election. You want to give me a good sendoff? Go vote! And I'm going to be working as hard as I can these next 7 weeks to make sure folks do.\nHope is on the ballot. And fear is on the ballot too. Hope is on the ballot, and fear is on the ballot too.\nA few days ago, Michelle and my mother-in-law and the girls and I, we snuck over and got an early look at the new Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. We looked at the shackles that had been used to bring folks over. We saw the shacks where slaves had been trying to make a way out of no way. And then, with each successive level, we saw the unimaginable courage and the struggles and the sacrifices and the humor and the innovation and the hope that led to such extraordinary progress, even in our own lifetimes.\nAnd it made us proud. Not because we had arrived, but because what a road we've had to travel. What a miracle that despite such hardship, we've been able to do so much. And I know everybody in this room understands that that progress is not inevitable. Its sustainment depends on us. It's not just a matter of having a Black President or First Lady. It's a matter of engaging all of our citizens in the work of our democracy.\nIt was that slave who said, you know what, despite the risk of a lash, I'm going to learn how to read. It's Harriet Tubman saying, despite the risk to my life, I'm going to free my people. It's Fannie Lou Hamer saying, despite the ostracism, the blowback, I'm going to sit down here in this convention hall, and I'm going to tell people what it's like to live the life I've lived. I'm going to testify to why change needs to come.\nAudience member. That's right!\nThe President. It's a young John Lewis saying, I'm going to march despite those horses I see in front of me.\nAll those ordinary people, all those folks whose names aren't in the history book, they never got a video providing a tribute to them—that's why we're here. That's how progress is sustained. And then, it's a matter of electing people to office who understand that story, who feel it in their hearts, in their guts, and understand that government can't solve all our problems but it can be a force for good.\nTo experience this incredible new monument, this museum, is to be reminded we're just a small part of a long chain, generation after generation, striving against the odds. What an inspiration they are. And what an inspiration all of you are, especially the young people who are here.\nThat's why I'm still fired up. [Laughter] That's why I'm still ready to go. And if you are too, if you're ready to continue this journey that we started, then join me. Register folks to vote. Get them to the polls. Keep marching. Keep fighting. Keep organizing. If we rise to this moment, if we understand this isn't the endpoint, this is the beginning, we're just getting going, we're just getting moving, then I have never been more optimistic that our best days are still ahead.\nThank you for this incredible journey, CBC.

It's so great to be back here with all of you tonight. I want to thank my friend, Congressman Jim Clyburn; Don Peebles; Representative Butterfield; members of the Congressional Black Caucus; and congratulate all of the honorees. On a personal note, I want to recognize a dear friend who is retiring after 46 years, Congressman Charles Rangel. He is one of a kind, and we are grateful for your years of service.\nAnd what can I say about one of the best Presidents this country has ever had, Barack Obama? All through this campaign, I have made the point over and over again, Presi-dent Obama saved our country from a second Great Depression. He brought Osama bin Laden to justice. And so much more. I, for one, don't think he gets the credit he deserves for doing what he's done on behalf of our country and the world. And it's not just the President he's been, but the man he is. Even when hateful nonsense is thrown their way, Barack, Michelle, their two beautiful daughters, have represented our country with class, grace, and integrity. As Michelle says, 'When others go low, we go high.' I know I speak for not just everyone in this room but so many tens of millions of Americans: Mr. President, not only do we know you are an American, you're a great American! And you make us all proud to be Americans, too.\nLet me thank the leadership of the CBC Foundation for this great honor, and to thank all of my friends in the Congressional Black Caucus for it as well. I dedicate it to all the trailblazers who came before me who blazed trails that I could follow in their footsteps – Barbara Jordan. Shirley Chisholm. I would not be standing here without them. Generations of women and men who struggled and sacrificed and cleared a path for all of us.\nThis award is also for everyone out there helping to break down the barriers holding Americans back, to leaders like all of you, and to a rising generation of young activists. To all those on the front lines dedicated to the proposition that in America, every single child deserves the chance to fulfill his or her God-given potential. This has been the cause of my life ever since I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund all those years ago. And I'm going to close my campaign the way I began my career and the way that I will serve as your president, focused on opportunities for our children and fairness for our families.\nWe have so much work to do together. I've heard many heartbreaking stories over this campaign. One was from Tianna Gaines-Turner, a working mother to three children from Northeast Philadelphia. She testified at the DNC platform meeting in June and told us how her husband had been laid off and she worked in a part-time job. She said she'd been hungry more times than she could count, and that life felt like a maze, because she faced barriers no matter which way she turned. But despite all of this, Tianna has hope. She still believes that her 8-year-old daughter will be president one day. And she believes that this election can make all the difference in the world to her and her family. Let's prove her right.\nAs a country, we have a moral obligation to give her family and every family a chance to rise up and reach their dreams. That is what's at stake in this election. It's not about golf course promotions or birth certificate. It comes down to\nwho will fight for the forgotten, who will invest in our children, and who will really have your back in the White House.\nWe need ideas, not insults, real plans to help struggling Americans in communities that have been left out and left behind, not prejudice and paranoia. We can't let Barack Obama's legacy fall into the hands of someone who doesn't understand that, whose dangerous and divisive vision for our country will drag us backwards. Instead, we need to come together, to get incomes rising with a higher minimum wage, to invest in neglected communities with efforts like Jim Clyburn's 10-20-30 plan, to get guns out of the hands of dangerous people, to fight for a criminal justice system that actually delivers justice, and to make sure that all kids have good schools and good teachers no matter what zip codes they live in.\nWhen you really think about it, the choice this November is about so much more than Democrats and Republicans. As Michelle Obama said at the Democratic convention, it's about who will have the power to shape our children for the next four years of their lives. It's also about the kind of country we want to be, what we want to leave behind for future generations. I thank everyone here, who has been fighting for this vision over so many years. I thank all who have supported me. I want you to know I'm not taking your vote or anyone's vote for granted. I'm working every single day to earn your support. And I need your help over the next 52 days to bring our campaign across the finish line together.\nBarbara Jordan famously said that a government is invigorated when each of us is willing to participate in shaping the future of this nation. So to everyone here tonight, please, keep doing what you're doing, but also help to register voters. Tell others about the clear choice in this election. In some states, early voting is nearly here, so we need to keep the pressure on. Let's send a loud and clear message once and for all: We are stronger together. And no matter what, remember this: Love trumps hate. Thank you all very much!\"", "timestamp": "2016-09-18", "title": "Remarks to the Congressional Black Caucus in Washington, D.C"}

Thank you so much. Danny, Audrey, thank you for your amazing hospitality. I appreciate your wonderful kids being here as well, and I know that since one of mine just left—[laughter]—that any time they come back is a good day. [Laughter] So I'm glad I could come up with an excuse.\nIrving Harris, for those of you who don't know, was an amazing businessman and helped to change the landscape of philanthropy in Chicago. His incredible wife and dear friend, Joan, is here with us. And it is absolutely true that Irving, I won't say discovered me, but was willing to, I think, put a bet on me very early on in my career at a time when I was just getting started in politics. And he was somebody who nobody said a bad word about, because he was an example of somebody who did well and did good and cared deeply about making sure that he was giving back.\nAnd one of the main areas that he focused on was early childhood education and how meaningful it could be if we were able to give every child early in life the kind of support that they needed, that it would pay dividends for years to come. And not only did he give money, but he gave time, and he understood the subject matter, and he was passionate about it. And that passion was transferred to me and to a lot of other people in public service and in philanthropy. And so what a thrill it is to be able to be with his family all these years later and remember him. He was a great, great man. So we're really proud of him.\nNow, to the matter at hand, there's an election coming up. [Laughter] And because this is an intimate group, I want to spend most of our time in conversation, but let me just say a few things at the top.\nIt is a cliché that every election is the most important election of our lifetime. This time it's true. [Laughter] They're all important, and I'm a big believer that the project of America, the project of democracy, is never finished; that it is a constant process of us together, reimagining what might be, figuring out how we can work together to make this country a little more just, a little more fair, a little more prosperous, a little more secure.\nI've described myself as a relay runner in that process; that even when you achieve the highest office of the land, that no one person is going to bring about all the change that is necessary. You take the baton and you run, and you, hopefully, advance the causes that we all care deeply about a little bit, and then you pass it on to the next person. And what gives me great pride is, is that I can say, unequivocally, that we've run a good race and that we are much better off now than we were when I took office.\nAnd that's true by almost every measure. When I came into office, we were losing 800,000 jobs a month. The financial system was frozen. We were looking at a global depression. And not only have we created 15 million new jobs, not only have we cut the unemployment by more—the unemployment rate by more than half, not only do we have 20 million people who have health insurance who didn't have it before, but just last week, the Census report came out that showed that last year we saw the largest increases in income since they've been measuring increases; the biggest drop in poverty since 1968. And what was most satisfying is that those increases in income were across the board and particularly among low-income and middle-income folks.\nAnd so we are now in the process of reversing what had been a 20-, 30-year trend where the gains typically accrued to the top, and incomes and wages were stagnant for people in the middle and at the bottom.\nAdd to that, then, our doubling of clean energy; our historic efforts to stop the process of a warming planet; marriage equality is now the law of the land in all 50 States; the reopening of Cuba; the disarming of nuclear weapons in Iran; taking Usama bin Laden off the battlefield. It's very hard to find an area where we're not better off than we were. And that's a consequence of hard work, the incredible resilience of the American people, but also because of good policy: policy that's based on facts, policy that's based on evidence, a willingness to look squarely at what's not working and try something different and learn from mistakes.\nAnd we now have one candidate in this race who is prepared to carry on that same type of governance. I have had the opportunity to work with Hillary Clinton. I've had the opportunity to run against Hillary Clinton. And I can tell you that this is somebody who is smart, who is tough, and most importantly, who cares deeply about making sure that this country works for everybody and not just a few. And she's displayed it again and again and again. And when I said that I think she is somebody who is as qualified as any individual who has ever run for this office, I meant it. Audrey mentioned \"Hamilton\" and being in the room where it happens. Well, she's been in the room where it happens, repeatedly. And her judgment has been unerring, and she has been disciplined, and she has been extraordinarily effective in every job that she's had.\nAnd then, there's the other guy. [Laughter] Now, you all know him because he's from New York. Some of you may have done business with him, I don't know. If you have, it doesn't sound like it's been a pleasant experience. [Laughter] But when I ran against John McCain, we had deep differences, but I couldn't say that he was not qualified to be President of the United States. When I ran against Mitt Romney, I had profound differences with him, but I couldn't say that electing Mitt Romney would be an unmitigated disaster.\nThis guy is not qualified to be President. And he shows no interest in even gaining the rudimentary knowledge required to make really hard decisions on a day-to-day basis. There's no curiosity. There's no desire to get up to speed. It's an infomercial. It's a reality show. And more disturbingly, it's tapping into some of our worst impulses as a country, ones that divide us rather than bring us together, ones that seek to put down people who have been historically vulnerable as opposed to lifting them up.\nSo this should not be a close election, but it will be. And the reason it will be is not because of Hillary's flaws, but rather because structurally, we've become a very polarized society. And if all you're doing is watching Fox News and listening to Rush Limbaugh and reading some of the blogs that are churning out a lot of misinformation on a regular basis, then it's very hard for you to think that you're going to vote for somebody who you've been told is taking the country in the wrong direction. And so, structurally, we already have these divisions and it's going to be hard to overcome those.\nI will also say that there's a reason why we haven't had a woman President: that we as a society still grapple with what it means to see powerful women. And it still troubles us in a lot of ways, unfairly, and that expresses itself in all sorts of ways. So the good news is, despite all that, I have confidence in the American people that they're going to make a good decision, and we're going to win this thing. But it's not going to happen if we just take it for granted. It's not going to happen if we just step back and assume that we're going to be successful; we've got to work for it, as we've always had to work for it.\nAnd that brings me back to where I started. Every step of the way, every piece of progress that we've made in this country has been because ordinary people decided we can imagine something better and then were willing to make extraordinary sacrifices and fight for it. That was true for the civil rights movement, that was true for the women's movement, that was true for the labor movement. And it will be true today.\nSo if we do our jobs, if we don't get distracted and certainly if we don't get discouraged, if we are focused and disciplined and provide the resources and the time and the effort and the energy to get this thing done, then we're going to be successful. And I am absolutely confident that Hillary Clinton will be a great President. But it's going to require us to put her there. So let's get busy.\nAs I was coming over here, I may embarrass her, but I've got one of my staff—I won't mention her name. Her dad—she just was telling this story. She hadn't flown on Marine One before, and we were flying in together, and she started talking about her dad, who grew up in an orphanage. And it was an orphanage actually started by Alexander Hamilton's widow. And it's an amazing institution apparently, and he benefited from this loving environment for an orphan and then had the opportunity, which is part of what set America apart, to go to city colleges in New York at a time when this was a gateway, a pathway for working people to get a world-class education. And he ended up becoming a biochemist. And he had a successful career, and his daughter now works in the White House and is one of my closest advisers.\nJust think about that. That's what America is at its best. That story, that trajectory. And probably somewhere for everybody in this room, there's a story like that. And the question is, does that story continue? And when you're making a decision about who should be President, and when you decide what's worth investing your time and your effort and your energy in—the way Irving Harris did—that's what we should be chasing. That's what we should be pursuing. That's what we should be trying to continue. That's what I've tried to do these last 8 years. I know that's what Hillary is going to be doing for the next 8 years.\nThank you, everybody.", "timestamp": "2016-09-18", "title": "Remarks at a Fundraiser for Democratic Presidential Nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton in New York City"}

I saw how much fun President Obama had last week and – I wanted to be here in Philadelphia.\nBefore I begin with my remarks, I do want to say how proud I am of our brave first responders working to keep us safe after the attacks of the last weekend in New York, New Jersey and Minnesota. There are now reports of a suspect in custody, but we must remain vigilant. This is a fast-moving situation and a sobering reminder that we need steady leadership in a dangerous world.\nI'm here to talk about a number of the issues that are part of this election but really, much more than that, they are part of our future – the kind of country we want to have, the kind of people we want to be and, particularly, what kind of opportunities we should be providing for the young people of America.

And Lauren remains committed and engaged, working with an organization called Generation Progress, because she understands that active citizenship is a lifelong job and the call to service never fades.\nNow, I know that with so much negativity out there, it is really easy to get cynical – especially about our politics. I remember wrestling with that challenge when I was a student during the Vietnam War. It can be tempting to think that no one will tell you the truth and nothing's ever going to change. But you're here today because you refuse to accept cynicism. You know that the next 50 days will shape the next 50 years. And you see how much needs fixing in our country, from the soaring cost of college to the scourge of systemic racism to the threat from climate change – but you also know the only way we can meet those challenges is if we meet them together.\nYou're here today because you believe we can do just that. You want something to vote for, not just against. Optimism, not resentment. Answers, not anger. Ideas, not insults. Bridges, not walls. You're also here because you know this election isn't a reality TV show. It shouldn't be about birth certificates or name-calling or stunts to get onto cable news.\nThis election comes down to a choice between two very different visions for America. I believe it's wrong to tear each down. We should be lifting each other up. It's wrong to let income inequality get even worse. We have to make the economy work for everyone, not just those at the top. And it's wrong to put a loose cannon in charge who could start another war. We should work with our allies to keep us safe.\nIt comes down to this: Are we going to pit Americans against each other and deepen the divides in this country, or are we going to be, as I know we can, stronger together?\nI know what I believe, and I'm going to close my campaign the same way I started my career – fighting for kids and young people and families. That has been the cause of my life. And it will be the passion of my presidency, and I hope you'll join me. We can't get distracted when the media or my opponent turns this election into a circus. My husband has a saying about that. He calls it majoring in the minors – getting so wrapped up in stuff that doesn't matter, you forget what's really important to your future and to the future of this country.\nTake the challenges facing young Americans today. First of all, if you're willing to work hard, you should be able to find a good job that pays well and lets you do what you love and make your mark in the world. But that's been out of reach for too many young people – trying to find your footing in the wake of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. That's why Tim Kaine and I have a plan to work with both parties and make a historic investment in good new jobs. We can create millions of jobs and make life a lot better by doing things like connecting every household to broadband by 2020; installing half a billion solar panels; building a cleaner, more resilient electric grid with enough renewable energy to power every home in the country.\nNext, getting an education should give you a boost, not hold you back. But as you know better than most, tuition keeps going through the roof and debt keeps piling up. I understand that Temple was founded to democratize, diversify and widen the reach of higher education. That is still a vital goal.\nSo I worked with Bernie Sanders on a plan. We came up with a plan that makes public college tuition-free for working families and debt-free for everyone. And if you already have debt, we will help you refinance it and pay it back as a percentage of your income so you're never on the hook for more than you can afford. You can actually see how much you and your family can save under our plan by looking at the College Calculator at hillaryclinton.com.\nAnd here's something we don't talk about enough: a four-year degree should not be the only path to a good job in America. People should be able to learn a skill, practice a trade, and making a good living because of that. So we're offering new tax credits to encourage companies to offer paid apprenticeships that let you earn while you learn and do more to dignify skills across the board – for welders, machinists, health technicians, coders, and so many other fields.\nAnother challenge I hear about all the time is from new parents about how hard it is to balance the demands of work and family in today's economy. Families look different today than they did decades ago, I think we can all agree. Most need two incomes just to get by. And many people now change jobs frequently and have wildly unpredictable schedules, or they have to cobble together part-time work, all without the basic supports available to parents in nearly every other advanced country.\nThat's why Tim Kaine and I have a plan to help working families with quality, affordable childcare, preschool and paid family leave. We fundamentally believe – the more we can strengthen families, the stronger we will be as a nation.\nEverywhere I go, young people also share their concerns about the divisiveness and discrimination we see in America today. You aren't – and you shouldn't be – satisfied with the progress we've made. You should keep wanting to right wrongs and fight for justice and dignify for all. We see, as Lauren said, too many young black men and women made to feel like their lives are disposable; too many immigrants living in fear of deportation; too many young LGBT Americans bullied; too many young women and men sexually assaulted on campus or in the military or at home. And more than previous generations, you understand that all these challenges are intersecting, and we must take them on together.\nBut you also see a Republican nominee for president who incites hatred and violence like we've never seen before in any campaign. Hate speech being normalized. The dog whistles are out in the open. And yet, despite this, I remain convinced America's best days are ahead of us. In large part, that's because of the inspiring young people I meet every day.\nI'm inspired by Astrid. I met her in Las Vegas last summer. She was brought to this country from Mexico at the age of four with nothing but a doll, a cross, and the dress she was wearing. Now she's in her twenties and advocating for the rights of undocumented Americans and comprehensive immigration reform. We should all join her in this.\nI'm inspired by Mikey, who I met in New York. Mikey spent six months in prison for a low-level drug offense. After he got out, Mikey discovered just how hard it is for people who've done their time to find good jobs and opportunities. But he persisted, and he managed to start his own ice cream shop in New York – and I can recommend, it's delicious. We have to do more to help others get that second chance, including by banning the box and reforming our criminal justice system.\nI'm inspired by Erica, one of the bravest young women I've ever met. Her mother, Dawn, was the principal of Sandy Hook School who died trying to protect her students. Erica was devastated. But then, she made it her mission to advocate for commonsense gun safety reforms. It's been painful for her – a lot of hate has come her way and the gun lobby is so powerful – but Erica won't give up. As she said, 'What if everyone who faced tough odds said, it's hard, so I'm going to walk away? That's not the type of world I want to live in.'\nThat's the spirit that makes this country great – we might get knocked down, but we get right back up again. And we refuse to quit, no matter what. And that's the spirit we need in this election too.\nNow, I know that with Washington paralyzed by big money and partisanship, the gap between the change we want and the progress that politics should deliver can look like a chasm. I also know that even if you're totally opposed to Donald Trump, you may still have some questions about me. I get that. And I want to do my best to answer those questions.\nWhen it comes to public service, the 'service' part has always easier for me than the 'public' part. I will never be the showman my opponent is – and you know what, that's okay with me. And it's also true I do spend a lot of time on the details of policy, like the precise interest rate on your student loans, right down to the decimal. But that's because it's not a detail for you. It's a big deal. And it should be a big deal to your president.\nSo here's what I ask any voter who is still undecided: Give us both a fair hearing. Hold us accountable for our ideas, both of us. I can't promise you'll agree with me all the time, but I can promise you this: No one will work harder to make your life better. I will never stop, no matter how tough it gets. In fact, you can read about what Tim and I want to do. We're not keeping it a secret. We've got a book called 'Stronger Together.'\nBut let me tell you a little bit about the values that drive me and my vision for the future because you deserve that from anyone from anyone running for president. I want to share with you the stories of three women who at pivotal moments changed my life and set me on a course of social justice, activism, and public service.\nThe first woman is my mother. Her name was Dorothy, and she was abandoned by her parents as a young girl. She ended up out on her own at 14, working as a housemaid. When I learned about this many years later, I asked how she managed to grow up into a warm, loving person and not become bitter and broken. And here's what she said, one word: 'kindness.' She was saved by the kindness of others. Like the teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch and brought extra food to share. The lesson she passed on to me was simple but powerful: No one gets through life alone. We have to look out for each other and lift each other up. She made sure I learned the words of one of the creeds of our Methodist faith: Do all the good you can for all the people you can in all the ways you can as long as ever you can.\nThat mission guides me still today. When I stumble, it helps pick me up, because there's always more good to do and more people to help if we keep our eyes open, especially kids.\nWhen I met a terrified little girl in Nevada who burst into tears because she worried her parents would be deported, it hit me right in the gut. I knew how hard-working her parents were. I knew the sacrifices they were making so that she could have a better life. When I met a little boy in Flint, Michigan who got sick from drinking water poisoned with lead, it just made me so angry and determined to work even harder. Every one of our children deserves the chance to share in the promise of America.\nThe second woman I want to tell you about is Marian Wright Edelman. She was a lawyer for the NAACP in Mississippi, first African American woman to pass the Mississippi bar. She was an ally of Dr. King and Robert Kennedy, and the founder of the Children's Defense Fund, an altogether remarkable person. One day during my first semester in law school, I saw a flyer – we used to have those, flyers on a campus bulletin board. And Marian was coming to give a lecture. I made sure to be there, and what I heard was captivating. Marian talked about creating a Head Start program in Mississippi and using her legal education to make life better for poor children and families. Something just clicked in my brain. I began to see how I could translate the commitment to helping others I'd learned from my mother, my church, into real social change. I went up to her and I said, 'Could I work for you this summer?' She said, 'Sure, but I can't pay you.' I said, 'Well, I am paying my way through law school, so I have to get paid.' She said, 'Well, if you can figure out how to get paid, you can have a job.' So I figured out how to get a grant to get paid and went to work for her.\nAfter graduation, I could have followed my classmates to a high-powered law firm, but I went to work for Marian at the Children's Defense Fund instead. She sent me door to door in New Bedford, Massachusetts on behalf of children with disabilities who were denied the chance to go to school back then. And I remember meeting a young girl in a wheelchair on the small back porch of her house. She told me how badly she wanted an education, but it just didn't seem possible. My heart went out to her and I wanted to help. But it became clear to me that simply caring is not enough. That wouldn't force the public school to build more wheelchair ramps or put more resources into special education. I learned that to drive real progress, you have to change both hearts and laws. So we gathered evidence. We built a coalition. And our work helped convince Congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilities. And that experience turned me into a lifelong advocate for children and families.\nI went to South Carolina to investigate the plight of 12- and 13-year-old boys imprisoned alongside grown men who had committed serious felonies. In Alabama I helped expose the racism of segregated academies. In Arkansas I ran a legal aid clinic that provided representation to poor families and prison inmates who could not afford it. When Bill was elected President, a lot of people were surprised, and even threatened, by the idea of an activist as First Lady. But I wasn't about to quit then, either. I fought for universal health care, and ended up working with Republicans and Democrats in Congress to create the Children's Health Insurance Program, which covers eight million kids today.\nThe third woman who changed my life was named Sophia, the 17-year-old captain of a high school basketball team in New York City. It was the late 1990s, and Democrats in New York were urging me to run for the Senate, and I kept telling them no. After all, no First Lady had ever done anything like that. I myself hadn't run for anything since student council. I'd always been an advocate, not a politician. But then one day I visited that school in New York for an event with young women athletes with Billie Jean King. Hanging above our heads was a big banner that said, 'Dare to compete.' Before my speech, Sophia introduced me. She was tall, and as we shook hands, she bent over and whispered in my ear, 'Dare to compete, Mrs. Clinton. Dare to compete.' Once again, something just clicked. For years I had been telling young women to step up. Participate. Go for what you believe in. Could it be I was afraid to do something I had urge so many others to do?\nWell, it was a difficult transition, becoming a candidate for the first time back in that New York Senate race. Even all these years later, I confess I don't enjoy doing some of the things that come naturally to most politicians, like talking about myself. But I took that leap then for the same reason I'm running now, to even the odds for those who've got the odds stacked against them, especially children and families. And I've learned that in a democracy, if you want to help the greatest number of people, you have to push for reform from both the outside in and the inside out. We need activists and advocates, entrepreneurs and innovators, teachers and mentors, people who change lives every day in a million quiet ways. We also need strong, principled leaders who can win votes, write laws, allocate resources, and do the slow, hard business of governing.\nNow, of course, politics can be discouraging. This election in particularly can be down-right depressing sometimes. But it matters. It really does. It matters for our families, our communities, and our country and the world. Our most cherished values are at stake. Every election is important, from school board to state senate to president. But this time is different. We are facing a candidate with a long history of racial discrimination in his businesses, who retweets white supremacists, who led the birther movement to delegitimize our first black President, and he's still lying about it today. He refuses to apologize to President Obama, his family, and the American people. We have to stand up to this hate. We cannot let it go on.\nAnd when we do that, we send a clear message: America is better than this. America is better than Donald Trump. Just as important, we have a chance to make real progress together in our country. I need you. I need you as partners, not just for winning this election, but for driving real change over the next four years. The fights ahead of us are bigger than one election, one president, or even one generation. It's going to take all of us working side-by-side to build the kind of future we want. That's why, if I'm in the White House, young people will always have a seat at any table where any decision is being made.\nSo if you believe diversity is America's strength, not America's burden, join us. If you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage and no one working full-time should have to raise their children in poverty, join us. If you believe that climate change is real and that we can save our planet while creating millions of good-paying clean energy jobs, join us. If you believe that every man, woman, and child in America has the right to affordable, quality health care, join us. If you believe we should finally guarantee equal pay for women, join us.\nAnd here's how you can join us. Go to iwillvote.com and register today. Register your friends. Register everyone you know. This is going to be close. We need everyone off the sidelines. Not voting is not an option. That just plays into Trump's hands. It really does. Text 'join,' j-o-i-n, to 47246 right now, or go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to volunteer. I understand here at Temple you're already organizing campaign tailgates at every football game and having a lot of fun doing it. We have 50 days, 50 days, to reach everybody we possibly can, to not only win an election – that's just the first step – then to keep the progress going, go even further, make it absolutely clear that we're going to shape a future that represents the best of who we are. So talk to your classmates. Talk to your neighbors. Help us stand up for our best values and reject prejudice and paranoia.\nYou know, I mentioned my mother and the kindness she experienced. Her life was so neglected that when she went to work as that housekeeper/babysitter at the age of 14, it was the first time she ever saw a family that loved each other, where the parents loved their children, cared for them, planned for them, where she learned the lessons that enabled her to be such an extraordinary mother to me and my brothers. Everything I've learned in my life convinces me that love trumps hate.\nSo please join us in working together. There's no doubt in my mind that young people have more at stake in this election than any other age group. And when you turn out and vote this fall, we will be sending a message much larger than even the outcome. We will say we can build a future where all our children have the opportunity to live up to their God-given potential, no matter who they are, where they're from, what they look like, or who they love. That's the America we believe in. That's the America worth fighting for. That's what we've got to do to stand together. We are stronger together, and let's make sure love trumps hate. Thank you all!\"", "timestamp": "2016-09-19", "title": "Remarks at Temple University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania"}

Hello, everyone. Are you enjoying the show so far? (Applause.) Good, me too. Well, I'm thrilled, so thrilled to be here today with all of you.\nLet me start by thanking the one and only Stephen Colbert for that wonderful introduction and for hosting this event today. (Applause.) As you saw firsthand, Stephen always makes us laugh, but he also makes us think and care about important issues like girls' education. And I'm so grateful for everything he has done.\nThanks also to Mrs. Ban, who's been such a great friend and supporter of our work to help girls worldwide. And thanks to the First Lady of Malawi, Dr. Gertrude Mutharika, and Queen Rania of Jordan for their outstanding leadership on behalf of women and girls.\nI also want to recognize the brilliant young women who are sharing their stories today, as well as the extraordinary performers from the cast of Beautiful, Waitress, Wicked, and of course, The Color Purple.\nFinally, thanks so much to all of you for joining us here today as we celebrate the power of girls' education across the globe.\nNow, for me, this issue has always been personal. See, back when I was a girl growing up in a working-class neighborhood, most of the folks I knew -– including my parents -– didn't go to college. But with a lot of hard work –- and a lot of financial aid -– I had the chance to attend some of the finest universities in the country. And I can tell you that education was everything for me. It opened doors. It gave me the confidence to pursue my ambitions and make my voice heard in the world. For me, education was power.\nSo a few years ago, when I had the honor of meeting Malala Yousafzai, who was shot in the head just for trying to go to school -- well, that's when this issue got really personal for me. Because the terrorists who nearly killed her were trying to silence her voice. They were trying to snuff out her ambitions and take away her power. And that's why I decided to work on global girls' education. Because there are girls just like Malala in every corner of the globe -- girls who are so bright, so hardworking and hungry, some who are even willing to risk their lives just to get an education.\nAnd that's really the mission of our Let Girls Learn initiative -– to give girls worldwide the education they need to fulfill their potential and lift up their families, their communities and their countries.\nNow, I want to be clear, as may be true for many of our first ladies who are here, as First Lady of the United States, I have no budget of my own for programs. I have no authority to make or pass laws. I cannot issue any kind of executive orders. But in just a year and a half, through Let Girls Learn, we've established partnerships with nearly 80 companies and organizations that are committing money, resources and expertise.\nWe're collaborating with countries like Canada, Mexico and the Nordic countries on girls' education efforts. Countries like Japan, South Korea, and the UK have invested nearly $600 million. The U.S. is investing over half a billion dollars more, and running Let Girls Learn programs in 40 countries. (Applause.) And the World Bank Group will be investing $2.5 billion over the next five years. (Applause.) Yeah, good stuff. (Applause.) In addition, through social media campaigns, Let Girls Learn has inspired young people like the girls here today to step up and be champions for girls worldwide.\nAll of this is happening because, time and again, whether it's a head of state, a corporate CEO, or a 15 year-old girl here in the U.S., when people hear the stories of girls who aren't in school, they want to help. And as spouses of world leaders, so many of us here in this room have a platform that we can use to tell these stories and bring people together to take action for these girls. Because people will pick up the phone when we call. They will come to a meeting when we ask. Cameras may even show up when we go to an event.\nSo really, we all have so much more power than we think. And today, I'm urging you to use that power to help girls worldwide get the education they deserve. Reach out to your country's NGOs and corporations. Lobby your spouses. Talk directly to your citizens, especially your young people. More than 62 million girls around the world are counting on us to be their voice. And I intend to keep speaking out on their behalf not just for the rest of my time as First Lady, but for the rest of my life. And I hope that you all will join me.\nThank you all so much. Enjoy the show. (Applause.)", "timestamp": "2016-09-19", "title": "Remarks by the First Lady at the United Nations General Assembly Spousal Program in New York City"}

Back then, my watch told me the time. Today, it reminds me to exercise. In my first year, I couldn't take pictures with my phone. Last year, I posted on Instagram from Alaska.\nOf course, American innovation is driving bigger changes, too: In the seven-and-a-half years of my presidency, self-driving cars have gone from sci-fi fantasy to an emerging reality with the potential to transform the way we live.\nRight now, too many people die on our roads – 35,200 last year alone – with 94 percent of those the result of human error or choice. Automated vehicles have the potential to save tens of thousands of lives each year. And right now, for too many senior citizens and Americans with disabilities, driving isn't an option. Automated vehicles could change their lives.\nSafer, more accessible driving. Less congested, less polluted roads. That's what harnessing technology for good can look like. But we have to get it right. Americans deserve to know they'll be safe today even as we develop and deploy the technologies of tomorrow.\nThat's why my administration is rolling out new rules of the road for automated vehicles – guidance that the manufacturers developing self-driving cars should follow to keep us safe. And we're asking them to sign a 15-point safety checklist showing not just the government, but every interested American, how they're doing it.\nWe're also giving guidance to states on how to wisely regulate these new technologies, so that when a self-driving car crosses from Ohio into Pennsylvania, its passengers can be confident that other vehicles will be just as responsibly deployed and just as safe.\nRegulation can go too far. Government sometimes gets it wrong when it comes to rapidly changing technologies. That's why this new policy is flexible and designed to evolve with new advances.\nThere are always those who argue that government should stay out of free enterprise entirely, but I think most Americans would agree we still need rules to keep our air and water clean, and our food and medicine safe. That's the general principle here. What's more, the quickest way to slam the brakes on innovation is for the public to lose confidence in the safety of new technologies.\nBoth government and industry have a responsibility to make sure that doesn't happen. And make no mistake: If a self-driving car isn't safe, we have the authority to pull it off the road. We won't hesitate to protect the American public's safety.\nEven as we focus on the safety of automated vehicles, we know that this technology, as with any new technology, has the potential to create new jobs and render other jobs obsolete. So it's critical that we also provide new resources and job training to prepare every American for the good-paying jobs of tomorrow.\nWe're determined to help the private sector get this technology right from the start. Because technology isn't just about the latest gadget or app – it's about making people's lives better. That's going to be the focus of the first-ever White House Frontiers Conference on Oct. 13. And what better place to hold it than Pittsburgh – a city that has harnessed innovation to redefine itself as a center for technology, health care and education.\nWe'll explore the future of innovation in America and around the world, focusing on building our capacity in science, technology and innovation, as well as the new technologies, challenges and goals that will shape the next century.\nThe progress we've seen in automated vehicles over the past several years shows what our country is capable of when our engineers and entrepreneurs, our scientists and our students – backed by federal and private investment – pour their best work and brightest ideas toward a big, bold goal. That's the spirit that has propelled us forward since before the automobile was invented. Now it's up to us to keep driving toward a better future for everyone.", "timestamp": "2016-09-19", "title": "Op-Ed by the President in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122569", "text": "Action from Congress urgently needed to provide $1.1 billion in new funding for treatment\n\"During Prescription Opioid and Heroin Epidemic Awareness Week, we pause to remember all those we have lost to opioid use disorder, we stand with the courageous individuals in recovery, and we recognize the importance of raising awareness of this epidemic.\"\n--Proclamation by President Obama, September 16, 2016\nAs part of  Prescription Opioid and Heroin Epidemic Awareness Week, Members of the President's Cabinet and Federal agencies are focusing on the work being done across the government and announcing new efforts to address the national prescription opioid and heroin epidemic.\nLeading up to and during Awareness Week, Federal agencies are taking a number of actions, including:\n•      Expanding substance use disorder treatment in the TRICARE system to include coverage of intensive outpatient programs and treatment of opioid use disorders with medication-assisted treatment.\n•      Establishing enhanced measures in conjunction with the Chinese government to combat the supply of fentanyl and its analogues coming to the United States.\n•      Increasing the patient limit from 100 to 275 for practitioners prescribing buprenorphine to treat opioid use disorders. Since July, 1,275 practitioners have applied for and been granted waivers to prescribe at the increased limit—improving access to medication-assisted treatment (MAT).\n•      Supporting distance learning and telemedicine programs that expand access to healthcare, substance use disorder treatment, and educational opportunities in rural communities.\nDuring Awareness Week, the White House will host a roundtable with parents affected by the epidemic. Attorney General Loretta Lynch and other Justice Department officials—as well as U.S. Attorney's Offices and Bureau of Prison facilities across the country—will participate in over 250 different events highlighting the importance of prevention, enforcement, and treatment. The Department of Agriculture will launch a series of State forums on the epidemic, starting in Connecticut and Colorado. Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert McDonald will lead a forum in Washington, DC, on treatment and support for veterans with opioid use disorder.\nDepartments across the Federal Government, including Justice, Agriculture, Defense, Veterans Affairs, and Health and Human Services, are using all available tools to combat this epidemic by expanding evidence-based prevention and treatment programs, increasing access to the overdose-reversal medicine naloxone, improving opioid prescribing practices, and supporting targeted enforcement activities. At the same time, with Federal support, State and community leaders are working together to combat the epidemic through innovative partnerships between public safety and public health.\nYet far too many Americans still do not get the treatment and care they need. That is why the President continues to call on Congress to provide $1.1 billion in new funding to make sure everyone who wants treatment for an opioid use disorder can get the treatment they need. Every day that passes without Congressional action to provide these additional resources is a missed opportunity to save lives.\nSupporting Evidence-Based Prevention and Targeted Enforcement:\nOn Tuesday Attorney General Lynch will travel to Lexington, Kentucky, to hold a student town hall at a high school, meet with Heroin Education Action Team (H.E.A.T.) parents that have lost children to heroin overdose, and speak at the University of Kentucky on how the Administration is addressing the issue through prevention, enforcement, and treatment.\nAlso this week, the Department of Justice will issue a memorandum to Federal prosecutors to reinforce the Administration's prevention, enforcement, and treatment strategy and institutionalize best practices in combatting the epidemic. The memorandum will build on the work the Department of Justice has been undertaking around the country to address the issue.\nAt public events this week, the Department of Justice will be announcing funding to strengthen Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs across the country and grants to support State-level law enforcement investigations of drug manufacturing and drug distribution networks.\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration and the Department of Health and Human Services are releasing prevention PSAs for TV and radio. One set of PSAs was filmed in Scott County, Indiana—which experienced an HIV outbreak last year linked to injection opioid use—and will be launched there this week.\nAlso, as part of Awareness Week, Education Secretary John King will send letters to educators across the country on the important role that schools can play in preventing youth substance use and in supporting students who need treatment or are in recovery.\nReducing the Supply of Fentanyl:\nMany of the recent overdoses and deaths in Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, and West Virginia have been attributed to synthetic opioids like fentanyl or its analogues, which include carfentanil, being mixed into heroin. Earlier this month, the Administration announced enhanced measures in conjunction with the Chinese government to combat the supply of fentanyl and its analogues to the United States. The majority of fentanyl and its analogues brought to the United States by drug traffickers originates in China. China committed to targeting U.S.-bound exports of substances controlled in the United States, but not in China. Additionally, the U.S. and China agreed to increase the exchange of law enforcement and scientific information with a view towards coordinated actions to control substances and chemicals of concern. The Administration will continue to work with China bilaterally and multilaterally to tighten international scheduling and improve capacity to monitor and analyze illicit synthetic drugs.\nPreventing Overdose Deaths with Naloxone:\nToday the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced the 2016 Naloxone App Competition, a public contest focused on developing innovative technologies to help combat the rising epidemic of opioid overdose. The goal of this competition is to develop a low-cost, scalable, crowd-sourced mobile phone application that helps increase the likelihood that opioid users, their immediate networks, and first responders are able to identify and quickly react to an overdose. A panel of judges from the Department of Health and Human Services will evaluate submissions and the highest-scoring entrant will receive an award of $40,000. Following the competition, all eligible entrants also may apply for National Institute of Drug Abuse Small Business Innovation Research grants to further develop their concepts and to develop data to evaluate their real world impact.\nDEA has now trained 1,033 employees in DEA Field Divisions on how to administer the overdose-reversal medicine naloxone. In early 2016, DEA's Training Division coordinated two Train-the-Trainer programs for 65 DEA Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs). These 65 EMTs were then certified to conduct a four-hour class on naloxone, CPR, and Automated External Defibrillator (AED) use for employees.\nExpanding Access to Treatment:\nThe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services published the final rule to increase the patient limit from 100 to 275 for practitioners prescribing buprenorphine in July. Since that time, 1,275 practitioners have applied for and been granted waivers to prescribe at the increased limit—improving access to buprenorphine, which is prescribed along with behavioral health services as part of medication-assisted treatment (MAT). In addition, SAMHSA plans to publish this week the final rule outlining annual reporting requirements for practitioners who increase their patient limits from 100 to 275 for prescribing buprenorphine.\nThis week, VA Secretary Robert McDonald, Associate Attorney General Bill Baer, and National Drug Control Policy Director Michael Botticelli will host a forum in Washington, DC, on the Administration's efforts to assist veterans suffering from opioid use disorder. Funding to support Veterans Drug Courts will be announced as part of the forum.\nMedicare and Medicaid are implementing person-centered and population-based strategies to reduce the risk of opioid use disorders, overdoses, inappropriate prescribing, and drug diversion. This includes the use and distribution of naloxone and increasing access to medication-assisted treatment. The programs are also encouraging the use of evidence-based practices for acute and chronic pain management.\nImproving Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Treatment for TRICARE Beneficiaries:\nIn coordination with the Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Parity Task Force established by the President, the Department of Defense issued a final rule this month to reduce barriers to mental health benefit coverage and to improve access to substance use disorder treatment for TRICARE beneficiaries, including coverage of intensive outpatient programs and treatment of opioid use disorders with medication-assisted treatment. TRICARE currently has an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 beneficiaries with opioid use disorder who previously could not access medication-assisted treatment. The changes include:\no      Eliminating prohibitions on substance use disorder (SUD) care and applying the same benefit coverage rules as other medical and surgical benefits.\no      Expanding covered SUD treatment under TRICARE, to include coverage of intensive outpatient programs (IOPs) and additional venues for Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder, including Office-Based Opioid Treatment and Opioid Treatment Programs.\no      Streamlining the process for SUD treatment facilities to become TRICARE authorized providers.\no      Developing TRICARE payment policies for newly recognized SUD treatments, Opioid Treatment Programs, and Office-Based Opioid Treatment.\nAssisting Rural and Tribal Communities:\nToday the Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced it is investing $4.7 million in Distance Learning and Telemedicine (DLT) program grants to support 18 projects in 16 States for rural communities to use communications technology to expand access to healthcare, substance use treatment, and advanced educational opportunities. These projects join 80 DLT projects announced in July. DLT grants can be used to connect rural hospitals to larger healthcare facilities through telemedicine in order to better diagnose and treat substance use disorders.\nTo continue the important conversations happening in rural communities devastated by the opioid crisis, leaders from USDA's Farm Service Agency and Rural Development offices in key affected States will host opioid epidemic awareness forums to bring together government officials, medical professionals, law enforcement, and other stakeholders to raise awareness of the issue, forge partnerships, identify possible solutions, and highlight the need for more treatment resources in rural communities. The series will kick off with four forums in September, with more to follow in the coming months:\n•      September 19: Tolland, Connecticut\n•      September 20: Brighton, Colorado\n•      September 26: Grants Pass, Oregon\n•      September 29: Fayetteville, North Carolina\nAlso today, USDA provided Red Lake Band of Chippewa a direct loan through USDA's Community Facilities program for the construction of a new, 16-bed Chemical Dependency Treatment Center. The new center will provide a safe, sanitary facility to treat men and women suffering from drug and alcohol use disorders.\nEngaging Health Care Professionals:\nIn response to the President's call to action last year, more than 40 health care provider groups announced a commitment to ensure that more than 540,000 health care providers would complete training on appropriate opioid prescribing in two years. To date, the provider coalition reports that 280,433 providers have completed prescriber training. In addition, 11,461 physicians have completed training to prescribe buprenorphine to treat opioid use disorder as part of the coalition's effort to double the number of buprenorphine prescribers in three years. This puts the coalition on track to meet or exceed their goals.\nIn August, the Surgeon General sent a letter to 2.3 million American health care professionals asking them to pledge to educate themselves to treat pain safely and effectively and to screen patients for opioid use disorder and provide or connect them with evidence-based treatment (TurnTheTideRx.org). The Surgeon General's office today is announcing that more than 17,000 people have signed the pledge to date and many more are joining their colleagues each day.\nSafely Disposing of Unneeded Prescription Opioids:\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) will hold its 12th National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day on Saturday, October 22, providing a safe, convenient, and responsible way of disposing of unneeded prescription drugs. More than 6.4 million pounds of medication have been collected over the last eleven Take Back Days. Local communities and some pharmacies are also establishing ongoing drug take-back programs.\nAdditional information on recent Administration actions to address the opioid epidemic:\nAug 31, 2016:  HHS Awards $53 Million to Help Address Opioid Epidemic\nAugust 17, 2016:  Obama Administration Funds New Projects to Disrupt Prescription Opioid, Fentanyl and Heroin Trafficking\nAugust 5, 2016:  White House Hosts Panel on Effective Treatment for Overdose Survivors for More Than 600 Medical Providers and First Responders\nJuly 6, 2016:  Obama Administration Takes More Actions to Address the Prescription Opioid and Heroin Epidemic\nJune 29, 2016:  White House Releases Estimated State Opioid Treatment Funding Levels under President's Budget Proposal\nApril 8, 2016:  White House Director of Drug Policy Joins National and Local Leaders in Announcing Medication-Assisted Treatment Trainings\nMarch 28, 2016:  Obama Administration Announces Additional Actions to Address the Prescription Opioid Abuse and Heroin Epidemic", "timestamp": "2016-09-19", "title": "Fact Sheet: Obama Administration Announces Prescription Opioid and Heroin Epidemic Awareness Week"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122570", "text": "White House hosts convening on trauma-informed approaches in schools to support girls of color and rethink discipline.\n\"Despite structural barriers of race and gender, women and girls of color have made real progress in recent years. The number of black women-owned businesses has skyrocketed. Black women have ascended the ranks of every industry. Teen pregnancy rates among girls of color are down, while high school and four-year college graduation rates are up. That's good news. But there's no denying that black women and girls still face real and persistent challenges.\"\n– President Barack Obama, Remarks at the Congressional Black Caucus Dinner, September 20, 2015\nToday, The White House Council on Women and Girls, together with the U.S. Department of Education, the Georgetown Law Center on Poverty and Inequality, and The National Crittenton Foundation, is hosting a conference titled \"Trauma-Informed Approaches in School: Supporting Girls of Color and Rethinking Discipline.\" The Obama Administration is committed to promoting policies and practices that support the needs and potential of underserved populations, including marginalized girls, young women and their families. Despite progress made over the recent years in academic achievement, access and school support, girls -- and particularly girls of color – still disproportionately face barriers in education. This convening will help participants focus on improving school systems' discipline practices and developing approaches that better serve students who have experienced trauma.\nAll too often, girls of color experience disproportionately high rates of school suspensions. According to the U.S. Department of Education's Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) black girls are 8 percent of enrolled students, but represent 14 percent of students receiving one or more out-of-school suspensions. By adopting supportive school discipline practices, schools foster success for all students and increase the likelihood that students will stay engaged and stay in school.\nTrauma from sexual assault may also impede a young girl's success in school. According to the  Centers for Disease Control, approximately 8 percent or an estimated 10 million girls experienced rape or attempted rape during youth. When the trauma of sexual assault is not addressed, it can have a devastating effect on a girl's physical and mental health, leading to serious problems in school. Like colleges and universities, K-12 school districts must comply with legal obligations under Title IX to respond to allegations of sexual assault of a student. K-12 school districts must also provide support for student survivors of sexual assault to ensure they can receive equal educational opportunities.\nAs part of today's conference, the White House is announcing additional supports from the U.S. Department of Education and the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault to help address sexual assault misconduct in schools:\n•      Safe Place to Learn: Prevent, Intercede, and Respond to Sexual Harassment of K-12 Students: Today, the U.S. Department of Education will release  Safe Place to Learn, an online, interactive resource package to support efforts to create a positive school climate and healthy learning environment. This package highlights strategies and instruments with which many schools are already working to create a school community committed to preventing discrimination based on sex and its most extreme corollary, sexual violence. The materials in the package aim to help three primary staff groups: administrative leadership; all building staff; and staff responsible for interceding and responding to students. The resource package contains guidance, e-learning training modules, and information about trauma sensitivity, resources to support current and ongoing conversations and efforts to prevent bullying, sexual harassment and violence, and provide safe, supportive learning environments for all students, in age-appropriate and developmentally appropriate ways.\n•      Considerations for School District Sexual Misconduct Policies: Today, the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault will release a  document highlighting issues for K-12 districts to consider when bringing together a multi-disciplinary team to develop sexual misconduct policies as part of their overall response to sexual misconduct. By using this document as a guide, it will enable K-12 teams to include the essential components of a comprehensive sexual misconduct plan. The document covers reporting options, support services for victims, definitions, confidentiality, the grievance process, and other critical areas. It also provides links to Federal government resources for those wanting further detail on a particular topic.\nIn addition, the following external commitments are being made to support trauma-informed approaches to school discipline:\n•      Online Community Support for Educators: Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) Connection network invites states to join the newly restructured ACEs in Education online community group to share resources on schools that want to become trauma informed. ACEs Connection Network has two parts: ACEsTooHigh.com is a news site for the general public that covers research about the consequences of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and how people, organizations, systems and communities are implementing practices based on ACEs science. It has a companion social network, ACEsConnection.com, which has more than 10,000 members who are implementing trauma-informed and resilience-building practices based on ACEs science across sectors. ACEsConnection.com has several community groups, including ACEs in Education, which has 300 members, mostly educators. ACEs in Education is the go-to place for trauma-informed, resilience-building education. It has resources, such as webinars, tutorials, books, articles, and lists of organizations that provide whole-school training for schools that want to become trauma-informed.\n•      Fellowship focused on best practices in school discipline reform efforts: The Communities for Just Schools Fund (CJSF) will announce a new fellowship, which will soon be accepting applications, jointly hosted by CJSF and the Southern Education Foundation, to develop a best practices institute to support school discipline reform efforts and remedy racial injustice in schools. Education Anew Fellow (EAF) will be housed at the Southern Education Foundation (SEF) for a 12-18 month fellowship period. The Fellow will work closely with CJSF staff and community partners, and with SEF's staff and fellows, including SEF's soon-to-be launched Racial Equity Fellow, to develop the CJSF Best Practices Institute (BPI) and to support conversations and collaborations between the community organizers CJSF supports and the educators with whom SEF works, all for the greater benefit of education justice advocates and school discipline reform efforts nationwide.\n•      Georgetown Law Center on Poverty to launch follow-up effort on trauma-informed schools for girls of color: The Center on Poverty will build on the momentum of this conference by pivoting from its role as co-host to serving school system reformers who seek to implement trauma-informed approaches that are responsive to the unique needs of girls of color. The Center will invite the state teams present at the conference and others to provide more in-depth information about their needs in creating trauma-informed schools, with the ultimate goal of serving as a central convener of these groups.\nToday's conference will bring together educational teams from 15 States and 23 school districts around the country, as well as key researchers and experts in this topic, and nonprofit partners who have demonstrated a strong commitment to improving supports and outcomes for this vulnerable population.\nParticipating States and districts include:\n•      Colorado\no      Denver Public Schools\n•      District of Columbia\no      District of Columbia Public Schools\n•      Illinois\n•      Maryland\no      Baltimore City Public Schools\n•      Massachusetts\no      Reading Public Schools\n•      Michigan\no      Flint Community Schools\no      River Rouge School District\no      Detroit Public Schools Community District\n•      Minnesota\no      St. Paul Public Schools\n•      Montana\no      Billings Public Schools\n•      New Jersey\no      Lawrence Township Public Schools\n•      New York\no      NYC Department of Education\no      Rochester City School District\n•      Ohio\no      Youngstown City Schools\no      Cleveland Metropolitan School District\n•      Oregon\no      Portland School District\n•      Pennsylvania\no      School District of Philadelphia\no      School District of Lancaster\n•      Tennessee\no      Shelby County Public Schools\no      Metro Nashville Public Schools\n•      Virginia\no      Richmond City Public Schools\no      Norfolk City Public Schools\no      Petersburg City Public Schools\nThe conference builds on the Administration's commitment to fostering school success for all youth, and reducing unnecessary exclusionary school discipline practices, including:\n•      This month, the Department of Education and the Department of Justice released letters to states and school districts encouraging communities to use school resource officers (SROs) only under appropriate circumstances and not for the administration of routine discipline. To assist school districts in the appropriate use of SROs, the Departments jointly released the Safe, School-based Enforcement through Collaboration, Understanding, and Respect (SECURe) Rubrics. These new resources can help education and law enforcement agencies revise SRO-related policies to better align with common-sense action steps that will lead to improved school safety and better outcomes for students.\n•      In follow-up to the Department of Education and the Department of Justice's school discipline guidance package from 2014, the Department of Justice released new resources at a White House Conference in July 2015 to assist school leaders in reducing rates of exclusionary discipline, including: Addressing the Root Causes of Disciplinary Disparities: An Educator's Action Planning Guide and Rethink School Discipline: Resource Guide for Superintendent Action. At the convening, the Department of Education launched its #RethinkDiscipline campaign and assembled leadership teams from more than forty school districts with each district committing to move away from exclusionary school discipline practices. As a part of the day the Department of Education released  story maps—disaggregated by race, gender, and disability status— highlighting the extent to which exclusionary discipline is used in certain parts of the country, particularly among students of color and students with disabilities\n•      In July 2015, the Department of Justice also launched the National Resource Center for School Justice Partnerships. This technical assistance portal is designed to assist juvenile courts, schools, and law enforcement agencies in supporting school discipline reform and addressing disparities.", "timestamp": "2016-09-19", "title": "Fact Sheet: Ensuring Safe and Supportive Schools for All Students"}

Christie of New Jersey; Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York; Ahmad Khan Rahami, suspect in the New York and New Jersey bombings of September 17; Officer Jason Falconer of the Avon, MN, Police Department; and Dahir Ahmed Adan, suspect in the stabbings at the Crossroads Center mall in St. Cloud, MN, on September 17. He also referred to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) terrorist organization.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119020", "text": "Good morning, everybody. I want to say a few words about the explosions that occurred here in New York City and New Jersey and the other device that have been found in New Jersey. I've been monitoring the situation closely and receiving frequent updates from my team. And I've just been briefed again by FBI Director Comey. In addition, I've had a chance to speak with Governors Cuomo and Christie, as well as Mayor de Blasio.\nWe've seen what was apparently a pipe bomb go off in New Jersey, in Seaside Park, where it could have seriously injured our U.S. marines and spectators who were there for a race. The bombing in the Chelsea neighborhood, here in New York, injured more than two dozen people. We are extremely fortunate and grateful that nobody was killed. And our prayers go out to all those who have been injured. We want to wish them a speedy recovery.\nI especially want to commend all the outstanding police and first responders in both New York City and New Jersey for their extraordinary professionalism and their quick response, which surely prevented even more people from being hurt and ensured that people got assistance quickly.\nNow, the investigation is moving rapidly, and as is my practice, I'm going to leave it to the FBI and law enforcement to provide details. I think everybody is aware at this point that there is a person of interest who is the focus of the investigation. And the FBI can give you further details in terms of how that is proceeding.\nI told Governors Cuomo and Christie and Mayor de Blasio that they and their teams will continue to have all Federal support as they move ahead with their investigations, in tracking down every lead, and working to keep the people of this city and of this region safe. Law enforcement is asking for the help of the community. And so to everybody in this region, I want to repeat what we've said before: If you see something suspicious, then you need to say something, contact local law enforcement.\nIn the meantime, I would ask that the press try to refrain from getting out ahead of the investigation. I am extraordinarily happy with the cooperation that's been taking place with—between the FBI and State and local law enforcement officials. They are moving smartly on this investigation. It does not help if false reports or incomplete information is out there. So try to, as much as possible, stick to what our investigators say, because they actually know what they're talking about.\nMeanwhile, I know that the United Nations meetings here every year already create an additional workload for New York. But given the U.N. meetings, we also have a particularly high level of Federal resources here to help as needed. We're going to make sure that everybody is working together seamlessly, as one team, to get to the bottom of what happened, to find those responsible, and to make sure that justice is done.\nStabbings in St. Cloud, MN\nMeanwhile, while all this is going on in New York and New Jersey, we're also focused on the stabbing attack at the shopping mall in Minnesota. At this point, we see no connection between that incident and what happened here in New York and New Jersey. Our attention there is on the people who were injured. And again, we are very grateful that no one lost their life. Thanks to the quick action of a brave off-duty police officer, the suspect was killed, and we avoided more people being hurt.\nI had a chance also to speak with Governor Dayton this morning. I assured him that we will provide all the assistance that he needs in the investigation. The FBI is investigating the Minnesota incident as a potential act of terrorism. We will direct the full resources of the Federal Government to make sure that the investigation goes forward aggressively.\nU.S. Counterterrorism Efforts\nAnd finally, I want to take this opportunity to reassure the people in this city, in this region, and Americans across our country that our counterterrorism and law enforcement professionals at every level—Federal, State, and local—are working together, around the clock, to prevent attacks and to keep us safe. They are the best of the best. Over the years, they have thwarted many plots and saved many lives. And we are incredibly grateful for their service, today and every single day.\nWe will continue to lead the global coalition in the fight to destroy ISIL, which is instigating a lot of people over the Internet to carry out attacks. We are going to continue to go after them. We're going to take out their leaders. We're going to take out their infrastructure. They are continuing to lose ground in Iraq and in Syria. And later today, I'll be meeting with Prime Minister Abadi of Iraq to discuss the need to sustain that momentum. As we take away more of their territory, it exposes ISIL as the failed cause that it is. And it helps to undermine their ideology, which over time will make it harder for them to recruit and inspire people to violence. And we're going to continue to enlist tech companies and community and religious leaders to push back against online extremist content and all messages of hate.\nAt moments like this, I think it's important to remember what terrorists and violent extremists are trying to do. They are trying to hurt innocent people, but they also want to inspire fear in all of us and disrupt the way we live, to undermine our values. And so, even as we have to be vigilant and aggressive, both in preventing senseless acts of violence, but also making sure that we find those who carry out such acts and bring them to justice, we all have a role to play as citizens in making sure that we don't succumb to that fear. And there's no better example of that than the people of New York and New Jersey.\nWhen I was speaking to Governor Cuomo and Governor Christie and Mayor de Blasio, one point that they all made is, folks around here, they don't get scared. They're tough, they're resilient, they go about their business every single day. And that kind of toughness and resoluteness and a recognition that neither individuals nor organizations like ISIL can ultimately undermine our way of life, that's the kind of strength that makes me so proud to be an American. And that's the kind of strength that is going to be absolutely critical not just in the days to come, but in the years to come.\nBy showing those who want to do us harm that they will never beat us, by showing the entire world that as Americans we do not, and never will, give in to fear, that's going to be the most important ingredient in us defeating those who would carry our terrorist acts against us.\nAll right. Thank you very much, everybody. And as I said, you will be receiving, I'm sure, ongoing briefings from both the FBI and local law enforcement in terms of the details of the investigation.", "timestamp": "2016-09-19", "title": "Remarks on the Bombings in New York City and Seaside Park, New Jersey, From New York City"}

Let me begin by just commenting on the events that have unfolded today. This morning, I talked about the fact that there was a person of interest that the FBI and law enforcement had identified with respect to the bombs that had been planted in the New York and New Jersey area. As everybody is now aware, that individual has been apprehended.\nAnd I just want to start by commenting on the extraordinary work and coordination that's taken place between the FBI and local law enforcement. For us to be able to apprehend a suspect in just a little over 24 hours after an event takes place like this, it is outstanding police work, outstanding law enforcement work.\nI, in particular, want to give a heartfelt thanks to the New Jersey police officers who were able to apprehend this individual. I had a chance to talk to them briefly before I came down to my meetings here. They are going to be fine. They have sustained some modest injuries, but ones that they'll rapidly recover from. They were in good spirits. And I communicated to them how appreciative the American people were, as well as people in the region. It's just one more reminder of the extraordinary skill and sacrifice and courage of our law enforcement officers, and what they put on the line every single day to make sure that we are safe.\nBeyond that, obviously information is still unfolding about what might have motivated the suspect. I'm going to leave it up to the FBI and local law enforcement authorities to discuss those details with you. I will also comment on the fact that in—with respect to the Minnesota stabbings that occurred, I had a chance to talk to the off-duty police officer there who undoubtedly saved a lot of lives and prevented further injury because of his quick and effective action. And I told him that, once again, the American people were appreciative of his work and his heroism.\nIraq-U.S. Relations\nNow, one of the challenges that we face is—in addition to being an open society in which individuals who are disturbed in some fashion can carry out violence against the American people—the big danger we have right now is, is that we have an organization in ISIL that is actively trying to radicalize and promote extremism of this sort. In addition, they are directly carrying out and planning constant attacks not only overseas, but within Iraq and within Syria.\nAnd so it is with great appreciation that I welcome Prime Minister Abadi here, along with his delegation. Thanks to the sacrifices of the Iraqi people and the Iraqi Armed Forces, since I last met with him face to face a year ago, we have made significant progress in rolling back ISIL. They have now lost over half of the populated territory that they had gained and were still maintaining as recently as last year. And what we've seen now is just steady progress as the Iraqi security forces have gained more confidence as they have coordinated with the 67-member coalition against ISIL.\nAnd now, what we have been discussing and what we're focusing on is to go right at the heart of the ISIL operations in Mosul. Now, this is going to be a challenging battle. Mosul is a large city, and ISIL has embedded itself deeply within that city. But because of the prepositioning of forces, because of the cooperation between the coalition and the Iraqi security forces, because of the cooperation and courage of the Kurdish Peshmerga, we feel confident that we will be in a position to move forward fairly rapidly.\nNow, it will be a tough fight. And once it is initiated, one of the things that we discussed is the importance of not just driving ISIL out of Mosul, but making sure that the population there that invariably is going to be displaced and will have suffered, and is going to be looking for warmth and food and water and shelter, that we are prepared to help provide rapid humanitarian assistance, and that we can rebuild the city in a way that assures not only ISIL does not come back, but extremist ideologies born out of desperation do not return.\nAnd so a lot of our work today is going—has been focused on making sure that that happens. I am very grateful that Prime Minister Abadi has consistently operated in a way that indicates his commitment to an inclusive Iraq that treats everybody fairly, respects human rights. And the work that we're doing with the Iraqi government will adhere to those principles, not just in the Mosul campaign, but beyond.\nBut this is going to be hard. This is going to be challenging and will require resources. We're going to be asking Congress to step up in support of this effort, and we're going to be asking other countries to step up in support of this effort.\nAnd my thanks go out not only to the Iraqi forces that have borne the brunt of the progress that's been made inside of Iraq, as well as the Kurdish Peshmerga, but also obviously our outstanding men and women in uniform. Although they are not on the front lines of the fight and not are—not involved directly in combat, it's still a dangerous area to operate. And I think Prime Minister Abadi would be the first to say that our men and women from all branches of our Armed Forces have operated with incredible effectiveness and courage in providing the training and the assistance that has allowed us to make these gains.\nSo, hopefully, by the end of this year, we will have seen further progress with respect to Mosul, and that we will continue to see further progress with respect to economic and political stabilization inside of Iraq.\nMr. Prime Minister, thank you for your good work, and thank you to all the members of your team for the excellent work that they've done, as well.\nPlease.\nPrime Minister Abadi. Thank you, Mr. President. I think Daesh is a huge threat, a terrorist threat to the whole world, not only for Iraq. Two years ago, we had been battling Daesh to protect Baghdad. Today, we are battling Daesh in the last stronghold in Mosul. And we hope within the next few months we're going to kick Daesh out of Mosul, and we'll deliver a huge blow to what Daesh believes in. This is very important to remove this terrorist organization and to crush it. It's a very dangerous organization. It has very dangerous ideology. It has very dangerous instruments and means of recruiting young people. It has a huge influence in the Internet and other social media. So they must be crushed on the ground, and our heroic fighters are doing that.\nOf course, the support which has been given to Iraqis by the United States and other coalition partners is very important for us in terms of training, logistical support, providing air cover to our fighters on the ground, and of course preventing Daesh from having more recruits and more financial support. This is very important. I think our next challenge is how we stop these terrorists from recruiting other young people from all over the world. I think we have listed something like a hundred countries where these terrorists are coming from. Some of them are not probably disadvantaged; probably some of them are from middle class families, some of them from families who are well off. So I think this a huge challenge for all of us—how we can stamp out this terrorism, which is probably affecting the whole world, and not only for Iraq. The damage in Iraq is huge due to Daesh. But the liberation of the areas, bringing refugees back to these liberated areas is a huge reward not only for these refugees, but for every one of us. This is my job, to bring all the Iraqis together, to treat all the Iraqis the same in Iraq. Now, we don't have first-class and second-class citizens in Iraq. All Iraqis are first-class citizens, regardless of their affiliation, regardless of their religion, regardless of their sect, regardless of their ethnic origin. We treat Iraqis the same. I hope everybody in Iraq will do the same.\nThere are huge challenges in Iraq. Daesh has caused a lot of damage in the relationship between communities. They have killed Yezidis, they have killed Shia, they have killed Christians, they have killed Sunnis, as well. So they have even caused divisions between the same tribe in the same area. So it's a huge task on our—I think, on our shoulder.\nWe believe in reconciliation. Mr. President, I called for national reconciliation in the day after liberation of Fallujah. And I still believe in reconciliation of the country. People have to live together. But, of course, those who have committed crimes, they have to be punished. But we have to be very careful in bringing the law. We have to follow the rule of law. And we're entitled to do that. And I think we have been managing well in the areas which we have liberated. There are excesses, which are unacceptable to us. And we are prepared, and we are very—we have the resolve to stamp them out. And we are doing this exactly.\nThank you very much for the support that was given to Iraq. And Iraq, of course, is fighting on the behalf of all the world to defeat Daesh, and we will do it soon.

Marino, R-PA, and 32 cosponsors)\nThe Administration is committed to ensuring that the regulatory process remains efficient and effective, and is tailored to further statutory goals in the most cost-effective manner. H.R. 3438 would promote unwarranted litigation, introduce harmful delay, and, in many cases, thwart implementation of statutory mandates and execution of duly enacted laws. The legislation also would increase business uncertainty and undermine much-needed protections for the American public, including critical rules that provide financial reform and protect public health, food safety, and the environment. For these reasons, the Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3438.\nThe Unnecessary Delay of Rules Act would delay the implementation of \"high-impact\" rules until all legal challenges are fully exhausted or, if there is no legal challenge, until the end of a statutorily prescribed period. H.R. 3438 would require this delay of all rules without consideration of the merits of the challenge or the consequences of delay. These \"high-impact\" rules already must adhere to the particular requirements of the statute that the agency is implementing as well as the requirements of other Federal statutes and the Constitution. Indeed, in many cases, the Congress has mandated that the agency issue the particular rule. The agency also must comply with the rulemaking requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.). When issuing a major rule, an agency also must perform analyses of benefits and costs that typically are required by one or more statutes (such as the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, and the Paperwork Reduction Act), as well as by Executive Order 12866. Furthermore, courts already have the discretion to delay rules on a case-by-case basis. Thus, the Unnecessary Delay of Rules Act is entirely unnecessary and would promote litigation designed only to delay rule implementation.\nGiven the extensive existing statutory framework already governing agency rules, the additional delays created by H.R. 3438 would needlessly endanger the welfare of the American public, while providing no benefit and creating a powerful incentive for litigation with little to no merit.\nIf the President were presented with H.R. 3438, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.", "timestamp": "2016-09-20", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 3438 – Unnecessary Delay of Rules Act"}

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119009", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n6:06 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good evening, everybody. Welcome to New York. I trust you all have been able to keep yourselves busy the last couple of days. Been a few things going on. I'm joined by a couple of special guests -- let me introduce them.\nAs many of you have written, the global refugee crisis has been a focus of this administration for more than a year now. And as you've heard me say, the President was determined to make this challenge a central theme during this year's United Nations General Assembly. That's why the President hosted the Leaders Summit on Refugees this afternoon, during which he highlighted the scale of the challenge as well as the contributions that are required to alleviate it.\nThe President also took part in a private sector roundtable to showcase what the American business community is doing to help address the refugee crisis by creatively leveraging their resources and their ingenuity. The roundtable included U.S. business leaders, representing more than 50 companies who responded to his call for action and have committed to investing, donating, or raising more than $650 million.\nSo I'm joined by some corporate leaders whose companies have made substantial pledges to this effort. This is a good illustration of the significant resources that we can mobilize when the public and private sector work together to solve a significant challenge. So the three leaders that we have here are Lila Ibrahim from Coursera; Julie Sweet from Accenture, and Jacqueline Fuller from Google.org. Each of them will share a short statement about the contributions that their companies are making, and then we'll give each of you an opportunity to ask them whatever questions that you may have. We'll let them go and then we can get on to any other business that you may have.\nSo, with that, Lila, do you want to take it from here?\nMS. IBRAHIM: Good afternoon. I'm Lila Ibrahim, Chief Operations Officer at Coursera, and I'm also a first-generation American.\nCoursera is an education focus technology company. We're founded in Silicon Valley where or headquarters remain, and our mission is to transform the lives by making top university courses available to anyone, anywhere.\nThat means we have 21 million learners from all around the world. And they're taking courses from the top universities -- think Yale, Duke, Stanford, Johns Hopkins University.\nNow, imagine you showing up on the shore of a new country, much like my parents did here in the United States. But no employer recognizes your credentials or the experience that you bring to your new country. So you look around and you realize that finding places to get reskilled or your new credential -- they're hard to access and they cost a lot. So where do you start? That's where Coursera has made a commitment to provide 100 percent financial aid for online courses from the top universities to refugees in the U.S. and around the world. And we're doing this in partnership with organizations like the United States government State Department and any nonprofit that works directly with the refugees.\nTo date, over 400 refugees have already enrolled in courses just in the past three weeks, and over 35 have actually completed courses in a short amount of time. Our ambition is to provide career-relevant skills and valuable credentials to 10,000 refugees by the end of next year. In order to achieve this goal we need more government and nonprofit, on-the-ground partners. We need them to be doing the critical work to support the refugees through these extremely difficult times.\nAs a first generation, I think about my parents own journey to the United States to pursue a better life. In fact, I'm here today as an engineer and as a business leader because my parents had the opportunity to enter a new country and to get a good education that has paid forward. For me, this announcement is extremely meaningful and why I choose to be at Coursera, because at Coursera we believe that anyone, anywhere should have the ability to transform their lives through access to quality education. We not only want to support refugees, but we're also working with similar initiatives with governments and employers to figure out how to best equip people at a time that they need it the most -- whether they're refugees, or veterans, or single mothers. With the knowledge and skills that they need to be successful, we're hoping that we can help them get new jobs, better jobs, or start their own company.\nWe're humbled and honored to work with the U.S. government and other partner organizations to help a generation of people start a new chapter and pursue a better life not only for themselves but for the generations to come.\nThank you.\nMS. SWEET: Hello. I'm Julie Sweet, the CEO of North America for Accenture. And I'm very pleased to be here with Lila and Jacqueline to talk about our commitment to the Partnership for Refugees. I first want to talk a little bit about why we are so committed to the partnership and then what we are doing.\nAnd so it's a company of 375,000 people with 50,000 in the U.S., and with a mission to improve the way the world works and lives. We feel it is our obligation, our responsibility to be a reader and take action on the most urgent and pressing needs that face the communities and countries we operate in. And I think we can all agree that there is probably no more urgent and pressing need today in communities around the world than to help in the refugee crisis.\nAs a business leader, we see a compelling case to step up and take action from three perspectives. We've all talked about the global scale of the crisis and the threat to economies, to health and security around the country. But as a business leader, we see the flip side, and that's the growth and the opportunity for tapping into the incredible potential of refugees. And as an American, we know, in a country built by immigrants, exactly how powerful that potential is.\nAnd then finally, in the third perspective, of course, it is the very uniquely human aspect of this terrible crisis -- and we've worked a lot with refugees over the last few years and heard firsthand about the devastating loss. As business leaders, we cannot erase those memories, we can't change the devastating loss, but we can provide the education and the opportunity for employment that will create a new life and the ability to have that hope and that new life.\nAnd that brings me to what we are doing, as we answered the President's call for action to the private sector. So this partnership -- public-private partnership is following a very important principle, and that is to tap into the unique capabilities of each company in order to achieve our common goal. It is not a one-size-fits-all. And earlier today, we were all in a room of CEOs and senior business leaders, and you really saw how it takes a village, the diversity of contributions that are necessary.\nWe at Accenture are focusing on three areas. First, in addition to being one of the founding members of the partnership, we became the strategic consulting partner, helping build out the platform, the website, bringing the strategy and consulting and technology advice that we give our clients to the platform -- to mobilize from 15 companies in June and a remarkable -- over 50 companies in just 90 days.\nSecond, we're focused on employment. We have had a Skills to Succeed program since 2010 that is committed to skilling or creating the skills to create their own business for three million people. And we have leveraged our expertise in helping the disadvantaged get the skills to have jobs to now focus on refugees. One of our Skills to Succeed partners, Upwardly Global, specializes on immigrants and refugees, connecting them with jobs, providing training, and the simple things like how do you interview, how do you talk about yourself when, in your own country, it might be viewed as bragging, but in the U.S., you need to talk about it differently.\nIt's sometimes the simplest things that can really make a difference, and we are committing $3 million in cash to Upwardly Global in order for them to expand in the U.S. and to have a refugee-specific curriculum and also expand globally. In addition, we're tapping into the passion of our people, who are incredibly committed and focused, and have spent already hundreds of hours working with Upwardly Global and will continue to do so.\nAnd finally, we're tapping into our innovation gene, and we are partnering with USA for UNHCR to have them be our key partner in our innovation challenge, which we do every year. Because we know the solutions we need to solve this crisis. We don't have them all today, and so we annually work with MBA students from around the country to solve critical problems, and then we commit to implement the solutions.\nAnd so I hope that this summit that we've had will not only inspire the leaders of other countries but inspire more companies, because we're at 50, but we need to be many, many more of large and small companies to really do what we need to do as a country for our refugees.\nMS. FULLER: So like Julie, let me start with some of the why. If you think about Google, we were founded by someone who came here in his youth from Russia. If you look at our CEO, he came from India. Our CFO not born in America. So Google couldn't be who we are as company without that investment and that global welcoming to immigrants.\nSo as we thought about what was happening with refugee crisis, we knew we wanted to get involved, and as we thought about, okay, how can we make the most distinct contribution -- the President today, when we were meeting earlier, made the comment, as governments, we need help with marketing around refugees; we need help with outreach. And one of the things we thought about is, we want to make sure that we are opening up the opportunity to contribute, the opportunity to do something, the opportunity to see what is happening right now as a humanitarian crisis but as an opportunity as well.\nSo we our did our first-ever global matching campaign, where we went out and said, we will match dollar-for-dollar whatever is raised for great groups on the front line like IRC, UNHCR, Maisons Sans Frontieres -- and to be perfectly honest, we had no idea how well that would go. First time ever going globally. And within two days, we had raised over $11 million. And what's interesting, it was over 175,000 people participated. The average gift was something like $25. So this is a great opportunity for people around the world to say, we want to be part of this and we want to help.\nSo that kicked off our giving and we went on to invest a total of over $16 million. and I just wanted to share a couple of the things that we've learned.\nOne, we always are concerned, we don't want to look around the world and think that technology is the silver bullet and the answer to every problem. What I'm here to tell you, with the refugee situation, especially with the need to provide education, technology really is a silver bullet. Technology really can help us bring efforts to scale.\nSo today, we're announcing a partnership with the Clooney Foundation for Justice that's going to help bring education for refugee children in Lebanon. So you take a country like Lebanon that has a largest number of Syrian refugee per capita and think about, okay, half of those are Syrian refugees, half of those refugees are children themselves, and of those children, half of them are not in school. So we need solutions that are scalable. And what that means is digital technology. That means learning, that means connectivity; that means creating new solutions. And we have done this in a few other places. We've, for example, as soon as this crisis hit, we helped provide connectivity along in the camps and along migration routes. We've provided -- we sent our teams of engineers and product managers to develop critical information such as the site refugeeinfo.eu that provides information on things like asylum.\nAnd what we've learned is that where we think companies like Google can have a lasting impact, a sustainable impact, is if we double down on education. We saw, for example, in Germany, another country that has welcomed many, many refugees, we committed to bringing 25,000 Chromebooks there to centers -- community centers, nonprofits, schools, churches, anyone who is opening their doors and working with refugees. And what we're seeing there is that in just a short amount of time, all 25,000 Chromebooks were spoken for because there are so many groups eager to help. And right now, they're reaching more than 42,000 refugees in Germany.\nSo as we think about this crisis, this opportunity, I think it's a moment for all of us to step up in generosity, and for the world to come together and to say, this is something that we can take on together in solidarity.\nThanks.\nMR. EARNEST: Thank you. Are there questions for the business leaders who are here about the contributions that they have made?\nCarol.\nQ: I'm just curious what you guys see as the main factor driving people to contribute -- what you're hearing anecdotally and kind of what's inspiring folks.\nMS. FULLER: To contribute? I mean, I'll say for us, for the campaign that we did, I mean, part of it is just being given the opportunity to do it in a way that they have trust that the nonprofits have been vetted and that their dollar is going to be impactful. I think there's a lot of goodwill around the world, globally, and people oftentimes just need an easy way and a way to give to an organization that they know is doing really great work.\nMS. IBRAHIM: At Coursera, an interesting thing happened. We have megathons, which are kind of like a hackathon, but it's not just for engineers -- it's for everyone. We do this three times a year where we give people about three days to really work on projects. So last year, our employees said, there's got to be something we can do for refugees. So they looked and found that we had over 600 people who were taking Coursera classes already that said they were a current or a former refugee. So we went and talked to our university partners, and they made some progress on coming up with an idea around Coursera for refugees. The next megathon came around, we made even more progress.\nBy that point, the entire company got behind it. So to me, it was very much about creating the time and space, and getting people together because there was an immense amount of energy and we just needed to really unleash the potential that our employees saw.\nMR. EARNEST: Other questions? Okay, thank you, ladies. Thanks for taking the time. I appreciate it.\nBefore we go to questions, the other thing that occurs to me in listening to them talk is there has been a lot in the political discourse recently about refugee policy in this country, And I think, once again, the business community -- certainly the businesses that were represented up here -- are a shining example of what the vast majority of Americans believe our values say about how we should respond to situations like this. And you also see them focused on practical solutions even to rather thorny, complex, significant challenges. But the determination that animates them is entirely consistent with the kinds of values that are essential to the founding of this country. And I think the presentations that they made are another good illustration of that.\nSo, let's go to your questions. Ben has joined me up here and we'll try to divide and conquer, and move through it this evening.\nSo, Josh, do you want to get us started?\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Let's start with the attack on the U.N. aid convoy at the Red Crescent facility. What has the U.S. learned about who was behind that and what equipment was used? And given what's happened over the past few days and the U.N. suspending the very humanitarian aid that you said is central to this deal, how can the U.S. credibly say that this ceasefire is still operational?\nMR. EARNEST: Ben, do you want to take that?\nMR. RHODES: Well, first of all, all of our information indicates clearly that this was an airstrike. That means there only could have been two entities responsible, either the Syrian regime or the Russian government. In any event, we hold the Russian government responsible for airstrikes in this space given that their commitment under the Cessation of Hostilities was to certainly ground air operations in places where humanitarian assistance is flowing. So that's the first point I'd make.\nSecond, with respect to what comes next, clearly this represents an enormous humanitarian tragedy that should be condemned. And I think you've seen condemnation from the international community here today. It presents an enormous challenge to the process that we are seeking to implement through the agreement.\nSecretary Kerry was able to meet today with the International Support Group for Syria -- that's a group of countries that we generally coordinate with in terms of our approach to the situation in Syria. The uniform view around that table is that we need to continue to determine whether or not the Cessation of Hostilities can continue. The preference is to see if it can, given that it offers right now the best opportunity to provide for an opening to reduce the violence and address the humanitarian concerns.\nThat doesn't mean we're not significantly concerned by the complete failure to demonstrate good faith on the Russian side. It just means that we're going to continue to review the circumstances with our closest partners, speak very directly to Russia about whether or not it's serious about pursuing the terms of the agreement, test whether or not we can make any progress in the coming days. If we can, we believe that that's the preferable course of action. If we can't, then clearly we will not be able to move forward with the terms of the agreement.\nIn any event, the type of military cooperation that Russia has sought under the agreement, that has to await the implementation. And so that's obviously something that we would need to see results before moving forward.\nMR. EARNEST: Toluse.\nQ: I wanted to ask about the 9/11 bill that the President has on his desk. Does he plan to veto that? And there has been some reports from the Senate -- Senate Republicans saying that the White House hasn't done very much to cooperate or try to negotiate to find an agreement on what would be acceptable to the White House.\nMR. EARNEST: Toluse, the President will veto this legislation. I don't have an update for you in terms of timing, but as soon as the President has put pen to paper, we'll be sure and let all of you know.\nWhite House officials and other senior officials on the President's national security team have engaged members of Congress and their staffs in both parties in both Houses of Congress, and we've acknowledged from the beginning that there's a steep hill to climb to address the concerns that we have raised about this legislation. As we've made this case, members of Congress in both parties have indicated that they are open to the concerns that we've expressed -- in many cases, they share them. And the real question for members of Congress will be whether or not they're prepared to cast a vote that is consistent with the views and feelings that they express in private.\nThat doesn't apply to every member of Congress. Some members of Congress are not open to our position, but some are. And those members of Congress and their staffs have been the focus of our efforts. And we're going to continue that engagement up to and through the President vetoing this legislation, in the hopes that we can find an alternative that preserves the effective response that we've already designed to counter state sponsors of terrorism.\nRather than leaving that designation subject to individual decisions by individual judges that could result in contradictory outcomes, we believe the process that we have in place is the most forceful way to respond to state sponsors of terrorism. That is a specific designation by the United States government that applies across the board that subjects these countries to sanctions; that subjects these countries to the kind of isolation that is faced by countries around the world that are subject to U.S. sanctions.\nSo this is obviously something that the President takes quite seriously. He's also concerned about the potential impact that this could have in terms of the concept of sovereign immunity. The United States benefits from sovereign immunity more than any other country in the world because the United States uses our influence in the international community more than any other country in the world. And to pass a piece of legislation that would open up our diplomats and our servicemembers and even American businesses to potential lawsuits in courts all around the world is foolish.\nSo we're going to continue to make this case. We already have. We'll continue to make it. And at some point, members of Congress will face a question about whether or not their vote that they cast in public reflects the views that they've articulated in private.\nRon.\nQ: What is the administration's explanation for the Inspector General finding that there were some 800 people who were slated for deportation who were granted citizenship? Given the national security concerns and concerns about immigration, what do you intend to do about it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Ron, the thing that I can tell you is that this is something that DHS is continuing to look at. Some of the reporting on this was not -- well, frankly, was not quite accurate. Questions were raised about whether or not these individuals were eligible to gain citizenship and there were potential disqualifiers. So that's why DHS is going back to take a close look at the records. It's clear that there needs to be an improvement in terms of digitizing some of the fingerprint records that have been collected. There is important progress on that scale that has already been made.\nQuite frankly, additional progress would have been made had sufficient resources been appropriated by Congress to complete that effort. So we certainly would like to see Congress support DHS's ongoing efforts to address some of the problems in the system.\nQ: So what is the scale of the problem, if you're blaming inaccurate reporting? The reporting suggested there are 800 people who fall into this category. How many are there? Are there none? Are you saying that -- you've said on many occasions how secure the system of vetting refugees and others is, and -- different category of people, but --\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, it's a different system, so we shouldn't conflate the two. But, look, Ron, we obviously are -- we take these kinds of reports quite seriously, and we're going to pursue necessary reforms. In some cases -- the reform that we know is needed is to complete the effort to digitize these fingerprint records. We need additional resources to get that done. So Congress is going to need to step up to the plate and provide additional resources.\nWith regard to the 800 individuals, we obviously are engaged in an effort to go back and take a look at their cases. Questions have been raised about whether or not they are eligible. It doesn't mean they are ineligible. But that's what DHS is working to determine and if they are ineligible then obviously will take the necessary action.\nQ: So given your analysis that's still ongoing, are you -- there seems to be a big problem in the system. Are you willing to admit that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there are questions that have been raised about the system that are included in the report. There certainly are some reforms that could be implemented if Congress is prepared to step up to the plate and provide the necessary resources. But I think that's what the findings show.\nI think the last thing that I would assert is the administration certainly takes seriously the consideration that is made in terms of protecting our national security when it comes to our immigration system. National security is the President's top priority. Protecting our homeland is the top priority. And that's true whether it's the refugee program; that's also true when it comes to pursuing immigration reform more broadly. And that's one factor in the significant disappointment that the President's expressed about how Republicans in Congress blocked the passage of comprehensive immigration reform that would have improved border security and would have focused our law enforcement resources on those individuals that actually do pose a threat to our national security.\nSo there certainly is more that can be done to fix our broken immigration system. But many of the reforms that we've pursued have been blocked by Congress.\nQ: If I could just ask one more. In the current -- the Rahami case, is the President concerned about these reports that the FBI or law enforcement officials in some way had contact with this family some time ago, two years ago, yet this is still -- this kind of event is still able to happen? Is there some -- what's the level of concern about that set of circumstances in this particular case?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the FBI has acknowledged that they had had contact with this individual. The extent of that contact and what prompted that interaction between law enforcement and this individual is something that's still being reviewed by the FBI.\nIt's important to remember that this is an individual that is a United States citizen. So this person, in his interaction with law enforcement, is entitled to rights. And law enforcement has a responsibility not just to protect the country, but also to protect the rights of every American citizen.\nSo the President is confident that the Department of Justice and the FBI will go back and review the interactions that this individual had with law enforcement to determine if there is something different that could have been done or should have been done to prevent the violence that we saw over the weekend.\nChristi.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Ben, going into tomorrow's meeting with Netanyahu, could you talk a little bit -- just take stock of where U.S.-Israeli relations are? It's been kind of a rocky road between these two leaders, but where do you think things stand right now? And can you also address the question of whether the President is planning to lay out a framework for Mideast peace before he leaves office?\nMR. RHODES: Well, first of all, I think as we take stock, you'll note, of course, that we just recently concluded a new 10-year MOU to provide the largest foreign assistance package to another country in our history. This builds on I think what has been the very firm foundation of the relationship, which is the security partnership. And I think Prime Minister Netanyahu, even in areas and times when we've had differences on other issues, has always made clear that President Obama has done as much for Israel's security as any other President.\nAnd so whether it's our commitment to Iron Dome and missile defense systems that have saved Israeli lives, our intelligence sharing relationships, our ability to have consistent dialogue with the Israeli security services, and this long-term MOU, I think President Obama has demonstrated a commitment to that foundation of Israel's security.\nSo that's kind of the -- I think certainly been a hallmark of the last eight years. At the same time, we've had differences on issues. In particular, we have been concerned about some of the trends as it relates to the prospect of peace. We've been concerned about continued settlement activity, the potential viability of a Palestinian state in the face of that settlement activity. And we've raised those directly with the Israeli government. I'm sure President Obama will do so tomorrow as well.\nWe do so because we believe that, ultimately, Israel will be most secure if there is a two-state solution and they can live side-by-side in peace and security with an independent and sovereign and sovereign Palestine.\nSo this is an issue where I think we've, once again, in addition to the efforts to promote peace in the past, we've taken our concerns to the Israeli government as we've seen this uptick in settlement activity over the course of the last years or so.\nOn other issues -- obviously the Iran issue has been a preeminent one at times in our relationship. I think, frankly, our assessment right now is that with the JCPOA in place, and with the ability, through the IAEA to clearly monitor and verify Iran's commitment to following through on its commitments in the JCPOA, and with the fact that Iran's nuclear program has been substantially rolled back, that issue has been less of an area of tension in our relationship. That's not to say Prime Minister Netanyahu supports the Iran deal, but I do think that certainly we've seen comments from the Israeli security establishment that have noted the benefits of the nuclear deal. So that has not been the issue of prominence that it was a year or two ago.\nSo I think tomorrow they'll discuss the security package, they'll discuss the MOU and our cooperation now and into the future. I think we'll discuss the Palestinian issue, of course, and our concerns about some of the trends that we're seeing. I'm sure they'll discuss regional issues like Iran and what Israel is dealing with in a very tough neighborhood, given the conflict in Syria, and issues along their borders.\nIn terms of our own plans going forward, we don't have plans for the President to pursue a new initiative at this point. We do want to raise our concerns directly with the Israeli government, and the President said in his speech today that he does not believe that, ultimately, it's in the interests of Israel to continue an occupation and to continue settlement activities.\nSo I think that this will be a good opportunity -- they haven't in a while -- for them to discuss the progress that's been made but also discuss some of these areas where we've had differences.\nQ: Kind of came together at the last minute. Can you say anything about why the meeting? And is this -- is it fair to say this is the last time they'll meet?\nMR. RHODES: Well I think the reason why principally is the completion of the MOU. It's been an area of intense focus of our teams -- Susan Rice leading that effort out of the White House. Given very substantial commitment on our part -- $38 billion over 10 years -- to include a commitment to Israel's qualitative military edge, and certain capabilities that we have worked through with them in determining how they deal with threats in their region, it was a good basis for the two leaders to note that progress, to discuss that security cooperation, and also have an opportunity to review other issues in the region and around the world, including our concerns on the Palestinian issue.\nI never say never with respect to future meetings with the Israeli Prime Minister. It's certainly the last one that we anticipate, but given how close our relationship is, events can always precipitate a meeting.\nQ: The President was pretty careful yesterday in his statement not to use the word \"terrorism\" when addressing the New York and New Jersey attacks, although he did mention that that was something the FBI was investigating in Minnesota. Is there a reason for that? And would he use that word now that the man has been arrested?\nAnd secondly, for Ben, would you be able to give us a little bit more of a readout on the Nigerian meeting, in addition to what the President said?\nMR. EARNEST: Jeff, I think based on the indications that we have seen so far, it does appear that this is an act of terrorism, and that's why the investigation is being conducted the way that it is. Obviously, the situation yesterday when the President addressed it, it was still quite fluid. But, look, we've obviously -- in the last 24 hours or so since the President addressed it, there's a lot more that we've learned about this particular situation and the individual who is responsible.\nThere's still, however, is a lot more investigative work that needs to be done to learn more about this individual, to learn more about who he was associating with, to learn more about who he was communicating with. We obviously want to ensure we understand exactly, as much as can, about what may have been motivating him. That's part of an investigation that will keep the country safe. It also is an opportunity for us to learn some lessons and, with regard to the questions that Ron was asking earlier, if there is something different that law enforcement could have done or should have done, that's a question that they obviously want to carefully consider in this situation given their previous interactions with him.\nI think that addresses your question. Ben, you want to take the part.\nMR. RHODES: Yes, quickly Jeff, I wasn't in the meeting so we can see if someone can give you a more detailed readout. I would just reinforce what the President said about the fact that we're very committed to the success of the Buhari administration. Nigeria had a peaceful, democratic transition that I think surprised some people, frankly, given the enormous challenges in the country, and President Buhari has, I think, shown real leadership in trying to set out on a path of reform.\nWe continue to provide assistance as it relates to their efforts to combat terrorism, particularly Islamic State's branch in Nigeria, formerly Boko Haram, and so there is a discussion around how to increase our counterterrorism cooperation. We also, again, want to see the success of some of the reform efforts that President Buhari's pursued in the country, and so they were able to discuss ways in which the United States, which has a significant trade and assistance relationship with Nigeria, can help play a role in supporting efforts to improve the lives of the people of Nigeria and strengthen its institutions.\nAnd tomorrow morning, we have the Africa Business Summit, which is going to focus on ways in which we can continue to increase trade and investment -- two-way trade and investment between the United States and Africa generally. Nigeria is one of the countries of focus that will be discussed at that summit and so, one of the other items is, how can we make sure that our approach to development is also taking advantage of the opportunities in Africa for increased trade and investment which raises standards of living in countries like Nigeria but also creates markets for our goods in the long run.\nQ: A couple questions for Ben. Ben, you said that you didn't expect the President to pursue a new peace initiative at this point, but would you rule out that he could, at some point between now and when he leaves, lay down some kind of a framework or a road map or some sense for how a future president and future people in the Middle East could pursue a peace agreement, either in a speech or some other format?\nAnd then secondly, on the meeting the President had with Premier Li, I'm wondering how hard the President pressed the Chinese leader on the need for tougher sanctions on North Korea in the wake of the nuclear test, and whether the President is satisfied with the response he's gotten from the Chinese so far on their willingness to cooperate in something like that.\nMR. RHODES: So with respect to Middle East peace, I wouldn't rule out the President taking any particular step on the issue. What I would say is his test has always been can I make a positive difference by engaging on the Israeli-Palestinian issue. We've tried multiple tactics, none of them have succeeded, given the fact that the parties themselves have been unable to come together.\nSo I think that he'll want to, obviously, discuss these issues Prime Minister Netanyahu. We're not currently engaged in the type of diplomatic initiative that we have been at different junctures of the administration. In terms of what he says about the issue before he leaves office, again, I think he'd want to make a determination about how can he be most constructive in supporting a vision that he cares about, which is an Israel that has security and peace with the Palestinian people and a Palestine that is sovereign and independent.\nSo we really haven't pursued any particular initiative on this. We'll want to continue to express or preference, which is that the parties themselves negotiate an agreement.\nAnd your second question?\nQ: Just about the sanctions --\nMR. RHODES: Look, we've seen very strong statements of condemnation from China about North Korea's recent nuclear test. We've had extensive discussions with them at a variety of levels. For us, we want to see, first of all, the full implementation of the existing U.N. Security Council resolution and we want to discuss appropriate responses to this cycle of provocations, which could include additional sanctions. And we want China to understand that in the long run it is going to be less secure if we see this pattern of provocation out of North Korea both because of the instability of having a nation like North Korea pursuing a nuclear program and a ballistic missile program, but also, frankly, because there are things that China objects to like our deployment of the THAAD missile defense system that we have an obligation to deploy in the face of these provocations.\nAnd so that's something that President Obama discussed at length with President Li. It wasn't the focus of what was not a lengthy meeting with the Premier but it's something that we're making clear at every level. And thus far, I don't think we can be satisfied because of the fact that we continue to have the cycle of provocation out of North Korea. I think China has grown more serious, they've taken steps that they've never taken before in terms of the previous U.N. Security Council resolution and the nature of their condemnations of North Korea's actions. But we want to continue to see follow-up from them.\nQ: Two questions. One, you said earlier on the ceasefire in Syria that you guys were going to test in coming days whether Russia was serious. Can you describe a little bit about what you mean by that? What specific things would show that they are serious or show that they're not serious, given what happened this week?\nMR. RHODES: Well, this was completely contrary to the agreement and an outrageous attack on people who were trying to save lives. And Russia had agreed to having its own airstrikes and Syria regime airstrikes grounded certainly in areas where we're trying to provide humanitarian assistance.\nIn terms of how we test going forward, the principal way is whether there is a commitment to follow through on the grounding of the Syrian air force and the cessation of Russian airstrikes in areas where terrorist organizations are not operating, and certainly areas where we're seeking to provide humanitarian assistance. So that capacity to demonstrate a period of calm and to cease the bombardment of civilian areas or areas where moderate opposition elements are present -- that is the principal test of seriousness.\nLook, we take very seriously this outrageous attack. We feel the responsible thing to do is to consult with all of our partners. And that's what Secretary Kerry did today with the meeting with the ISSG. All of them, including some very tough critics of the Assad regime around that table, still believe that the preferable course is to see whether this agreement can be implemented.\nAnd so there's a desire to continue to try to test whether or not we can get a true period of calm from the different nations that have made up the support network for the Syrian people and the Syrian opposition that we work with. But I think we'll be able to tell whether or not today was an indication that there's just no good faith in terms of implementing the agreement, or whether or not there's a recognition that the only way out of the political, humanitarian and security crisis in Syria is some form of negotiated settlement that stops the violence, allows humanitarian assistance and gets the parties back to the negotiating table.\nQ: -- do you have a different measure now for testing this -- because there's not some larger consequence that -- because you went into this agreement and this happened. And so you're saying you would go back into an agreement. How would you guarantee that?\nMR. RHODES: It's the same metric which we said at the beginning, which is whether or not there is a true commitment to the reduction of violence and a period of calm and allowing for humanitarian assistance.\nClearly this is completely contrary and in violation of that agreement. The question is whether or not we just walk away from the table completely at this point, or whether or not we do some more diplomacy and consultation to determine whether or not there is some path forward.\nAnd so, again, we're still in the early stages of responding to this, consulting with our partners. At this point, again, I just don't want to close door to the possibility that we can get back to the type of agreement that was negotiated. If we can't, we'll walk away. And there certainly is not going to be military cooperation between the United States and Russia as it relates to targeting Al-Nusra elements and ISIL unless and until we see an implementation of the agreement.\nSo our end of the bargain here was to have that military cooperation established on the back end of a period of calm. And given that we hadn't seen that, we certainly have not initiated that cooperation.\nQ: Separate topic. The two presidential candidates had some meetings with foreign leaders here. Do you find that to be helpful, unhelpful? Do you think that, I mean, you obviously are -- it's the former Secretary of State -- the President's former Secretary of State. There's close communication between the campaign. Do you get a readout of what those discussions entail? And do you find it interesting the Donald Trump met with the leader of Egypt?\nMR. RHODES: The fact of presidential candidates meeting with foreign leaders is certainly something that we have absolutely no problem with. When then-Senator Obama was running for President and I was working for him, we met with a number of foreign leaders, including Prime Minister Netanyahu, who was then in the opposition -- including presidents and prime ministers on his foreign travel.\nSo I think it's a tradition. I think it's useful for candidates to have an understanding of what some of the issues are that are shaping the international agenda. But they are not conducting foreign policy. So these are decisions that they make on their own, and we do not see that as, in any way, an extension of the work that we're doing on behalf of the American people.\nQ: So on the ceasefire, given the things that Russia has done and said over the last couple of days, I guess it's hard to see how there is good faith and goodwill there. But today, the Kremlin said that they see little hope of renewing the ceasefire. Would you say that? Do you see this as unlikely?\nMR. RHODES: Look, I want to be very clear here. We have not seen good faith. This was an outrageous action. We believe that Russia bears responsibility given, again, the fact that this was an air strike, and only they or the Syrian regime would be conducting such a strike, and it was in an area where we knew humanitarian aid was being delivered. And this is critical -- this was not something that is not coordinated. When a convoy goes in, there is very clear information provided to different parties about where they're going to be and when they're going to be there. And so we find it to be completely contrary to the agreement that was negotiated, and a further demonstration of the type of bombardment and disrespect for innocent civilian life that we've seen from the Syrian regime and its Russian sponsor for a long time now.\nSo I do believe it puts in serious -- raises serious questions about whether or not this agreement goes forward. I'm just not closing the door on the possibility that, in our consultations with other countries and with Russia, we might not try to pursue a ceasefire because, frankly, it's the only path forward that can truly achieve a political resolution to the Syrian conflict.\nThis isn't the first framework that we've tried to pursue for a Cessation of Hostilities and, in conflicts like this, I think we have an obligation to continue to try to find whether there are diplomatic openings to make progress. If was can't, we walk away. As I was saying to Carol, our commitment under this agreement was to engage in military cooperation with Russia after there was a demonstrated period of calm, and we have not done that yet. And so, unless and until we see a period of calm actually take hold, and those flights ground, and the humanitarian aid delivered, we're not going to move forward with our end of the bargain, which was to cooperate on efforts against ISIL and Nusra.\nQ: But the Kremlin is saying that there's little hope of it being renewed. Would you say that on its face that is bad faith? Or are you not putting too much store --\nMR. RHODES: I'd put a lot more -- I'd pay a lot more attention to the fact that there was a bombardment of an aid convoy. That to me is the bad faith. That's something that needs to be answered for. And frankly, if Russia is serious about its expressed concerns about that action, it would ground the Syrian air force in these areas, and ground its own airstrikes in these areas, and show that it's seriously committed to allowing for a better future for the Syrian people.\nSo that I think is ultimately what gives us our own assessment that we do not see Russia acting in good faith at this point.\nQ: And just quickly -- oh, I'm sorry.\nMR. EARNEST: Go ahead.\nQ: I was just going to ask, what can you say about any interaction with Rouhani?\nMR. RHODES: We have no planned interaction with President Rouhani, and I'm not aware that there was any.\nMR. EARNEST: Mark.\nQ: Yes, Josh, I'm still confused on the Israeli-Palestinian thing. I want to come back to that for a second. There have been a series of reports since March that the President is considering, perhaps as a parting gesture, hoping to leave something for a future administration, an outline, some kind of a framework for what a future deal might look like. Were they wrong? Is he still considering that? Has he shelved the idea? Is it still a possibility?\nMR. RHODES: Look, I think most of those reports were speculation, frankly, about what are the different options available to us. We do not have any particular plan to pursue that course of action. Over the course of the last eight years, basically everything you could consider as it relates to the Israeli-Palestinian issue we have. So I don't want to suggest that we've never discussed different things that the President could do to move the ball forward. But we're not coming to this meeting tomorrow or moving forward in the coming weeks with a plan for the President to take a particular action on this issue.\nI just also don't want to stand here and say we're going to rule out the President speaking to the Israeli-Palestinian issue in any more detailed way before he leaves office because ultimately, we'll make a judgment based on whether or not he believes that that would be constructive in pursuit of the outcome we want to see, which is a negotiated two-state settlement.\nQ: Back to North Korean sanctions. Can you talk about the news story about the Chinese company which may be exporting the material to North Korea? I think the newspapers (inaudible.) Is the U.S. coordinating with the Chinese on this issue?\nMR. RHODES: I'm not familiar with this specific report. We do believe that China has an obligation to implement fully the sanctions that have been passed at the U.N. Security Council resolution, including preventing the export to North Korea of a variety of goods and technologies. When we see concerns about that we do raise them directly with China, but I'm not familiar with this specific report.\nQ: With regard to U.N. Security Council resolution on the nuclear test ban that you were circulating, I was just wondering what you have to say about it. Is it -- was it designed to be legally binding at first, I mean, in your intention? And what does it have to do with your --\nMR. RHODES: So as the President said in his speech today, we believe that all nations should reinforce the norm against the testing of nuclear weapons. And we believe that acting through the U.N. Security Council resolution will send a strong message that the international community is committed to reinforcing the norm against the testing of nuclear weapons.\nIt is a part of our broader policy. When we came here in 2009, the President shared a U.N. Security Council session, and we had a resolution that essentially embraced a framework of the agenda he had laid out in Prague. We've invested a lot in that effort since. First, our own efforts to reduce our stockpiles through the New START Treaty; certainly the long commitment to stopping the spread of nuclear weapons to Iran through diplomacy, which also was an effort that very much had its roots here in the U.N. General Assembly in 2009; but also strengthening international norms again proliferation. And at a time when North Korea is testing nuclear devices, it's all the more imperative that the world expresses its commitment to ban testing.\nNow, in terms of the force of law for the United States, ultimately, we believe that the Senate should ratify CTBT. That's clearly not going to happen this year or -- the likelihood of that happening soon is slim. However, what we want to accomplish through this process is to have that clear expression of support for the ban on testing to reinforce the norm through the U.N. Security Council, and to, frankly, isolate those like North Korea, who are operating outside of norm -- the norm against the testing of nuclear weapons.\nMR. EARNEST: Thanks a lot, everybody. Have a nice evening.\nEND 7:06 P.M.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "note": "As prepared for delivery.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119192", "text": "Thank you. It's wonderful to be back in North Carolina.\nCome November 8, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.\nWe are going to bring back your jobs.\nWe are going to cut your taxes.\nWe are going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals.\nAnd we are going to protect our country from Radical Islamic Terrorism.\nOver the weekend, there were Islamic terrorist attacks in Minnesota and New York City, and in New Jersey. These attacks were made possible because of our extremely open immigration system, which fails to properly vet and screen the individuals or families coming into our country.\nAttack after attack – from 9/11 to San Bernardino to Orlando – we have seen how failures to screen who is entering the United States puts all of our citizens in danger.\nSo let me state this very clearly: immigration security is national security.\nMy opponent has the most open borders policy of anyone ever to seek the presidency. As Secretary of State, she allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released into our communities because their home countries wouldn't take them back.\nNow Obama wants to bring in an additional 110,000 refugees, and Hillary wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. Altogether, Hillary Clinton's plan would bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term – with no effective way to screen or vet them. Her plan would cost $400 billion dollars in terms of lifetime welfare and entitlement costs.\nThis isn't just a matter of terrorism, but also quality of life. We want to make sure we are only admitting people into our country who love our country.\nMy highest duty as President is to protect our citizens and to uphold the Constitution of the United States. I will honor that duty to the fullest extent every single day – and I will never waver in that sacred obligation.\nIt's just a plain fact that our current immigration system makes no real attempt to determine the views of the people entering. Since 9/11, hundreds of immigrants and their children have been implicated in terrorism and terrorist-related activity in the United States.\nNow we learn that another 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted citizenship despite pending deportation orders. This is unacceptable.\nAltogether, there are nearly 1 million individuals in the United States with deportation orders who have not yet been removed.\nIn the 20th Century, the United States defeated Fascism, Nazism, and Communism.\nNow we must defeat Radical Islamic Terrorism.\nYet, my opponent won't even say the words Radical Islamic Terrorism. In fact, Hillary Clinton talks tougher about my supporters than she does about Islamic terrorists. She calls the patriotic Americans who support our campaign – many of them cops and soldiers – deplorable and irredeemable. Has she ever talked that way about Radical Islam, or about those who oppress and murder women and gays overseas? Has Hillary Clinton ever called people who support these practices deplorable and irredeemable? In many countries overseas, non-believers face the death penalty – where is Hillary's condemnation here?\nLet's ask Hillary Clinton: how many people who subscribe to Radical Islamic views, and support the oppression of non-believers, would you call deplorable or irredeemable – or are those words reserved only for hardworking Americans that truly love their country and that support Donald Trump?\nAmerica can never elect a President, like Hillary Clinton, who apparently, with her choice of words, thinks decent American citizens are a bigger threat than Radical Islamic Terrorists.\nAnyone who cannot name our enemy, is not fit to lead this country. Anyone who cannot condemn the hatred, oppression and violence of Radical Islam lacks the moral clarity to serve as our President.\nThe commander-in-chief of this nation must speak with moral clarity and conviction. Our system of government is the best in the world and, as your President, I will defend our values – and speak out against all those who assault our values in any way.\nIt's also time to remember one very important word: accountability. All this disaster with ISIS happened on Hillary Clinton's watch.\nHer policies in Iraq, Libya and Syria are responsible for the rise of ISIS. Her attacks on me are all meant to deflect from her record of unleashing this monstrous evil upon us.\nHer timetable withdrawal from Iraq, her push for regime change in Libya and Syria, her open borders policies – these are the actions that unleashed the ISIS disaster.\nSo she will say and do anything to distract from that record of total failure.\nHer claim that my opposition to Radical Islamic Terrorism is a recruiting tool, demonstrates a level of ignorance about the terror threat that is disqualifying.\nWhen she says my opposition to radical Islamic Terror provides \"aid and comfort,\" to the enemy, we know that Hillary Clinton has once again demonstrated that she is dangerously unfit for office. Her comments are not only reckless, but beneath the dignity of the office she seeks.\nISIS is torturing, murdering, executing and exterminating people in a campaign of genocide. And what is Hillary Clinton's suggestion? That we should censor our vocabulary so as not to upset these butchers. I have news for Hillary Clinton: refusing to call out Radical Islam will not lessen the danger, it will only increase and embolden the danger – just like we have seen during her disastrous and failed tenure as Secretary of State.\nThe rise of ISIS is Hillary Clinton's foreign policy legacy.\nSecretary Clinton has helped to topple regimes, displace millions, and then opened the door to ISIS to enter our country. How is this a smart policy?\nHillary Clinton's decisions overseas have left us with the threat we face today – and her immigration policies will invite this threat onto our shores.\nWe must stop the massive inflow of refugees – which Hillary Clinton is trying to drastically increase. We should temporarily suspend immigration entirely from regions where safe and adequate screening cannot occur.\nPew polling shows that in many of the countries from which we draw large numbers of immigrants, extreme views about religion – such as the death penalty for those who leave the faith– are commonplace.\nIt is the job of a responsible government to admit only those who we expect to succeed and flourish here, and to become part of our incredible home. Hillary Clinton disagrees with this common sense rule, and it's one more reason why she can never be President.\nIt's time to break with the corruption, the bad judgement, and the failures of the past.\nIt is time to have a new American Future.\nWe are going to change our immigration system to reflect American values.\nWe are going to stop the policy of regime change overseas, and instead focus on working with our allies on a military campaign to utterly destroy ISIS and defeat Islamic terrorism. This will not only require military warfare, but also financial warfare, cyber warfare, and ideological warfare.\nBut to win this struggle, we need to be strong at home.\nWe are going to rebuild our country.\nAnd at the center of that effort will be the rebuilding of our inner cities.\nNearly 4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty, including 45% of African-American children under the age of six. 58% of African-American youth are not working.\nViolent crime rose in America's fifty largest cities last year. Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.\nMore than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January of this year.\nThe schools are failing, the jobs are leaving, and millions are trapped in poverty.\nTo the African-American community, I say: vote for Donald J. Trump. I will fix it – I will bring back your jobs, I will fix your schools, and I will fight for you as no one ever has before.\nIt is time for a new civil rights agenda, one that promises safe communities, great education, and good-paying jobs.\nMy whole life has been about creating jobs. Hillary Clinton has spent her career destroying jobs – just look at upstate New York, and her terrible trade deals.\nHillary Clinton supported NAFTA, she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization, and she supported the job-killing deal with South Korea that she helped to push through.\nThe South Korean deal was supposed to create 70,000 jobs – instead, we lost 100,000 jobs and our trade deficit with South Korea has more than doubled.\nNext, Hillary Clinton wants the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\nYour state has lost more than 4 in 10 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA. I am going to renegotiate this disastrous deal – and if we don't get the deal we want, I will walk away.\nOur trade deficit is now nearly $800 billion a year – this is the economic legacy of Hillary Clinton.\nBut we are going to turn it all around.\nMy economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: Jobs, Jobs, Jobs.\nI am going to lower your taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to create American energy independence; I'm going to make our government lean, responsible and efficient; I'm going to fix our terrible trade deals and defend American workers; I'm going to rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; and I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution of the United States;\nWe will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.\nAmerican cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.\nAmerican steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.\nAmerican hands will rebuild this nation – and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.\nWe will put new American steel into the spine of this country.\nI will fight for every neglected part of this nation – and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\nIt is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.\nJobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing onto our shores.\nOnce more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.\nWe Will Make America Wealthy Again.\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\nThank you, and God Bless!", "timestamp": "2016-09-20", "title": "Remarks at High Point University in High Point, North Carolina"}
{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119375", "text": "Dear Wells Fargo Customers,\nIn America, we have faith that when we open up a checking account, we aren't opening ourselves up to being scammed.  Whether you use a local credit union or community bank or one of the big national chains, we take it for granted that those institutions are fulfilling this basic responsibility to their consumers.\nThat's why I was deeply disturbed when, last week, we found out that Wells Fargo had engaged in widespread illegal practices over many years.  The bank secretly opened up millions of accounts for customers without their consent – betraying their customers, misusing their personal information and leading many to be slapped with unjust fees and other charges. Today, Wells Fargo's CEO will appear before Congress. He owes all of you a clear explanation as to how this happened under his watch.\nThere is simply no place for this kind of outrageous behavior in America.\nOur economy depends on a strong and safe banking system to help keep it moving.  But even after Americans spent years working hard to recover from the Great Recession, the culture of misconduct and recklessness that preceded that crisis too often persists.\nI have a plan to address it.\nFirst, we need to defend the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  The unfair and abusive practices at Wells Fargo remind us that we need tough watchdogs looking out for customers.  The CFPB worked with local authorities and enforced the law – assessing its highest penalty ever, and bringing the bank's illegal activity into the national spotlight.\nDonald Trump, the Republican Party, and Wall Street lobbyists are desperate to dismantle this effective agency, which is dedicated solely to protecting consumers from unfair and deceptive practices.  I won't let them put the CFPB under their thumb.  I'll protect the CFPB and make sure it can continue its essential work on behalf of the American people.\nSecond, we need real consequences when firms on Wall Street break the law. This past week, we learned that one of the Wells Fargo executives that oversaw the division that ripped off its customers left the bank – not with a pink slip, but with a $125 million payout.  It's hard to imagine that top executives were unaware of a problem that involved thousands of the firm's employees.  After all, they imposed sales targets and compensation incentives in ways that led to this behavior.  And it's frustrating that a bank can simply pay a fine and keep doing business as usual – with massive compensation for the executives responsible.  That compensation should be clawed back.\nI've put forward an agenda to enhance accountability on Wall Street. Executives should be held individually accountable when rampant illegal activity happens on their watch.  Their compensation should take a hit if their companies pay major fines.  And they must face appropriate legal consequences if they break the law.\nThird, we need to make sure that no financial institution is too big to manage.  I'll put additional safeguards in place to address the risks that the big banks continue to pose to our system.  And if any bank can't be managed effectively, it should be broken up.\nI'll appoint regulators who will stand with taxpayers and consumers, not with big banks and their friends in Congress.  I'll fight hard to make sure that Wall Street is working for Main Street – not the other way around.\nWe need to keep pushing to make the financial system safer and fairer. Let's do it together.\nSincerely,\nHillary Clinton", "timestamp": "2016-09-20", "title": "Hillary Clinton's Open Letter to Wells Fargo Customers"}

The Summit built on a meeting earlier in the day to mobilize private sector resources to address this same crisis Based on commitments received prior to the Summit, the results are as follows:\nFifty-two countries and international organizations participated in the Summit, announcing commitments that cumulatively increased their total 2016 financial contributions to UN appeals and international humanitarian organizations by approximately $4.5 billion over 2015 levels; roughly doubled the number of refugees they resettled or afforded other legal channels of admission in 2016; created improved access to education for one million refugee children globally; and, improved access to lawful work for one million refugees globally.\nOver the course of 2016, 11 of the countries participating in the Summit have at least doubled their financial contributions for humanitarian assistance as compared to last year, with four countries committing to at least ten times more this year than in 2015. Notably, several new countries have pledged to maintain substantially higher rates of humanitarian financing for multiple years. Additionally, at least 18 countries across four continents committed to starting or significantly expanding UNHCR-facilitated third-country resettlement programs, or announced plans to significantly increase their admission of refugees based on family reunification, scholarships, or humanitarian visas. Seven countries committed to resettle and/or admit at least ten times more refugees than they did in 2015.\nTo achieve the Summit's goal of improving refugees' access to education, 17 major refugee-hosting countries pledged to help increase refugees' school enrollment, including by constructing new classrooms, training and hiring new teachers, and certifying and streamlining refugee education programs that previously offered only informal education or education using foreign curricula. Fifteen countries also committed to take concrete action to improve refugees' ability to work lawfully by adopting policies that permit refugees to start their own businesses, expanding or enacting policies that allow refugees to live outside camps, making agricultural land available, and issuing the documents necessary to work lawfully.\nThe Summit also showcased two new platforms that will improve the international community's ability to share more equitably the responsibility for protecting refugees. The World Bank announced the Global Crisis Response Platform, which will provide low- and middle-income countries hosting large refugee populations with access to financing on favorable terms for projects to benefit both refugees and their host communities. The United States intends to contribute at least $50 million over the next five years to the Platform's middle income facility, subject to the availability of appropriations, above and beyond the $25 million contribution we announced earlier. This will leverage three to four times as much in low cost financing. We also look forward to supporting the facility for low income countries later this year as part of our broader replenishment of the World Bank's fund for the poorest countries. Additionally, the United States helped to establish the Emergency Resettlement Country Joint Support Mechanism (ERCM) – a joint project of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) – which will provide both financial and technical assistance to countries that are interested in establishing or expanding refugee resettlement programs.\nThe Summit built on efforts by the international community throughout 2016 to mobilize resources and strengthen the systems required to meet the growing need of refugees, including: the London Conference on Supporting Syria and the Region, the UNHCR resettlement conference in Geneva, the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul, and the UN Summit on Large Movements of Refugees and Migrants.\nU.S. Contributions to the Refugee Crisis\nProtecting and assisting refugees is a foreign policy priority and a proud tradition for the United States. Since 1975 the United States has resettled more than 3.2 million refugees representing more than 70 nationalities. We increased the number of refugees resettled annually in the United States from 70,000 in 2015 to 85,000 this year, and, as recently announced, have established an admissions target of 110,000 in fiscal year (FY) 2017. The United States has also increased alternative pathways of admission, providing special immigrant visas to more than 11,000 people at risk from Iraq and Afghanistan in FY16, an increase of more than 4,000 from FY 2015. Last year the United States provided more than $6 billion in humanitarian assistance worldwide. We anticipate providing more than $7 billion in humanitarian assistance to international organizations and non-governmental organizations by the end of the current fiscal year. In direct support of the Summit's goals, the United States recently made a contribution of nearly $37 million for UNHCR's work with countries hosting refugees to increase the number of refugee children receiving a quality education. The United States is also proud to have provided $20 million in support for the Education Cannot Wait Platform, the world's first fund for education in emergencies and protracted crises, championing access to education in the most complex and dangerous environments.\nThe United States is also committed to making financial contributions to each of the groundbreaking financial platforms launched in connection with the Summit. We are pleased to have provided $11 million to the ERCM and intend to contribute at least $50 million over the next five years, subject to the availability of appropriations, to the Global Concessional Financing Facility – the middle-income portion of the World Bank's Global Crisis Response Platform.", "timestamp": "2016-09-20", "title": "Fact Sheet on the Leaders' Summit on Refugees"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122676", "text": "Today, the White House is announcing that 51 companies from across the American economy have made new, measurable, and significant commitments to aid refugees in the United States and around the world in response to the President's June  Call to Action. These companies, representing more than 2.5 million employees, more than $775 billion in annual revenue, and more than $3.2 trillion in market capitalization, are standing with the Administration to demonstrate that private sector innovation and resources can have a durable impact on refugees residing in countries on the frontlines of the global refugee crisis and in countries of resettlement, like the United States. In total, these 51 companies have committed to investing, donating, or raising more than $650 million. These commitments will provide:\n•      Support for more than 6.3 million refugees across more than 20 countries;\n•      Educational opportunities for more than 80,000 refugees, including through digital content, mentorship, and classroom support;\n•      Employment opportunities for more than 220,000 refugees, including through mentorship, training, internships, and job placements;\n•      Greater financial inclusion and economic integration for more than 4 million refugees; and\n•      Partnerships with more than 70 refugee-serving NGOs.\nThere are more than 65 million displaced people in the world today, the highest number on record since the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) began collecting statistics. More than 21 million of these people have crossed international borders in search of safety and are assessed as refugees. From this population, a small number of refugees are provided opportunities for third-country resettlement. It is important to highlight that refugees who are admitted to the United States undergo the highest level of security screening of any category of traveler to the U.S. including the involvement of the National Counterterrorism Center, the FBI's Terrorist Screening Center, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State and the Department of Defense.\nA crisis of this scale requires more than government action. In issuing the Call to Action, President Obama challenged the U.S. private sector to draw on its unique expertise, resources and entrepreneurial spirit to help refugees regain control over their lives and integrate into their new communities. Their response is unprecedented.\nCall to Action Impact Areas\nThe Call to Action was principally focused on generating new commitments in three \"impact areas\":\nØ      Education – Facilitating refugee children and young adults' education by ensuring that refugee students can access schools of all levels and creating quality long-distance learning platforms and programs.\nØ      Employment – Increasing employment opportunities for refugees, supporting refugee entrepreneurship, and assisting refugees' reentry into the workforce.\nØ      Enablement – Increasing humanitarian financing, strengthening infrastructure and access to resources needed for refugees to become self-reliant, and supporting countries taking new steps to welcome refugees or allow them to work and attend school.\nPartnership for Refugees: Catalyzing Durable Solutions\nTo facilitate private sector commitments in response to the Call to Action, the White House announced in June the creation of the  Partnership for Refugees, an initiative established through collaboration between the Department of State and USA for UNHCR, with significant support from Accenture Federal Services. The Partnership for Refugees has provided guidance to private sector organizations that have wished to take action and has helped to ensure that their pledges are sustainable and responsive to refugees' needs. On November 1, 2016, the Tent Foundation will assume control over the operations and management of the Partnership for Refugees, thereby ensuring the long-term vitality of this initiative. Other federal agencies supporting this initiative include the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Department of Homeland Security, the Small Business Administration, and the Department of Commerce.\n* * *\nPrivate Sector Participants to the Call to Action\nIn response to the President's Call to Action, the following companies have put forward commitments to address the global refugee crisis.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "The President spoke at 10:29 a.m. at United Nations Headquarters. In his remarks, he referred to Peter Thomson, President, 71st Session of the U.N. General Assembly; and State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi of Burma. He also referred to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) terrorist organization.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119022", "text": "Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, fellow delegates, ladies and gentlemen: As I address this hall as President for the final time, let me recount the progress that we've made these last 8 years.\nFrom the depths of the greatest financial crisis of our time, we coordinated our response to avoid further catastrophe and return the global economy to growth. We've taken away terrorist safe havens, strengthened the nonproliferation regime, resolved the Iranian nuclear issue through diplomacy. We opened relations with Cuba, helped Colombia and—end Latin America's longest war, and we welcome a democratically elected leader of Myanmar to this Assembly. Our assistance is helping people feed themselves, care for the sick, power communities across Africa, and promote models of development rather than dependence. And we have made international institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund more representative, while establishing a framework to protect our planet from the ravages of climate change.\nThis is important work. It has made a real difference in the lives of our people. And it could not have happened had we not worked together. And yet, around the globe, we are seeing the same forces of global integration that have made us interdependent also expose deep fault lines in the existing international order.\nWe see it in the headlines every day. Around the world, refugees flow across borders in flight from brutal conflict. Financial disruptions continue to weigh upon our workers and entire communities. Across vast swaths of the Middle East, basic security, basic order has broken down. We see too many governments muzzling journalists and quashing dissent and censoring the flow of information. Terrorist networks use social media to prey upon the minds of our youth, endangering open societies and spurring anger and—against innocent immigrants and Muslims. Powerful nations contest the constraints placed on them by international law.\nAnd this is the paradox that defines our world today. A quarter century after the end of the cold war, the world is, by many measures, less violent and more prosperous than ever before, and yet our societies are filled with uncertainty and unease and strife. Despite enormous progress, as people lose trust in institutions, governing becomes more difficult, and tensions between nations become more quick to surface.\nAnd so I believe that at this moment we all face a choice. We can choose to press forward with a better model of cooperation and integration. Or we can retreat into a world sharply divided, and ultimately in conflict, along age-old lines of nation and tribe and race and religion.\nI want to suggest to you today that we must go forward and not backward. I believe that as imperfect as they are, the principles of open markets and accountable governance, of democracy and human rights and international law that we have forged remain the firmest foundation for human progress in this century. Now, I make this argument not based on theory or ideology, but on facts, facts that all too often we forget in the immediacy of current events.\nHere's the most important fact: The integration of our global economy has made life better for billions of men, women, and children. Over the last 25 years, the number of people living in extreme poverty has been cut from nearly 40 percent of humanity to under 10 percent. That's unprecedented. And it's not an abstraction. It means children have enough to eat, mothers don't die in childbirth.\nMeanwhile, cracking the genetic code promises to cure diseases that have plagued us for centuries. The Internet can deliver the entirety of human knowledge to a young girl in a remote village on a single hand-held device. In medicine and in manufacturing, in education and communications, we're experiencing a transformation of how human beings live on a scale that recalls the revolutions in agriculture and industry. And as a result, a person born today is more likely to be healthy, to live longer, and to have access to opportunity than at any time in human history.\nMoreover, the collapse of colonialism and communism has allowed more people than ever before to live with the freedom to choose their leaders. Despite the real and troubling areas where freedom appears in retreat, the fact remains that the number of democracies around the world has nearly doubled in the last 25 years.\nIn remote corners of the world, citizens are demanding respect for the dignity of all people, no matter their gender or race or religion or disability or sexual orientation, and those who deny others dignity are subject to public reproach. An explosion of social media has given ordinary people more ways to express themselves and has raised people's expectations for those of us in power. Indeed, our international order has been so successful that we take it as a given that great powers no longer fight world wars; that the end of the cold war lifted the shadow of nuclear Armageddon; that the battlefields of Europe have been replaced by peaceful union; that China and India remain on a path of remarkable growth.\nI say all this not to whitewash the challenges we face or to suggest complacency. Rather, I believe that we need to acknowledge these achievements in order to summon the confidence to carry this progress forward and to make sure that we do not abandon those very things that have delivered this progress.\nIn order to move forward, though, we do have to acknowledge that the existing path to global integration requires a course correction. Because too often, those trumpeting the benefits of globalization have ignored inequality within and among nations; have ignored the enduring appeal of ethnic and sectarian identities; have left international institutions ill-equipped, underfunded, underresourced in order to handle transnational challenges.\nAnd as these real problems have been neglected, alternative visions of the world have pressed forward both in the wealthiest countries and in the poorest: religious fundamentalism, the politics of ethnicity or tribe or sect, aggressive nationalism, a crude populism—sometimes from the far left, but more often from the far right—which seeks to restore what they believe was a better, simpler age, free of outside contamination.\nWe cannot dismiss these visions. They are powerful. They reflect dissatisfaction among too many of our citizens. I do not believe those visions can deliver security or prosperity over the long term, but I do believe that these visions fail to recognize, at a very basic level, our common humanity. Moreover, I believe that the acceleration of travel and technology and telecommunications, together with a global economy that depends on a global supply chains, makes it self-defeating ultimately for those who seek to reverse this progress. Today, a nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself.\nSo the answer cannot be a simple rejection of global integration. Instead, we must work together to make sure the benefits of such integration are broadly shared and that the disruptions—economic, political, and cultural—that are caused by integration are squarely addressed. Now, this is not the place for a detailed policy blueprint, but let me offer in broad strokes those areas where I believe we must do better together.\nIt starts with making the global economy work better for all people and not just for those at the top. While open markets, capitalism have raised standards of living around the globe, globalization, combined with rapid progress and technology, has also weakened the position of workers and their ability to secure a decent wage. In advanced economies like my own, unions have been undermined, and many manufacturing jobs have disappeared. Often, those who benefit most from globalization have used their political power to further undermine the position of workers.\nIn developing countries, labor organizations have often been suppressed, and the growth of the middle class has been held back by corruption and underinvestment. Mercantilist policies pursued by governments with export-driven models threaten to undermine the consensus that underpins global trade. And meanwhile, global capital is too often unaccountable: nearly $8 trillion stashed away in tax havens and a shadow banking system that grows beyond the reach of effective oversight.\nA world in which 1 percent of humanity controls as much wealth as the other 99 percent will never be stable. I understand that the gaps between rich and poor are not new, but just as the child in a slum today can see the skyscraper nearby, technology now allows any person with a smartphone to see how the most privileged among us live and the contrast between their own lives and others. Expectations rise, then, faster than governments can deliver, and a pervasive sense of injustice undermine people's faith in the system.\nSo how do we fix this imbalance? We cannot unwind integration any more than we can stuff technology back into a box. Nor can we look to failed models of the past. If we start resorting to trade wars, market-distorting subsidies, beggar-thy-neighbor policies, an overreliance on natural resources instead of innovation, these approaches will make us poorer, collectively, and they are more likely to lead to conflict. And the stark contrast between, say, the success of the Republic of Korea and the wasteland of North Korea shows that central, planned control of the economy is a dead end.\nBut I do believe there's another path, one that fuels growth and innovation and offers the clearest route to individual opportunity and national success. It does not require succumbing to a soulless capitalism that benefits only the few, but rather recognizes that economies are more successful when we close the gap between rich and poor and growth is broadly based. And that means respecting the rights of workers so they can organize into independent unions and earn a living wage. It means investing in our people: their skills, their education, their capacity to take an idea and turn it into a business. It means strengthening the safety net that protects our people from hardship and allows them to take more risks, to look for a new job or start a new venture.\nThese are the policies that I've pursued here in the United States, and with clear results. American businesses have created now 15 million new jobs. After the recession, the top 1 percent of Americans were capturing more than 90 percent of income growth. But today, that's down to about half. Last year, poverty in this country fell at the fastest rate in nearly 50 years. And with further investment in infrastructure and early childhood education and basic research, I'm confident that such progress will continue.\nSo just as I've pursued these measures here at home, so has the United States worked with many nations to curb the excesses of capitalism; not to punish wealth, but to prevent repeated crises that can destroy it. That's why we've worked with other nations to create higher and clearer standards for banking and taxation, because a society that asks less of oligarchs than ordinary citizens will rot from within. That's why we've pushed for transparency and cooperation in rooting out corruption and tracking illicit dollars, because markets create more jobs when they're fueled by hard work and not the capacity to extort a bribe. That's why we've worked to reach trade agreements that raise labor standards and raise environmental standards, as we've done with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, so that the benefits are more broadly shared.\nAnd just as we benefit by combating inequality within our countries, I believe advanced economies still need to do more to close the gap between rich and poor nations around the globe. This is difficult politically. It's difficult to spend on foreign assistance. But I do not believe this is charity. For the small fraction of what we spent at war in Iraq, we could support institutions so that fragile states don't collapse in the first place and invest in emerging economies that become markets for our goods. It's not just the right thing to do, it's the smart thing to do.\nAnd that's why we need to follow through on our efforts to combat climate change. If we don't act boldly, the bill that could come due will be mass migrations and cities submerged and nations displaced and food supplies decimated and conflicts born of despair. The Paris Agreement gives us a framework to act, but only if we scale up our ambition. And there must be a sense of urgency about bringing the agreement into force and helping poorer countries leapfrog destructive forms of energy.\nSo, for the wealthiest countries, a Green Climate Fund should only be the beginning. We need to invest in research and provide market incentives to develop new technologies and then make these technologies accessible and affordable for poorer countries. And only then can we continue lifting all people up from poverty without condemning our children to a planet beyond their capacity to repair.\nSo we need new models for the global marketplace, models that are inclusive and sustainable. And in the same way, we need models of governance that are inclusive and accountable to ordinary people.\nI recognize not every country in this hall is going to follow the same model of governance. I do not think that America can or should impose our system of government on other countries. But there appears to be a growing contest between authoritarianism and liberalism right now. And I want everybody to understand, I am not neutral in that contest. I believe in a liberal political order: an order built not just through elections and representative government, but also through respect for human rights and civil society and independent judiciaries and the rule of law.\nI know that some countries, which now recognize the power of free markets, still reject the model of free societies. And perhaps those of us who have been promoting democracy feel somewhat discouraged since the end of the cold war, because we've learned that liberal democracy will not just wash across the globe in a single wave. It turns out, building accountable institutions is hard work, the work of generations. The gains are often fragile. Sometimes, we take one step forward and then two steps back. In countries held together by borders drawn by colonial powers, with ethnic enclaves and tribal divisions, politics and elections can sometimes appear to be a zero-sum game. And so, given the difficulty in forging true democracy in the face of these pressures, it's no surprise that some argue, the future favors the strongman, a top-down model, rather than strong, democratic institutions. But I believe this thinking is wrong. I believe the road of true democracy remains the better path. I believe that in the 21st century, economies can only grow to a certain point until they need to open up, because entrepreneurs need to access information in order to invent; young people need a global education in order to thrive; independent media needs to check the abuses of power. Without this evolution, ultimately, expectations of people will not be met; suppression and stagnation will set in. And history shows that strongmen are then left with two paths: permanent crackdown, which sparks strife at home; or scapegoating enemies abroad, which can lead to war.\nNow, I will admit, my belief that governments serve the individual, and not the other way around, is shaped by America's story. Our Nation began with a promise of freedom that applied only to the few. But because of our democratic Constitution, because of our Bill of Rights, because of our ideals, ordinary people were able to organize and march and protest, and ultimately, those ideals won out, opened doors for women and minorities and workers in ways that made our economy more productive and turned our diversity into a strength; that gave innovators the chance to transform every area of human endeavor; that made it possible for someone like me to be elected President of the United States.\nSo yes, my views are shaped by the specific experiences of America, but I do not think this story is unique to America. Look at the transformation that's taken place in countries as different as Japan and Chile, Indonesia, Botswana. The countries that have succeeded are ones in which people feel they have a stake.\nIn Europe, the progress of those countries in the former Soviet bloc that embraced democracy stand in clear contrast to those that did not. After all, the people of Ukraine did not take to the streets because of some plot imposed from abroad. They took to the streets because their leadership was for sale and they have no recourse. They demanded change because they saw life get better for people in the Baltics and in Poland, societies that were more liberal and democratic and open than their own.\nSo those of us who believe in democracy, we need to speak out forcefully, because both the facts and history, I believe, are on our side. That doesn't mean democracies are without flaws. It does mean that the cure for what ails our democracies is greater engagement by our citizens, not less.\nYes, in America, there is too much money in politics, too much entrenched partisanship, too little participation by citizens, in part because of a patchwork of laws that makes it harder to vote. In Europe, a well-intentioned Brussels often became too isolated from the normal push and pull of national politics. Too often, in capitals, decisionmakers have forgotten that democracy needs to be driven by civic engagement from the bottom up, not governance by experts from the top down. And so these are real problems, and as leaders of democratic governments make the case for democracy abroad, we'd better strive harder to set a better example at home.\nMoreover, every country will organize its government informed by centuries of history and the circumstances of geography and the deeply held beliefs of its people. So I recognize a traditional society may value unity and cohesion more than a diverse country like my own, which was founded upon what, at the time, was a radical idea: the idea of the liberty of individual human beings endowed with certain God-given rights. But that does not mean that ordinary people in Asia or Africa or the Middle East somehow prefer arbitrary rule that denies them a voice in the decisions that can shape their lives. I believe that spirit is universal. And if any of you doubt the universality of that desire, listen to the voices of young people everywhere who call out for freedom and dignity and the opportunity to control their own lives.\nThis leads me to the third thing we need to do: We must reject any forms of fundamentalism or racism or a belief in ethnic superiority that makes our traditional identities irreconcilable with modernity. Instead, we need to embrace the tolerance that results from respect of all human beings.\nIt's a truism that global integration has led to a collision of cultures. Trade, migration, the Internet—all these things can challenge and unsettle our most cherished identities. We see liberal societies express opposition when women choose to cover themselves. We see protests responding to Western newspaper cartoons that caricature the Prophet Muhammad. In a world that let—that left the age of empire behind, we see Russia attempting to recover lost glory through force. Asian powers debate competing claims of history. And in Europe and the United States, you see people wrestle with concerns about immigration and changing demographics and suggesting that somehow people who look different are corrupting the character of our countries.\nNow, there's no easy answer for resolving all these social forces, and we must respect the meaning that people draw from their own traditions: from their religion, from their ethnicity, from their sense of nationhood. But I do not believe progress is possible if our desire to preserve our identities gives way to an impulse to dehumanize or dominate another group. If our religion leads us to persecute those of another faith, if we jail or beat people who are gay, if our traditions lead us to prevent girls from going to school, if we discriminate on the basis of race or tribe or ethnicity, then the fragile bonds of civilization will fray. The world is too small, we are too packed together, for us to be able to resort to those old ways of thinking.\nWe see this mindset in too many parts of the Middle East. There, so much of the collapse in order has been fueled because leaders sought legitimacy, not because of policies or programs, but by resorting to persecuting political opposition or demonizing other religious sects; by narrowing the public space to the mosque, where in too many places perversions of a great faith were tolerated. And these forces built up for years and are now at work helping to fuel both Syria's tragic civil war and the mindless, medieval menace of ISIL.\nThe mindset of sectarianism and extremism and bloodletting and retribution that has been taking place will not be quickly reversed. And if we are honest, we understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to coexist for long. But I do believe we have to be honest about the nature of these conflicts, and our international community must continue to work with those who seek to build rather than to destroy.\nAnd there is a military component to that. It means being united and relentless in destroying networks like ISIL, which show no respect for human life. But it also means that in a place like Syria, where there's no ultimate military victory to be won, we're going to have to pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence and deliver aid to those in need and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect.\nAcross the region's conflicts, we have to insist that all parties recognize a common humanity and that nations end proxy wars that fuel disorder. Because until basic questions are answered about how communities coexist, the embers of extremism will continue to burn, countless human beings will suffer—most of all in that region—but extremism will continue to be exported overseas. And the world is too small for us to simply be able to build a wall and prevent it from affecting our own societies.\nAnd what is true in the Middle East is true for all of us. Surely, religious traditions can be honored and upheld while teaching young people science and math, rather than intolerance. Surely, we can sustain our unique traditions while giving women their full and rightful role in the politics and economics of a nation. Surely, we can rally our nations to solidarity while recognizing equal treatment for all communities, whether it's a religious minority in Myanmar or an ethnic minority in Burundi or a racial minority right here in the United States. And surely, Israelis and Palestinians will be better off if Palestinians reject incitement and recognize the legitimacy of Israel, but Israel recognizes that it cannot permanently occupy and settle Palestinian land. We all have to do better as leaders in tamping down, rather than encouraging, a notion of identity that leads us to diminish others.\nAnd this leads me to the fourth and final thing we need to do, and that is sustain our commitment to international cooperation rooted in the rights and responsibilities of nations.\nAs President of the United States, I know that for most of human history, power has not been unipolar. And the end of the cold war may have led too many to forget this truth. I've noticed as President that at times, both America's adversaries and some of our allies believe that all problems were either caused by Washington or could be solved by Washington. [Laughter] And perhaps too many in Washington believe that as well. [Laughter] But I believe America has been a rare superpower in human history insofar as it has been willing to think beyond narrow self-interest; that while we've made our share of mistakes over these last 25 years—and I've acknowledged some—we have strived, sometimes at great sacrifice, to align better our actions with our ideals. And as a consequence, I believe we have been a force for good.\nWe have secured allies. We've acted to protect the vulnerable. We've supported human rights and welcomed scrutiny of our own actions. We've bound our power to international laws and institutions. When we've made mistakes, we've tried to acknowledge them. We have worked to roll back poverty and hunger and disease beyond our borders, not just within our borders.\nI'm proud of that. But I also know that we can't do this alone. And I believe that if we're to meet the challenges of this century, we are all going to have to do more to build up international capacity. We cannot escape the prospect of nuclear war unless we all commit to stopping the spread of nuclear weapons and pursuing a world without them.\nWhen Iran agrees to accept constraints on its nuclear program, that enhances global security and enhances Iran's ability to work with other nations. On the other hand, when North Korea tests a bomb, that endangers all of us. And any country that breaks this basic bargain must face consequences. And those nations with these weapons, like the United States, have a unique responsibility to pursue the path of reducing our stockpiles and reaffirming basic norms like the commitment to never test them again.\nWe can't combat a disease like Zika that recognizes no borders—mosquitos don't respect walls—[laughter]—unless we make permanent the same urgency that we brought to bear against Ebola: by strengthening our own systems of public health, by investing in cures and rolling back the root causes of disease, and helping poorer countries develop a public health infrastructure. We can only eliminate extreme poverty if the sustainable development goals that we have set are more than words on paper. Human ingenuity now gives us the capacity to feed the hungry and give all of our children, including our girls, the education that is the foundation for opportunity in our world. But we have to put our money where our mouths are.\nAnd we can only realize the promise of this institution's founding—to replace the ravages of war with cooperation—if powerful nations like my own accept constraints. Sometimes, I'm criticized in my own country for professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions. But I am convinced that in the long run, giving up some freedom of action—not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core interests, but binding ourselves to international rules over the long term—enhances our security. And I think that's not just true for us.\nIf Russia continues to interfere in the affairs of its neighbors, it may be popular at home, it may fuel nationalist fervor for a time, but over time, it is also going to diminish its stature and make its borders less secure. In the South China Sea, a peaceful resolution of disputes offered by law will mean far greater stability than the militarization of a few rocks and reefs.\nWe are all stakeholders in this international system, and it calls upon all of us to invest in the success of institutions to which we belong. And the good news is, is that many nations have shown what kind of progress is possible when we make those commitments. Consider what we've accomplished here over the past few years.\nTogether, we mobilized some 50,000 additional troops for U.N. peacekeeping, making them nimble, better equipped, better prepared to deal with emergencies. Together, we established an Open Government Partnership so that, increasingly, transparency empowers more and more people around the globe. And together, now we have to open our hearts and do more to help refugees who are desperate for a home.\nWe should all welcome the pledges of increased assistance that have been made at this General Assembly gathering. I'll be discussing that more this afternoon. But we have to follow through, even when the politics are hard. Because in the eyes of innocent men and women and children who, through no fault of their own, have had to flee everything that they know, everything that they love, we have to have the empathy to see ourselves. We have to imagine what it would be like for our family, for our children, if the unspeakable happened to us. And we should all understand that, ultimately, our world will be more secure if we are prepared to help those in need and the nations who are carrying the largest burden with respect to accommodating these refugees.\nThere are a lot of nations right now that are doing the right thing, but many nations—particularly those blessed with wealth and the benefits of geography—that can do more to offer a hand, even if they also insist that refugees who come to our countries have to do more to adopt to the customs and conventions of the communities that are now providing them a home.\nLet me conclude by saying that I recognize history tells a different story than the one that I've talked about here today. There's a much darker and more cynical view of history that we can adopt. Human beings are too often motivated by greed and by power. Big countries, for most of history, have pushed smaller ones around. Tribes and ethnic groups and nation-states have very often found it most convenient to define themselves by what they hate and not just those ideas that bind them together.\nTime and again, human beings have believed that they finally arrived at a period of enlightenment only to repeat, then, cycles of conflict and suffering. Perhaps that's our fate. We have to remember that the choices of individual human beings led to repeated world war. But we also have to remember that the choices of individual human beings created a United Nations so that a war like that would never happen again. Each of us as leaders, each nation can choose to reject those who appeal to our worst impulses and embrace those who appeal to our best. For we have shown that we can choose a better history.\nSitting in a prison cell, a young Martin Luther King, Jr., wrote that \"Human progress never rolls on the wheels of inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of men willing to be coworkers with God.\" And during the course of these 8 years, as I've traveled to many of your nations, I have seen that spirit in our young people, who are more educated and more tolerant and more inclusive and more diverse and more creative than our generation; who are more empathetic and compassionate towards their fellow human beings than previous generations. And yes, some of that comes with the idealism of youth. But it also comes with young people's access to information about other peoples and places, an understanding unique in human history that their future is bound with the fates of other human beings on the other side of the world.\nI think of the thousands of health care workers from around the world who volunteered to fight Ebola. I remember the young entrepreneurs I met who are now starting new businesses in Cuba; the parliamentarians who used to be, just a few years ago, political prisoners in Myanmar. I think of the girls who have braved taunts or violence just to go to school in Afghanistan and the university students who started programs online to reject the extremism of organizations like ISIL. I draw strength from the young Americans—entrepreneurs, activists, soldiers, new citizens—who are remaking our Nation once again, who are unconstrained by old habits and old conventions and unencumbered by what is, but are instead ready to seize what ought to be.\nMy own family is a made up of the flesh and blood and traditions and cultures and faiths from a lot of different parts of the world, just as America has been built by immigrants from every shore. And in my own life, in this country and as President, I have learned that our identities do not have to be defined by putting someone else down, but can be enhanced by lifting somebody else up; that they don't have to be defined in opposition to others, but rather by a belief in liberty and equality and justice and fairness.\nAnd the embrace of these principles as universal doesn't weaken my particular pride, my particular love for America, it strengthens it. My belief that these ideals apply everywhere doesn't lessen my commitment to help those who look like me or pray as I do or pledge allegiance to my flag. But my faith in those principles does force me to expand my moral imagination and to recognize that I can best serve my own people, I can best look after my own daughters, by making sure that my actions seek what is right for all people and all children and your daughters and your sons.\nThis is what I believe: that all of us can be coworkers with God. And our leadership and our governments and this United Nations should reflect this irreducible truth.\nThank you very much.", "timestamp": "2016-09-20", "title": "Remarks to the United Nations General Assembly in New York City"}

EDT", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119023", "text": "President Obama. It's a great pleasure to once again meet with President Buhari of Nigeria, along with his delegation. Nigeria is one of the largest, most populous, and most important countries not just in sub-Saharan Africa, but in the world. And I am very pleased that we have been able to build a very strong working relationship with President Buhari as he's come in and initiated some very bold efforts at reform.\nOn the security front, real progress has been made in coordinating regionally to restrict Boko Haram, a brutal organization affiliated with ISIL that has killed an enormous number of people and have decimated communities there. Because of President Buhari's leadership, he has been able to refocus the Nigerian military. We are coordinating carefully. And we discussed here today additional ways that we can make further progress not only in destroying this branch of ISIL, but also to make sure that the people in this region are able to recover from the devastation of Boko Haram's occupation.\nThat includes making sure that humanitarian is—aid is getting in. There is real danger of famine and hardship in these areas because farmers were not able to grow crops and engage in traditional agricultural practices. And so we had a discussion about how we can work together to ensure an international response and then move forward to help these communities rebuild.\nWe also had a discussion about how, during a difficult time for Nigeria given its role as an oil exporter, we are looking to help in any ways that we can to facilitate a reduction of conflict in the Niger Delta region, a major oil-producing region, but one that has been marred by a number of militant organizations that have expropriated or siphoned off oil revenues. And the President, I think, wisely, is heading up a delegation to bring various stakeholders together and try to make progress on that front. We want to be helpful in any way that we can.\nWe discussed broader issues of development. And the President is taking some very bold economic reforms, including allowing for flexibility in exchange rates, refocusing on agricultural production. And we pledged to offer all the assistance that we can in those areas.\nAnd as the President is trying to stamp out corruption, to recover external funds that may have been illegally obtained and are sitting in bank accounts around the world, as he continues to work to make sure that the security forces inside of Nigeria are abiding by professional and human rights standards, what we've pledged is, is that we will partner in any ways that we can to be helpful.\nAnd in the meantime, I also want to thank the President for having been a great partner with us on a range of international challenges of great importance, including around issues like climate change and dealing with pollutants like hydrofluorocarbons, where Nigeria has actually been an excellent partner.\nSo we wish President Buhari well. He's going to be President longer than I am. [Laughter] But that gives us a sense of urgency to make sure that we've done everything we can to put in place the framework for cooperation and partnership for many years to come.\nMr. President. President Buhari. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\nWe have—when I say we, I mean Nigeria—benefited tremendously from the United States understanding and cooperation and backing politically and security-wise. Politically, after 16 years and 8 successive government of the other party, it is the United States and Europe that made it absolutely clear that elections should be held according to Nigerian Constitution. That really stabilized the polity in Nigeria and help changing in Government.\nAnd when we came back, a major problem we identified and we mentioned during our campaign is about security, economy, and corruption. And in each of the three identified objectives, the United States help us: training our military, helping with hard- and software. That's why we are very successful in the northeast, where Boko Haram was holding clearly 14 out of 770—[inaudible]—and they declared a caliphate. Now they are not holding a single one, and they are reduced to—what do you call—using improvised explosive devices and attacking soft targets. And then, the training team we received from the United States and the hard- and software help has helped to stabilize it. And in the south, the militants there, we are being helped again with intelligence and advice and training, and we believe soon it will be okay.\nDeveloping the economy, we made the mistake of being a monoeconomy. Until now, we find out footing the bills on food importation will be difficult. So we want into agriculture. We are very grateful for the advice we have been receiving.\nSo I don't think Nigeria can thank the United States enough, in terms of helping us in the security and the economy. So we are really very grateful, Mr. President. Thank you very much.\nMinister of Foreign Affairs Geoffrey Onyeama. And you wish him well in his retirement.\nPresident Buhari. And I wish you a peaceful retirement. [Laughter]\nPresident Obama. Thank you so much.

And thank you, Mr. Secretary-General, as always, for your kind words and your welcome. For 8 years, this luncheon has followed a long speech by me. For 8 years, it's forced me to be brief and not subject you to a second long speech. And after 8 years, I finally figured out the Secretary-General's plan. It keeps me brief to—and I will follow that plan here today.\nMy role is very simple. As President of the host country of the United Nations, it is my pleasure to welcome each and every one of you. The presence of so many world leaders in one place is always an enormous undertaking. New York City always rises to the occasion. And over the last few days, this city has been tested again. And on behalf of all of us, I want to salute our police officers, our law enforcement officials, our first responders for hosting us, but also showing the world the true meaning of grit and resolve. So thank you again, New York City and the New York-New Jersey area.\nAs I said earlier today, even as we work to uphold our international system, it is the choices of individuals that decides whether our world is defined by confrontation or cooperation. And so again today I want to pay special tribute to those individuals who devote their lives to sustaining the system: the men and women who staff the United Nations and its organizations, those in Syria and elsewhere who risk their lives to deliver aid to people in dire need, those who give their lives as peacekeepers. The entire world is in their debt.\nAnd I would note, just as this morning was my last speech to the General Assembly as President, this will be my last toast at this luncheon. It will be the Secretary-General's as well. So I want to take this opportunity on behalf of all of us to say thank you, Mr. Secretary-General, for your outstanding leadership of this institution and the example of your life. You've traveled a remarkable journey: born in a village in South Korea, rising to the highest levels of global leadership. And it is a testimony to your courage and your optimism, your imagination and your will.\nWe see your legacy in the new sustainable development goals, your courageous defense of human rights, a reinvigorated peacekeeping structure, and the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change.\nI should point out, we're not the only ones who are grateful for the Secretary General's leadership. A village on the island of Samoa declared him officially a crown chief and prince—[laughter]—which I believe is a title that you can keep for life. There's no term limit to that. [Laughter]\nSo let me propose a toast: To the eighth Secretary-General of the United Nations, who in his seventh decade still embodies what Robert Kennedy famously called the \"qualities of youth; not a time of life, but a state of mind, a temper of the will, a quality of the imagination, and a predominance of courage over timidity.\" That aptly describes our Secretary-General. We are grateful for his service. We are grateful to his team. The world is better for him. Cheers.\n[At this point, the President offered a toast.]", "timestamp": "2016-09-20", "title": "Remarks at a Luncheon Hosted by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon of the United Nations in New York City"}

And for that matter, none of which can be solved solely by governments. Obviously, we expect governments to take the lead on major transnational challenges, but for us to be able to mobilize the private sector, NGOs, and others is absolutely vital to maximize our impact.\nAnd that's why we're convening today a summit of 50 nations to make new commitments to address a growing refugee crisis, not just in Europe, which has received the most attention, but around the world. And what we have represented here is the results of what we launched—what we call \"A Call to Action\"—to encourage companies to contribute not just money but their unique expertise. And as you can see, some extraordinary companies and individuals have answered the call.\nI want to thank Secretary Penny Pritzker, Ambassador Power, and my national senior—my Senior Adviser, Valerie Jarrett, for bringing these leaders together here today. I'm pleased to announce that 50 companies, large and small, have stepped up and committed more than $650 million, including in-kind contributions that are all designed to help empower more than 6.3 million refugees across more than 20 countries.\nMicrosoft, TripAdvisor, HP, Google, something called the Clooney Foundation for Justice—I don't know what that is—[laughter]—among others. They're going to help children get an education, including in refugee camps: all together, educational opportunities for more than 80,000 refugees. You have companies like Accenture, Western Union, and LinkedIn that are going to help with internships, skills training and job placement. Newton Supply Company, a small business in Texas that makes handbags, is going to make 90 percent of their bags with local refugees.\nSo today's commitment means that we're going to be creating employment opportunities for more than 220,000 refugees.\nMeanwhile, companies like micro—MasterCard, Johnson & Johnson, Goldman Sachs, and Airbnb are going to help refugees become more self-sufficient by getting online, accessing aid, finding housing, health care, and financial services. And the private sector is also driving change through investment. For example, George Soros and the Soros Fund Management is making an extraordinary investment of up to $500 million in companies that come up with sustainable long-term solutions to help refugees.\nSo for these companies to put themselves out there on behalf of the most vulnerable citizens in the world is not just an extraordinary gesture of compassion, but I think it's also a recognition that, for those of us who benefit from this increasingly integrated global society, we can only sustain what we do to the extent that we're making sure that the least of these, the most vulnerable among us, also have hope, also have opportunity.\nAnd as a consequence, I want to thank them for doing good, but I want to emphasize that, from their perspective, this isn't charity, this is part of their overall mission and makes good business sense. I suspect, as well, that there's some around this table who, themselves, were displaced, were immigrants, recall what it's like, maybe, leaving a place they called home in search of a better life. And as I said today, if there's one thing that I hope comes out of today, it is a shared understanding that the children we see in these refugee camps are as precious as our children. Somebody loves them just as much. And hopefully, we can begin to see through their eyes and imagine what it might be like to not be able to control the safety, the education, and the opportunity that we provide our kids and take for granted.\nSo thank you all for the extraordinary work, and thanks for helping to tell the story.

Well, Yusra, we could not be prouder of you, not just for the great introduction, but more importantly, for your courage and your resilience and the great example that you're setting for children everywhere, including your 8-year-old sister, who I know must look up to you.\nGood afternoon. Mr. Secretary-General, Your Excellencies, we are here because, right now, in crowded camps and cities around the world, there are families—from Darfur in Chad, Palestinians in Lebanon, Afghans in Pakistan, Colombians in Ecuador—who have endured years, in some cases, decades, as refugees, surviving on rations and aid and who dream of someday, somehow, having a home of their own.\nWe're here because, right now, there are young girls—like Yusra, like my daughters—who are just as precious and just as gifted—like the 16-year -old refugee from Myanmar that I met in Malaysia—who have suffered unspeakable abuse at the hands of traffickers, modern day slavery, girls who pray at night that someone might rescue them from their torment. There are boys, fleeing the fighting in South Sudan, violence in Central America, wars in North Africa and the Middle East, who are at the mercy of criminals who pack them into trucks or makeshift rafts, and who die on treacherous seas, like little Alan Kurdi from Syria, lifeless, face down on a Turkish beach, in his red shirt and blue pants.\nAnd we are here because, right now, there are mothers separated from their children—like the woman in a camp in Greece, who held on to her family photographs, heard her children cry on the phone, and who said: \"My breath is my children. . . . Every day, I am dying 10, 20, 30 times.\" We're here because there are fathers who simply want to build a new life and provide for their families, like Refaai Hamo, from Syria, who lost his wife and daughter in the war, who we welcomed to America, and who says, \"I still think I have a chance to make a difference in the world.\"\nMr. Secretary-General; heads of state and heads of government; distinguished guests; ladies and gentlemen: As you saw in the video, we are facing a crisis of epic proportions. More than 65 million people have been driven from their homes which is more than any time since the Second World War. Among them are more than 21 million refugees who have fled their countries, everything and everyone they've ever known, fleeing with a suitcase or the clothes on their back.\nAnd I'm here today—I called this summit—because this crisis is one of the most urgent tests of our time: our capacity for collective action. It tests, first and foremost, our ability to end conflicts, because so many of the world's refugees come from just three countries ravaged by war: Syria, Afghanistan, and Somalia.\nAnd I said today to the General Assembly, the mentality that allows for violence with impunity is something we cannot excuse. And collectively, we continue to make excuses. It's not the subject of this summit, but we all know that what is happening in Syria, for example, is unacceptable. And we are not as unified as we should be in pushing to make it stop.\nIt's a test of our international system where all nations ought to share in our collective responsibilities, because the vast majority of refugees are hosted by just 10 countries who are bearing a very heavy burden—among them Turkey, Pakistan, Lebanon, Iran, Ethiopia—countries that often have fewer resources than many of those who are doing little or nothing.\nThis is a crisis of our shared security, not because refugees are a threat; refugees, most of whom are women and children, are often fleeing war and terrorism. They are victims. They're families who want to be safe and to work, be good citizens and contribute to their country—I was talking to Yusra—she's now in Germany; she already speaks some English; now she's trying to learn German—who are interested in assimilating and contributing to the society in which they find themselves.\nIn recent years, in the United States, we've worked to put in intensive screening and security checks so we can welcome refugees and ensure our security; in fact, refugees are subject to more rigorous screening than the average tourist. We've seen in America, hard-working, patriotic refugees serve in our military, and start new businesses and help revitalize communities. I believe refugees can make us stronger.\nSo the challenge to our security is because when desperate refugees pay cold-hearted traffickers for passage, it funds the same criminals who are smuggling arms and drugs and children. When nations with their own internal difficulties find themselves hosting massive refugee populations for years on end, it can risk more instability. It oftentimes surfaces tensions in our society when we have disorderly and disproportionate migration into some countries that skews our politics and is subject to demagoguery.\nAnd if we were to turn refugees away simply because of their background or religion or, for example, because they are Muslim, then we would be reinforcing terrorist propaganda that nations like my own are somehow opposed to Islam, which is an ugly lie that must be rejected in all of our countries by upholding the values of pluralism and diversity.\nAnd finally, this crisis is a test of our common humanity: whether we give in to suspicion and fear and build walls or whether we see ourselves in another. Those girls being trafficked and tortured, they could be our daughters. That little boy on the beach could be our son or our grandson. And we cannot avert our eyes or turn our backs. To slam the door in the face of these families would betray our deepest values. It would deny our own heritage as nations—including the United States of America—that have been built by immigrants and refugees. And it would be to ignore a teaching at the heart of so many faiths that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us; that we welcome the stranger in our midst. And just as acting—just as failure to act in the past—for example, by turning away Jews fleeing Nazi Germany—is a stain on our collective conscience, I believe history will judge us harshly if we do not rise to this moment.\nNow, first and foremost, we must recognize that refugees are a symptom of larger failures, be it war, ethnic tensions, or persecution. And if we truly want to address the crisis, wars like the savagery in Syria must be brought to an end, and it will be brought to an end through political settlement and diplomacy and not simply by bombing.\nWe have to insist on greater investments in development and education and democratic institutions, the lack of which fuels so much of the instability we see in the world. And we need to continue to speak up for justice and equality and insist that the universal human rights of every person are upheld, everywhere.\nNow, in the face of this crisis, with what often seems grim news, we are grateful for the heroic work of so many around the world: leaders who, often in the face of difficult politics at home, welcome refugees as new neighbors; businesses, such as those I met with right before I came here, which had made commitments worth more than $650 million to empower refugees; international institutions and faith groups and NGOs, including InterAction—the alliance of American NGOs—whose members will invest more than $1.2 billion over the next 3 years to assist the world's displaced people and refugees.\nAs Americans, we're determined to do our part. The United Nations [United States; White House correction.] is the largest single donor of humanitarian aid around the world, including to refugees and to the people of Syria. We resettle more refugees than any other nation. As President, I've increased the number of refugees we are resettling to 85,000 this year, which includes 10,000 Syrian refugees, a goal we've exceeded even as we've upheld our rigorous screening. And I called for this summit because we all have to do more.\nI want to thank our cohosts, Secretary-General Ban and Jordan. Obviously, Jordan is carrying an enormous burden as a consequence of the conflict, and we are grateful for His Majesty and the work that they've done. Mexico, which is absorbing a great number of refugees from Central America. Sweden, which has made enormous humanitarian contributions in addition to taking on refugees. Germany and Canada, two countries that have gone above and beyond in providing support for refugees. And I want to personally thank Chancellor Merkel and Prime Minister Trudeau and the people of both those countries, because the politics sometimes can be hard, but it's the right thing to do. And Ethiopia, which is—as was noted in the video, bears an enormous burden.\nI also want to thank the more than 50 nations and organizations participating in this summit for making tangible, concrete commitments. Collectively, our nations have increased our contributions to humanitarian organizations and U.N. appeals this year by some $4.5 billion, and that includes a $1 billion increase this year from the United States. This will translate concretely into lifesaving food and medicine and clothing and shelter.\nBut since we can't just keep on doing the same thing the same way—allowing refugees to languish in camps, disconnected from society—we've also been working with the World Bank to create new financing facilities to assist countries hosting refugees build schools and economic opportunities. As part of these efforts, the United States will contribute at least $50 million to help middle-income countries, and we'll do more to help low-income countries so that refugees and their host communities can flourish and grow stronger together. The refugees in places like Ecuador or Kenya don't always get as much attention as some of the recent migrations, but they need help too. And that's part of our goal here.\nCollectively, our nations are roughly doubling the number of refugees that we admit to our countries to more than 360,000 this year. Again, I want to especially commend Germany, Canada, Austria, the Netherlands, and Australia for their continued leadership, as well countries like Argentina and Portugal for their new commitments. And today I'm proud to announce that the United States will continue our leadership role. In the coming fiscal year, starting next week, the United States will welcome and resettle 110,000 refugees from around the world, which is a nearly 60 percent increase over 2015. We intend to do it right, and we will do it safely.\nCollectively, the major commitments by Turkey, Thailand, Chad, and Jordan will help more than 1 million children who are refugees get an education, will help one million refugees get training, new skills or find a job. And in all of this work, we cannot forget those who are often the most vulnerable to abuse: young girls and women. So a key part of our efforts must be a renewed commitment to stopping sexual violence and forced marriage. And we need to do more to truly empower women and girls, because every girl deserves the chance to grow and be safe, and every woman should have her human rights and dignity upheld.\nSo I'm heartened by the commitments that have been made here today. They will help save lives. But we're going to have to be honest: It's still not enough, not sufficient for a crisis of this magnitude. And that's why I believe this summit must be the beginning of a new global woman—movement where everybody does more: more nations donating more assistance and accepting more refugees; more institutions and NGOs finding new ways to deliver aid; more businesses contributing their expertise; more faith groups making this work their own; more young people demanding action; more States and cities and towns coming forward and saying, yes, we will open our communities to our fellow human beings in need; and more pressure on those countries that are willing to perpetrate violence on their own citizens in pursuit of power that carries such a heavy human toll.\nWe can learn from a young boy named Alex, who lives not far from here in Scarsdale, New York. Last month, like all of us, Alex saw that heartbreaking image: 5-year-old Omran Daqneesh in Aleppo, Syria, sitting in that ambulance, silent and in shock, trying to wipe the blood from his hands.\nAnd here in New York, Alex, who is just 6 years old, sat down and wrote me a letter. And he said, he wanted Omran to come live with him and his family. \"Since he won't bring toys,\" Alex wrote, \"I will share my bike and I will teach him how to ride it. I will teach him addition and subtraction. My little sister will be collecting butterflies and fireflies for him. . . . We can all play together. We will give him a family and he will be our brother.\"\nThose are the words of a 6-year-old boy. He teaches us a lot.\nThe humanity that a young child can display, who hasn't learned to be cynical or suspicious or fearful of other people because of where they're from or how they look or how they pray, and who just understands the notion of treating somebody that is like him with compassion, with kindness—we can all learn from Alex. Imagine the suffering we could ease, and the lives we could save, and what our world would look like if, seeing a child who's hurting anywhere in the world, we say, \"We will give him a family and he will be our brother.\"\nWe spend, so many of us in politics and in leadership, so much time devoted to ascending the ladders of power. We spend time maintaining it; we spend time trying to win over public opinion. And maybe sometimes we forget that the only rationale for doing it is to help that little boy. I hope and pray that we remember.\nI appreciate all of your support. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2016-09-20", "title": "Remarks at the Leaders' Summit on Refugees in New York City"}

The majority are women and children, who are often at increased risk of violence, exploitation and abuse. At a time when global response mechanisms have been strained past their limits by displacement levels not seen since the Second World War, it is incumbent upon the international community to act.\nWe recognize that this crisis, while disproportionately driven by conflict in Syria, is truly global in nature, and demands a global response and political solutions. We also recognize the extraordinary steps that the international community has taken over the course of 2016 to mobilize resources and strengthen the systems and institutions that will be required to meet the growing need—including at the London Conference on Supporting Syria and the Region, the UNHCR resettlement conference in Geneva, and the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul. We applaud U.N. Member States for coming together at the high-level plenary meeting on September 19 to reaffirm their shared responsibility for refugees and migrants.\nThroughout these engagements, certain priorities have become clear. We must seek to increase international humanitarian assistance funding, offer opportunities for refugee resettlement and alternative forms of legal admissions, and facilitate refugees' access to education and lawful employment. We also note the importance of increasing the pool of countries that provide significant levels of humanitarian assistance beyond the current largest donors, as well as the number of countries providing opportunities for resettlement or other lawful paths to admission. Throughout we have, of course, continued to reaffirm the obligation of states to respect international law, international human rights law, and where applicable, international refugee law and international humanitarian law. We convened today's Summit with these goals in mind and—because of the concerted efforts and generosity of the international community—we are in a position to reflect on the important progress we have made, while recognizing the magnitude of the challenges that lie ahead. In particular:\nIn order to mobilize more substantial and sustainable funding for UN humanitarian appeals and other international humanitarian organizations, and provide further support to countries hosting large numbers of refugees, we sought a $3 billion increase in global humanitarian financing and commitments to maintain funding in future years. Through our mutual efforts, over the course of 2016, the 32 donors participating today have contributed this year roughly 4.5 billion additional dollars to UN appeals and international humanitarian organizations than in 2015. We commend all governments that have made new and significant humanitarian contributions this year, as well as the important contributions of host countries and will work to provide more aid and direct support. We continue to urge all governments to do even more over the years to come.\nIn addition, the Summit also sought to provide longer-term solutions for refugees stranded in exile, whose lives are on hold. Governments participating here today have come together, with different types of commitments, to approximately double the global number of refugees resettled and afforded other legal channels of admissions and to improve asylum systems. Some governments have committed to starting or significantly expanding new UNHCR-facilitated third-country resettlement programs and others have greatly increased the numbers of refugees admitted through family reunification or humanitarian admission visas. Several governments have committed to admit significant numbers of refugees into their countries for the first time in recent history. We welcome the inclusion of civil society, which, in many cases, has established private sponsorship programs. To support these efforts, we commend the International Organization for Migration and UNHCR for creating the Emerging Resettlement Countries Joint Support Mechanism, which will help new resettlement countries select, prepare, and support the movement of refugees, and develop systems to welcome and support refugees upon arrival.\nWe also sought to increase the number of refugees in school by one million globally, and the number of refugees able to lawfully work by one million. Altogether, at least 17 governments participating in today's Summit have committed to strengthen and adapt their policies so that more refugees can attend school and/or lawfully work. The commitments announced today will help ensure that one million children have improved access to education and that one million more refugees have opportunities to pursue opportunities to legally access work. Noting the importance of fostering an environment of inclusion, as applicable, we are pleased that so many countries have made commitments to help facilitate these goals and recognize that, for purposes of implementation, refugee host countries will continue to require sustainable donor support.\nIn this connection, we welcome efforts by UNICEF and the international community to establish Education Cannot Wait, the world's first fund for education in emergencies and protracted crises, championing children's right to access education in the most complex and dangerous environments. We likewise applaud the World Bank's establishment of a Global Crisis Response Platform, which will provide grants and loans to help low and middle-income countries that so generously host large numbers of refugees. This financing can help provide quality education and economic opportunities for refugees and their host communities. There was consensus that the international community must recognize the protracted nature of the majority of refugee situations and work to strengthen coherence between humanitarian and development support so that our international response provides refugees with the tools necessary to be self-reliant and productive wherever they reside.\nFinally, we applaud those countries participating in the summit that, through their pledges, have made qualitative leaps in their commitment to humanitarian financing and/or resettlement and other humanitarian admissions. Others have committed to strengthen their institutional capacity to address the specific needs of asylum seekers and refugees, especially those of the most vulnerable groups.\nIn closing, we recognize that no routine mechanism exists yet to facilitate the kind of voluntary responsibility-sharing for refugees that was demonstrated today or to more comprehensively address other challenges arising from large-scale refugee crises. We therefore commit to working together in support of the development of the Global Compact on Responsibility Sharing for Refugees, and to develop tools and institutional structures to improve the international architecture and lay a foundation for addressing both the immediate and the long-term challenges of managing refugee flows effectively and comprehensively.", "timestamp": "2016-09-20", "title": "Joint Statement on the Leaders' Summit on Refugees"}

Poliquin, R-ME, and one cosponsor)\nThe Administration shares the Congress' goals of increasing transparency and bringing Iran into compliance with international standards in the global fight against terror finance and money laundering. However, this bill would be counterproductive toward those shared goals.\nThe bill requires the U.S. Government to publicly report all assets held by some of Iran's highest leaders and to describe how these assets are acquired and used. Rather than preventing terrorist financing and money laundering, this bill would incentivize those involved to make their financial dealings less transparent and create a disincentive for Iran's banking sector to demonstrate transparency. These onerous reporting requirements also would take critical resources away from the U.S. Department of the Treasury's important work to identify Iranian entities engaged in sanctionable conduct. Producing this information could also compromise intelligence sources and methods.\nOne of our best tools for impeding destabilizing Iranian activities has been to identify Iranian companies that are controlled by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) or other Iranians on the list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN List) to non-U.S. businesses, so that they can block assets or stop material transfers. This process is labor-intensive and requires the judicious use of our national intelligence assets. Redirecting these assets to preparing this onerous public report would be counterproductive and will not reduce institutional corruption or promote transparency within Iran's system.\nIn addition, this bill's required public postings also may be perceived by Iran and likely our Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) partners as an attempt to undermine the fulfilment of our commitments, in turn impacting the continued viability of this diplomatic arrangement that peacefully and verifiably prevents Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. If the JCPOA were to fail on that basis, it would remove the unprecedented constraints on and monitoring of Iran's nuclear program, lead to the unraveling of the international sanctions regime against Iran, and deal a devastating blow to the credibility of America's leadership and our commitments to our closest allies.\nAs we address our concerns with Iran's nuclear program through implementation of the JCPOA, the Administration remains clear-eyed regarding Iran's support for terrorism, its ballistic missile program, human rights abuses, and destabilizing activity in the region. The United States should retain all of the tools needed to counter this activity, ranging from powerful sanctions to our efforts to disrupt and interdict illicit shipments of weapons and proliferation-sensitive technologies. This bill would adversely affect the U.S. Government's ability to wield these tools, would undermine the very goals it purports to achieve, and could even endanger our ability to ensure that Iran's nuclear program is and remains exclusively peaceful.\nIf the President were presented with H.R. 5461, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto this bill.", "timestamp": "2016-09-21", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 5461 - Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act"}

Royce, R-CA, and 70 cosponsors)\nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 5931, which is an ill-advised attempt to respond to a problem – so-called \"ransom\" payments to Iran – that does not exist, in a way that would undermine U.S. obligations and ultimately benefit Iran at the expense of the United States. The bill purports to raise concerns about the announcement in January that the United States brought home several unjustly detained Americans from Iran. As the Administration has repeatedly made clear, Iran released several detained Americans, and the United States provided relief to certain Iranian citizens charged with primarily sanctions-related offenses, several of whom are dual U.S.-Iranian nationals, in a one-time, reciprocal humanitarian gesture that brought our Americans home after 14 months of intensive negotiations. As the President has affirmed, the United States did not pay ransom to secure the return of our Americans from Iran. As was also announced publicly in January, the United States transferred funds to Iran to effectuate the settlement of a long-standing claim at the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal at The Hague (the Tribunal). The settlement of this 35-year old claim was resolved to the benefit of the U.S. taxpayer. The timing of the settlement was a consequence of the United States taking advantage of the opening of diplomatic opportunities with Iran on several fronts simultaneously, including Implementation Day of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and the intensification of negotiations to release unjustly detained Americans. Both of these diplomatic achievements and the settlement of the Tribunal claim were made possible by this intensified engagement – all three were resolved on their own merits and were profoundly in the U.S. interest.\nThis bill, while styled as prohibiting future purported \"ransom payments,\" instead bars virtually any payment from the U.S. Government to Iran, including those permitted or even required by law. Specifically, this bill would effectively prevent the United States from paying out awards rendered by the Tribunal and, thus, risk putting the United States in violation of our obligations under the Algiers Accords – an agreement concluded by President Carter, endorsed by President Reagan and honored by every President since that time. Since the establishment of the Tribunal in 1981, the Tribunal has resolved numerous substantial claims of U.S. nationals against Iran, with over $2.5 billion being paid out to the U.S. claimants.\nFurther, this bill could effectively remove the President's ability to settle Tribunal claims with Iran for the foreseeable and indefinite future by requiring unrealistic certifications and notifications. This is an unprecedented restriction on the President's claims settlement authority that would adversely affect our ability to resolve Tribunal claims on favorable terms to the U.S. taxpayer, as we did in January. It would be unprecedented for the Congress to impose rigid, ex ante conditions on the President's prerogative to settle claims with foreign sovereigns.\nThis bill would benefit Iran, not the United States. Settlements of Tribunal claims, over several decades, have already saved the U.S. taxpayers potentially billions of dollars. Removing the President's authority to settle these claims virtually guarantees higher monetary awards for Iran after years of continued litigation – and the U.S. taxpayers will be stuck with the bill.\nThe bottom line is that this bill is a short-sighted response to politicized discussions about the recent Tribunal settlement. It undermines our international obligations in an unprecedented fashion that, ultimately, advantages Iran at the expense of the U.S. taxpayer.\nIf the President were presented with H.R. 5931, he would veto the bill.", "timestamp": "2016-09-21", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 5931 – Prohibiting Future Ransom Payments to Iran Act"}

{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "note": "Speech as delivered.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119162", "text": "\"Hello, Orlando! Wow. Thank you all so much. I am so happy to be back and I want to thank all of you for being here today at the Frontline Outreach Youth and Family Center, which does so much good work in the community. I want to acknowledge your terrific mayor, Mayor Buddy Dyer, who was here earlier. I want to thank Pastor Wynn, Tiffany Namey, the chair of the Orange County Disability Caucus, and everyone – especially Val Demings. Where's Val? Val – I know – got this crowd really whipped up, and I want you to stay whipped up for Val. She is going to be a great member of Congress for everything that we care about and are fighting for.\nI want to thank Anastasia for that introduction. Didn't she do an amazing job? I first met Anastasia when she was nine years old. She raised her hand at a town hall and she said, 'My twin sister can't speak. Because of that, they put her in a separate class, apart from the rest of the kids. But she can communicate with a computer. And she's very smart and would do just as well as anyone else, if the principal and teachers would just give her a chance.' I was just blown away by this nine-year-old girl – her confidence and how much she loved her sister.\nSo Anastasia and I have stayed in touch over the years. When she grew up, she became an intern in the Senate. I was so proud of her speech at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia too. And I'm very excited that she's here with us today.\nI also want to thank Orlando. It's great to be back in this wonderful city with all of you. You've been through a lot this year. And what has been so notable is you've responded with grace. You've shown the world what Orlando is made of – strength, love and kindness. This is something we could all use more of right now.\nI'm here today to talk about how to make our economy work for everyone, but first, I need to say something about two very upsetting incidents that took place over the past few days. First, an unarmed man named Terence Crutcher was shot and killed by a police officer in Tulsa. Then, a man named Keith Lamont Scott was shot and killed by a police officer in Charlotte. I'm sending condolences and prayers to their families; I know a lot of you are as well.\nThere is still much we don't know about what happened in both incidents. But we do know that we have two more names to add to a list of African Americans killed by police officers in these encounters. It's unbearable. And it needs to become intolerable.\nWe also saw the targeting of police officers in Philadelphia last week. And last night in Charlotte, 12 officers were injured in demonstrations following Keith Lamont Scott's death. Every day, police officers across our country are serving with extraordinary courage, honor and skill. We saw that again this weekend in New York and New Jersey and Minnesota. Our police handled those terrorist attacks exactly right. And they likely saved a lot of lives. I've spoken to many police chiefs and other law enforcement leaders who are as deeply concerned as I am and deeply committed, as I am, to reform. Why? Because they know it is essential for the safety of our communities and our officers. We are safer when communities respect the police and police respect communities.\nI've also been privileged to spend a lot of time with mothers who have lost children, and young people who feel that, as far as their country's concerned, their lives seem disposable. We've got to do better. And I know we can. And if I'm elected president, we will – and we will do it exactly together, which is the only way it can be done.\nLook, I know I don't have all the answers. I don't know anyone who does. But this is certain: too many people have lost their lives who shouldn't have.\nSybrina Fulton has become a friend of mine. Her son, Trayvon Martin, was killed not far from where we are today. Sybrina says, 'This is about saving our children.' And she's absolutely right. We need to come together, work together – white, black, Latino, Asian, all of us – to turn the tide, stop the violence, build the trust. We need to give all of our kids, no matter who they are, the chance to grow up safe and healthy in their communities and in our country.\nNow, there are so many issues we need to take on together, and that's why we're here today. Because in just 48 days – can you believe it, 48 days – Americans will go to the polls and choose our next president. Well, I hope so. I hope so. I want to just stress that our campaign is about the fundamental belief that, in America, every person, no matter what you look like, who you are, who you love, you should have the chance to go as far as your hard work and dreams will take you. And that is the basic bargain that made our country great, and it's our job to make sure it's there for you and future generations.\nBuilding an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top, is the central challenge of our time. And I take it personally, because I'm a proud product of the American middle class. My grandfather started working in a lace mill in Scranton, Pennsylvania, when he was just a boy, and worked there for 50 years. Thanks to him, my dad was able to go to college and then start his own small business, printing fabric for draperies. And because of my dad and my mom, I could head out into the world and follow my dreams.\nEvery American family should be able to write a similar story for themselves and their children. And history has shown us – our history has shown us that the strongest growth in our economy is inclusive, broad-based growth – when everyone can contribute to our prosperity and share in its rewards.\nNow, here is just one example. The flood of women into the American workforce over the past several decades was responsible for more than $3.5 trillion in economic growth. But as women's labor participation has slowed in recent years, due in part to our failure to provide family-friendly policies like paid leave and affordable childcare, so our economic growth wasn't as strong as it could have been. Women who want to work deserve to work. And whenever they are denied that opportunity, it's not fair to them – and we all lose out. In a competitive 21st century global economy, we cannot afford to leave talent on the sidelines. When we leave people out or write them off, we not only shortchange them and their dreams, we shortchange our country and our own futures.\nThat's one reason why I care so much about supporting working parents. It's one reason why I'm such a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform. Because bringing millions of undocumented workers into the formal economy will decrease abuse and exploitation, and it will increase our economic breath and our tax base. It is estimated if we did this, despite what you hear from the other side, we would increase our gross domestic product by an estimated $700 billion in 10 years. Now, we need that.\nIt's also one reason why we've got to break down barriers of systemic racism, including under-investment that has held communities of color back for generations. That's part of building an inclusive economy, too. And it's why I believe we need to do more to help young people, who are left behind in the wake of the Great Recession, find those strategies and opportunities that will get them moving ahead again. And we've got to help older Americans who've displaced by automation and outsourcing in our changing economy.\nAnd too often, training and retraining doesn't work as it should. If you don't have a four-year degree, if you haven't really had the chance to upgrade your skills over the years, it's hard to just make a course correction. We need to have apprenticeships and community college and technical programs, starting in high school and moving all the way up to older workers. Whether you're trying to start your career or you've spent decades contributing to our economy, you deserve better.\nNow, these are some of the elements of my plan for an inclusive economy, and I'm going to hold up the book Tim Kaine and I have put out because we've actually put in one place all of our plans. You see, we have this old-fashioned idea if we're asking you to support us, we should tell you what we're going to do. Right? And today I want to focus on one area that hasn't gotten enough attention. It concerns a group of Americans who are too often invisible, overlooked, and undervalued, who have so much to offer but are given too few chances to prove it. Now, that's been true for a long time, and we have to change it.\nI'm talking about people with disabilities, men and women, boys and girls, who have talents, skills, ideas, and dreams for themselves and their families just like anybody else. Whether they can participate in our economy and lead rich, full lives that are as healthy and productive as possible is a reflection on us as a country. And right now, in too many ways, we are falling short. We've got to face that and do better for everyone's sake because this really does go to the heart of who we are as Americans. I intend this to be a vital aspect of my presidency.\nI want to bring us together as a nation to recognize the humanity and support the potential of all of our people. And I want you to hear this because this is not well-known. Nearly one in five Americans lives with a disability. Now, some of those disabilities are highly visible, some much harder to notice. If you don't know you know someone with a disability, I promise you, you do. But their disability is just one part of who they are.\nAcross the country, people with disabilities are running businesses, teaching students, caring for our loved ones. They're holding public office, making breakthrough scientific discoveries, reporting the news, and creating art that inspires and challenges us. They're veterans whose service and sacrifice has protected our freedom and kept our country safe. They're working in the White House. Just last year a young woman named Leah Katz-Hernandez became the first West Wing receptionist who is deaf. So when world leaders come to the White House, the person who greets them is Leah. Think of the message that sends about how our nation sees the talent in everyone.\nAnd Americans with disabilities are working on presidential campaigns. I know because several of my staff and advisors have disabilities, and they're doing phenomenal work. I'm grateful to them every single day. And people all over America would say the same about their boss, their colleague, their employee, their family member with a disability.\nNow, over the past few days, our country has taken leaps forward, not just in recogniz-ing the humanity and dignity of people with disabilities, but in making long-overdue changes in our schools, workplaces, and communities so everyone can be part of our shared American life. Even so, not that long ago if you had a disability – if you couldn't see, couldn't walk, lived with dyslexia or muscular dystrophy or some other health issue – that one fact was allowed to define your entire life. Because of that and that alone, the world was closed to you. Not all of it and not for everyone, but for most people, basic essential things that others could do you couldn't and never would. And that was that.\nI saw this for myself, as Anastasia said, years ago when I was just starting out as a young lawyer working with the Children's Defense Fund. One of my first assignments was to figure out why so many American kids weren't in school. We looked at census tract numbers and we said, okay. How many young people between five and 18 live in this census tract? Then we would look at school enrollment numbers, and there'd be a gap. And we would say, wait a minute. Where are the kids? Why aren't they in school?\nI went door to door, along with people across our country, going into different communities. I was in New Bedford, Massachusetts. We saw a notable disparity there, and I soon realized that part of the problem was kids were stuck at home because of disabilities. There were kids who were hard of hearing, kids with intellectual disabilities. I remember one little girl in a wheelchair who was smart, curious, desperate to go to school. But that chair held her back. Not all schools had ramps or accessible bathrooms. Most teachers and aides weren't trained to help her. So she didn't get to go. It felt like the world had said to her, sorry, kid. Your life just isn't going to be worth very much. And she and her family weren't rich. They weren't powerful. So what could they do about it?\nThat little girl reminded me of another little girl, my mother. She didn't face the same challenges, but she, too, was clocked from a full and happy childhood – abandoned by her own parents, raised by grandparents who didn't want her, and ended up on her own when she was just 14, supporting herself as a housemaid. But then something finally went her way. The woman she worked for encouraged her to finish high school. And that family showed my mother what a happy family looked like. After many lonely years, it was the start of a better life.\nThe core lesson from her childhood was that none of us gets through life alone. We all have to look out for each other and lift each other up. And I remembered that, sitting with that little girl in a wheelchair. My colleagues and I at the Children's Defense Fund, along with others, gathered the facts, and we built a coalition of activists and families across America, and together we helped convince Congress to pass a groundbreaking law saying that children with disabilities have the same right to be educated in public school just like any other kids.\nSo we opened the doors to school, and then some years later I was so excited when the Americans with Disabilities Act finally passed, 26 years ago. It was bipartisan. The notion that workplaces and public spaces belong to everyone was something Democrats and Republicans both supported. And, by the way, I'm proud that some of the Democrats and Republicans who passed that landmark bill are supporting my campaign because they know where my heart is on this.\nAs Secretary of State, I appointed the first-ever special advisor for international disability rights because I wanted America to stand up for the rights and dignity of people with disabilities all over the world. And over the years, I've spent a lot of time working for kids with disabilities. In addition to Anastasia, who spoke at the convention, another young man, Ryan Moore, also spoke there. I first met Ryan when he was 7 years old. I was fighting for health care reform. He was born with a rare form of dwarfism. But he never let that stop him. He's had so many surgeries, we've lost count of them. But his family was always there for them and – for him. And he was the advocate for himself as he got older. Now he's a college graduate working in the technology department of his local school district. And he's just one of the most optimistic people you'll ever meet.\nListening to Ryan and Anastasia tell their stories at the convention this July made me think about all the people who never got the chance, never got the chance to get the education, let alone go to college, become forces for change. And I thought about all of the mothers and fathers across America who love their children more than anything and want so badly for them to have every opportunity that they deserve to have in America.\nI'll never forget something that the actor Christopher Reeve said. Some of you may be too young to know who he was. He was a huge star. He played Superman. He was unbelievably good-looking. He and his wonderful wife were friends of mine. And then he was paralyzed in a horse-riding accident. He once said that he had been thinking about a phrase that comes up a lot in our politics, 'family values.' 'Since my accident,' he said, 'I've found a definition that seems to make sense. I think it means that we're all family and we all have value.' I couldn't agree more.\nWe've come a long way since the fall of 1973, when I was going door to door talking to kids and families. But make no mistake. We still have a lot more work to do. We can't be satisfied, not when over 60 percent of adults with disabilities aren't in the workforce, not when businesses are allowed to pay employees with disabilities a subminimum wage [cheers and applause], not when people with physical and intellectual disabilities are still subjected to stigma and discrimination every single day. We've got to build an inclusive economy that welcomes people with disabilities, values their work, treats them with respect.\nNow, one advocate after another has told me the same thing, 'We don't want pity. We want paychecks. We want the chance to contribute.' As president, I'm going to give – give them that chance. First, we're going to focus on jobs and incomes. I'm going to fight to give more Americans with disabilities the chance to work alongside those without disabilities and do the same jobs for the same pay and benefits. People with disabilities shouldn't be isolated. They should be given the chance to work with everyone else. And we're going to eliminate the subminimum wage, which is a vestige from an ugly, ignorant past. Good work deserves fair pay, no matter who you are.\nSecond, we're going to work with our colleges and universities to make them more accessible to students with disabilities. To have a truly inclusive economy, we need a truly inclusive education system. So let's raise our standards. For too long, accessibility has been an afterthought. Let's make it a priority in our curriculums, our classrooms, and the technology our students use. It's like what Anastasia said about her sister. She can communicate through a computer. Then let's make sure kids who can communicate that way have the opportunity to do so.\nThird, we're going to partner with businesses and other stakeholders to ensure those living with a disability can get hired and stay hired. As part of that, we'll launch a new effort we're calling Autism Works to help people with autism succeed in the workplace.\nFourth, let's build on the success of the Americans with Disabilities Act by finally ratifying the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It has the strong backing of leaders across the political spectrum, and it's a chance to show American values and American leadership. And I have to tell you ever since I was first lady, I have had the great privilege of traveling the world on behalf of our country. When I was secretary of state, I went to 112 countries. And one of the things that I have noticed is how far behind many countries are in how they treat people with disabilities. Very often people with disabilities from the time they are babies and toddlers are locked away, basically forgotten. I want us since we have been the leader in this area to get that ratified and then to demonstrate to other countries what we have done and are doing to give dignity and opportunity to people with disabilities.\nNow, these ideas are just a start. We're working with advocates to come up with even more. If you've got an idea, we want to hear it. Go to hillaryclinton.com and leave your ideas because we are really welcoming this debate. This issue is very close to my heart.\nI've always believed that the ultimate test of our society is more than the size of our economy or the strength of our military. It's how we treat our fellow human beings, especially the most vulnerable among us. And on this front especially, I intend for my presidency to move our country forward. Together, we will make our economy and our country more welcoming to people with disabilities because we all win when everyone gets to share in the American dream.\nNow, if you want some proof, let me tell you this story. It's a story of a woman named Freia David. Now, some of you may have read about Freia in the Boston Globe. I've carried a copy of that article around with me because I loved it so much. Freia has Down syndrome. When she was 21, she got her first job, at the local McDonald's. Her mother was a little worried, as any mother would be. She wondered, would Freia be able to handle being independent? Could she handle the job? Would she even pass the six-month training program? Well, not everyone in her class passed, but Freia did. And then – then she excelled at that job for 32 years. Her colleagues loved her, and she loved them. The restaurant became such a home to her that she'd bring her family there on off days just to hang out.\nEarlier this year, Freia began to show signs of early-onset dementia. She knew that meant she had to stop working, but 32 years is a pretty good run, isn't it? It broke her heart. One thing that made it a little better is the whole staff threw a party in her honor. Her family hoped a few people might show up. And in the end, nearly 100 people did: customers, colleagues and friends from over the years. The party lasted three hours. And at one point, one of Freia's former managers asked for everyone's attention. She turned to Freia, and she said, 'We love you. We appreciate you. We respect you. And we are all better people for having you in our lives.'\nMy friends, after years of hard work and treating people right, isn't that what we all want to hear? Isn't that America at our best? We don't thrive on tearing each other apart, or separating ourselves. We know we are stronger together. We believe in equality and dignity for all. And when we fall short, we strive to do better, not to blame and scapegoat but to improve ourselves, to move toward becoming that more perfect union that our founders hoped for. This election is a chance for us to move still closer to that goal, to make sure everyone can contribute to a growing and prospering America, to say loudly and clearly in this country, no one's worthless, no one's 'less than.' We're all of value. In the United States of America, the greatest country in the world, we believe everyone is created equal. And you know what else we believe? We all believe love trumps hate.\nThank you all.\"", "timestamp": "2016-09-21", "title": "Remarks at the Frontline Outreach Center in Orlando, Florida"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122675", "text": "Africa's immense economic potential, increasing integration into global markets, expanding infrastructure, and demographic boom provide a remarkable opportunity to enhance U.S. trade and investment ties across the continent. African countries are tackling economic challenges by diversifying their economies, streamlining regional and global economic cooperation, and innovating to overcome barriers to trade and investment. The United States is committed to being a partner in these efforts, including through initiatives such as the Doing Business in Africa Campaign, Power Africa, and Trade Africa. Taking into account these and other efforts, at the 2014 U.S.-Africa Business Forum (USABF) co-hosted by the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) and Bloomberg Philanthropies, $33 billion in commitments, including $14 billion in private sector deals and commitments, were made to support economic growth across Africa. Over the last two years, Commerce has tracked nearly $15 billion in additional private sector deals reached between U.S. and African partners, and from 2008 to 2015 U.S. direct investment in Africa rose from $37 billion to $64 billion on a historic-cost basis - an increase of more than 70 percent. That's more than double the total global official development assistance that went to Africa in 2015. ?Today's U.S.-Africa Business Forum builds upon the partnerships created in 2014 with new commitments to mobilize an additional $9.1 billion in trade and investment to support the development of Africa's consumer goods, construction, energy, healthcare, manufacturing, telecommunications, and transportation sectors.\nThe U.S. Government has Expanded its Presence and Economic Engagement in Africa\nSince 2008, Commerce has doubled its presence on the continent, opening new offices in Angola, Tanzania, Ethiopia, and Mozambique, expanding its presence in Ghana, and re-establishing a presence at the African Development Bank. The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) has opened an office in Nigeria and restarted work in Kenya, and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) opened offices in Kenya, South Africa and Cote d'Ivoire. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has deployed more than 40 field-based transaction advisors in sub-Saharan Africa to track projects for potential Power Africa support and to provide technical support to improve the enabling environment for private sector investment in the energy sector.\nIn addition to expanding their physical presence, economic and development agencies have significantly expanded their portfolios on the continent:\no      OPIC has tripled its portfolio in Africa since 2009, and investments in Africa now represent nearly a third of OPIC's total portfolio. OPIC has committed more than $7 billion in financing and insurance to projects in Africa, and these commitments have mobilized more than $14 billion in additional investments into highly impactful sectors in Africa like clean energy, telecom, healthcare, education, and microfinance.\no      USTDA has more than doubled the size of its Africa portfolio in the last eight years, supporting 135 projects across 14 countries. This early-stage investment, which has the potential to mobilize more than $17 billion in private and public financing, has already helped to realize $2.5 billion in U.S. exports.\no      From 2009-2016, Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM Bank) authorizations doubled in Sub-Saharan Africa as compared to the previous eight-year period, and rose across all of Africa by 45 percent. In the past five years EXIM Bank has approved more than $6.3 billion in financing for U.S. exports to sub-Saharan Africa, including a record $2.1 billion in fiscal year 2014.\no      Twenty of the Millennium Challenge Corporation's (MCC's) signed compacts are with African countries, totaling $7.9 billion and representing approximately 68 percent of MCC's total compact portfolio. In addition, 11 of MCC's threshold programs are with African countries, totaling more than $203 million.\no      Since 2008, the U.S. African Development Foundation (USADF) commitment to Africa has grown with entry into 8 new countries. USADF has opened African-led program offices in each country, with African country teams that manage nearly $25 million active projects\no      The Department of the Treasury has committed to double resources for the domestic resource mobilization work of the Office of Technical Assistance (OTA) by 2020, which will expand support for building effective revenue and expenditure systems. OTA has increasingly focused on Africa, with projects in sub-Saharan Africa making up approximately one third of its portfolio.\nThe Administration has Expanded Access to U.S. Government Tools that Support Our Trade and Investment with Africa\nThe U.S. Government, across a dozen Departments and Agencies, offers a suite of financial and technical tools and programs to support U.S. businesses looking to trade with and invest in Africa, including financing for overseas investments; export credit and political risk insurance; partial loan and risk guarantees; support for project preparation, feasibility studies and training; and export counseling and market analysis. Diplomatic engagement by the State Department also supports American firms and promotes host government reforms that improve investment environments.\n­­\nIn 2012, the Administration launched the Doing Business in Africa (DBIA) Campaign to help make the U.S. Government's resources more easily available to the U.S. private sector and African public and private sector partners. At the 2014 Forum, the President announced the formation of an Advisory Council on DBIA to provide information, analysis, and recommendations on opportunities for the U.S. Government to promote broad-based economic growth in the United States and in Africa by encouraging U.S. companies to trade with and invest in Africa. Today, the President welcomed the new members of the Advisory Council on DBIA, which was expanded from 15 to 24 members to ensure a more robust representation across U.S. industries.\nSince the DBIA Campaign was launched in 2012, Commerce has assisted more than 1,500 U.S. clients seeking to export to African countries. Since 2009, Commerce's International Buyer Program has helped bring 522 delegations and 8,123 buyers from Africa to U.S. trade shows, and Commerce has taken 283 U.S. companies on trade missions to Africa. Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency has sponsored the African Global Pathways initiative, which provides minority-owned firms access to expert consulting services that promote U.S.-Africa business linkages. USTDA has hosted African government and business leaders on more than 40 reverse trade missions to the United States since 2008 – helping to generate over $135 million in U.S. exports to Africa. OPIC has also led investor delegations to Liberia, Sierra Leone, Cote d'Ivoire, and Senegal to identify ripe opportunities and encourage investment, and MCC conducted its first ever investment mission to Tanzania and Malawi. Earlier this week, the Department of Commerce and leaders from East Africa announced new steps they plan to take to support tourism, cold chain development, and infrastructure in that region. At the USABF, Commerce and the Nigerian Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment are announcing the establishment of the U.S.-Nigeria Commercial and Investment Dialogue to sustain engagement between our governments and private sectors in order to promote deeper trade and investment ties between the United States and Nigeria.\nThe U.S. government is also working to make it easier for U.S. companies to invest and work in Africa. The Department of Transportation (DOT) continues to work with African governments to improve transportation infrastructure, modernize laws and regulations governing transportation, reduce technical barriers to trade through harmonization of standards, and improve regional connectivity. Under the Safe Skies for Africa program, DOT has completed more than 100 training courses and workshops to facilitate African aviation professional's exposure and adherence to international aviation standards. And today, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) is making up to  $100 million in credit guarantees available to establish or upgrade facilities or infrastructure in Africa and elsewhere, enhancing countries' ability to import U.S. agricultural commodities.\nIn addition to in-person resources, departments and agencies are expanding access to online resources. Commerce launched a  One-Stop-Shop website to offer American businesses and entrepreneurs real-time access to critical African market information, financing tools available to them, projects to consider, and key contacts. The Department of Energy (DOE) developed the online \"Clean Energy Solutions Center,\" which connects policymakers in Africa with experts and best practice resources to help governments design and adopt policies that support the deployment of clean energy technologies, including by harmonizing these policies with countries' Intended Nationally Determined Contributions. DOE also brought together world class industry experts and emerging natural gas producers and consumers in sub-Saharan Africa to create a \"Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Handbook,\" which will help foster a shared understanding between government officials and private companies of the factors that lead to successful LNG projects. Commerce's Commercial Law Development Program and the African Development Bank's (AfDB's) African Legal Support Facility released two  handbooks under the auspices of Power Africa that are helping to strengthen the capacity of African governments to negotiate fair and transparent power deals. Today, MCC  launched a new collaboration with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to catalyze investment in the developing world by sharing economic analysis and identifying potential partnerships and investment opportunities.\nThrough Power Africa, launched in 2013, the U.S. Government and a coalition of more than 130 public and private sector partners are working to double access to electricity in sub-Saharan Africa. At the 2014 USABF, the President pledged new funding to expand Power Africa's reach to all of sub-Saharan Africa, and announced a new aggregate goal of adding 30,000 megawatts (MW) of new, cleaner electricity and increasing electricity access by at least 60 million new connections. Power Africa is providing support for projects expected to generate more than 29,000 MW, and this support has already helped transactions expected to generate more than 4,600 MW of generation reach financial close. Through the combined efforts of Power Africa's strategic partners, including the World Bank Group, the AfDB, the European Union, and the Governments of Sweden, the United Kingdom, Norway, and Canada, Power Africa is on track to meet its goals by 2030. In August 2016, Power Africa announced a new partnership with the Government of Japan, through which Japan committed to bring 1,200 MW of electricity to sub-Saharan Africa by the end of 2018. To date, Power Africa's initial $7 billion commitment has mobilized more than $52 billion in additional external commitments, including more than $40 billion in private sector commitments to invest in power generation and distribution across sub-Saharan Africa.\nBy demonstrating that renewable power transactions are financially viable, improving the performance of utilities, changing the regulatory mind-set on renewables, and harmonizing policies to drive investment and stability, Power Africa is also playing a critical role in advancing affordable, reliable, and modern energy services and substantially increasing the share of renewable energy in sub-Saharan Africa – which currently represents three quarters of the projects Power Africa is supporting. Through the U.S.-Africa Clean Energy Finance (ACEF) Initiative, OPIC and USTDA have provided critical early-stage project preparation support for 34 renewable energy projects in ten African countries. Already, 15 ACEF projects have secured project financing, which is leading to increased power generation capacity and expanded access to electricity. For example, since receiving ACEF funding from OPIC in 2013, Off-Grid Electric has expanded solar energy provision in Tanzania from 2,000 households to more than 100,000. A grant from the USTDA to Rwandan company Amahoro Energy Ltd. to develop two run-of river hydropower plants helped open up Rwanda's hydropower sector to eight other projects, in addition to providing electricity to the Shyira Hospital and 22,500 households in rural Rwanda. Power Africa has also facilitated the signing of 14 Independent Power Purchase Agreements to develop 1,125 MW of new solar power in Nigeria, and through a partnership with Lekela Power, OPIC will support the development, construction and operation of a 158.7 MW wind farm in Senegal, which will boost Senegal's generation capacity by nearly a quarter and provide a critical foundation for its power generation and sustainable energy growth plan. Through the Power Africa Off-Grid Energy Challenge, in partnership with GE Africa, USADF has awarded 50 grants totaling an investment of $5 million to African energy entrepreneurs who have leveraged their awards to bring electricity, from solar micro-grids to biogas, to rural communities living beyond the grid. Today, the USADF  announced 21 new Off-Grid Energy Challenge grant winners and launched a new partnership with GE Africa focused on African women-owned and managed energy enterprises.\nThe Trade Africa initiative, launched in 2013, has helped countries boost trade within Africa and between Africa and the United States, while reducing barriers to trade across borders on the continent. Trade Africa has expanded to five additional countries, in addition to its original focus on the Partner States of the East African Community (EAC). Since 2014, USAID regional Trade and Investment Hubs in Ghana, Kenya, and South Africa have facilitated more than $283 million in African exports to the United States and $140 million in U.S. investment in Africa. The East Africa Hub has supported 29,000 new African jobs, and exports facilitated by the Hub has contributed to the 36 percent increase in EAC exports to the United States between 2013 and 2015. Trade Africa has helped reduce cross-border transit times from key East African ports to land-locked interior destinations by as much as 80 percent – exceeding the initiative's 15 percent target – through its contribution to and leadership in the TradeMark East Africa initiative and the Hub's efforts to establish partner government joint border committees, support the development of \"single windows\" for traders to file paperwork, and facilitate the adoption of electronic data exchange systems. Trade Africa has also facilitated successful policy dialogues on trade and investment issues, including an agreement to cooperate on World Trade Organization trade facilitation measures and enhancing food safety.\nToday, USAID issued two reports on behalf of the Administration that highlight progress to date under the Trade Africa and Power Africa initiatives. The Power Africa Annual Report complements the January 2016 Power Africa Roadmap, which describes the initiative's path to achieving its ambitious access goals by 2030. The Trade Africa Annual Report highlights the most significant impacts this initiative has had on trade between African countries and between Africa and the United States. In addition, USTR issued a report entitled \"Beyond AGOA: Looking at the Future of U.S.-Africa Trade and Investment\", which considers paths to deepen the U.S.-Africa trade and investment relationship, keeping pace with dramatic change in Africa.\nThe United States is Supporting the Next Generation of African Leaders and Makers\nThe United States also recognizes the role that young people play in supporting economic growth, including through entrepreneurship. Africa's large and growing youth population is central to achieving and maintaining Africa's robust economic growth. That is why the United States has held two Global Entrepreneurship Summits (GES) in Africa – in Morocco in 2014 and in Kenya in 2015 – showcasing the innovation and economic opportunities of both North and Sub-Saharan Africa. Through the GES, the U.S. Government has mobilized more than $1 billion in capital for entrepreneurs across Africa and around the world. At the 2015 GES, USAID, the United Kingdom, and the Shell Foundation, under the auspices of Power Africa, launched the Scaling Off-Grid Energy: Grand Challenge for Development, a $36 million investment to empower entrepreneurs and investors to connect 20 million households in sub-Saharan Africa to modern, clean, and affordable electricity. As part of the Grand Challenge, USAID partnered with DOE and the Global Lighting and Energy Access Partnership to launch a refrigeration prize that will leverage $300,000 to catalyze technological advancements in off-grid refrigeration.\nSince 2010, the Young African Leaders Initiative (YALI) has engaged nearly 300,000 young Africans through the YALI Network, an online and in-person community of entrepreneurs, activists, and public servants working together to solve shared challenges for their continent and the world. Since 2014, two thousand young people have participated in the Mandela Washington Fellows program, and thousands more have joined seminars and workshops at the four YALI Regional Leadership Centers in Accra, Dakar, Nairobi, and Pretoria. The USADF has committed $7.5 million over three years to fund YALI entrepreneurs who are launching and expanding their businesses and social ventures across Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2016 Mandela Washington Fellows were able to join the first sector-specific YALI training program at the YALI Energy Institute, a collaboration between USAID, the U.S. Department of State, the DOE's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and the University of California at Davis.\nThe United States is Combatting Corruption at Home and Abroad\nWe have also committed to continue and expand efforts combat to corruption at home and abroad, as we recognize corruption's pernicious effects on inclusive economic growth, prosperity and sustainable development, as well as the obstacle that it continues to represent as we seek to grow trade and investment. In 2014, President Obama announced the Partnership on Illicit Finance (PIF) at the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, an initiative co-led by the United States and Senegal that brings together African partners and the United States to jointly tackle the challenges of corruption and other financial crimes. This May, the United States launched its PIF  National Action Plan, along with Senegal. The remaining six PIF partners are working to develop their plans, and we look forward to those plans being released soon. We are also working together to combat corruption and to increase transparency and accountability in the region through the Open Government Partnership (OGP). Participation from African countries in OGP is growing, and OGP can play an important role in addressing common governance challenges across the continent, including by engaging civil society and building trust in government. In addition, in May 2016, President Obama announced several important  steps we are taking in the United States to strengthen financial transparency, combat money laundering, corruption and tax evasion, and called upon Congress to take additional action to address these critical issues.", "timestamp": "2016-09-21", "title": "Fact Sheet: U.S.-Africa Cooperation on Trade and Investment Under the Obama Administration"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "The President spoke at 11:26 a.m. in the Grand Ballroom at the Plaza Hotel. In his remarks, he referred to former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York City, in his capacity as the founder of Bloomberg Philanthropies; and Jean Bosco Nzeyimana, founder and chief executive officer, HABONA Ltd.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119027", "text": "The President. Well, good morning, everybody.\nAudience members. Good morning.\nThe President. Let me begin by thanking Mayor Bloomberg, not just for the introduction, but for the incredible work that Bloomberg Philanthropies is doing, not just in helping this event, but for all the work that you're doing in promoting entrepreneurship and development throughout Africa. And I'd also like to thank our cohost and a tremendous champion of investment and engagement in Africa, my great friend, Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker.\nI also want to welcome our partners from across Africa, including the many heads of state and government leaders who are with us. And I want to acknowledge Senator Chris Coons and leaders from across my administration who share a profound commitment to expanding opportunity and deepening relationships between our countries.\nMost importantly, I want to thank all of you: the business leaders, entrepreneurs, on both sides of the Atlantic, who are working very hard every single day to create jobs and to grow economies and to lift up our people.\nNow, I gave a long speech yesterday. Some of you had to sit through it. [Laughter] I'm going to try to be a little more concise today. I'm here because, as the world gathers in New York City, we're reminded that on so many key challenges that we face—our security, our prosperity, climate change, the struggle for human rights and human dignity, the reduction of conflict—Africa is essential to our progress. Africa's rise is not just important to Africa, it's important to the entire world.\nYes, too many people across the continent still face conflict and hunger and disease. And yes, recent years have brought some stiff economic headwinds. And we have to be relentless in our efforts to end conflicts, and improve security and promote justice. At the same time, the broader trajectory of Africa is unmistakable. Thanks to many of you, Africa is on the move, home to some of the fastest growing economies in the world and a middle class projected to grow to more than a billion customers, an Africa of telecom companies and clean-tech startups and Silicon savannahs, all powered by the youngest population anywhere on the planet.\nAs President, I've worked to transform our relationship with Africa so that we're working together as equal partners. I'm proud to be the first American President to visit sub-Saharan Africa four times; the first to visit Ethiopia and speak before the African Union; the first to visit Kenya, which I think was obligatory. I would have been in trouble if I hadn't done that. [Laughter] I believe I'm also the first American President to dance the lipala in Nairobi—[laughter]—or to try to dance the lipala.\nAnd wherever I've gone, from Senegal to South Africa, Africans insist they do not just want aid, they want trade. They want partners, not patrons. They want to do business and grow businesses and create value and companies that will last and that will help to build a great future for the continent. And the United States is determined to be that partner for the long term, to accelerate the next era of African growth for all Africans. And that's why, over the past 8 years, we've dramatically expanded our economic engagement. With your support, we renewed the African Growth and Opportunity Act for another decade, giving African nations unprecedented access to American markets. We launched Trade Africa so that African countries can sell goods and services more easily across borders, both within Africa and with the United States. We created \"Doing Business in Africa\" campaign to help American businesses, including small businesses, pursue opportunities across Africa. And under Penny's leadership, nearly 300 American companies have taken trade missions to Africa, with more than 8,000 African buyers attending U.S. trade shows.\nIf you are an African entrepreneur or an American entrepreneur looking for more support, more capital, more technical assistance, there has never been a better time to partner with the United States. Commitments from the Export-Import Bank and the U.S. Trade and Development Agency have doubled. OPIC investments have tripled. Nearly 70 percent of Millennium Challenge Corporation compacts are now with African countries. And we've opened up and expanded new trade and investment offices from Ghana to Mozambique. Through our landmark Power Africa initiative, the United States is mobilizing more than 130 public and private sector partners and over $52 billion to double electricity access across sub-Saharan Africa.\nMeanwhile, our Global Entrepreneurship Summits in Morocco and Kenya and our Young Leaders—Young African Leaders Initiative are giving nearly 300,000 talented, striving young Africans the tools and networks to become the entrepreneurs and business leaders of the future. And we've got some of those outstanding young people here today. And 2 years ago, I welcomed many of you to our first-ever U.S.-Africa Business Forum, where we announced billions of dollars in new trade and investment between our countries.\nAnd you can see the results. American investment in Africa is up 70 percent. U.S. exports to Africa have surged. Iconic companies—FedEx, Kellogg's, Google—are growing their presence on the continent. You can hail an Uber in Lagos or Kampala. In the 2 years since our last forum, American and African companies have concluded deals worth nearly $15 billion, which will support African development across the board, from manufacturing to health care to renewable energy. Microsoft and Mawingu Networks are partnering to provide low-cost broadband to rural Kenyans. Procter & Gamble is expanding a plant in South Africa. MasterCard will work with Ethiopian banks so that more Ethiopians can send home remittances.\nThese are all serious commitments. New relationships are being forged. And I'm pleased that all together, the deals and commitments being announced at this forum add up to more than $9 billion in trade and investment with Africa.\nSo we are making progress, but we're just scratching the surface. We have so much more work that can be done and will be done. The fact is that, despite significant growth in much of the continent, Africa's entire GDP is still only about the GDP of France. Only a fraction of American exports—about 2 percent—go to Africa. So there's still so much untapped potential. And I may only be in this office for a few more months, but let me suggest a few areas where we need to focus in the years ahead.\nWe have to keep increasing the trade that creates broad-based growth. In East Africa alone, our new trade hubs have supported 29,000 jobs and helped increase exports to the United States by over a third. So we need to keep working to integrate African economies, diversify African exports, and bring down barriers at the borders. Since we're approaching two decades since AGOA was first passed, we're releasing a report today exploring the future beyond AGOA with trade agreements that are even more enduring and reciprocal.\nWe also have to keep making it easier to do business in Africa. We know progress is possible. A decade ago, if you wanted to start a business in Kenya, it took, on average, 54 days. Today, it takes less than half that. And governments that make additional reforms and cut redtape will have a partner in the United States.\nAt our last forum, I announced the creation of our Presidential Advisory Council to guide our work together. And today I'm pleased to welcome the newest members of our expanded council so that more industries and insights can shape their recommendations. Feel free to find them later. Bend their ear. Don't be shy. They are excited about their work and excited to hear from you.\nWe also need to invest more in the infrastructure that is the foundation of future prosperity. And as I indicated earlier, we're especially focused on increasing access to electricity for the two-thirds of sub-Saharan Africans who lack it. Three years after launching Power Africa, we're seeing real progress: solar power and natural gas in Nigeria, off-grid energy in Tanzania, people in rural Rwanda gaining electricity. This means that students can study at night and businesses can stay open. And we are not going to let up. Partners like the World Bank and the African Development Bank are mobilizing billions.\nLast month, the Government of Japan made a major commitment to support this work. And together with GE, today we're launching a public-private partnership to support energy enterprises managed by women in Africa. So we're on our way, and by 2030, I believe we can bring electricity to more than 60 million African homes and businesses. And that will be transformative.\nBut even if we do the infrastructure, even if we're passing more business-friendly laws, even if we're increasing trade, I think all of you know that we're also going to have to keep promoting the good governance that allows for good business. Graft, cronyism, corruption—it stifles growth, scares off investment. A business should begin with a handshake and not a shakedown. [Laughter] So through our efforts like our Open Government Partnership and our Partnership on Illicit Finance, we're going to keep working to encourage transparency, stamp out corruption, and uphold the rule of law. That's what's going to ultimately attract trade and investment and opportunity.\nThe truth is, is that those governments that are above board and transparent, people want to do business there. People don't want to do business in places where the rules are constantly changing depending on who's up, who's down, whose cousin is who. It creates the kinds of risks that scare investors away.\nAnd finally, we need to invest more in Africa's most precious resource, and that is its people, especially young people: men and women, boys and girls. I've had the opportunity to meet the next generation of leaders and entrepreneurs in Soweto and Dar es Salaam and Dakar. I've welcomed many of them to the White House. They are spectacular. They are itching to make a difference. Their passion is inspiring. Their talent is unmatched. They are hungry for knowledge and information and are willing to take risks. And many of them, because they've come from tough circumstances, by definition they're entrepreneurial. They've had to make a way out of no way and are resilient and resourceful.\nSo we've got to continue to empower these aspiring leaders, give them the tools, the training, and the support so that a few years from now, they can be sitting in this room. Because if Africa's young people flourish, if they are getting education, if they are getting opportunity, I'm absolutely convinced that Africa will flourish as well.\nAnd they are the future leaders that inspire me. I think of the Rwandan entrepreneur I met earlier this year at one of our entrepreneurship summits. His company is turning biomass into energy. He started his business when he was 19 years old. And a lot of folks didn't get what he was doing or why. He made an interesting comment that sometimes in traditional cultures, in African cultures, the working assumption is, is that young people don't know anything. And since we were in Silicon Valley when he was telling this story, I wanted to point out that folks in Africa may want to rethink that, because if you're over 30 there, you're basically over the hill. [Laughter]\nBut he kept at it. And as he told me, \"No matter what you're trying to do, you need the motive in your mind that you want to help your society move forward.\" He was doing well, but he was also trying to do good.\nAnd that's what this is all about. That's the work that we've got to carry on. This is a U.S.-Africa Business Forum. This is not charity. All of you should be wanting to make money and create great products and great services and be profitable and do right by your investors. But the good news is, in Africa right now, if you are doing well, you can also be doing a lot of good. And if we keep that in mind, if we do more to buy from each other and sell from each other, if we do more to bring down barriers to doing business, if we do more to strengthen infrastructure and innovation and governance, I know we're going to be able to move our societies and economies forward. And that will be good, not just for Africa, but it will be good for the United States and good for the world.\nWe want Africa as a booming, growing, thriving market, where we can do business, where you've got a young population that is surging. And although this will be the last time I participate in the U.S. Business Forum—U.S-Africa Business Forum as President, I think you should anticipate that I will be continuing to work with all of you in the years to come, and I know that Penny has done a great job in working to institutionalize these efforts. And when we've got great partners like Mike Bloomberg and the Bloomberg Foundation involved in this, I have no doubt that this is just going to keep on growing, and we're going to look back and say, we were on to something.\nThank you so much, everybody. Appreciate it. Keep up the great work.", "timestamp": "2016-09-21", "title": "Remarks at the United States-Africa Business Forum in New York City"}

In his remarks, he referred to former President Shimon Peres of Israel, who suffered a stroke on September 13.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119028", "text": "Prime Minister Netanyahu. Mr. President, it's very good to see you again. First, I want to thank you for the memorandum of understanding that we signed last week. It greatly enhances Israel's security. It fortifies the principle that you've enunciated many times that Israel should be able to defend itself, by itself, against any threat.\nSecondly, I want to thank you for the extensive security and intelligence cooperation between our two countries. I don't think people at large understand the breadth and depth of this cooperation, but I know it. And I want to thank you on behalf of all the people of Israel.\nThird, I want to thank you for the many meetings we've had in which we discussed how to confront common challenges and how to seize common opportunities. The greatest challenge is, of course, the unremitting fanaticism. The greatest opportunity is to advance a durable peace. That's a goal that I and the people of Israel will never give up on.\nWe've been fortunate that, in pursuing these two tasks, Israel has no greater friend than the United States of America, and America has no greater friend than Israel. Our alliance has grown decade after decade, through successive Presidents, a bipartisan Congress, and the overwhelming support of the American people. It's an unbreakable bond based on common values, buttressed by common interest, and bound by a shared destiny.\nAnd I want to thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to once again discuss how we can shape that destiny together. And I'd like to add, if I may, one final point. As you conclude your presidency, I know you're going to be busy with many, many things, much more than improving what I hear is a terrific golf game. [Laughter] Your voice—your influential—voice will be heard for many decades. And I know you'll continue to support Israel's right to defend itself and its right to thrive as a Jewish state. So I want you to know, Barack, that you'll always be a welcome guest in Israel.\nAnd, by the way, I don't play golf, but right next to my home in Caesarea, in Israel, is a terrific golf course. So——\nPresident Obama. We'll set up a tee time. [Laughter]\nPrime Minister Netanyahu. Thank you.\nPresident Obama. Thank you. Thank you so much.\nWell, it's good to once again welcome Prime Minister Netanyahu and his delegation here. I want to start by just sending a message that all of the American people, my entire administration, and me, personally, are thinking about Shimon Peres, a great friend, a hero, and giant in the history of Israel. And we are hopeful that he will have a speedy recovery.\nI've always joked whenever I've seen Shimon that I wanted to see what he ate and what he did, because he's always looked so good. I know this has been a challenging time for him and his family, but I wanted to make sure that I relay my gratitude to him for his friendship and his leadership in helping to forge a strong U.S.-Israeli bond. As Prime Minister Netanyahu mentioned, the bond between the United States and Israel is unbreakable. It is based on common values, family ties, a recognition that a Jewish State of Israel is one of our most important allies, and a guiding principle throughout my Presidency—one that I've expressed often to the Prime Minister—is, is that it is important for America's national security to ensure that we have a safe and secure Israel, one that can defend itself.\nAnd so the memorandum of understanding that we recently signed, I think, is indicative of that. What it does is provide an assurance and a foundation for the kinds of ongoing military and intelligence cooperation that has been the hallmark of our relationship. It allows, I think, Israeli planners the kind of certainty in a moment where there's enormous uncertainty in the region. It is a very difficult and dangerous time in the Middle East, and we want to make sure that Israel has the full capabilities it needs in order to keep the Israeli people safe and secure.\nSo this will give us an opportunity to talk about the challenges that arise out of situations like Syria. I'll also be interested in hearing from the Prime Minister his assessment of conditions within Israel and in the West Bank. Obviously, our hearts go out to those who have been injured, both Israeli and Palestinian. Clearly, there is great danger of not just terrorism, but also flareups of violence. We do have concerns around settlement activity, as well. And our hope is that we can continue to be an effective partner with Israel in finding a path to peace.\nObviously, I'm only going to be President for another few months. The Prime Minister will be there quite a bit longer. And our hope will be that in these conversations we get a sense of how Israel sees the next few years, what the opportunities are and what the challenges are in order to assure that we keep alive the possibility of a stable, secure Israel at peace with its neighbors and a Palestinian homeland that meets the aspirations of their people.\nBut obviously, these are challenging times. One thing I can say about Prime Minister Netanyahu is, he has always been candid with us, and his team has cooperated very effectively with ours. We very much appreciate it. And I guarantee you that I will visit Israel often, because it is a beautiful country with beautiful people. And Michelle and the girls, I think, resent the fact that I've not taken them on most of these trips, so they're insistent that I do take them. Of course, they will appreciate the fact that the next time I visit Israel I won't have to sit in bilats—[laughter]—but instead can enjoy the sights and sounds of a remarkable country.\nSo thank you very much.\nPrime Minister Netanyahu.

This is the first time that I'm seeing him in person since the historic agreement that was achieved in Colombia, ending the longest war in Latin America and providing an opportunity for Colombia to open an entirely new chapter of its history.\nI could not be more supportive of these efforts. The American people welcome these efforts. I recognize that there are going to be a lot of challenges involved in implementation, and I recognize that the people of Colombia still have to lend their voice through a referendum in order for it to move forward. But I think this is an achievement of historic proportions. It ultimately will be good for the region, as well as the people of Colombia. It took a lot of courage and a lot of hard work by a lot of people.

And I also want to just thank President Santos and his delegation for the continued cooperation on a wide range of regional issues, including making sure that we don't slip on the progress that's been made in stamping out transnational drug organizations.\nSo it's a great achievement, and we're very proud of you. And congratulations.\nPresident Santos. Thank you. Almost 6 years ago, when I decided to take this step, one of the first persons that I informed about my intentions was President Obama. And since then, he has been a great support, every day, every week asking how is it going, and supporting it in every way possible. You appointed a Special Envoy, Bernie Aronson, and he did a terrific job. The Secretary of State has been there many times, pushing the process forward.\nAnd I wanted to give to you a special edition, 297 pages. I think it's the most comprehensive peace agreement to date, probably in history. It's every detail. But you deserve a lot of credit for this very historic agreement, which will change not only Colombia, the whole region. As you said, it is the oldest, longest, cruelest armed conflict that Latin America has had.\nAnd thank you very much from the bottom of my heart, in the name of 50 million Colombians. President Obama, here is the result of this effort.\n[At this point, President Santos presented President Obama with a ceremonial copy of the peace agreement.]\nPresident Obama. Thank you so much.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119030", "text": "Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies\nSubject: Climate Change and National Security\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct the following:\nSection 1. Purpose. This memorandum establishes a framework and directs Federal departments and agencies (agencies) to perform certain functions to ensure that climate change-related impacts are fully considered in the development of national security doctrine, policies, and plans.\nSec. 2. Background. Climate change poses a significant and growing threat to national security, both at home and abroad. Climate change and its associated impacts affect economic prosperity, public health and safety, and international stability. Extended drought, more frequent and severe weather events, heat waves, warming and acidifying ocean waters, catastrophic wildfires, and rising sea levels all have compounding effects on people's health and well-being. Flooding and water scarcity can negatively affect food and energy production. Energy infrastructure, essential for supporting other key sectors, is already vulnerable to extreme weather and may be further compromised. Impacts of a changing climate can create conditions that promote pest outbreaks and the spread of invasive species as well as plant, animal, and human disease, including emerging infectious disease, and these can further undermine economic growth and livelihoods. Impacts can also disrupt transportation service, cutting off vulnerable communities from relief immediately after events and reducing economic output. These conditions, in turn, can stress some countries' ability to provide the conditions necessary for human security. All of these effects can lead to population migration within and across international borders, spur crises, and amplify or accelerate conflict in countries or regions already facing instability and fragility.\nClimate change and associated impacts on U.S. military and other national security-related missions and operations could adversely affect readiness, negatively affect military facilities and training, increase demands for Federal support to non-federal civil authorities, and increase response requirements to support international stability and humanitarian assistance needs.\nThe costs of preparing for, responding to, and recovering from the impacts of climate change are expected to increase in the coming decades. Some meteorological events (i.e., heat waves and intense precipitation) are projected to become more frequent and more severe, occur in geographic areas not previously exposed to such events, inflict more damage, heighten humanitarian needs, undermine development investments, adversely impact public health, contribute to ecological, social, and political instability, compromise diplomatic goals, and undermine national security interests. There is evidence that the rate of climate change and the resulting impacts are accelerating, even as global efforts to curb greenhouse gas pollution are increasing. The United States must take a comprehensive approach to identifying and acting on climate change-related impacts on national security interests, including by maintaining its international leadership on climate issues. Sec. 3. Policy. It is the policy of the Federal Government to ensure that the current impacts of climate change, and those anticipated in the coming decades, be identified and considered in the development and implementation of relevant national security doctrine, policies, and plans. This policy builds on the following Presidential directives and policies:\n(a) the 2015 National Security Strategy, which identified climate change as an urgent and growing threat to our national security, contributing to increased natural disasters, refugee flows, and conflicts over basic resources like food and water. It added that increased sea levels and storm surges threaten coastal regions, infrastructure, and property, which in turn threatens the global economy, and compounds the growing costs of preparing and restoring infrastructure;\n(b) the President's Climate Action Plan of June 2013, which included actions to help prepare the United States for the impacts of climate change;\n(c) Executive Order 13653 of November 1, 2013 (Preparing the United States for the Impacts of Climate Change), which directed Federal agency actions to incorporate climate-resilience considerations into agency operations and other mission objectives;\n(d) Executive Order 13677 of September 23, 2014 (Climate-Resilient International Development), which set requirements for systematically integrating climate-resilience considerations into U.S. international development work; and\n(e) Executive Order 13693 of March 19, 2015 (Planning for Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade), which directed Federal actions to improve environmental performance and Federal sustainability.\nSec. 4. Coordination on Climate Change and National Security.\n(a) The Climate and National Security Working Group. The Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology, or their designees, will chair an interagency working group (Working Group) to coordinate the development of a strategic approach to identify, assess, and share information on current and projected climate-related impacts on national security interests and to inform the development of national security doctrine, policies, and plans.\n(b) Representation. The Working Group shall include representatives, at the Assistant Secretary or equivalent level, or their designees, from:\n(i) the Department of State;\n(ii) the Department of the Treasury;\n(iii) the Department of Defense;\n(iv) the Department of Justice;\n(v) the Department of the Interior;\n(vi) the Department of Agriculture;\n(vii) the Department of Commerce;\n(viii) the Department of Health and Human Services;\n(ix) the Department of Transportation;\n(x) the Department of Energy; (xi) the Department of Homeland Security;\n(xii) the United States Agency for International Development;\n(xiii) the Environmental Protection Agency;\n(xiv) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration;\n(xv) the Office of the Director of National Intelligence;\n(xvi) the U.S. Mission to the United Nations;\n(xvii) the Office of Management and Budget;\n(xviii) the Council on Environmental Quality;\n(xix) the Millennium Challenge Corporation; and\n(xx) any other agencies or offices as designated by the Co-Chairs.\n(c) Functions. The Working Group, in close collaboration with the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), shall:\n(i) identify the U.S. national security priorities that are within the scope of the Working Group's mission;\n(ii) develop recommendations for requirements for climate and social science data and intelligence analyses, as appropriate, that support national security interests;\n(iii) catalog climate science data, intelligence analyses, and other products and programs that support or should be considered in the development of national security doctrine, policy, and plans. This catalogue shall include climate and social science data repositories and analytical platforms; climate modeling, simulation, and projection capabilities; and information-sharing tools and resources supporting climate risk analyses and assessments, such as the Climate Data Initiative, the Climate Resilience Toolkit, the Global Change Information System, and the National Climate Assessment;\n(iv) identify information and program gaps that limit consideration of climate change-related impacts in developing national security doctrine, policies, and plans. Descriptions of these gaps will be provided to Federal science agencies and the United States Intelligence Community to inform future research requirements and priorities, including collection priorities, on climate data, models, simulations, and projections;\n(v) facilitate the production and exchange of climate data and information with relevant stakeholders, including the United States Intelligence Community, and private sector partners, as appropriate;\n(vi) produce, as appropriate, and make available science-informed intelligence assessments to agencies having responsibilities in the development of national security doctrine, policies, and plans in order to identify climate change-related impacts and prioritize actions related thereto;\n(vii) establish, by consensus, guidance for Working Group members on coordinating, sharing, and exchanging climate science data among the members, and with the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC); (viii) provide a venue for enhancing the understanding of the links between climate change-related impacts and national security interests and discussing the opportunities for climate mitigation and adaptation activities to address national security issues;\n(ix) work to improve the Federal Government's capability and capacity to characterize greenhouse gas sources and sinks accurately at sub-continental scales;\n(x) in coordination with the NSTC, recommend research guidelines concerning the Federal Government's ability to detect climate intervention activities;\n(xi) develop, by consensus, guidance for Working Group members on building climate resilience in countries vulnerable to climate change-related impacts;\n(xii) provide information and Working Group-related progress updates to the Council on Climate Preparedness and Resilience, established by Executive Order 13653, Preparing the United States for the Impacts of Climate Change, on a quarterly basis;\n(xiii) take into account defined requirements and current capabilities described in subsection (4)(c)(ii) and (iii) of this memorandum to facilitate the consideration of climate change-related impacts into national security doctrine, policies, and plans. The Working Group shall develop recommended climate data requirements and consider the cost of the production and exchange of this information, and making this information available;\n(xiv) have classified and unclassified capabilities, as required and appropriate, to consolidate and make available climate change-related impact information, intelligence analyses, and assessments for access and use by Working Group member agencies;\n(xv) identify the most current information on regional, country, and geographic areas most vulnerable to current and projected impacts of climate variability in the near- (current to 10 years), mid- (10 to 30 years), and long- (more than 30 years) term, in order to support assessments of national security implications of climate change, and identify areas most vulnerable to these impacts during these timeframes;\n(xvi) develop recommendations for the Secretary of State to help ensure that the work of U.S. embassies, including their planning processes, are better informed by relevant climate change-related analyses; and\n(xvii) coordinate on the development of quantitative models, predictive mapping products, and forecasts to anticipate the various pathways through which climate change may affect public health as an issue of national security.\n(d) Action Plan. Within 90 days of the date of this memorandum, the Working Group shall, by consensus, develop an Action Plan, which shall identify specific steps that are required to perform the Working Group's functions. The Action Plan shall also include specific objectives, milestones, timelines, and identification of agencies responsible for completion of all actions described therein. The Action Plan shall include recommendations to inform the development of agency implementation plans, as described in section 5 of this memorandum. The Action Plan shall be submitted to the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology. Sec. 5. Federal Agency Implementation Plan. Within 150 days of the date of this memorandum, the agencies listed in subsection 4(b) of this memorandum shall each develop an appropriate implementation plan supporting the policy of this memorandum. Such implementation plans may be classified, as required, to meet specific agency requirements. Implementation plans shall consider for inclusion, but not be limited to, a description of how the respective agencies will accomplish the following actions:\n(a) identify, sustain, and strengthen climate-related data repositories, tools, and modeling products that inform climate change-related impacts on national security;\n(b) identify climate change-related risks to agency missions, and risks that may be caused by agency policies, programs, and actions concerning international development objectives, fragility, and regional stability;\n(c) pursue agency adaptation strategies and methods that address climate change-related impacts on national security and homeland defense;\n(d) identify and implement climate change-related information-sharing opportunities and arrangements through international development activities, military-to-military engagements, and government-to-government climate-related data exchanges;\n(e) identify economic considerations arising from the impacts of climate change globally and the resulting specific impacts on national security, including macroeconomic analyses and data-sharing mechanisms;\n(f) identify the potential impact of climate change on human mobility, including migration and displacement, and the resulting impacts on national security;\n(g) identify climate change-related impacts on global water and food security and nutrition and the resulting impacts on national security, and recommend actions to mitigate these impacts;\n(h) identify climate change-related global health security concerns affecting humans, animals, and plants, and develop options to address them;\n(i) develop an agency-specific approach to address climate-related hazards and threats to national security;\n(j) determine and act on climate change-related threats to infrastructure at the asset, system, and regional level and act to strengthen the safety, security, and resilience of infrastructure critical to national security; and\n(k) incorporate climate change-related impact information and considerations into agency technical and executive education and training programs.\nSec. 6.

There's a lot going on in the world today, so I anticipate a wide variety of questions today. So let's just get right to it.\nKevin, do you want the start?\nQ: Sure, Josh. Can you speak to the President's thoughts about the unrest taking place in Charlotte? And is this an indication that, despite a lot of focus on this issue, a lot of meetings by the President, a lot of comments, that really tensions have only gotten worse between law enforcement and many in the black community over the summer instead of gotten better?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, the President has, unfortunately, had numerous opportunities to address this topic, not just over the last couple of years, but as you mentioned, over the summer. What's clear is that there's important work to be done in local communities all across the country to build trust and strengthen the relationship between individual local law enforcement agencies and the communities that they're sworn to serve and protect.\nAnd the President has played a leading role in trying to discuss publicly some of these issues and to raise this policy -- or these policy questions as a legitimate priority, something that is worthy of careful consideration by policymakers all across the country.\nThis is a particularly complex set of issues, in part because we know that the vast majority of men and women who work in law enforcement are genuine public servants who keep their communities safe and who put their lives on the line to do so. There are countless examples that the President has cited of individuals performing that work heroically, and saving lives and saving communities.\nWhat's also true, what the President has also addressed is there are legitimate concerns that have been raised about inequities in our criminal justice system. These are inequities that break down, in many cases, along racial lines. And those are difficult questions that must be confronted; they cannot be ignored. And the President has certainly played his own role in making sure that these issues are not ignored.\nThe President has talked about them publicly on a number of occasions. The President has also convened a 21st century -- a Task Force on 21st Century Policing that brought together civil rights leaders, academics, leading law enforcement officials to talk about steps that communities can take to build this trust. And the President continues to believe it's in the interest of everybody for the relationship between local law enforcement and individual communities to improve and to strengthen. That certainly increases the safety of local law enforcement officials and law enforcement officers; it makes them more effective at doing their jobs; and it also makes our communities safer, which is ultimately everybody's goal.\nQ: I suspect there will be quite a few questions on that topic.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay.\nQ: I wanted to ask about Bashar al-Assad accusing the U.S. of intentionally attacking the Syrian military, saying that multiple planes were involved in what he described as a lengthy attack. I just wanted to get the White House reaction to his comments.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think that we've already addressed publicly that over the weekend there was an incident that is under investigation by the Department of Defense because it may have resulted in a strike not against an intended ISIL target but against some Syrian government forces. This is something that the Department of Defense is still investigating. But we've acknowledged that an error likely occurred and we've owned up to that.\nPresident Assad, however, has not owned up to the fact that his military has targeted hospitals and refugee camps, carried out barrel bomb attacks against innocent civilians. In some cases, those barrel bombs included using chlorine as a weapon. President Assad is somebody who has contributed greatly to violence, chaos and bloodshed in his country. And the consequences of his failed leadership and his willingness to resort to violence against innocent civilians has caused mayhem not just across his country but across his country and around the world.\nThat's something that he needs to own up to, and it's certainly the reason that he has lost the legitimacy to lead that country, and it's why even the Russians acknowledge -- his biggest defender in the international community -- even they acknowledge that a politics transition inside of Syria is necessary.\nQ: There appears to be quite a divide between the State Department and the military over a proposal to ground all warplanes in Syria. Have they not been consulting each other? Generals were on the Hill today saying they were against such a proposal. Does that mean the proposal is out the window now.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, what I can tell you is that there is a continued effort to test the proposition that Russia can succeed in living up to the terms of the Cessation of Hostilities and persuade the Assad regime to do the same. There is an open question about whether Russia is willing or able to do so, and the last 10 days or so have raised significant doubts about Russia's credibility. That creaking sound you hear is Russia's international credibility taking an additional hit as the Assad regime fails to live up to the commitments that they made in the context of the Cessation of Hostilities, and as additional evidence indicates that the Russians themselves have not abided by the terms of the Cessation of Hostilities.\nSo that's the fundamental question that we're facing. And there is unanimity of opinion across the United States government that there won't be any cooperation militarily with the Russians unless and until the Russians live up to the commitments that they've made. There's no disagreement about that.\nRoberta.\nQ: You mentioned the 21st Century Policing Task Force. I'm wondering, given that experience and work that the White House has done on that issue, what the White House makes of the suggestion by Republican candidate Donald Trump that stop-and-frisk be used more broadly by police departments in America.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not going to respond to comments from the Republican nominee on the campaign trail. I think people can consult the Task Force on 21st Century Policing that was formed under the auspices of this administration to lay out suggestions for local law enforcement agencies across the country about what they can do to enhance trust with the communities that they're sworn to serve and protect. And strengthening those bonds of trust keeps law enforcement officers safer, makes them more effective at doing their job; it also ends up making communities safer as well.\nExpanding and doubling down on stop-and-frisk policies is not among the suggestions, I think for rather obvious reasons.\nQ: I wanted also to ask about this latest hacking situation that seems to have come to light this morning and that has revealed Mrs. Obama's passport and some other information. I'm wondering whether the White House has any response, any idea how it happened, any attribution. Was it Russia?\nMR. EARNEST: Obviously, I've seen the reports about this. I can tell you that administration officials are taking a look at the information that's been disclosed. Obviously we take any reports about a cyber breach seriously, particularly if it may include some sensitive information.\nAt this point, I cannot speak to the authenticity of the information that's been released, but certainly this is something that we're taking a close look at, as we do with any report of a cyber intrusion. And, no, at this point I cannot announce any sort of conclusion that's been reached about the individual or individuals that may have been responsible for the cyber breach that resulted in this information being leaked.\nApril.\nQ: Josh, I want to go back to Charlotte, and also, yesterday on another topic. But on Charlotte, on the issue of Charlotte -- has President Obama talked to Secretary Foxx about his hometown of Charlotte and what can be done and what his thoughts are?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I don't believe the President has had a chance to talk to Secretary Foxx. I know the President yesterday had the opportunity to talk to both the mayor of Charlotte and the mayor of Tulsa, two communities that are confronting these issues in a real and tangible way right now. I can tell you that the President this afternoon spoke to Governor McCrory from North Carolina to get an additional update about the response to the situation in Charlotte as well.\nSo the President is certainly aware of what's happening and has been in close touch with local officials. And in those conversations, the President has offered his condolences to communities that are mourning the loss of loved ones. The President has also articulated his administration's support for communities that are grappling with these difficult questions.\nThe President also hopes that the rights of peaceful protestors will be protected, but he also believes that it should be made clear that the protests must remain peaceful, and that they should not be used as an excuse to engage in vandalism or violence. That only serves to distract from the issues that should be the subject of careful public scrutiny.\nQ: So as you call for peaceful protest, which happens to be their right, there are people there in Charlotte who say, yes, they have a right to protest, but the question is how far will they go and when will the line be crossed when there is the possibility of militarization. When the President talked to the governor and other officials in Charlotte, did he bring up the issue of the militarization issue, of talking about anything about tear gas, and what the -- because people are afraid in Charlotte and Baltimore because of -- the police and how they're interacting with the crowd -- think they have a fighting chance?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have a more detailed readout of the President's conversation to share with you. I can tell you that the President certainly -- well, look, you all have heard the President talk about this issue. I'm not saying anything new. The President believes strongly in the right of individuals to publicly protest, to voice their concerns in public. Those rights are protected in the United States Constitution. And the President believes strongly in not just allowing individuals to exercise those rights, but in the responsibility that government officials at every level have in protecting the ability of private citizens to exercise those rights.\nThat's important. It's also important that people don't use a peaceful, public protest as an excuse to engage in violence, or to engage in vandalism. There's no excuse for that.\nQ: When you talk about these protests, many people try to come up with solutions and reasons why -- reasons as to why it's happened. And some of those who are analyzing these types of situations -- be it Baltimore, be it Ferguson, be it Charlotte right now, be it wherever -- they're saying there's been a lack of community policing, that people like Congressman John Lewis, who said community policing is a major issue. Also, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson has said community policing --\nis there anything that this administration can do to change dynamics in some communities to prevent this, and try to implement in this last few months the issue of community policing that has been cut in many communities, like Baltimore, because budgetary constraints?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, April, even the phrase that you're using, \"community policing,\" suggests that these kinds of law enforcement decisions should be made at the community level. It shouldn't be imposed by the federal government. So the President believes that the most effective role for the federal government to play is, first of all, to share information, particularly with regard to best practices. And that's exactly what his Task Force on 21st Century Policing was formed to do.\nSo if there are law enforcement agencies who are interested in adapting and adopting these best practices, we would certainly welcome them doing so. Many of them already have. And there are a number of communities that have made progress and have made strides in improving the relationship with the communities that they police based on their commitment to these best practices.\nSo we've made important progress at the community level, based on the leadership that's shown by mayors and sheriffs and police chiefs all across the country.\nThe other thing that federal government can do is look for ways to provide additional resources to local law enforcement agencies that are trying to do the right thing. And there are grants and other expertise that the Department of Justice can provide. There is an office at the Department of Justice that's dedicated to community-oriented policing. And, in fact, there are some resources from the Department of Justice that are being sent to Charlotte to help that community deal with the situation that they're facing right now. And we certainly would welcome Congress appropriating additional resources that could be deployed to assist communities that are taking on this tough challenge.\nQ: Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson says this breach between the community and law enforcement is a national security issue. And if it is deemed as such by your head of Homeland Security, why not mandate or executive order it that there should be community policing in these urban areas -- in these areas where these types of things are happening?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, April, you're using the word \"community-oriented policing,\" and I think that connotes the idea that it's not a solution that's going to be imposed by the federal government.\nQ: But your head, your Secretary of Homeland Security says it's a national security issue, so it's gone beyond community, if he's saying it's a national security issue. That's just my humble opinion.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay.\nQ: But now, wait a minute, one more question. Thank you. I'm sorry. Yesterday, on the road, there was a word used by Don King at a rally for Donald Trump, and it's a word that you had to deal with a couple of months ago -- the \"N\" word. Did the President say anything about it? And what do you say about the fact that Don King is essentially saying any African American, no matter what level that they have achieved, is that word?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, I'm not going to -- I don't have anything to say in response to his rhetoric.\nJustin.\nQ: I wanted to ask about the stop-gap spending bill the Republicans -- at least the text of their proposal. It has not been warmly received by House and Senate Democrats, with Senator Reid suggesting the White House would veto it. Is that true? What is your interpretation? And are we -- what is your assessment of whether or not a shutdown is an increasing reality?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Justin, when I walked out here, I hadn't heard about any text that's been made public. I know that over the last several weeks, there were a variety of proposals that have been floated on Capitol Hill.\nWhat I can tell you is that our principle has not changed. And that is, the President believes that the United States Congress should fulfill its basic duty to pass a budget. And Republicans have failed to do that. Republicans have a strong majority in the House of Representatives. They've got a majority in the United States Senate. And they've had nine months to work on spending bills and send them to the President's desk. And a grand total of zero of them have been passed through the House and the Senate. That's a failure of House Republicans to fulfill their -- among their more basic responsibilities.\nAnd so that's why Congress right now is faced with this question about passing a short-term budget measure. The President does not believe that a short-term budget measure that only exists because Congress hasn't done their job in the first place should be used to pass ideological riders in the law. And the President is not going to be a part of any effort to sign those kinds of ideological riders into law when they're attached to a short-term spending bill.\nThe real question that's facing Congress right now, and the real question that's facing Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan right now is whether or not they're going to go along with a Ted Cruz-engineered effort, backed by Donald Trump, to shut down the government under false pretenses.\nSenator Cruz has certainly done that before. Leader McConnell went along with that before. He's going to have to make a decision, Speaker Ryan is going to have to make a decision about whether or not that's in the best interests of the country, and whether or not, frankly, that's in the best interests of their party's candidates who are on the ballot in seven weeks.\nQ: Just to drill down on that, I assume you're referring to the ICANN provision that's been offered by Senator Cruz.\nMR. EARNEST: That's correct.\nQ: So that's a red line for you guys? You'd be unwilling to sign a budget that includes that? And secondly, a non-ideological point of tension on this bill has been funding for Ex-Im. I was wondering if you could provide clarity on whether or not you guys would need to see that for the President to accept -- or advocate for Democrats, who despite being a minority do hold some power in the Senate?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Justin, again, as you've heard me say many times, if you and I were trying to negotiate this out, we can probably figure it out in relatively short order.\nQ: I'm not trying to negotiate. I just want your position on -- (laughter).\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I understand. I haven't seen the -- like I said, I haven't seen the specific proposal that's been put forward today. But, look, I think with regard to the proposal that's being moved forward by Senator Cruz, with the strong support of Donald Trump, we see a proposal that doesn't withstand any scrutiny. It's also a proposal that business leaders, leaders in the technology sector, leading entrepreneurs and innovators all oppose and say would be bad policy.\nIt also strikes me as a curious position for a self-described small government conservative to shut down the government to ensure that the federal government can continue to control the Internet. That doesn't make any sense.\nWith regard to the Ex-Im Bank, I think our position on this is actually pretty clear, which is in some ways this is exhibit A of Republican congressional dysfunction. You have Senator Shelby, who -- maybe never, actually, the Chair of the Senate Banking Committee -- that is his title. I don't think he actually sits in that chair, because that committee doesn't seem to do much work. You have a Republican nominee to the Ex-Im Bank that is being blocked by Senator Shelby right now. So this is not somebody that President Obama has strongly advocated for. This is somebody that Leader McConnell vouches for. So this isn't a partisan fight. This is just run-of-the-mill Republican dysfunction that, again, I think contributes to the remarkably low standing -- or I guess I should say low regard -- that the American people hold Congress in right now.\nThe fact of the matter is, the Ex-Im Bank does important work that contributes to economic growth and job creation. And right now they're handcuffed because they don't have a quorum on their board. And the reason they don't have a quorum on their board is because the Republican chair of the Senate Banking Committee is blocking the Republican nominee to the board. I mean, it almost is difficult to describe what poor judgment that shows.\nAnd we obviously feel quite strongly about it. And, quite frankly, we believe that's something that should have been rectified months ago. But, again, maybe it's because Republicans are so dysfunctional. Maybe it's because Republicans are unwilling to do their job in the United States Senate. Maybe it's because Republicans have worked the fewest days of any Congress since the 1950s. There are a variety of explanations. But none of them legitimizes the failure of Republicans in Congress to do something so basic, so nonpartisan, that would improve our economy even further. And we believe they should.\nQ: Can I ask a couple quick ones on the 9/11 Saudi bill?\nMR. EARNEST: Sure.\nQ: The first one is just a logistical one. I know you've said that he's going to veto it. Can we expect that to be late Friday night? Is this a news dump situation, or is that going to happen --\nMR. EARNEST: I don't think it's a news dump situation. I think you all are aware of the fact that it's going to happen, it's just a matter of when. And as soon as it does, we'll let you know.\nQ: But no actual guidance on when the President is planning to do that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, certainly before the -- he will do it within the 10-day window that's described in the Constitution. And as you point out, the end of that 10-day window is tomorrow evening.\nQ: Has the administration at all reached out to the Saudis to work on some sort of voluntary move that could provide assistance to 9/11 families and head this off at the pass? Has that been any -- have there been any diplomatic kind of negotiations or discussions around this?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'll let the Saudis speak for themselves, but I think the reports that we have seen and their public statements indicate that they're concerned about the passage of this legislation, and they've certainly contacted the United States government about that concern.\nBut I think the important point here, Justin, is it's not just the Saudis who are deeply concerned. Our partners in the EU sent a letter to the State Department indicating their significant concern about the potential passage of this legislation. Just to read briefly from that letter -- \"State immunity is a central pillar of the international legal order. Any derogation from the principle of immunity bears the inherent danger of causing reciprocal action by other states, and erosion of the principle as such.\"\nThat's some legalistic language that indicates that if this bill were to enter into force, if the President's veto were overridden, the United States government, U.S. servicemembers, U.S. diplomats, and even, potentially, U.S. companies are at risk of being hauled into court in countries all around the world. And that's something that this principle -- the erosion of this principle is something that the EU is concerned about as well. But the truth is, there is no country in the world that has more at stake in that debate than the United States, because we are engaged in countries around the world.\nSo we certainly have heard from some of our closest partners in the EU expressing their concern about this legislation. I would also note the letter from a bipartisan group of national security experts indicating what they describe as their deep concerns about this bill. And this includes President George W. Bush's Attorney General, President George W. Bush's National Security Advisor, and other officials who have served Presidents in both parties.\nSo this is one of those moments in which people who are unencumbered by politics and are allowed to evaluate a particular piece of legislation based on their expertise have a very strong view that mirrors the President's. And we're going to continue to make that case to members of Congress.\nAnd I think, Justin, what I'm trying to illustrate here is that so much of the coverage of this particular piece of legislation evaluates its impact on the United States' relationship with Saudi Arabia. The concern that the administration has is about the impact that this legislation would have on the United States' relationship with every other country in the world, including Saudi Arabia. And that's why we believe this is a bad bill. It's why the President is going to veto it. I also think, Justin, it's why we hear in private from some members of Congress that they're uneasy about this bill, too.\nQ: You've mentioned that a couple times.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I'm going to let individual members of Congress express their own position. And there are plenty of people who have been hired on Capitol Hill to be a spokesperson for a member of Congress. I'm a spokesperson for the President of the United States, and I've done my best to articulate his views in public as clearly as I can. But you'll have to ask my counterparts on Capitol Hill for the views of individual members of Congress.\nMichelle.\nQ: You said a couple of times during this briefing what the President thinks about the issue surrounding the Charlotte protests, what he would say. Well, on this occasion, in the wake of two shootings -- and this one that has necessitated bringing in the National Guard -- why doesn't he say something to the American public?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I don't have any additional details from the President's schedule to disclose at this point. The President is doing an interview later today, and I guess there certainly is potential that he could get asked about it in that context. We'll let you know.\nBut I also -- I think people would be hard-pressed to make the case that somehow the President has not been particularly visible on these issues. I think the President has spoken more about these issues all across the country over the last couple of years than any other public official that comes to my mind. Part of that is because he has got a responsibility as the President of the United States. Part of that is because of the President's strongly held personal views about this topic. Part of that is because the President's commitment to trying to do something about it. And so you've heard frequently from the President on these issues, and I'm confident that you've not heard him talk about this for the last time.\nQ: And the kind of protest that we've seen in Charlotte -- and we've seen that a number of times now where there is some violence, where things do get out of hand. You mentioned that -- yeah, I mean, nobody is disputing the fact that everybody has the right to protest. But how does the President feel about whether protests like this are productive? Does he see a value in this kind of demonstration? Or does he feel like this adds to division?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what is true, Michelle, is that it's easy -- and I'm not accusing you of this -- but I think it is easy for people to generalize in describing the conduct of people who are protesting. What is typically the case -- and I think this is true in communities across the country -- is that the vast majority of people who are exercising their constitutionally protected right to protest are doing so peacefully. Unfortunately, we've seen situations in which a small number of people take advantage of that peaceful public protest to engage in criminal activity, to engage in vandalism and, in some cases, violence.\nWe've often heard from the families of those who were killed, urging people with concerns to express those concerns peacefully and to not perpetuate the cycle of violence. Those have often been quite powerful calls. And those are calls that the President has strongly supported.\nThe President, on a number of occasions, has talked about how the constitutional right of citizens to protest is an integral part of our democracy, and the ability of citizens to exercise that right has made our country better, and more fair, and more just. But protests that are peaceful have more power and are more likely to arouse the conscience of the public and of elected leaders to implement reforms and bring about the kind of change that the protesters would ultimately like to see.\nSo the President certainly does not believe that there's an excuse for somebody to engage in violence in the context of these protests. But the President also, just as a practical matter, believes that these protests are much more effective and much more likely to have an impact when they're peaceful.\nQ: This is also not the first time that we've seen a police department have a video of the incident that they haven't released immediately. I mean, eventually, we all know that video is going to come out, or it's going to be in the public record at some point.\nMR. EARNEST: It does seem likely.\nQ: So does the President support just releasing videos like this soon after the existence becomes clear because that's going to possibly quell the unrest?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, as I was mentioning to April, individual law enforcement agencies and local elected officials are going to have to make those kinds of decisions consistent with the law that's on the books in their individual jurisdictions. That's the way that it should work. But the President is certainly interested in trying to foster a stronger relationship between local law enforcement and the communities they're sworn to serve and protect. And being as transparent as possible is much more likely to foster that spirit of trust.\nQ: Okay, sorry, I thought you were going to say something. And just quickly, on the subject of stop-and-frisk, I think it's easy to simplify that, as well. It's easy to take a side on that. Today, we heard Donald Trump call for I think what he'd describe as a tailored, localized version of stop-and-frisk. I'm not really sure what that means.\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not sure, either.\nQ: Well, maybe this will shed some light on that. Because speaking to, for example, a D.C. lawmaker, who's a Democrat, talking about ending stop-and-frisk here leading to a disturbing uptick in gun crime, and talking about the numbers of guns that they got off the streets through stop-and-frisk. So, obviously, the administration has an interest, and one we've heard so many times, in getting illegal guns off the streets and stopping violent crime, especially gun crime. Don't you think that there is some kind of more balanced or more tailored version of stop-and-frisk that could be productive?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, actually, what occurs to me in you asking your question is I think it does raise questions that a politician would be so dogmatic about protecting Second Amendment rights, yet rather cavalier about protecting the constitutional prohibition against an illegal search and seizure. It might lead one person to conclude that the politician is more interested in playing politics than finding a solution.\nJordan.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I have a follow-up on the CR situation.\nMR. EARNEST: I thought you might. (Laughter.)\nQ: You know me well. We're eight days away from a shutdown now, and leaders have been saying for a long time they don't think one is going to happen, but it could. So what --\nMR. EARNEST: I think they were saying that in 2013, too. Weren't they?\nQ: So my question is what is the administration doing to prepare for that situation?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there is a standard procedure that's followed by the Office of Management and Budget to ensure that if funding for the federal government lapses, that the appropriate steps are taken to remain in compliance with the law. And that means an orderly shutdown of the federal government based on the lack of congressional action.\nSo what you see on the part of the administration is continued commitment to effective governance and taking responsibility for serving the American people. Unfortunately, that is not at all what we see from Republicans in Congress. Republicans in Congress have failed to pass a single spending bill through both houses of Congress. That's among the more basic responsibilities of the United States Congress.\nAnd the American people elected a Republican majority in the House and a Republican majority in the Senate. You would think that would make it easier for Congress to pass a budget. But it hasn't because it does require Republicans in Congress to do their job. And whether it's considering the nominees to the Supreme Court, or considering Republican nominees to the Ex-Im Bank, or passing spending bills, too often over the course of this year we've seen a failure on the part of Republicans in Congress to do their job. That's something they'll have to answer for in a few weeks.\nAnita.\nQ: Thank you. I have a few questions about Charlotte. First, I know that the Department of Justice is sending some folks down there today, if they haven't already gone. And I thought you mentioned resources. Were you referring to them?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes.\nQ: Or is the White House sending additional people?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of anybody from the White House that's headed down there, but there are a couple of different offices from the Department of Justice that are headed down there. Let me see if I can get you some --\nQ: So these resources are just personnel.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes.\nQ: Okay.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes. These are -- personnel from the Community Relations Service, which is a branch of the Department of Justice, are heading to Charlotte. I know that there are FBI resources, FBI personnel that are based in Charlotte that are available if requested by local law enforcement officials. So there are resources that can be provided in the form of personnel and experts who have helped other communities deal with difficult situations like this one.\nQ: And then can I ask a couple questions about the 21st Century Task Force you mentioned? So a couple things. One, they made recommendations, I think in 2015, about 50 recommendations. But then I have a vague recollection that President Obama stopped in at a meeting that they had earlier this year. Are they still meeting post-recommendations? Or is the task force done?\nMR. EARNEST: I can get you an update on their activities. I know that there has been some follow-up work that they've done since the initial release of that initial report in March of 2015. But let me see if we can get you some additional information about other activities that they've been working on.\nQ: I had a couple other questions about that. Do you know what has happened with the recommendations that they made?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the recommendations that they made were recommendations that they made public. And just to -- you probably know this, but just so others are aware, this was a task force that included senior law enforcement leaders, civil rights activists, young people who protested in Ferguson, academics who have spent years studying this challenge. So this was a genuine cross-section of people with a variety of perspectives and experiences who came together around a set of best practices. They held hearings all across the country.\nBut ultimately, as I was explaining to April, we've got a tradition in this country of local law enforcement decisions being made at the local level. And so these are not practices that the federal government can impose on local law enforcement agencies. Rather, what we can do is put forward these recommendations that are drawn from practices that have been implemented in other communities, and make suggestions to local law enforcement agencies that they consider these best practices. There are experts at the Department of Justice that have traveled to some cities to help them in the implementation of some of these best practices. But ultimately, it's the responsibility of local law enforcement leaders and local elected officials to determine how and whether to pursue the implementation of these best practices, and it's not something that can be imposed by the federal government.\nQ: None of the recommendations, which I don't have in front of me, would be from the federal government level, they would all be at the local level? None would be implemented by the federal government, is what you're saying?\nMR. EARNEST: I think that there were some suggestions about what the federal government could do. Some of this related to providing equipment to local law enforcement agencies, for example. So there were a handful of things that did relate to the federal government. But when it relates to the policies that are implemented by local law enforcement, that's not something that can be imposed by the federal government. These are best practices that local law enforcement agencies need to determine how -- whether and how to implement in their individual communities.\nQ: One I wanted to ask you about. So I don't want to -- maybe this isn't on a federal level, but one of the recommendations was for more data to be collected on police-involved shootings, and I would assume that would be country-wide. So do you happen to know if there is such a thing happening at this point?\nMR. EARNEST: I know there has been an effort to collect more data on this, but we'll see if we can get you some more details. Maybe there's some more specific questions --\nQ: Yeah, if you could put me in the right -- talk to the right person on this --\nQ: Can you give me some of the stuff that she's asking for as well?\nMR. EARNEST: Sure.\nQ: Thank you.\nQ: Thanks.\nMR. EARNEST: Mark.\nQ: Josh, on the 9/11 lawsuit bill, can you say why President Obama is waiting until the end of the 10-day window to cast his veto?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Mark, we've made clear that we want to have an opportunity to make our case to members of Congress, and that's what we've been doing over the last several days. But as soon as the President has vetoed the bill, we'll let you know.\nQ: There's no anguishing going on? You said umpteen times he'll veto it and he will veto it.\nMR. EARNEST: He will veto it.\nQ: And he has until midnight tomorrow to do it.\nMR. EARNEST: That's my understanding, yes. And by midnight tomorrow, I mean the end of the day tomorrow.\nQ: Understand. And the reason he's delaying it is because you're reaching out to members of Congress in the hope of avoiding an override?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we've certainly been making a case to members of Congress, rooted in the principle at stake here, consistent with the argument that's made by these Democratic and Republican national security experts, who today said they had deep concerns with the bill.\nSo we have spent the last eight days making that case, and we're going to continue to do so, to Democrats and Republicans in both houses of Congress. And many of those conversations include their staff members as well. And more than one member of Congress has indicated that they are uneasy about the impact of this legislation, too. And so those that are uneasy about this are going to have to make their own decision about whether or not they're prepared to vote in public the same way that they have talked in private.\nQ: Can you be more specific than \"more than one member of Congress\"?\nMR. EARNEST: No. I mean, primarily because it's -- because I don't have a number in mind. I know that based on my communications with people who are having these conversations, I know that to be true.\nQ: Are you working the phones yourself?\nMR. EARNEST: I am not.\nQ: Okay. One other subject --\nMR. EARNEST: Fortunately, we've got other people that do that.\nQ: Has President Obama -- did he weigh in on the decision to allow Airbus and Boeing to sell airplanes to Iran?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any congressional -- I'm sorry -- presidential involvement with that specific decision. We'll follow up with you if there was. This obviously was a decision that was made by experts at --\nQ: -- (inaudible.)\nMR. EARNEST: No, at the Treasury Department. This is OFAC, the Office of Foreign Assets Control. And they made the decision to issue two licenses for the export of commercial passenger aircraft to Iran. The licenses themselves are quite limited in that they relate solely to commercial passenger aviation, and there are specific provisions in here that prevent these aircraft from being transferred or conveyed to sanctioned entities in Iran or anywhere else. So there are limitations on this license. But for a more detailed accounting of that, I'd referred you to the Treasury Department.\nRon.\nQ: In North Carolina, there's a law -- October 1st -- that will require a court order to release body cam video from police officers. Does the White House oppose that law, or did you, when it was in the process of --\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware that we've taken a position on that one.\nQ: Why wouldn't you? I think there are other North Carolina laws you've taken a positions on and --\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, there are.\nQ: -- this seems to be -- I'm not sure if body cameras -- I believe they were part of the task force recommendations, were they not?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, there was some language in there about studying the impact of the more widespread use of body cameras, and so what that included was, trying to provide those resources to additional law enforcement agencies and then studying the impact that it had.\nRon, there are 50 states across the country with active state legislators who are sponsoring and passing bills, some of which we strongly support, and some of which we strongly oppose, and some of which are entirely irrelevant to the federal government. We don't evaluate each one.\nQ: No, I understand. But this one about body cameras and transparency and, particularly in this day and age that we live in where this video has become such an important factor in how the public and participants view these incidents, why not take a position on that, to try and stop that in a place like North Carolina?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, Ron, just because we're not going to take a position on every bill.\nQ: Trying to clarify, White House staffers are not allowed to work for Clinton campaign, is that correct?\nMR. EARNEST: There are strict limitations about what individual White House staffers can do with regard to political activity. There are some things that they're able to do on their personal time. We can certainly provide you a detailed briefing on that if you're interested.\nQ: This issue of using private Gmail and email again in the campaign -- imagine that -- but I would think that a White House staffers are not supposed to use Gmail, their own private accounts in doing White House business, correct?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, you've heard me on a number of occasions restate our policy, which is that our recommendation to White House staffers and to employees of the federal government that they should use their official government email for official government business.\nQ: And obviously this relates to the hack thing -- the alleged one -- you said you were concerned about. Are those issues that you're looking at, given the allegations that have been made?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Ron, there's one premise, however, that -- certainly this is a serious situation, we're going to take a close look at it. But the individual whose names -- whose name has been floated in the context of all this is not a White House staffer.\nThose of you who have traveled with the President know the significant number of people that are involved in planning the logistics of his travel. The same is true of other senior U.S. government officials when they travel. In order to plan the logistics for those trips, it's not uncommon for the United States government to enter into, essentially, short-term contracts with private citizens, who do get paid, but they don't have a desk at the White House. These are individuals who are working with the White House or working with another government agency to plan travel logistics.\nSo this is things like making sure there are enough chairs in the room, or making sure that all the logistical requirements for all of you who are covering the President are taken care of, making sure that the flags are arranged behind the President, making sure there's a glass of water under his podium. Those are the responsibility of advance staffers, and these are individuals, again, who -- they're basically -- they're akin to contractors in that they work on a short-term, periodic basis to assist in travel logistics.\nQ: And this is what this individual was doing?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, that's what that individual and hundreds of other people have done over the course of last eight years, yes.\nQ: On the Syria situation, General Dunford said something about how, given the attack on the convoy which he blamed on the Russians, as you have -- that that should eliminate the possibility of sharing intelligence and I would presume moving to this next military phase of sharing information that was going to happen if there was a seven-day period and humanitarian aid delivered, so on and so forth. So essentially, is that the end of the possibility of that ever happening now?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Ron, what we have indicated is that conversations between U.S. diplomats and Russian diplomats continue. I think you got a window into that conversation if you had an opportunity to see Secretary Kerry's remarks at the United Nations Security Council yesterday. He expressed his deep concern about Russian culpability for the attack on the United Nations aid convoy.\nThese were humanitarian workers who were traveling in a very dangerous place -- not because they are seeking a profit or glory, but because they're trying to meet the basic humanitarian needs of people who have been suffering for years, people who don't have access to food or clean water or medicine -- and they risk their lives to travel to some of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the world to try to bring relief. And the fact that they came under attack from military aircraft is an outrage.\nAnd the Russians are culpable because we know this was an airstrike. There were no coalition aircraft in the region. There certainly were no U.S. aircraft in the region. That means it was either the Russians, or the Iranian Syrian regime that carried out this attack.\nQ: Syrian.\nMR. EARNEST: Syrian regime, sorry. The Iranian -- the Russians or the Syrian regime that carried out this attack. And the Russians, in the context of the Cessation of Hostilities, have taken responsibility for the conduct of the Syrian regime. We're counting on them to ensure that the Syrians live up to the commitments that are made in the context of the Cessation of Hostilities. That's why the Russians need to account for this.\nAnd so that, however, means that we're going to continue to talk to the Russians and see of this is something that can be salvaged.\nQ: And just one more on this hack thing. What it sounds like you're saying, essentially, is that this apparently involves a contractor on a short-term assignment for the White House. Do these individuals have security clearances? Do they -- again, I'm trying to -- are you saying this is not a breach of White House cyber security?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, this is something that was just leaked on the Internet a few hours ago, so we're still taking a look at exactly what happened. And at this point I cannot account for the veracity or accuracy of the information that has been posted online.\nWhat I can tell you is that there are individuals who are -- who essentially have a contract with the federal government on a short-term basis to help with travel planning. So these are not individuals who show up at desk at the White House every day, but rather individuals who assist the White House in planning travel of senior U.S. officials. And this is not just true at the White House. This is true at other federal agencies, as well. And these are individuals who are responsible for basic travel logistics, lining up hotel rooms, making sure there are enough chairs in the room, making sure that the press logistics are in place. It requires a lot of people. And those are people that assist in that planning and execution of a trip of a senior government official.\nJulianna.\nQ: Thanks. Just to follow up on that. It appears that the hackers went for this individual's Gmail account. I'm wondering if that's any kind of wakeup call for White House staffers that hackers at this point -- that we're seeing these leaks happen with more frequency, might be especially inclined to go to staffers' personal accounts. And is the White House taking any additional precautions or asking its staff to take additional precautions for their personal emails now that we're seeing this happening with regularity, especially in this election season?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Julianna, I guess the point I would make is consistent with what you said there at the end of your question, which is I think it should be a wakeup call for all of us. All of you have prominent names. And it's important for all of us to be conscious of protecting our information and practicing good cyber hygiene. And that certainly is something that we've seen from --\nQ: Cyber hygiene.\nMR. EARNEST: That's certainly something that we were reminded of in the context of reports about former Secretary of State Colin Powell and the cyber breach that he was a victim of that was reported on last week. So it's something we all need to be mindful of.\nQ: Any additional precautions or recommendations going out to staff?\nQ: I'm not aware of anything like that right now. But certainly this -- like I said, this should be a reminder to everybody about how it's important to be quite careful with that kind of information.\nKevin.\nQ: If I could follow up just a minute on Ron's comments about Russia. I'm going to run down the list for you. Minsk, support for the Assad regime, obstruction of the U.N., of the attack on the convoy, hacking. At what point does this administration say, enough is enough -- what's the point in dealing with Moscow?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, we also -- there are other things that you could cite, which is that the Russians have been supportive of our efforts to try to apply additional pressure and further isolate the North Koreans. Russia did play an important role in bringing about the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Russia did play an important role in working with the United States to round up and destroy the declared chemical weapons stockpile of the Assad regime. And that had a positive impact on not just U.S. national security, but it prevented those chemical weapons from falling into the hands of extremists. We know that Russia shares our deep concerns about extremists that are operating in Syria and other places.\nSo our differences with the Russians are not things we've tried to hide. Even in the context of this briefing I've spoken quite bluntly about Russian behavior, about Russian activities, and the devastating toll that that's taking on Russia's credibility in the international community.\nBut what the United States is trying to do is trying to use the most effective lever we have on the Syrians by engaging the Russians. And what Russia has agreed to do in the context of a Cessation of Hostilities is to compel the Assad regime to abide by the terms of the Cessation of Hostilities and to allow the flow of humanitarian assistance to reach those communities that desperately need it.\nAnd I don't know if it's because Russia is incapable of doing that or if Russia is unwilling to do that, or Russia has not devoted the effort and energy required to succeed in doing that. Whatever the explanation, Russia has fallen short of their commitments, and they have to account for that with regard to the impact it has on their credibility. It also means that Russia has not yet received the thing that they want. What they would like to have -- they would like the ability to say in the international community that they're working with the United States to confront extremists inside of Syria. They haven't gotten that cooperation from the United States because we've insisted that they live up to their terms of the arrangement first. And they failed. It does beg questions about what exactly Russia's aims are. They're taking this big hit to their international credibility and haven't gotten anything for it. And if anything, the situation inside of Syria is worsening in a way that risks drawing Russia even deeper into a quagmire.\nSo these are all I think legitimate questions to raise about Russia's strategy and their intentions. And these are questions that can only be answered by President Putin himself. But at some point, they're going to have to make a basic decision, and I think the only question is how much credibility are they willing to spend or lose. Look, spend is the wrong word, because they're not getting anything in exchange. So Russia is essentially in a situation where they're pouring their credibility down the drain while they repeatedly fail to live up to the terms of the arrangement.\nQ: I want to draw your attention to something we talked about -- I think it may have been back in March -- and that was the release of some of the bin Laden documents, the declassification thereof. I'm just wondering why the administration seems to be a little bit slow in releasing more of them, and is there a reason for that.\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have -- I haven't recently received an update on the pace of releasing those documents. I know that there are a substantial number of those documents and materials that have already been released. But there are additional materials that continue to be reviewed by the intelligence community to see what we can learn about the al Qaeda network and to see what we can learn about the tactics and strategies that are employed by our adversaries. But I'd refer you to the Director of National Intelligence and his office for an update in terms of where the declassification effort stands.\nQ: And I ask because I just wonder if the release of more might sort of run counter to maybe the administration's perspective on al Qaeda, for example, or jihadism in general. Is that a fair criticism?\nMR. EARNEST: No, because that's not the criteria that's being used to evaluate the release of this information. But again, I guess you just have to ask the ODNI for an update on the status of that declassification effort.\nQ: Would the White House be open to officially ending the availability of cash payments being made to Iran?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I know that there's been a lot of rhetoric and a lot of accusations that have gone along with that rhetoric in Congress, but I haven't seen any serious proposals that would garner the support of the administration. I also haven't seen any serious proposals that would actually enhance our national security.\nQ: Well, let me just follow up for just a second then, I guess, because people would say, well, cash payments are tougher to trace -- you've heard people make that suggestion; cash can end up in the hands of terrorist groups in a way that perhaps wired money might not.\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah, I have to admit, I've never really understood how people could say that. That doesn't really make any sense to me. We all get paid with wire transfers. We're not paid in cash every two weeks, and it doesn't inhibit our ability to spend that money however we choose. So again, it's a pretty tough case to make. I've also heard people raise the prospect of, \"oh, these were unmarked bills.\" Well what if they were marked? What would that have done?\nSo this whole argument is a factually challenged attempt to re-litigate a fight that Republicans have already lost. The fact is this administration succeeded in safely recovering U.S. citizens who were being held against their will in Iran. This administration succeeded in resolving a decades-long financial dispute with the Iranians in a way that potentially saved the American people billions of dollars. And this administration succeeded in completing an international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, that required Iran to eliminate 98 percent of their nuclear stockpile, to disconnect thousands of centrifuges, to render harmless their plutonium reactor, and to submit to and cooperate with the most intrusive set of inspections that have ever been imposed on a country's nuclear program.\nNone of those results, none of those benefits are in dispute. All of that has been confirmed independently. And no one argues that all of that benefits the American people and benefits our national security. So that's why you see Republicans and other critics pick these other arguments to try to distract from those facts, but ultimately those arguments don't hold up to any scrutiny. Somehow it's easier to move cash around if the payments are made in cash as opposed to if there's a wire transfer.\nQ: But there were --\nMR. EARNEST: I'm no expert on that, but I actually think that's not true.\nQ: Right, right.\nMR. EARNEST: I think it would be easier to transfer the money if you didn't have to cart it around on crates, but if you could just press a button on a computer. It seems easier that way.\nQ: They were made both ways, though, right? Some were made by wire?\nMR. EARNEST: You can talk to the Treasury Department about all that.\nQ: Okay. But so -- I mean, they were both -- right? Wire and cash?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't think that's true. I think what the Treasury Department would tell you is that they were cash payments.\nQ: Last one. Driverless vehicles. The President is -- the administration, I should say, is fairly aggressively promoting that development. I'm wondering if there are concerns, however, as we move into that direction, about the labor impact on those who work in industries that are related to driving, whether it's vans, buses and what have you. And I read a statistic that said some 600,000 Californians alone would be negatively impacted in this sort of headlong move in that direction. Is the administration sensitive to that, and what are you doing to combat those concerns?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, Kevin, there's no doubt that our economy is significantly affected by technology. And in many ways, technology has the potential to strengthen our economy and to make our roads safer.\nSo there's great potential associated with these kind of technological developments. But advanced technology also has an impact on our workforce, and that's all the more reason we should be doing much more to invest in early childhood education, to invest in job training, to make the doors to a college education open to every American student that's willing to work hard to get it. Preparing our citizens and our workforce for that kind of advanced economy needs to be a top priority. It certainly has been a top priority of this President.\nBut unfortunately, those kinds of investments that are critical to the long-term success of the United States had been gutted by Republicans in Congress who, for some reason, don't seem to share that priority.\nSo the President does feel quite passionate about this, and I think you'll have an opportunity to hear the President talk about this a little bit more when he travels to Pittsburgh here in the next week or two.\nThanks for the question. Andrew.\nQ: Let's go back to Syria. You said again that you're trying to test a proposition that whether the Russians are -- whether the Russians are willing or not to implement the ceasefire that they previously agreed. But by your account, they've bombed an aid convoy, which is a war crime. The day after, they targeted a clinic, which is a war crime. How is this still an open question? Haven't the Russians made their decision?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, to be clear Andrew, what we have indicated is that the two outrageous incidents that you have cited are the responsibility of Russia, whether or not they've carried them out personally. Because we know they were either carried out by Russian forces or by Syrian forces. And given the influence that Russia has committed to use with the Assad regime to get them to stop carrying out those actions, either way Russia is responsible.\nAnd it has taken an impact on their credibility. And as skeptical as this administration was on the front end of this agreement, I'll put it mildly and say, there is nothing that Russia has done to reduce that skepticism. And it does raise questions for the Russians about what they're prepared to do. And those are the questions that we're asking the Russians right now.\nQ: The President, in the interview that was published last night, said that, Syria haunts him but he says that, basically his decisions on Syria -- he thinks that his decisions on Syria were correct and in the national interest. Should we infer from that that, if the status quo broadly continues, if Russia keeps on bombing, if tens of thousands more people die, that he's not going to change course?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I wouldn't interpret it that way, Andrew. I think it's important to -- the President's Syria policy has been second-guessed by many, many people. I think the President acknowledged in the interview that he himself has reviewed the decisions that he has had to make with regard to U.S. policy in Syria. And as he has reviewed those decisions, he's concluded that, each time, he made a decision that was squarely within the national security interests of the United States, and even advanced our national security interests.\nNone of those decisions has brought an end to the violence. None of those decisions has brought about the kind of political transition that we know is needed inside of Syria. None of those decisions have eliminated entirely the extremist organizations that are operating in Syria. But each of those decisions has mitigated the negative impact on our national security. And the President is going to continue to make decisions, and is, in the four months that he remains in office, focused on our national security, and focused on what he can do to better protect the American people.\nThe consequences of those decisions include building a coalition with 67 members that have gone to great lengths to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. Iraqi security forces have made progress on the ground in taking back about 50 percent of the territory that ISIL previously controlled. The percentage is somewhat smaller in Syria, but there have been important gains that have been made in Syria, including in key areas along the Turkey-Syria border.\nThe United States and our coalition partners have made important progress in taking out leading ISIL figures. In just the last couple of weeks, two senior ISIL officials responsible for external plotting operations have been taken off the battlefield.\nSo we've made important progress, and that progress was a result of decisions and leadership that President Obama exercised. But the President would be the first on to tell that there's a whole lot more that remains undone, and that our goals there have still not been accomplished; that the humanitarian toll that this chaos has taken is far too great. Too many innocent people continue to be killed. Too many innocent people have been forced to flee their homes. Too many countries around the region and in Europe have been strained by the burden of caring for innocent people fleeing violence in Syria.\nSo I think that's the point that the President is making. And moving forward, the President is going to continue to make decisions with the national security of the United States highest on the priority list.\nQ: Okay, and just a final question. As you know, Congress is considering additional sanctions on the Syrian regime. Is the White House reviewing its position on those sanctions in light of what's happened in the last week?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have an update for you in terms of that process. As the U.S. government considers applying sanctions to individuals or entities, we don't talk about that in much detail in advance primarily because we don't want to give those individuals or entities an opportunity to take steps that would evade those sanctions.\nSo this is just not a process that I can talk about much in advance. Once we've made an announcement, the experts at the Treasury Department who are responsible for administering those sanctions can certainly give you some information and some insight into why specific decisions were made. But ultimately, it's just not something we're going to be able to talk about in advance.\nLana.\nQ: Given what you're saying about this contractor and the work that she did in arranging travel for the White House, is it conceivable that she would have a scan of the First Lady's passport?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I just can't talk about the contents of the information that's been leaked. This is still something that is just a few hours old and something that officials in the U.S. government have taken a look at.\nQ: Does the White House care to comment on the testimony of the CEO, Heather Bresch, from Mylan Pharmaceuticals, and the rising cost of EpiPen?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I didn't get a chance to see much of the testimony firsthand. I was traveling in New York with the President yesterday. I think what I can say in general is that the administration welcomes close congressional scrutiny of steps that we can take to reduce the cost of prescription drugs. And ironically, those same Republicans that were eager to be caught on TV asking tough questions of a pharmaceutical company CEO are also preventing the U.S. government from negotiating a better price for the taxpayers. Is it because they're also taking significant campaign contributions from pharmaceutical companies and their CEOs? You might have to ask them.\nBut it certainly is not a good look for Republicans in the United States Congress. And if they were really committed to reducing prescription drug prices, they'd get behind the administration proposal to do exactly that. Because the President feels strongly about this. The President has put forward specific proposals to reduce prescription drug costs in a way that would be good for taxpayers and good for patients. But Republicans have shown no interest in it because they're much more worried about protecting the interests of pharmaceutical companies.\nQ: One more question. President Obama, just a little bit ago, said that arts and humanities are reflective of our national soul in selecting Spanish-American chef Josй Andres, who has had a very public feud with the Republican nominee. Is the President making a point about inclusiveness as part of the American soul?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think that's a point that the President has made on a number of occasions even long before anybody considered the political career of the current Republican nominee. And you don't have to spend too much time reading Mr. Andres's biography to determine that he is a very worthy recipient of the recognition that he received today.\nQ: And food.\nMR. EARNEST: That too. (Laughter.) That too.\nJane, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. On North Korea, North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Su-yong said that the war already started between South Korea and North Korea, and North Korea might be using their nuclear weapons. Any comment on it?\nMR. EARNEST: I didn't see that specific comment, but it certainly sounds like the kind of inflammatory rhetoric and provocative statement that's counterproductive. What the international community seeks is deescalation on the Korean Peninsula. We're seeking stability on the Korean Peninsula, and we're seeking the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\nThose are principles that the South Koreans, that the United States, our allies in Japan, and other places are all committed to -- countries like China and Russia who aren't allies of the United States and, as Kevin pointed out earlier, are in many cases competitors, at best, of the United States -- adversaries, even. But they agree with greater stability and denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. And that's the message that the international community is unified around.\nQ: Does the President have any particular plans for the North Korea, such as preemptive strikes?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have any -- well, let me just say it this way. Just in general -- not specifically to North Korea -- as an operational matter, we're not going to discuss any preemptive military actions in advance. And I think that's for a simple and obvious reason.\nMore generally, what President Obama has said with regard to North Korea is that the international community needs to consider what additional steps we can take to further isolate the North Koreans, particularly in the aftermath of their latest nuclear test, which is in violation of a wide variety of U.N. resolutions and other international obligations that just about every other country in the world complies with.\nSo the international community takes this quite seriously. The United States takes this quite seriously. This is something that has been discussed in the context of the United Nations Security Council. And I know that there's work that's being done at the United Nations to consider what additional steps should be taken in response to the latest North Korean nuclear test.\nThanks everybody, we'll see you tomorrow.\nQ: Hey, Josh, you mentioned a Pittsburgh trip. When is that?\nMR. EARNEST: We'll get you some more details on that.\nEND 2:27 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2016-09-22", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}

It's wonderful to be here in Pennsylvania.\nGreat polls keep coming in. A brand new Rasmussen poll has us up 5 points nationwide.\nOn November 8th, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.\nWe are going to replace our failed and corrupt establishment with a new government that serves you, your family, and your country.\nAt the center of our society is going to be a simple promise to every American: safety.\nWe are going to Make America Safe Again.\nThe rioting in our streets is a threat to all peaceful citizens. It must be ended.\nThe main victims of these violent demonstrations are law-abiding African-Americans who live in these communities and only want to raise their children in peace.\nWho is looking out for them?\nFor every one violent disruptor, there are thousands of moms and dads in those same communities who just want their kids to be able to walk home safely from school.\nTo all our citizens, in all of our inner cities, and all across the country, I say these words to you tonight: I'm with you and I will fight for you.\nThe job of a leader is to stand in someone else's shoes and see things from their perspective. Hillary Clinton calls people who don't support her deplorable, and irredeemable. I call anyone who doesn't support me an American citizen who is entitled to equal representation under the law.\nI will be a President for all Americans, and I will campaign for every last vote, in every last community.\nI will extend my hand to every mayor in this country who wants to be a partner in making our cities safer for their citizens.\nBut to do this, we must work with our police – not against our police.\nThose peddling the narrative of cops as a racist force in our society – a narrative supported with a nod by my opponent – share directly in the responsibility for the unrest that is afflicting our country and hurting those who have the very least.\nLow-income African-Americans in these communities are the ones suffering in terms of lost jobs, lost property values, and lost lives.\n65 people have been shot in the city of Chicago alone since Friday.\nThe problem is not that there are too many police. The problem is that there are not enough police.\nPolice are entrusted with immense responsibility, and we must do everything we can to ensure they are properly trained, that they respect all members of the public, and that any wrongdoing is always vigorously addressed.\nBut our men and women in blue also need our support, our thanks, and our gratitude. They are the line separating civilization from chaos.\nHillary Clinton does not have to worry about the sirens and the gunshots at night. No, it's the poor family living in the inner city – it's the mother who feels like a refugee in her own country.\nWho is there to represent these families?\nHillary Clinton doesn't want to hear their voices. So I will be their voice, and I will be a voice for all of the forgotten Americans in this country. People who just want a secure community for their families, good schools for the kids, and a good-paying job to support their loved ones.\nWe will bring security to our African-American communities, and to our Latino communities. We will also bring school choice, and new prosperity.\nDemocrats have run our inner cities for more than half a century. It's time for change – it's time for a New American Future.\nMy economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.\nMy opponent likes to say that for decades, she has been \"fighting for women.\" That she has been \"fighting for children.\" Why then are 70 million American women and children living in poverty, or on the brink of poverty? Why has she provided no relief for the millions of Americans in search of affordable, reliable quality childcare? You know the old saying, \"Watch what I do, not what I say.\"\nAt the Trump Organization, and in my campaign for President, women occupy some of the highest positions. I have employed thousands of women in my company. Women of different backgrounds. Women of many talents.\nAnd just last week here in Pennsylvania, I was joined by my daughter, Ivanka, and I laid out my plan for childcare and eldercare.\nWe have also talked about improving education, and I will talk about it more tonight. A first-class public school education, as well as options for alternatives through charter schools, school choice, and homeschooling, is a right, not a privilege. The opportunity to attend a two or four-year college, or to pursue a trade or a skill set through vocational and technical education, should be easier to access, pay for, and finish. Education is the bedrock of our society.\nWomen also value security. They want a Commander-in-Chief that will defeat radical Islamic terrorism and protect our borders. As I campaign across this country, I hear so many stories and pleas, from women especially, about drug addiction and opioid use. They are doing their best in their communities and for their families to provide a safe and nurturing environment.\nBut even the best-laid plans cannot always protect our youth, and increasingly, many adults, from the scourge of drugs. We lose thousands of our fellow Americans every year to opioid use. I will stop the drug inflow from our borders. These drugs come over the border and make their way into our urban and rural communities, and into our suburbs.\nThis must change. Every change starts with a conversation. Together, we will have this conversation. And we will make this change.\nThe changes will start immediately.\nOn my first day in office, I am going to immediately begin lifting all regulations that are hurting our workers and our businesses.\nThis will unleash a technology revolution. America will become the best place to innovate and to invest in the future. The next great American invention, the next great improvement to our lives, is right around the corner. All we have to do is remove the red tape.\nOur plan includes one of the biggest tax reforms in American history. It's going to include a 15% tax rate for all businesses, small and large, making our country a magnet for new jobs.\nWe are going to unleash an American Energy Revolution. Oil, coal, natural gas, shale energy, and renewables. This will add at least half a million new jobs every single year.\nBut to be a prosperous nation, we need to be a country that makes and builds things in our own country.\nThat is why I will direct the Department of Commerce to identify every single violation of our trading rules by our foreign competitors. We will apply every lawful remedy to end these trade abuses.\nSteel jobs, and all manufacturing jobs, will be returning to Pennsylvania in a very big way.\nYour state has lost one-third of your manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, and one-fourth of your manufacturing jobs since China joined the World Trade Organization. These were both Bill Clinton deals backed by Hillary Clinton.\nThe Clintons robbed Pennsylvania, stole your jobs, and shipped them to other countries – we are going to bring them back.\nJobs will come flowing back in all over America.\nIt used to be that cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Today, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint.\nWe're going to turn it all around.\nThere's a reason the hedge fund managers are all donating to Hillary Clinton's campaign – and not mine. Everybody getting rich off the rigged system, and who wants nothing to change, are throwing their money at Hillary Clinton.\nMy campaign is powered by my own money, and by small dollar donations from everyday patriotic citizens.\n95% of our donors are small dollar donations. Every dollar helps us deliver your country back to you – visit DonaldJTrump.com to find out how you can help our movement.\nLet me tell you what else we're going to do.\nOne of the biggest problems facing young people and families today is the cost of college education. The cost of college has increased by over 500% since 1973.\nBut what a lot of people don't know is that universities get massive tax breaks for their massive endowments. These huge multi-billion dollar endowments are tax-free, but too many of these universities don't use the money to help with tuition and student debt.\nInstead, these universities use the money to pay their administrators, or put donors' names on buildings, or just store the money away. In fact, many universities spend more on private equity fund managers than tuition programs.\nBut they should be using the money on the students – for tuition, for student life, and for student housing.\nOn top of that, the federal government spends over $70 billion in higher education every year, plus another $130 billion on federal loans.\nHere again, the universities don't use the money to reduce the price of college – but to increase it.\nWe have to break this cycle. I'm going to work with Congress on reforms to make sure that if universities want access to all of these special federal tax breaks and tax dollars – paid for by you – that they are making a good faith effort to reduce the cost of college and student debt, and to spend their endowments on their own students.\nAnother major issue for all American families is healthcare. President Obama promised Obamacare would reduce the cost of healthcare by $2,500 dollars. Instead, the opposite happened – the cost of healthcare has increased nearly $5,000 dollars during that time.\nJust one more Washington lie – like the lie that if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor.\nIt's a disaster.\nThat is why, on my first day, I am going to ask Congress to immediately send me a bill to repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare.\nWe are going to replace government-run Obamacare with reforms that put patients first. These reforms include expanding access to popular Healthcare Savings Accounts, empowering Americans to shop for the insurance of their choice across state lines, and block granting Medicaid to the states so they can design innovative solutions to best serve our most vulnerable citizens.\nHillary Clinton, on the other hand, wants to give Obamacare to illegal immigrants and wants a total government takeover of healthcare.\nHer plan also gives Social Security and Medicare to illegal immigrants, by making them citizens – bankrupting these programs for Americans.\nShe doesn't understand how Democracy works. Public servants are just that – they're there to serve you. But the only people Hillary Clinton has ever served are the special interests.\nOur campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives.\nThey're all part of the same political establishment. They go to the same restaurants, they attend the same conferences, they have the same friends and connections. They all support the same ideology of globalism that makes them rich while shipping your jobs, your factories, and your wealth to other countries.\nI am not running to be President of the World. I am running to be President of the United States. I Am For America – and America First.\nTogether, we will rebuild this country beyond our greatest dreams.\nGovernment will start working again. Fixing things is what I do. Just look at my projects in New York, where I turned rundown spaces into new centers of business, activity and opportunity – where others saw only problems, I saw only potential.\nWe turned empty lots into homes, offices and living memories for thousands of workers and families.\nThat's what I want to do for our country – I want to go into the neglected neighborhoods, the failing schools, the forgotten stretches of this nation, and unlock their potential for all of our people.\nI've made a living for years looking at unused spaces and imagining what they could be. Politicians look at blighted neighborhoods and offer only excuses – I look at those same neighborhoods and offer solutions.\nWe spend so much time thinking about how things used to be, we've stopped thinking about how great things could be – all we have to do is tune out the doubters, the cynics, and the naysayers.\nWe are a nation of strivers, dreamers, and believers – and that's the spirit that will carry us to victory in November, and to great victories as a nation.\nIt's that same spirit of resilience I have seen visiting the flood-ravaged towns in Louisiana, or meeting with the incredible but hard-hit people in cities and towns like Flint, Michigan.\nIt's that spirit of strength we will need to start winning again as a country.\nBut that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th.\nYou have to knock on doors. You have to pick up that phone. Go to our website to learn more. You have to campaign on the streets. Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country. To beat the system, you have to lift your voice, pound the pavement, and get out the vote.\nYou have 46 days to change the world. You have 46 days to make possible every dream you ever dreamed of for your country.\nYou have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this nation.\nThe arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.\nThis November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back – Bigger and Better and Stronger than Ever Before.\nHere is just some of what will happen starting in January of 2017:\nI am going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; unleash American energy; appoint justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold the Constitution of the United States; close our border to terrorists, save the 2nd amendment; and put American workers first.\nWe will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.\nAmerican cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.\nAmerican steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.\nAmerican hands will rebuild this nation – and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.\nWe will put new American steel into the spine of this country.\nI will fight for every neglected part of this nation – and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\nIt is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.\nJobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing onto our shores.\nOnce more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.\nWe Will Make America Wealthy Again.\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\nThank you, and God Bless!", "timestamp": "2016-09-22", "title": "Remarks at a Rally at Sun Center Studios in Chester Township, Pennsylvania"}
{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "note": "As prepared for delivery.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119191", "text": "Good morning. Thank you, Christine, for that kind introduction.\nI also want to thank the Marcellus Shale Coalition, the Ohio Oil and Gas Association, and the West Virginia Oil and Natural Gas Association for inviting me to join you here today. Your organizations represent tens of thousands of jobs for hardworking Americans.\nLet me also recognize my friend, Harold Hamm.\nIt is great to be here in Pittsburgh, the Steel City. Under a Trump Administration, we are going to bring back our steel jobs and we are going to rebuild this nation.\nBefore going any further today, I want to address the turmoil unfolding right now in our country.\nOur country desperately needs unity, and it needs the spirit of togetherness that has not only got us through our toughest times – but which has lifted us up, in the past, to our greatest achievements as a nation. Every day, I see people of different backgrounds working together for a common good, and we need to bring that spirit to every part of our country – and become One American Nation, united by our shared values and principles as American Citizens.\nWe all have to walk a mile in someone else's shoes, see things through their eyes, and then get to work fixing our wounded country.\nMany Americans are watching the unrest in Charlotte unfolding on their TV screens. Others are witnessing the chaos and the violence firsthand.\nOur country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the leader. How can we lead when we can't even control our own cities.\nWe honor and recognize the right of all Americans to peacefully assemble, protest and demonstrate. But there is no right to engage in violent disruption, or to threaten the public safety and peace.\nEvery single American in this country is entitled to live in a safe community. The violence against our citizens, and our law enforcement, must be brought to an end.\nThe people who will suffer the most as a result of these riots, are law-abiding African-American residents who live in these communities. It is their jobs, housing markets, schools and economic conditions that will suffer – and the first duty of government is to protect their well-being and safety.\nThere is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct. Crime and violence is an attack on the poor, and will never be accepted in a Trump Administration.\nOur job is not to make life more comfortable for the violent disruptor, but to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent trying to raise their kids in peace.\nFor every one violent protestor, there are thousands of moms and dads and kids in that same community who just want to be able to sleep safely at night.\nMore law enforcement, more community engagement, more effective policing is what our country needs.\nLast year, we saw a 17% rise in violent crime in our fifty largest cities. Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.\nMore than 3,000 have been shot in Chicago so far this year alone.\nNationwide, approximately 60% of murder victims under the age of 22 are African-American.\nThis is a national crisis, and it is the job of the next President to work with our governors and mayors to address this crisis and save African-American lives.\nLook at the example of Mayor Rudy Giuliani in New York. The policies he put into place ultimately brought down crime by 76 percent and murder by 84 percent. Think of how many families these policies saved from the worst heartache imaginable.\nWe need a national anti-crime agenda to make our cities safe again.\nI will appoint the best prosecutors, investigators and federal law enforcement officers in the country to dismantle the international cartels, gangs and criminal syndicates – and I will stop the drugs from flowing into our country.\nMy Administration will work with local communities and local officials to make the reduction of crime a top priority.\nSafety is the foundation of the ladder to American success: a great education, and a good-paying job. To have the best schools, and the best jobs, you must have safe communities.\nThat means we must recognize the contributions of our police, who come from all backgrounds and all walks of life, and who often thanklessly risk their own lives to protect the innocent.\nWe all remember, earlier this year, when officers in Dallas – hunted down for execution – continued protecting the public until their last moments on earth.\nEvery day, police officers risk their lives for complete strangers and, every year, many of them will go out on calls and never return.\nPolice are entrusted with immense responsibility, and we must do everything we can to ensure they are properly trained, that they respect all members of the public, and that any wrongdoing is always vigorously addressed.\nBut our men and women in blue also need our support, our thanks, and our gratitude. They are the line separating civilization from total chaos.\nThey are also the front lines of defense in the War on Terror, as we saw recently with their quick action following the terrorist attacks in New Jersey, and New York, and the off-duty police officer's heroic actions in Minnesota.\nIn addition to providing safety, we must provide economic opportunity. That begins with school choice, and leads to a secure job with a rising income.\nThis brings us to the subject of energy.\nProducing more American energy is a central part of my plan to Making America Wealthy Again – especially for the poorest Americans.\nAmerica is sitting on a treasure trove of untapped energy – some $50 trillion dollars in shale energy, oil reserves and natural gas on federal lands, in addition to hundreds of years of coal energy reserves.\nIt's all upside: more jobs, more revenues, more wealth, higher wages, and lower energy prices.\nI am going to lift the restrictions on American energy, and allow this wealth to pour into our communities – including right here in Pennsylvania.\nAccording to the Institute for Energy Research, lifting the restrictions on American energy, including shale production, will accomplish the following:\nincrease GDP by more than $100 billion annually\nadd over 500,000 new jobs annually\nincrease annual wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 years\nincrease federal, state, and local tax revenues by almost $6 trillion over 4 decades\nincrease total economic activity by more than $20 trillion over the next 40 years.\nIn addition, we will streamline the permitting process for all energy infrastructure projects, including the billions of dollars in projects held up by President Obama – creating countless more jobs in the process.\nOverall, my entire economic plan – tax reform, regulatory reform, energy reform, and trade reform – will create at least 25 million new jobs over the next 10 years, assuming an average growth rate of 3.5 percent, and I believe we will reach 4% growth.\nMy tax plan includes a fifteen percent business tax rate, for small and large businesses, down from 35 percent today – turning America into a jobs magnet. Hillary Clinton would raise taxes on some small businesses to as high as 45 percent.\nIncome taxes will be simplified from 7 brackets to 3, and middle class Americans will get a major tax cut – including childcare deductions and tax-free childcare savings accounts.\nMy plan includes the elimination of all unnecessary regulations, and a temporary moratorium on new regulations not compelled by Congress or public safety. Overregulation is costing our economy $2 trillion a year.\nOn energy, my economic plan unlocks our shale oil and gas, and the energy technologies of both today and tomorrow.\nFinally, my plan includes a renegotiation of America's trade deals, and the enforcement of trade rules, to increase jobs and wealth inside the United States. Strong border controls will also protect our workers and save our budget trillions in the long-term.\nIt is perhaps the most pro-growth economic plan in American history.\nCompare that to my opponent. She plans a $1.3 trillion tax hike, massive new regulations, the offshoring of American jobs, and the aggressive restriction of American energy production. Her plan will help only her wealthy donors, and global special interests, who benefit from the rigged system.\nHillary Clinton wants to put the coal miners out of work, ban hydraulic fracturing in most places, and extensively restrict and ban energy production on public lands and in most offshore areas.\nThis will produce devastation for states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia, where shale energy and coal production are critical parts of the economy.\nHer plan hurts states like Colorado, Florida, Virginia, North Carolina, and any anywhere with access to either onshore or offshore energy resources.\nShe also supports blocking the energy infrastructure that is needed to move our energy resources to the marketplace.\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, \"Overall, more than a dozen [fossil fuel] projects, worth about $33 billion, have been either rejected by regulators or withdrawn by developers since 2012, with billions more tied up in projects still in regulatory limbo.\"\nExamples of energy transportation projects blocked or abandoned include an $850 million coal export facility in Washington, a $3 billion natural gas pipeline in the Northeast, and a $6.8 billion Liquid Natural Gas export facility, among others.\nBillions of dollars in private infrastructure investment have been lost to the Obama-Clinton restriction agenda.\nThe platform produced by Hillary Clinton's party this year also calls for a \"price on carbon.\" That's just political-speak for a massive new tax on coal and shale production – a tax on American consumers.\nAnd remember, every energy dollar that isn't harvested here in America is harvested instead in a foreign country – often foreign countries not very friendly to us.\nThat not only means we are sending our jobs to those countries, but it means energy is being produced in foreign countries that lack our high environmental and conservation standards.\nThat is just one more reason why we should pursue the safe and responsible production of America's vast energy reserves.\nWe need an America-First energy plan.\nThis means opening federal lands for oil and gas production; opening offshore areas; and revoking policies that are imposing unnecessary restrictions on innovative new exploration technologies.\nThe development of the Marcellus and Utica Shales will fundamentally change the economic landscape of this region and our country, bringing extraordinary new prosperity to millions – more jobs, higher wages, a larger tax base, and dollars flowing into our country for a change, instead of out of our country.\nHillary Clinton's war on energy will cost our economy $5 trillion dollars.\nShe has not only declared war on the miners but on oil and natural gas production – which supports 10 million jobs in the United States.\nAccess to low-cost liquid natural gas also supports the American chemical industry, which supports 40,000 jobs in Pennsylvania.\nWe have just begun, as a nation, to recognize our economic advantage that is made possible by shale energy. The Shale Energy Revolution will unleash massive wealth for American workers and families.\nAt the same time, this energy revolution will produce new demand for American steel.\nBut federal restrictions remain a major impediment to both shale production specifically, and energy production in general.\nCurrently, less than 10 percent of the federally managed surface and mineral estates are leased for oil and gas development.\nAlmost 90% of our nation's offshore acreage is off-limits to energy production.\nOur energy policy will make full use of our domestic energy sources, including traditional and renewable energy sources.\nThat means we will end the war on coal.\nI will rescind the coal mining lease moratorium, the excessive Interior Department stream rule, and conduct a top-down review of all anti-coal regulations issued by the Obama Administration.\nWe will eliminate the highly-invasive \"Waters of the US\" rule, and scrap the $5 trillion dollar Obama-Clinton Climate Action Plan and the Clean Power Plan – these unilateral plans will increase monthly electric bills by double-digits without any measurable improvement in climate.\nI will refocus the EPA on its core mission of ensuring clean air, and clean, safe drinking water for all Americans.\nI believe firmly in conserving our wonderful natural resources and beautiful natural habitats. My environmental agenda will be guided by true specialists in conservation, not those with radical political agendas.\nIt will be a future of conservation, of prosperity, and of great success.\nIt will be a future of new technology, new innovation, and new solutions.\nIt will be a future we can achieve together, beginning with a victory on November 8th.\nWe Will make America Wealthy Again.\nWe Will make America Safe Again.\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.", "timestamp": "2016-09-22", "title": "Remarks at the Shale Insight TM Conferencee at the David L.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=121487", "text": "Today, the United States hosted a gathering of countries in New York to provide a boost of momentum to the upcoming international negotiations to adopt an amendment to the Montreal Protocol to phase down the potent greenhouse gases known as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). The event highlighted two significant announcements:\n•      First, more than 100 countries called for securing an ambitious amendment with an \"early freeze date.\" This group includes the United States, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, all 28 countries in the European Union, all 54 countries in Africa, and several island states that are the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Complementing this announcement, more than 500 companies and organizations and hundreds of sub-national governments called upon world leaders to take strong action on HFCs.\n•      Second, a group of donor countries and philanthropists announced their intent to provide $80 million in support to help countries in need of assistance (i.e., Article 5 countries) implement an ambitious amendment and improve energy efficiency. The philanthropic component of this is the largest-ever private grant made for energy efficiency in this sector.\nHFCs are factory-made chemicals that are primarily used in air conditioning, refrigeration, and foam insulation, and they can be hundreds to thousands of times more potent than carbon dioxide in contributing to climate change. If left unchecked, global HFC emissions could grow to be equivalent to 19 percent of total carbon dioxide emissions in 2050. There are alternative refrigerants available that have comparable performance to HFCs but with significantly reduced climate-changing properties.\nSecuring an ambitious amendment to the Montreal Protocol to phase down HFCs could avoid up to 0.5°C of warming by the end of the century, making a major contribution to the Paris Agreement goal to limit global temperature rise to well below 2°C. Countries agreed last November to \"work within the Montreal Protocol to an HFC amendment in 2016,\" and they have subsequently worked intensively during a series of negotiations this year toward consensus on the terms of such an amendment. Next month, countries will gather at the Montreal Protocol Meeting of the Parties in Rwanda for final negotiations on the amendment.\nLaunch of the Coalition to Secure an Ambitious HFC Amendment\nAt an event today hosted by Secretary of State John Kerry, senior government officials representing over 100 governments released the \"New York Declaration of the Coalition to Secure an Ambitious HFC Amendment.\" The declaration calls for adopting an ambitious HFC phasedown amendment at the upcoming Meeting of the Parties with an early freeze date for Article 5 countries, in addition to an early first reduction step for non-Article 5 countries.\nIn addition to the broad support for an ambitious amendment overall, the commitment for an \"early freeze date\" is a key element for achieving a strong climate outcome. The freeze date is the year when countries stop increasing the production and consumption of HFCs and begin the process of phasing them down, and it is therefore critical to achieving the emissions reductions associated with an amendment.\nNew Finance Announcements\nIn tandem with the declaration for an ambitious amendment, a group of donor countries and philanthropists announced their intent to provide $80 million in assistance to Article 5 countries to implement an amendment and improve energy efficiency.\nA group of 16 donor countries – consisting of the United States, Japan, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Canada, Australia, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, and New Zealand – announced their intent to provide $27 million in 2017 to the Montreal Protocol Multilateral Fund to provide fast-start support for implementation if an ambitious amendment with a sufficient early freeze date is adopted this year. Such funding is one-time in nature and will not displace donor contributions going forward.\nComplementing the funding announced by donor countries today, the following group of 19 philanthropists announced their intent to provide $53 million to Article 5 countries to support improvements in energy efficiency: Barr Foundation; Bill Gates; Children's Investment Fund Foundation; ClimateWorks Foundation; David and Lucile Packard Foundation; Heising-Simons Foundation; Hewlett Foundation; John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation; Josh and Anita Bekenstein; John and Ann Doerr; Laura and John Arnold; Oak Foundation; Open Philanthropy Project; Pirojsha Godrej Foundation; Pisces Foundation; Sandler Foundation; Sea Change Foundation; Tom Steyer; and Wyss Foundation. This support reflects a strong recognition from private philanthropists of the dual benefits associated with taking advantage of the transition to HFC alternatives to also improve energy efficiency.\nTogether, this funding will enable Article 5 countries to begin developing programs to track and reduce HFCs and help their consumers and businesses realize the net economic benefits from energy efficiency as they transition to HFC alternatives. Today's announcement from philanthropists represents the single largest private grant ever made in this sector for energy efficiency. Based on our own experience in the United States, this scale of investment could yield billions of dollars in economic benefits for Article 5 countries and help to offset any upfront costs associated with transitioning past HFCs.\nTechnical Progress\nDemonstrating that in addition to galvanizing support for an ambitious amendment and providing new resources, the United States is also committed to addressing technical questions associated with phasing down HFCs, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) today published the results of a testing program to evaluate the performance of HFC alternatives in rooftop air conditioning units in high ambient temperatures. The testing program was launched in response to questions over whether HFC alternatives can perform well in hot and extremely hot temperatures. The results demonstrate that several viable replacements exist for both HCFC-22 and HFC-410A – two of the most common refrigerants used today – and that these potential replacements perform just as well at high temperatures as today's refrigerants. The testing program was conducted at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), and guided by a panel of prominent technical experts from Brazil, China, Egypt, India, Italy, Japan, Kuwait, Peru, Saudi Arabia, the United States, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO).

Thank you! Everybody, please have a seat, have a seat. Thank you so much. Everybody, please sit down. I can tell this is a rowdy crowd. Sit down. [Laughter]\nWelcome to the White House, everybody. Now, throughout my time here, Michelle and I have tried to make it a priority to promote the arts and the humanities, especially for our young people, and it's because we believe that the arts and the humanities are, in many ways, reflective of our national soul. They're central to who we are as Americans: dreamers and storytellers and innovators and visionaries. They're what helps us make sense of the past, the good and the bad. They're how we chart a course for the future while leaving something of ourselves for the next generation to learn from.\nAnd we are here today to honor the very best of their fields, creators who give every piece of themselves to their craft. As Mel Brooks once said—[laughter]—to her—to his writers on \"Blazing Saddles,\" which is a great film: \"Write anything you want, because we'll never be heard from again. We will all be arrested for this movie.\" [Laughter]\nNow, to be fair, Mel also said, a little more eloquently, that \"every human being has hundreds of separate people living inside his skin. And the talent of a writer is his ability to give them their separate names, identities, personalities and have them relate to other characters living within him.\" And that, I think, is what the arts and the humanities do. They lift up our identities and make us see ourselves in each other. And today's honorees each possess a gift for this kind of creative empathy, a gift that allows us to exchange a sense of what's most important and most profound in us and to identify with our collective experience as Americans.\nNow, along with Mel, we have an impressive crew with us here today. We've got Terry Gross and a whole bunch of people who Terry Gross has interviewed. [Laughter] We have Jane Chu, our Chair of the National Endowment of the Arts, and Bro Adams, Chair of the National Endowment of the Humanities, who also just has a cool name. [Laughter] Bro. [Laughter] And we thank the Members of Congress who are here for their strong support of the arts and the humanities.\nBut today the focus is on our recipients. And today's recipients of the National Medals of the Arts and the Humanities are poets, musicians, artists, journalists, professors, historians, and at least one chef. Their paths and their mediums could hardly be more different, and that's what makes them great. They take their piece of this big, bold, diverse, energetic country, they reshape it, and then they share it with us. They open our experience to theirs, and for that, we honor them here today.\nWe honor poets like Louise Glück, whose probing poems capture the quiet drama of nature and the quiet emotions of everyday people. Throughout her life, fastidious, attentive readers have taught her that there are \"ears that receive.\" As a professor, she strives to be a receiving ear for others, and she's inspired generations of young poets who are her students and readers alike. Once, when asked how she hoped the world would respond to her work, Louise said she wanted William Blake to come down from heaven and say, \"You did a very good job.\" [Laughter] Now, I don't think that's happened. [Laughter] So you will have to settle for us today. [Laughter]\nWe honor musicians like Philip Glass. Like his own life as a Juilliard-trained New York City cab driver, Philip's work is full of contradictions that cross genres and cultures. When the music he made strayed from neat conventions, audiences didn't know always how to react. I understand that there have been some eggs thrown occasionally. [Laughter] But, as Philip said, \"What seems strange or bizarre for any short period of time starts becoming familiar, and whatever artistic rewards or secrets it might have become revealed.\" So change isn't easy. But over his career of symphonies and operas and film scores, Philip Glass has proven that change can be beautiful.\nWe honor historians like Isabel Wilkerson, whose masterpiece \"The Warmth of Other Suns\" made the story of the Great Migration of African Americans from the South to the North and West accessible to a new generation of Americans. To craft this remarkable book, Isabel spent 15 painstaking years trekking between archives and living rooms, interviewing more than 1,200 people who told her their families' stories of heartbreak and endurance and ultimately overcoming, stories they often found too painful to share even with their own children. And through it all, she had to conquer the enormity of her task and prove wrong the doubts of others. And because she did, one of the most important chapters in our history is told in a book any young person can pick up and read.\nAnd that's just a sampling of the extraordinary accomplishments that are represented here today. We honor Rudolfo Anaya, José Andrés, Mel Brooks, Ron Chernow, Sandra Cisneros, Philip Glass, Louise Glück, Berry Gordy, Santiago Jiménez, Moisés Kaufman, Ralph Lemon, Audra McDonald, Terry Gross, James McBride, Louis Menand, the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center, Elaine Pagels, the Prison University Project, Luis Valdez, Abraham Verghese, Jack Whitten, Isabel Wilkerson. We also honor Wynton Marsalis, who unfortunately could not make it here today, and Morgan Freeman, who undoubtedly is off playing a Black President again. The—[laughter]. He never lets me have my moment. [Laughter] You know, it's just—he's always, like—[laughter].\nAll of today's honorees work in an age where the stories we tell and the technologies that we use to tell them are more diverse than ever before and as diverse as the country that we love. \"Every human being has hundreds of separate people living inside his skin.\" It echoes what Whitman once wrote about America, that we are large, containing multitudes. It's what's so great about this country, that there is no single, set way to contribute. All of us belong. All of us have a story to tell. Even when you think your story is too different, too strange, too unique, there's someone out there who's been waiting their whole life to hear you tell your story, because it's just like theirs. What a great gift all of you have given us.\nSo today we thank you, today's honorees, who have had the bravery to go first and tell their story and make us feel a little bit better about ours.\nSo with that, let's give out some awards. Let's read the citations. Thank you.\nThey're very big, by the way. [Laughter]\n[At this point, Lt. Cmdr. Richard I. Lawlor, USN, Navy Aide to the President, read the first 10 citations, and the President presented the medals, assisted by Lt. Cmdr. Ginny R. Nadolny, USCG, Coast Guard Aide to the President. The President then spoke to Lt. Cmdr. Lawlor as follows.] The President. Did we skip Audra McDonald?\n[The citation for musician and actor Audra McDonald appeared to be misplaced.]\nThe President. I was thinking of getting—[inaudible]. [Laughter] You're feeling kind of left out. [Laughter]\nAudience member. From Fresno. From Fresno, Mr. President.\nThe President. Huh?\nAudience member. From Fresno.\nThe President. See, you've got a lot of boosters here. [Laughter] I can make up the citation if you want. [Laughter]\nLt. Cmdr. Lawlor. Let's do that. Let's do that, sir. [Laughter]\nThe President. All right. You don't have it in there?\nLt. Cmdr. Lawlor. No, sir.\n[A White House aide brought the citation to the podium.]\nThe President. Here we go. [Laughter]\nLt. Cmdr. Lawlor. I'm sorry. Audra McDonald. [Applause]\n[Lt. Cmdr. Lawlor read the citation. After being presented with her medal, Ms. McDonald returned to her seat.]\nAudience member. We love you, Audra!\nThe President. From Fresno. [Laughter]\nAudience members. From Fresno!\n[Lt. Cmdr. Lawlor continued reading the citations, and the President presented the medals, assisted by Lt. Cmdr. Nadolny. As he returned to his seat having received his medal, writer and educator Rudolfo Anaya spoke as follows.]\nMr. Anaya. Viva Obama!\nThe President. This really is a rowdy crowd. [Laughter] Usually, these are much more serious. [Inaudible]\n[Lt. Cmdr. Lawlor read the remaining citations, and the President presented the medals, assisted by Lt. Cmdr. Nadolny.]\nThe President. Those are our honorees. Let's give them a big round of applause again. [Applause] Hey! Well, once again, we thank them for their extraordinary contributions. We look forward to all the work they will be doing in the future.\nJust a couple of other comments. One, I think Louise Glück has the coolest outfit—[laughter]—especially those spiked sneakers. I'm glad that Audra is already a good friend of mine. [Laughter] So the fact that they kind of left out the citation, I think she'll forgive me. And I do think Mel Brooks kind of set the tone for this thing—[laughter]—because, historically, this has been a much more staid affair. [Laughter] But somehow, I think my quote of him in the beginning, it threw everything off. [Laughter]\nEverybody, have fun. Enjoy the reception. Thank you. God bless you.", "timestamp": "2016-09-22", "title": "Remarks on Presenting the National Medal of Arts and the National Humanities Medal"}

I apologize for keeping you waiting, but I assume that you enjoyed the music that was playing in my absence. So I'm late, but at least I arranged for some little entertainment before we get started.\nTGIF. Let's get this going. Josh, do you want to start?\nQ: Sure. Thanks, Josh. Let's start with this Saudi legislation. I'm disappointed that you didn't erect like a countdown clock, cable news-style, for us to sort of all build up the anticipation. But I know there are some folks that work in the legislative office that are adept at counting votes. Do you have the sense that at this point, given the work that you've done to try and persuade lawmakers to reconsider, that you have the votes to avert an override of the President's veto?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Josh, we certainly are counting votes and having a number of conversations with members of Congress in both parties, in both houses of Congress. One of the particular challenges of counting votes in this instance is the frequency with which we hear private concerns expressed that don't match the public votes that are cast. So I don't have a solid vote count to share, but I can confirm for you that we continue to make a forceful case to members of Congress that overriding the President's veto means that this country will start pursuing a less forceful approach in dealing with state sponsors of terrorism, and it potentially opens up U.S. servicemembers and diplomats and even companies to spurious lawsuits in kangaroo courts around the world.\nThat's the crux of our concern. And I know you described it as the Saudi Arabia bill, and they certainly are interested in the outcome here. But from the administration perspective, our concern extends not just to the impact this would have on our relationship with Saudi Arabia, but rather the impact that this could have on the United States' relationship with countries around the world.\nQ: You've been saying for a few days now that you're hearing one thing from lawmakers in public and something else in private. Are you suggesting that members of Congress, including a lot of Democrats, are being duplicitous by saying -- telling something to their constituents that's contradictory to what they acknowledge off the record?\nMR. EARNEST: I think what I'm acknowledging is, first of all, I don't think I'm the first person or even the first White House Press Secretary to stand up here and to say that we're getting conflicting signals from members of Congress based on comparing their private conversations and their public expressions of a position on a particular issue. I'm also acknowledging that the politics of the situation are really tough. And if anything, I think that is an illustration of the principled nature of the President's position.\nThe President is not blind to the politics of this situation. The President understands that the talking points that are being prepared for the proponents of this bill have more political upside than the talking points that I'm able to present you from here. But if we're focused on the substantive, long-term impact on our nation's national security, that's what's driving the position, that's what's driving the President's decision to veto this bill -- not because it's politically convenient, it's not; it's political inconvenient.\nBut when it comes to the stakes and the impact that this could have on our national security, the President is willing to take some political heat in order to try to do the right thing and stand up for a principle that has an impact on the safety and security and risk that's faced by our servicemembers and diplomats around the world.\nQ: I know he disagrees with this substantively from the points that you just described, but does the President attach any symbolic significance to the prospect of being rebuked by Congress in a way that he never has before, and to having another branch of government so decisively overrule his decision-making on a major issue?\nMR. EARNEST: No, the President is not particularly concerned about that. I mean, in part because this President has gone longer in his tenure in the White House than just about any other President in modern history before facing the prospect of having his veto overridden. That's not happened yet. We're going to continue to make our case. But the President is much more worried about the long-term impact of this legislation on our national security than he is about the impact that this could have in his daily interactions with members of Congress.\nQ: And on one other topic. We learned today that Cheryl Mills and two others officials were granted immunities as part of the look the FBI was doing into the Clinton email situation. Given that this whole controversy is basically driven by the perception that the Clintons play by different rules than anyone else, does the White House think that it was appropriate for the FBI to offer the immunity to those three individuals?\nMR. EARNEST: Josh, off the top of my head, I can't recall an instance in which I second-guessed the decision made by the FBI Director or an independent investigator at the FBI, and I'm not going to start today. The fact is, the reason that President Obama nominated Director Comey to lead the FBI a few years ago is based on his reputation and commitment to putting politics aside and focusing on his responsibilities as a public servant and as a senior law enforcement official in the United States government.\nIt's presumably that same criteria that prompted just about every member of the Republican Senate Conference to support his nomination to this job, and to confirm him in this job. So the President has got a lot of confidence in the ability of senior officials at the FBI to make decisions based on their judgement, not on the politics. And that's what the President wants his FBI Director to do.\nSo I don't have any insight into this decision. For more insight into it, I'd refer you to the FBI.\nAyesha.\nQ: Thank you. Going back to the 9/11 bill, you say you're making your case. Has the President been making any calls to lawmakers on this, trying to prevent an override?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any specific presidential-level conversations to share with you. But there certainly have been a number of conversations at the staff level, here at the White House, with staff members and members on Capitol Hill, again, in both parties and in both houses of Congress.\nQ: Secretary Clinton has come out today -- or her campaign has said that she should sign this legislation if she was elected. Does that complicate the efforts to persuade lawmakers to not override this veto?\nMR. EARNEST: No. I don't think anybody was particularly surprised by that announcement.\nQ: Moving on to the continuing resolution and trying to fund the government, Democrats have opposed legislation from Republicans in the Senate because it wouldn't provide funding for Flint, Michigan. Now, I know that you're not going to negotiate this from the podium, but --\nMR. EARNEST: As easy as that would be. (Laughter.)\nQ: -- but I wanted to know, does the White House support that position? Should funding for the government, should it include funding for Flint?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, the Republican Leader in the Senate put out a proposal yesterday, and there are some attractive elements of the proposal, the first of which is Congress has a basic responsibility to keep the United States government open for business, and that's what the bill that he put forward would do. The President is obviously pleased to see that, and that's certainly something -- the President would like to avoid a government shutdown. He believes that Congress needs to do its job, and this is one element of it.\nThis proposal also includes funding to fight the Zika virus -- not as much money as we initially requested, but after seven months of waiting, it is a welcome development that Republicans in Congress are finally moving forward on a bipartisan proposal to give our public health professionals the resources that they need to fight the Zika virus.\nWe were, however, disappointed that Congress has not made a commitment to addressing the situation in Flint. I know there are a bunch of Democrats who are advocating for that approach, but not enough Republicans. And the President is concerned that that situation has not been addressed in the context of these ongoing negotiations. So he's concerned about that.\nThe President is also concerned about the fact that the proposal includes a rider that would essentially protect the ability of special interests to funnel money into political campaigns without having to disclose it. First of all, I don't really know what a proposal like that is doing in a budget bill, setting aside the fact that transparency in government and transparency in politics is something that is worthy of bipartisan support.\nSo one of the reasons why I was a little late in joining you all today is I had an opportunity to talk with the President in the Oval Office about this proposal. And after that conversation it's not at all clear to me that he is prepared to sign this bill because he believes that Congress has got more work to do. And hopefully they'll get to work on that and get it done without putting the American people and the American economy through another cliffhanger related to a government shutdown.\nMichelle.\nQ: When we're talking about the 9/11 bill, and you're saying that sometimes what is said in these conversations doesn't match the votes and that the politics are tough, it sounds like you're saying that Democrats are playing politics, just as you've accused the Republicans of doing with other issues.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think the -- I'm not going to generalize. I think what I would encourage you to do is to go talk to these members of Congress about what their position is. And the President has made it quite clear about what his position is. It's a principled one. It's one that means he's taken some political heat, but he's prepared to take that political heat because he's committed to protecting our national security.\nBut, look, here's the other thing that I've acknowledged. The President is also in a better position to take this political heat because of his strong record of looking out for the families of those who lost loved ones on 9/11. This is the President that ordered the operation to take Osama bin Laden off the battlefield. This is the President who, time and again, advocated for legislation that provided health care to recovery workers at Ground Zero, even in the face of some Republican opposition to that.\nAnd this is the President who, time and time again, has spoken movingly about the impact that 9/11 has had on our country and the way that those who lost loved ones on 9/11 serve as a daily inspiration to the President and to Americans across the country in exhibiting the kind of resolve and resiliency that's unique to this country.\nAnd so, look, the President is better positioned to take this political heat than your average back-bencher in the United States Congress. But that's heat that the President is prepared to take, nonetheless, because he feels strongly about looking out for the interests of our servicemembers and our diplomats when they're representing our country overseas.\nQ: But if he feels that strongly about this particular piece of legislation, why isn't he making calls or having meetings with particular members of Congress?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I wouldn't rule out that he's had some conversations about this, but I don't have any specific conversations to tell you about. What I can say is there's no doubt about the President's position. He stated it clearly, both in answering your questions, and I've been answering a number of questions about this every day for the last couple of weeks. So I don't think there's any doubt about what the President's position is or why the President has adopted this position even in the face of some political criticism.\nQ: So in having these conversations at the staff level, I mean, what you said was a little bit vague -- that what is said in these conversations don't necessarily match the votes. But what would you say about progress that is made in these conversations? Do you feel like that -- I mean, there's a positivity there, that this override might not happen?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me try to explain to you that in talking about this bill to members of Congress, our staffers are saying this opens up potentially U.S. servicemembers and U.S. diplomats to being hauled into court under spurious charges or under spurious claims in a way that would force the United States to expend significant resources and, in some cases, diplomatic capital to go and defend them.\nWe also make a strong case that the most effective way for the United States to confront state sponsors of terrorism is to level a government-wide designation against them and take appropriate steps, including sanctions, to isolate them from the United States and the rest of the international community, that that is a forceful way to compel them to stop supporting terrorism. But if we delegate that decision to a variety of judges in a variety of courtrooms, at a variety of levels, that unmistakable message of isolation is muddied.\nThat's not a very effective way for us to express and confront -- to express opposition to and confront state sponsors of terrorism. And when those arguments are presented, some members of Congress express some sympathy to that position and, in some cases, even articulate their own unease about the potential impact of this bill.\nI'll just point out that members of Congress, those who do, in private, express concerns about the potential consequences of this bill are not alone. I read for you the letter yesterday from George W. Bush's attorney general expressing his deep concerns about the impact of this legislation. He was joined by national security experts in both parties who served under President Bush and President Clinton. We got a letter our allies at the European Union, some of our closest allies and partners in the world, expressing their deep concern about the consequences of this legislation entering into law.\nSo there's widespread concern among our allies and among national security experts in both parties that's consistent with the argument that you've heard me make and that you've heard the President make publicly.\nSo the argument that I'm trying to make here, Michelle, is to emphasize [that] much of the objection that we encounter on Capitol Hill to our arguments is not one that's based on the merits, but one that's based on the politics. That's not a new phenomenon. That's happened throughout this presidency, and it's happened throughout the presidency of the 43 previous American presidents. But in this case, we're talking about our national security. We're talking about the risk that is facing American diplomats and American servicemembers. And that risk is significant, and it's not one the President is prepared to take. And he certainly is not -- does not believe that is a risk that the country should take.\nQ: Do you feel these conversations have swayed any votes?\nMR. EARNEST: We'll see.\nLana.\nQ: You're running a very persuasive case on behalf of the administration for --\nMR. EARNEST: Thank you, I appreciate that.\nQ: -- well, good for you on that. But you would think that when you're talking about the diplomatic consequences of that, when you're talking about President Obama's own former Secretary of State saying that that isn't a concern for her and that she would, in fact, vote in favor of this bill if she was in his position, how do you reconcile that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I'll let Secretary Clinton and her team talk about the position that she's taken on this.\nQ: You said you're not surprised by it.\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah, I'm not. I'm not.\nQ: You're saying she's taking the politically convenient choice rather than the choice on the merits that you've been talking about.\nMR. EARNEST: I didn't characterize her position. I'll let her and her team do that.\nQ: So is there a method by which somebody could look at all the same information and come up with a different conclusion about the potential diplomatic consequences of this bill?\nMR. EARNEST: Potentially. You'd have to go ask Secretary Clinton. I'm also not speaking on behalf of the position that's taken by individual members of Congress, either. They're going to have to explain their own position and their own votes, and if they want to reconcile their private conversations with the White House about this, then they're welcome to do that. And if they're -- I'm not going to reveal any confidences here, so they're going to have to sort of search their own conscience in terms of making a decision about how they want to talk about this publicly.\nI'm not aware of any conversations between Secretary Clinton and President Obama on this issue. So again, to get any insight into the position that she's taken, you'll have to ask her.\nQ: Will you let us know if they do have a conversation on this issue?\nMR. EARNEST: Potentially. (Laughter.)\nQ: All right. So, Monday night, does the President have any plans, anything he's going to tune into TV and watch?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Monday Night Football.\nQ: Oh, Monday Night Football. Is that what he's going to be watching?\nMR. EARNEST: I know the President is pretty fired up about Monday Night Football. I don't know who's on the calendar for Monday Night Football this week, but I'm sure the President does. (Laughter.)\nLook, I would anticipate that the President will watch much of, if not all, of the debate. I didn't talk to him about that today. But look, I think there will be millions of people across the country who are quite interested to see the two candidates on stage together for the first time, and I imagine the President will be one of them.\nQ: And a follow-up to yesterday's hack. You had said yesterday that the White House was investigating this. Any updates? You weren't prepared at that time to tell us whether or not that was in fact First Lady Michelle Obama's passport. Can you confirm that now?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not in a position to confirm that. You can check with the Secret Service, who obviously is at the forefront of ensuring the safety of the First Family. There continue to be administration officials who do look at this particular situation, but I don't have any update on it at this point.\nQ: And just one more follow-up on that. Do you have any comment on the potential Russian ties with this email hack?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't at this point. Olivier.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. On what's being called the 9/11 bill, can you share, or can you get us the number of times that this administration has invoked sovereign immunity and the circumstances surrounding the most recent case?\nMR. EARNEST: Let me see what I can find out about that. I'll look into it.\nQ: And then just on the substance of the question, why shouldn't a government official who is responsible for, tied to, whatever, an act of international terrorism -- whether it's a government official from this country or another country -- why shouldn't there be civil relief available to relatives of people who were killed under those circumstances?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, because I think the question really, Olivier, is to evaluate -- well, I think the question is actually about whether or not the country of Saudi Arabia would be held responsible.\nQ: But when you're being asked, you're pointing to specific American diplomats and servicemen and women. So, clearly, individuals here -- there's got to be jeopardy for individuals.\nMR. EARNEST: What I'm suggesting is that that could be the corresponding response to this legislation going into effect. And that would be a reasonable reciprocation of the steps that the United States Congress is poised to pass into law here.\nSo look, the administration believes strongly that individuals need to be held accountable. And, in fact, we also believe that countries who sponsor terrorism should be held accountable. And if anything, this legislation waters down our ability to do that. There already is a well codified -- there already is a codified process enacted by Congress for designating specific countries as state sponsors of terrorism.\nSo there are countries like Iran and Syria that fit that description, and they are faced with a whole set of sanctions and broader international isolation because of that designation. And that's a forceful way -- that's a forceful response.\nAnd if we were going to essentially delegate that designation to individual judges considering different pieces of evidence and reaching different conclusions potentially, that waters down our ability to send an unmistakable signal that the United States is prepared to confront, in the toughest possible terms, governments that sponsor terrorism.\nCheryl.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. On the CR, we're one week away from the end of the fiscal year and a possible government shutdown. Do you believe that the CR proposal that the Senate has is the best you're going to get, or are you expecting them to continue negotiating it?\nMR. EARNEST: The President does believe that they've got more work to do. And I think there are a lot of Democrats on Capitol Hill who share that view, and I think it is unclear at best right now whether or not this particular piece of legislation will pass both houses of Congress and make its way to the President's desk. Even if it were, it's also unclear at best right now if the President would sign it.\nSo it sounds to me like Republicans in Congress have some more work to do to make sure that the government doesn't shut down a week from now.\nQ: How would you describe, at least from the White House perspective, the tenor of the negotiations? Clearly, there does not appear to be panic that the government is about to shut down. Would you say negotiations are going well, better this year?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I do think it's too early for people to panic. So I'm not advocating that. But there remains some important work to be done. Fortunately, there are seven days to get it done. And hopefully Congress will not take all seven days, but will spend some time working over the weekend. I don't think that's too much to ask considering they recently completed a seven-week vacation. So pulling a few hours over the weekend to make sure this gets done in a timely fashion I don't think is too much for the American people to ensure that Congress is fulfilling arguably their most basic responsibility, which is funding the government and avoiding a government shutdown.\nRon.\nQ: I'm not sure I understand this argument about the bill, the 9/11 bill and state sponsors of terrorism. There's no other way to designate a country or to impose sanctions comprehensively on a country if this bill is -- aside from this mechanism?\nMR. EARNEST: Ron, the point is that there already is an existing system for doing that. That's the point.\nQ: So what you're saying is that if this -- this would eliminate that?\nMR. EARNEST: No, no, it wouldn't eliminate that. But it certainly would cloud that judgement. Because right now, for example, Saudi Arabia is not on the state sponsors of terror list. And this kind of legislation could open up the potential for a variety of court decisions that could reach differing conclusions about that.\nYou could also imagine other court cases being filed that would raise similar questions about Iran's conduct or Syria's conduct. And if we end up in a situation where plaintiffs in a case do not succeed in making their case against Syria, hypothetically, it certainly muddies the water when it comes to the U.S. government position about whether or not Syria is complicit in supporting terrorism.\nQ: The other part of this -- you were asked earlier about sovereign immunity. What is the situation -- is there any situation that you can recall, or if you can tell us about where, without that protection abroad, a diplomat, a soldier, someone would have been at risk?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, for a specific case, I'd refer you to the Department of Justice or even the State Department, and they may be able to tell you a little bit more about a particular situation where this cropped up. But in general, we know that U.S. government personnel are engaged in a variety of activities to protect our national security, to advance our interests around the world. And the prospect that in carrying out that work they could get hauled into court in some other country under dubious pretenses, that's something that we're deeply concerned about. But that's exactly the kind of loophole that could potentially be created here.\nQ: Do you think the Saudis would do that?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not going to speculate about individual countries and what their potential reaction would be. But you can talk to the Saudis about that.\nQ: Have they warned you or told you, told the U.S. what they will do if, in fact, this bill is -- this veto is overridden?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I know they've said a number of things publicly. I'll let them characterize their position. But our partners and allies at the European Union are certainly concerned about that, and that was the reason that they sent the letter expressing their grave concern about this particular piece of legislation, because they understand that countries around the world, and potentially countries who are members of the European Union, would pass legislation carving out exceptions to sovereign immunity. And no country has more to lose in the context of those exceptions than the United States of America, given the preeminent role that we play in global affairs.\nQ: On Charlotte, there's a DOJ team that went down there. Now, this is not an \"investigation,\" as in the case in Tulsa. Have they been able to give the President an assessment of where the situation stands there now in real time -- this community relations team, essentially?\nMR. EARNEST: That team is on the ground primarily to offer some expertise and advice the local officials who are grappling with the difficult situation right now. Their primary function is not to report back to the White House. There are other ways that the President can continue to be informed of events on the ground. There are White House staffers here who are in close touch with the Charlotte mayor and her office, and the Tulsa mayor and his office. I can tell you that senior administration officials -- or senior White House officials have been in touch with Anthony Foxx. He's currently the Secretary of Transportation, but he's also the former mayor of Charlotte, so he obviously has a lot of ties to that community and a lot of relationships with people who can offer an assessment about what's happening there.\nSo there are a variety of ways for the President to get a very clear understanding about what exactly is happening in Charlotte right now.\nQ: What is the assessment now?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, I think the assessment is one that -- the assessment that the President has received is consistent with the one that all of you have been reporting, which is there continue to be protests. They appeared to have been more peaceful last night than they were on the two previous nights. That obviously is a welcome development. And you heard the President talk about this a little bit yesterday in his interview with Robin Roberts. But this is a situation that we're going to continue to closely monitor from here in terms of the impact on that broader community.\nQ: And lastly, on this issue of the release of the videotape and all that, what is the President's thinking about that particular aspect of this, given the demand for transparency in that community and so many others?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, the President believes that this is a decision that should be made by local officials. And the mayor and the police chief I think are the ones that ultimately are going to have to decide, and they should do so consistent with their judgment about the best interest of the community. And they also are going to have to make a judgment consistent with state and local laws. And based on what I've read, there may be some laws that could have an impact on their decision.\nSo I'm not going to be able to speak precisely to the decision that needs to be made by local officials in Charlotte. But as a matter of principle, I think the President has reached the pretty common-sense conclusion that when you're in a position needing to build trust with a group of people, being as candid as possible is usually the best approach.\nQ: And being as transparent as possible? Candid, transparent -- I don't want to put words in your mouth.\nMR. EARNEST: Candid as possible is usually the best approach.\nJerome.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. The EU President said today that it was not realistic to get a deal with the U.S. by the end of the Obama presidency. The TPP, the prospect of being ratified in Congress looks very limited. What's left of the President's ambitious trade deals policy?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Jerome, the briefing room is an appropriate setting for skeptical questions to be asked, but as is usually the case in this setting, we're a lot more hopeful than your question would suggest. There is plenty of reason for Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill to give careful consideration and eventually support the Trans-Pacific Partnership. There certainly is widespread public support all across the country, and there are a variety of polls that have come out in the last few months that indicate that a majority of Democrats and a majority of Republicans and a majority of independents across the country support the Trans-Pacific Partnership or trade deals like it.\nWe also know that last year the President was able to succeed in building a bipartisan coalition to support legislation that gave him the authority to complete the negotiations. If you think about it, that actually seems like a much tougher sell. Convincing Republicans to give the Democratic President authority to do something is a tough sell, but something we succeeded in getting done.\nWith regard to the TPP, now we're in a position of just advocating to Republicans in Congress, hey, do you want to vote for a bill that will actually cut 18,000 taxes that other countries impose on American goods? And we can go to Democrats and say, hey, do you want to go raise labor standards, and environmental standards, and intellectual property protection standards in countries all around the world in a way that will level the playing field for American workers and American businesses? We can actually do something about these broader global trends that, in some cases, have dealt a pretty tough blow to some communities across the country.\nThat's a pretty good case. Not a slam-dunk case, but I think it's a pretty strong case. And based on the track record of building a bipartisan majority last year, we're hopeful that we'll be able to do the same thing before the end of this year. But we'll see.\nWith regard to T-TIP, the European trade deal, it's not uncommon, over the last several months, for people to be openly worrying about whether or not this is something that we can do. The President set an ambitious goal earlier this year of trying to complete negotiations before the end of the year. They're not completed yet. They've got a lot of negotiating left to do. But as I understand it, the U.S. Trade Representative was just in Europe within the last few weeks trying to move this forward.\nSo we'll see if we can get you some more information from them about the current status of those negotiations. But that's an ambitious goal, I would acknowledge that on the front end, but it's still one that we're aiming to achieve.\nGregory.\nQ: This 9/11 lawsuit bill seems to be framed as an up or down proposition. Is that accurate, or is there room for compromise?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we certainly would welcome congressional action that would address the concerns that we've raised. So I guess that's the reason that we're having conversations, is to try to find an approach that would satisfy the concerns and the desire of some members of Congress to want to address the request of the 9/11 families. And we're hopeful that they can find a way to do that that doesn't carve out the kinds of exceptions that put our diplomats and servicemembers at risk around the world.\nQ: But your answer to Olivier before sort of suggested that there are two moving parts here. There is the sovereign immunity stripping provisions of JASTA, but also the response from other nations, which may or may not be reciprocal to that. So is there any -- am I characterizing your position correctly? If that's true, is there anything that you can do to reduce the immunity protection without triggering some sort of international law --\nMR. EARNEST: I guess what I would say -- the best way I can answer your question, Gregory, is to say that, yes, potentially there is a way to address the significant concerns that we've raised about the risk facing U.S. servicemembers and U.S. diplomats while also addressing the requests of the 9/11 families. That's the --\nQ: Are you prepared to say (inaudible)?\nMR. EARNEST: No, but I think that's the nature of the conversations that we're having with members of Congress on Capitol Hill. I don't know if something like that exists, but we're certainly in conversations to find out if it does.\nToluse.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I wanted to ask you about Syria. There's a new offensive there in east Aleppo. I'm wondering if the White House still believes that the ceasefire that was agreed to is still in effect. And if you do, sort of what kind of case can you make for it at this point?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Toluse, we clearly have seen an increase in violence over the last several days. And that's not a welcome development at all. In fact, the arrangement that we tried to reach with the Russians was engineered to try to reduce violence. And unfortunately, that only worked for a rather short period of time.\nLook, over the last several days we have seen Syria announce their intent to unilaterally withdraw from the Cessation of Hostilities. We saw an attack on U.N. aid workers, for which we hold the Russians accountable, because know that it was either carried out by the Russian military or by the Syrian military. And Russia is the party that's taken responsibility for keeping the Syrian military in line. And obviously striking a humanitarian aid convoy is way out of line, entirely inconsistent with international principles, and in the view of many people, potentially a war crime.\nYou also saw President Assad make a statement yesterday falsely ascribing blame to the United States for this increase in violence. Nothing short of a bald-faced lie. And then you had the announcement overnight, East Coast time, of a new offensive by the Syrian government in Aleppo.\nConsidering that Russia is the party that is taking responsibility for ensuring Syrian compliance with the Cessation of Hostilities, Russia is culpable. And if this arrangement has a future, Russia is going to need to step up and prove it. And they've got some work to do.\nQ: You've often said that this is a test of whether or not Russia is willing or able to sort of have influence on the Syrian regime. I'm wondering if you've been able to make an assessment on whether -- since this has basically broken down, whether they were unwilling, or whether they were unable, and if you think there's a difference in terms of White House policy in terms of whether or not it was one or the other.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen -- well, that's an interesting question, actually. I think it is -- I'm not prepared to offer an assessment in each of these cases whether or not it was weakness on the part of Russia, where essentially they were rebuked by the Assad regime, and despite Russia's warnings, Assad went ahead and ordered the actions that he did. Or if Russia failed to clearly communicate to Assad what their expectations were. It's too early to tell exactly whether they were unwilling or unable.\nQ: A third option could be that they were not being straight with the U.S. and they see some benefit to having an agreement with the U.S. and not fulfilling it on their end. Is that something that --\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, I guess I would see that. I would put that in the unwilling category, which is to say they weren't willing to go to the Assad regime and actually make them live up to the terms of the Cessation of Hostilities.\nBut I guess the question you're asking is: \"Does it matter?\" I guess it's hard to say. It certainly matters if they're unwilling, right? Because it certainly does raise significant questions about their credibility. If they were unable to, it raises similarly difficult questions -- because the only reason we're really having this conversation with the Russians is they seem to be the only people that we can talk to that do have any influence over the Assad regime. And if they don't, then I'm not really sure why we would continue to talking to them.\nWell, again, we're going to have to see how this plays out. And when I say how this plays out, we're really just going to have to see what the Russian response is. Their credibility is on the line under either scenario. And they're going to have to decide -- President Putin is going to have to decide whether he's interested in protecting that credibility in the international community or not.\nQ: One more question on Wells Fargo. They obviously face about $100 million in fines for setting up millions of bogus accounts that customers didn't want. Now we're hearing from Senator Warren that she believes the CEO should resign and should be investigated. She just sent a letter with eight other senators saying that Wells Fargo's executive should be investigated by the Labor Department for potentially unfair labor practices. I don't think we've heard from the White House on this yet. So I'm just wondering, do you agree with Senator Warren that the CEO should resign? Do you think the fines that were put out are enough of a punishment? And is the White House going to weigh in any further on this in the future?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I can't recall an instance in which I called for the resignation of an executive at a private company, so that seems a little outside my purview. But maybe I'll reserve the right to do that at some point. But I can't imagine a scenario in which that would come up, but we'll see. I haven't done that before, and I'm not going to do it in this instance.\nWith regard to the Department of Labor, I can't speak to any potential enforcement action that they may be considering. Those kinds of enforcement actions are conducted independent of any sort of White House interference. And so I certainly don't want to say something that could lead somebody to conclude that there was inappropriate White House interference in that decision, if there is even a decision to be made. So I'll refer to them.\nMore generally, though, I do think that this announcement from the CFPB is strong vindication of the President's pursuit of tough Wall Street reform legislation. Republicans have been foursquare against the CFPB since the day that it was created. But the reason that the CFPB was created is that there previously had not been a financial regulator dedicated solely to protecting consumers.\nThe CFPB is the only financial regulator with the express mission statement to look out for American middle-class families. And here it paid off in spades. You had one of the largest, most influential financial institutions in the country scamming people who were trying to set up checking accounts. And nobody was in a better position to hold them accountable for that than the CFPB. And they took action, levying the largest fine in its history in response to this egregious conduct. And that means that they're going to be -- the fine was on the order of $185 million. And that also -- when you combine that with the other actions that the CFPB has taken over the last several years, they've put nearly $12 billion back into the pockets of 27 million American families that have been harmed by financial institutions.\nI think that's a pretty good illustration of the President making good on his promise to bring change to Washington and to change business as usual in Washington, and making sure that there is somebody in Washington looking out for middle-class families. And he took a lot of political heat for making this a priority too. We saw millions of dollars in lobbying efforts and campaign ads spent by the most influential financial institutions in the country to try to block this. But the President stood up to them and said no, even though those financial institutions have some members of Congress in their back pocket -- those members of Congress who have repeatedly tried to gut funding for the CFPB.\nSo this is a good illustration of why the President fought so hard for the CFPB, and I think it's a pretty strong vindication of his efforts and the several million American families that are going to get the benefit from it.\nBob.\nQ: Yeah, Josh, on the 9/11 bill. You keep saying it goes against international norms, and there's this somewhat fuzzy area of sovereign immunity -- or is it fuzzy? Correct me --\nMR. EARNEST: It's fuzzy to me. I'm certainly no expert in international law.\nQ: Well, that's what I'm asking, I guess. Can you say that this would specifically go against some kind of international agreement? Or is it just an international norm?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, I have not heard -- as a technical matter, no one has made the case to me that this is the violation of a specific agreement. Maybe it is, and if it is, then I'm sure one of the White House lawyers will be appearing at my door when I get back to my office to explain it to me, in which case I'll explain it to all of you.\nMy understanding, however, the way that it's been described to me, is that there is a legal concept of sovereign immunity that countries around the world observe. And if the most influential country in the world starts carving out exceptions to sovereign immunity, then other countries are going to do the same thing.\nNow, the problem with that approach is that there's no country in the world that has more to lose from carving out exceptions to sovereign immunity than the United States, given the role that we play around the world. So that's what the -- that's the concern that we have. And what that means is it means that there's more legal risk that our servicemembers and our diplomats and, in some cases, even U.S. companies face as a result of this action.\nAnd at a certain level -- and so the concern is, is not just the legal risk that they would face, but also the significant resources and diplomatic capital that the United States government would have to spend to defend them. So that's the principle that's at stake, and that's why the President feels so strongly about this.\nQ: Is it fuzzy?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I'm not an attorney, so I'm sure that there's -- somebody who is an expert in the technical aspects of this law would say that the risk that we face is really clear. And look, I think in this instance I'd be inclined to believe them, because it's not just White House lawyers that have reached that conclusion, it's lawyers at the European Union that have reached that conclusion and it's the top lawyer in the Bush administration that has reached that conclusion.\nSo this isn't some partisan fight here. This is basically a contest between politicians that are worried about their political standing and experts in national security who are focused on the long-term best interest of the country.\nQ: Can I follow up?\nMR. EARNEST: Go ahead, John.\nQ: Thank you. You're familiar with the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act? It's a law that was passed -- signed into law in 1976, signed by Gerald Ford. And under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act there actually is one exception that's carved out for suing a foreign government, and that's if a foreign state engages in commercial activity. Are you familiar with this already?\nMR. EARNEST: I've certainly heard of the law, but I'm not familiar with all the consequences of it.\nQ: So there's a carve-out -- there's a carve-out that exists right now --\nMR. EARNEST: Yes.\nQ: -- under U.S. law, and I assume the President has no problem with the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and the way this carve-out exists. Is that correct?\nMR. EARNEST: That's correct. The President does not have an objection to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. The concern that the President has is carving out another one. Carving out additional exceptions only --\nQ: This carve-out -- what's wrong with a carve-out that would allow an individual to sue a foreign state engaged in terrorist activity? So you allow it for commercial activity, but why not terrorist activity? Explain that.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think there are a couple of things about this. The first is, it's just the principle that is at risk of further erosion and degradation as a result of this bill. And again, this is a principle that insulates and protects the U.S. government, U.S. servicemembers, U.S. diplomats, and U.S. companies around the world. This is a concept, this is a principle of sovereign immunity that is worth protecting because the United States benefits more from that principle and international regard for that principle than any other country in the world.\nHere's the other thing that's important to recognize, though, John, which is there already is a mechanism for individuals who were harmed by state sponsors of terrorism to be compensated. So there already is a mechanism for victims --\nQ: Individuals.\nMR. EARNEST: -- individuals who were harmed by state sponsors of terrorism. There's already a legal mechanism for seeking that kind of compensation.\nQ: After the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act was signed into law, I don't believe there was any rush to the courts all around the world -- based upon that one carve-out -- for commercial activity that a foreign government maintained. What makes you think there would be this rush to the courts based upon this carve-out as it relates to terrorist activity that a foreign government may take against U.S. citizens on U.S. soil?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, first of all, John, I'll just point out that Bashar al-Assad did an interview with the Associated Press this week in which he cast the kind of allegations that, again, if there were these kinds of exceptions in Syria, could put the United States at grave legal risk. So it's not exactly uncommon for other countries to irresponsibly and falsely accuse the United States of terrorism.\nThe second thing is -- all I can tell you is that that is the legal conclusion that the Obama administration has reached about the potential consequences of this legislation. That conclusion was also reached by officials at the Europe Union. And that legal conclusion was also reached by Michael Mukasey, who was the Attorney General for President George W. Bush. So this isn't a partisan conclusion or a partisan analysis that's been put forward. This is an analysis that is actually bipartisan in nature and has been reached by national security experts in both parties.\nAgain, I think that's the reason that there is sympathy for the case that we're making to individual members of Congress. The question is, is it actually going to show up in the vote count. And I don't know if it will.\nQ: Your example of Bashar al-Assad, does the President -- does this government consider him to be the legitimate leader of Syria?\nMR. EARNEST: The President believes that Bashar al-Assad has lost legitimacy to lead that country; that, moving forward, it is impossible to imagine the country of Syria coming together and being led by a tyrant that has used the military might of the country to attack his own people. It is impossible for him to have any -- just as a practical matter -- setting aside the moral questions here, just as a practical matter, there's no reasonable prospect that President Assad would build, earn, or win the confidence of even a majority of the Syrian people.\nJuliet.\nQ: Josh, the Interior Department just finalized a rule today that would clear the way for Native Hawaiians to have a government-to-government relationship with the federal government should they form a unified government. Could you just explain why the administration is pursuing this, and whether the President's own childhood and experience in Hawaii influenced the approach the administration has taken on this issue?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President took office vowing to strengthen the relationship between the United States government and tribal governments around the country, including the Native Hawaiian population.\nAnd next week -- I'm jumping ahead here -- but next week the White House will convene the Tribal Nations Conference here in Washington, D.C. This is something that the President has prioritized, and he's regularly appeared at this conference as a demonstration of the priority that he has placed on improved relations between the federal government and tribal governments.\nThe President obviously does have his own personal connection to the Native Hawaiian population and the rich cultural heritage of the Native Hawaiian people. The President got to experience a little of that when he traveled to Hawaii a few weeks ago. And the President believes that that cultural heritage isn't just worthy of our respect, it's also worth protecting. And that's the reason that, in designating the marine monument out there, the policy was careful to ensure that local populations could continue to engage in their ancient traditions.\nSo I think this also -- I would put this in the category of the kind of policies the President is hopeful the next president will pursue. But there's a lot of progress that we've made in terms of strengthening the relationship between the federal government and a variety of tribal governments. But there's more work to be done.\nAnd there certainly is more work to be done in terms of supporting and empowering the next generation of Native Americans to ensure that they've got access to good schools and quality health care and the kind of stable home life that so many other American kids benefit from. And we've made some important progress, making investments that would ensure that kind of future for native populations. But there certainly is more work to be done. And the President is hopeful that the next president will build on that progress.\nLet's move around. Kevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I wanted to ask you about the Assad sanctions legislation. There are leaders on the Hill who feel like the White House is getting in the way of that. And given that there is not only no longer a ceasefire -- certainly not one that's been consistent -- to say nothing of the fact that the President himself feels like this is a man who is an illegitimate leader in that nation, why would the White House stand in the way of such legislation?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, to put it bluntly, Kevin, we already have got the authority that we need to impose sanctions against the Assad regime if we believe that's going to advance our interests in that part of the world.\nWhat recent history has shown is that our sanctions strategy is most effective when it is closely coordinated and implemented with our allies and partners all around the world. We were able to apply maximum pressure against the Iranians and compel them to come to the negotiating table, and ultimately give up the most concerning aspects of their nuclear program because the United States worked in concert with other countries around the world to apply tough sanctions against them. Unilateral sanctions imposed by the United States Congress are not likely to have the desired effect.\nSo Congress has already given the President broad authorities when it comes to imposing sanctions, and his administration has not hesitated to use them, but we only use them -- or at least we use them most effectively when we're able to coordinate those activities and that strategy with our partners and our allies around the world.\nQ: Let me push back for just a second, though, because I want to read just part of Speaker Ryan's remarks yesterday morning. You may or may not have had a chance to hear. He said, \"Listen, this week we learned that the Syrian military was complicit in bombing a humanitarian aid convoy.\" You and I talked about that this week; it should come as no surprise. \"At no point has the Assad regime stopped committing atrocities against the Syrian people.\" When you have that as a backdrop, you can understand why there are leaders who feel very forcefully that anything that can be done to punish this regime, this lawless regime, is a good thing. It's difficult to reconcile that you have them thinking that this is something that should move forward when you also have a White House that feels like we need to do all we can to not only punish this specific regime, but do all we can to get him out of power. Why wouldn't the two sides come together?\nMR. EARNEST: Because what we're looking to do is we're looking to maximize the pressure that we can apply to the Assad regime. And applying unilateral sanctions by the United States is not the most effective way for us to do that. The most effective way for us to do that is to work carefully with other governments in the region and countries around the world to coordinate our sanctions and apply maximum economic pressure to the Assad regime. That's the approach that we have taken with regard to Iran. That's the approach that we've taken with regard to North Korea. That's also the approach that we've taken with regard to Russia.\nAnd there are varying levels of success that we've had in each of those instances, but what all of them have in common is that the force of our sanctions are multiplied when they are implemented in coordination with other countries around the world.\nQ: Let me run back a bit on the CR. Did you suggest that the Senate hadn't really addressed Flint? Because they actually have. Funding for Flint was included in the recently passed WRDA bill. It passed 95 to 3. I'm not sure if you're aware of that.\nMR. EARNEST: I am aware of that. But in the current version that the House is working on, it's not included in there. And I did notice that there is funding in the CR that's dedicated to meeting the needs of people in places like Louisiana, Texas and Maryland who have been victims of flooding.\nThe President is obviously supportive of that. The administration was among the first to come forward and say that we believe Congress should act as soon as possible to provide relief to the people of Louisiana. The President promised that he would fight for the people of Louisiana when he visited them in the immediate aftermath of that flooding.\nQ: And he wouldn't forget them.\nMR. EARNEST: And wouldn't forget them, and he hasn't. The President made a similar commitment when he went to Flint earlier this spring. He went to Flint, he visited with people in that community. And he promised to help them as much as he could by providing them the kind of resources that they need to address the infrastructure problems that have put thousands of kids at a pretty significant risk.\nCongress has a responsibility to look out for the needs of those kids in Flint just as much as they have a responsibility to look out for the needs of kids in Louisiana, too. So we need to see some congressional attention to this issue. And look, I know a lot of Democrats are quite focused on this issue in Flint. It's time for some Republicans to get the message, too.\nQ: Let me -- one more -- or a couple more. Gitmo, I know I ask you every week about the possibility of, in particular, bulk transfers coming up certainly in the days ahead. Is there any reason to believe that there will now be more transfers in the next week that you would announce?\nMR. EARNEST: Nothing I have to announce from here, but we'll obviously keep you posted if any of those transfers take place.\nQ: Okay. And last, on JASTA. I want to run something by you that Jack Quinn said; he's an attorney for the victims' families of the tragedy of 9/11. He says, \"It's increasingly apparent that these false reciprocity arguments reflect nothing more than a desire to protect the Saudis from having to answer the legitimate claims of the 9/11 families whose loved ones were murdered on September 11, 2001.\" How sensitive is the President to the notion that there is a perception, at minimum, that by voting against JASTA, or vetoing JASTA, is somehow a nod to the Saudi government and our relationship with them?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, the President has made a forceful case and I've made a forceful case that our deepest concern is not limited to the impact that this bill would have on our relationship with Saudi Arabia. Our deepest concern is about the impact that this bill would have on our relationship with countries all around the world.\nQ: But we don't sponsor terrorism.\nMR. EARNEST: I'm sorry?\nQ: We don't sponsor terrorism. When we're talking about JASTA, it's specifically tailored against state sponsors of terror. The United States doesn't do that.\nMR. EARNEST: You and I both know that. But there are irresponsible people all around the world who accuse the United States of being complicit in terrorism all the time. Bashar al Assad just did an interview with the Associated Press two days ago. We know that this happens.\nAnd here's the other part of this, Kevin. People like Mr. Quinn stand to make some money from these kinds of exceptions being carved out. Nothing wrong with that, but we should acknowledge the interest that he has in this as well. The President's interest is focused on our national security. The President's interest is making sure we're looking out for the safety and security and legal risk that could be facing our servicemembers, our diplomats, and U.S. companies around the world.\nQ: Last, can you give us a readout on what you expect the President to say tomorrow at the opening of the African American History Museum?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, the President is quite excited about the prospect of appearing at the dedication of the new Smithsonian that's dedicated to African American history and culture. The President and his family had an opportunity to get a behind-the-scenes tour of the museum a week or two ago. And I was just talking to him about what a special opportunity that was and how much he enjoyed being able to take his family there. And he believes it's something that all Americans should see. The story that African Americans have to tell about their history in this country is in line with the American story. It's an important part of the American story.\nAnd the President was talking about this in his interview last night, and I thought he made a real interesting point, which is much of the history that's contained in that beautiful new building is not ancient history; it's history that took place in his lifetime. And I think that says two really important things, particularly as we're dwelling on -- and rightfully focused on -- the situation in Charlotte and Tulsa and other communities that have encountered some of the distrust between law enforcement and African American communities.\nThe lesson is simply this: Since that is not ancient history, we need to understand that there is a legacy that's still very present. And I think that can help white Americans understand the concerns that many African Americans have. At the same time, the fact that this is not ancient history is also a great indication of how much progress our country has made in a really short period of time. Some profound changes have happened in this country, and those who are advocating and demonstrating and protesting should take confidence from the progress that was hard won by people like John Lewis and others who are advocates of civil rights.\nSo this is an important -- this museum is important, not just to the African American community, but it's important to all Americans. It says something important about who we are and what we can accomplish when we put our minds to it. And the President will say it much more eloquently tomorrow than I just did. But he's got some strong feelings about it, and he's looking forward to appearing at the dedication tomorrow.\nLalit.\nQ: Last week, around 18 Indian soldiers were killed in a terrorist attack (inaudible) Kashmir. After, they (inaudible). What did the White House think of the situation there?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I've seen some of the public reports about this incident. Obviously, the United States strongly condemns acts of terrorism around the world. And we have long urged India and Pakistan to find ways to resolve their differences not through violence but through diplomacy. And over the years, they've made some important progress in that pursuit, and we're hopeful that they'll be able to continue to make the kind of progress that will bring greater stability to what is a rather volatile region of the world.\nQ: Has there been outreach made by the White House to the two capitals of --\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any specific conversations at the White House level. I can certainly tell you that the White House is aware of this incident. But for any contacts with either the Indian or Pakistani government, I'd refer you to the State Department.\nJane.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. With regards South Korea issues, yesterday South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se remarked at the U.N. General Assembly, and Foreign Minister Yun suggested its exclusion of North Korea from U.N. member states. How would you comment on this?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm sorry, can you repeat that one more time? Just the last part.\nQ: Foreign Minister Yun suggested the exclusion North Korea from U.N. member states.\nMR. EARNEST: It's crucial that North Korea --\nQ: -- from United Nations member states.\nMR. EARNEST: I see -- it's important for North Korea to hear from the United Nations?\nQ: Yes.\nMR. EARNEST: Was that the statement?\nQ: Taken out.\nQ: No, be excluded from.\nQ: Excluded.\nMR. EARNEST: I see. Obviously, I'm unfamiliar with the comments made by the Foreign Minister of South Korea yesterday, so why don't I take the question and we'll see if we can get you a specific answer.\nQ: Also, another one. Is the United States concerned about the North Korea as a state sponsor of terror country?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the United States is certainly deeply concerned about the kind of provocations that emanate from North Korea. And you hear the President on a regular basis express his solidarity and our nation's solidarity with our allies in South Korea, our allies in Japan who are facing the biggest risk from North Korea's activities.\nSo the United States is resolute in our stance in support of our allies, and the United States is committed to playing a leading role in the international community in working with not just our allies but also our partners like Russia and China in applying significant pressure on North Korea and bringing them into compliance with their international obligations and with a variety of U.N. Security Council resolutions that they violate all too frequently.\nWhy don't we do the week ahead, and then we'll let you get started on your weekend. Mark Knoller is not here to snicker at my joke.\nOn Monday, the President will host the 2016 White House Tribal Nations Conference in Washington, D.C. This will be the President's eighth and final Tribal Nations Conference, providing tribal leaders from the 567 federally recognized tribes with the opportunity to interact directly with high-level federal government officials and members of the White House Council on Native American Affairs. This year's conference will continue to build upon the President's commitment to strengthen the government-to-government relationship with Indian Country and to improve the lives of American Indians and Alaska Natives.\nOn Tuesday, the President will participate in a DNC roundtable.\nOn Wednesday, the President will welcome Kyle Bush and his team members to the White House to honor his 2015 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series championship. On Wednesday afternoon, the President will travel to Fort Lee in Virginia to meet with servicemembers and the post community to thank them for their outstanding service to the nation. While he's there, the President will tape a CNN town hall meeting with Jake Tapper, where he will have the opportunity to take questions from members of the military community.\nOn Thursday, the President and First Lady are looking forward to welcoming the 2016 U.S. Olympic and Paralympic teams to the White House to honor their participation and success in this year's Olympic Games in Rio.\nOn Friday -- next Friday -- the President will travel to a local high school to discuss the importance of a high-quality education and how the United States must strengthen and reform our education system to ensure that our students have the tools, skills and support they need to succeed.\nWe'll have some additional details about the President's visit in the coming days, and hopefully we'll even have some more details about the precise location of that visit before the end of the day today. So stay tuned on that. But that will be somewhere here in the Washington, D.C. area.\nEverybody have a good weekend. Take care.\nEND 2:23 P.M.

{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119381", "text": "Friday, HFA senior national spokesperson Glen Caplin released the following statement in response to the new bombshell report that Trump's foreign policy adviser is being probed for suspected meetings with senior Russian officials:\n\"It's chilling to learn that U.S. intelligence officials are conducting a probe into suspected meetings between Trump's foreign policy adviser Carter Page and members of Putin's inner circle while in Moscow. You have to ask why he would meet with Igor Diveykin, who is believed by U.S. officials 'to have responsibility for intelligence collected by Russian agencies about the U.S. election.' This comes as Russian hackers continue their attempts to influence the outcome of our elections, something Trump openly invited. This is serious business and voters deserve the facts before election day.\n\"Just one day after we learned about Trump's hundreds of millions of dollars in undisclosed Russian business interests, this report suggests Page met with a sanctioned top Russian official to discuss the possibility of ending U.S. sanctions against Russia under a Trump presidency – an action that could directly enrich both Trump and Page while undermining American interests. This is precisely what more than fifty national security experts warned against when they called on Trump to disclose and divest his conflict-laden foreign assets that could endanger our national security.\n\"We've never seen anything like this in American politics. Every day seems to cast new doubts on what's truly driving Donald Trump's decision-making: the interests of the American people or his own bottom line. He needs to immediately disclose the full extent of his business relationships and foreign assets so the voters can make that determination for themselves.\"\nFull story is below.\nU.S. intel officials probe ties between Trump adviser and Kremlin\nYahoo News\nBy Michael Isikoff\nSeptember 23, 2016\nU.S. intelligence officials are seeking to determine whether an American businessman identified by Donald Trump as one of his foreign policy advisers has opened up private communications with senior Russian officials — including talks about the possible lifting of economic sanctions if the Republican nominee becomes president, according to multiple sources who have been briefed on the issue.\nThe activities of Trump adviser Carter Page, who has extensive business interests in Russia, have been discussed with senior members of Congress during recent briefings about suspected efforts by Moscow to influence the presidential election, the sources said. After one of those briefings, Senate minority leader Harry Reid wrote FBI Director James Comey, citing reports of meetings between a Trump adviser (a reference to Page) and \"high ranking sanctioned individuals\" in Moscow over the summer as evidence of \"significant and disturbing ties\" between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin that needed to be investigated by the bureau.\nSome of those briefed were \"taken aback\" when they learned about Page's contacts in Moscow, viewing them as a possible back channel to the Russians that could undercut U.S. foreign policy, said a congressional source familiar with the briefings but who asked for anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject. The source added that U.S. officials in the briefings indicated that intelligence reports about the adviser's talks with senior Russian officials close to President Vladimir Putin were being \"actively monitored and investigated.\"\nA senior U.S. law enforcement official did not dispute that characterization when asked for comment by Yahoo News. \"It's on our radar screen,\" said the official about Page's contacts with Russian officials. \"It's being looked at.\"\nPage is a former Merrill Lynch investment banker in Moscow who now runs a New York consulting firm, Global Energy Capital, located around the corner from Trump Tower, that specializes in oil and gas deals in Russia and other Central Asian countries. He declined repeated requests to comment for this story.\nTrump first mentioned Page's name when asked to identify his \"foreign policy team\" during an interview with the Washington Post editorial team last March. Describing him then only as a \"PhD,\" Trump named Page as among five advisers \"that we are dealing with.\" But his precise role in the campaign remains unclear; Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks last month called him an \"informal foreign adviser\" who \"does not speak for Mr. Trump or the campaign.\" Asked this week by Yahoo News, Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller said Page \"has no role\" and added: \"We are not aware of any of his activities, past or present.\" Miller did not respond when asked why Trump had previously described Page as one of his advisers.\nThe questions about Page come amid mounting concerns within the U.S. intelligence community about Russian cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee and state election databases in Arizona and Illinois. In a rare public talk this week, former undersecretary of defense for intelligence Mike Vickers said that the Russian cyberattacks constituted meddling in the U.S. election and were \"beyond the pale.\" Also, this week, two senior Democrats — Sen. Dianne Feinstein, ranking minority member on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Rep. Adam Schiff, ranking minority member on the House Intelligence Committee — released a joint statement that went further then what U.S. officials had publicly said about the matter.\n\"Based on briefings we have received, we have concluded that the Russian intelligence agencies are making a serious and concerted effort to influence the U.S. election,\" they said. \"At the least, this effort is intended to sow doubt about the security of our election and may well be intended to influence the outcomes of the election.\" They added that \"orders for the Russian intelligence agencies to conduct such actions could come only from very senior levels of the Russian government.\"\nPage came to the attention of officials at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow several years ago when he showed up in the Russian capital during several business trips and made provocative public comments critical of U.S. policy and sympathetic to Putin. \"He was pretty much a brazen apologist for anything Moscow did,\" said one U.S. official who served in Russia at the time.\nHe hasn't been shy about expressing those views in the U.S. as well. Last March, shorty after he was named by Trump as one of his advisers, Page told Bloomberg News he had been an adviser to, and investor in, Gazprom, the Russian state-owned gas company. He then blamed Obama administration sanctions — imposed as a response to the Russian annexation of Crimea — for driving down the company's stock. \"So many people who I know and have worked with have been so adversely affected by the sanctions policy,\" Page said in the interview. \"There's a lot of excitement in terms of the possibilities for creating a better situation.\"\nPage showed up again in Moscow in early July, just two weeks before the Republican National Convention formally nominated Trump for president, and once again criticized U.S. policy. Speaking at a commencement address for the New Economic School, an institution funded in part by major Russian oligarchs close to Putin, Page asserted that \"Washington and other West capitals\" had impeded progress in Russia \"through their often hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change.\"\nAt the time, Page declined to say whether he was meeting with Russian officials during his trip, according to a Reuters report.\nBut U.S. officials have since received intelligence reports that during that same three-day trip, Page met with Igor Sechin, a longtime Putin associate and former Russian deputy prime minister who is now the executive chairman of Rosneft, Russian's leading oil company, a well-placed Western intelligence source tells Yahoo News. That meeting, if confirmed, is viewed as especially problematic by U.S. officials because the Treasury Department in August 2014 named Sechin to a list of Russian officials and businessmen sanctioned over Russia's \"illegitimate and unlawful actions in the Ukraine.\" (The Treasury announcement described Sechin as \"utterly loyal to Vladimir Putin — a key component to his current standing.\" At their alleged meeting, Sechin raised the issue of the lifting of sanctions with Page,\" the Western intelligence source said.\nU.S. intelligence agencies have also received reports that Page met with another top Putin aide while in Moscow — Igor Diveykin. A former Russian security official, Diveykin now serves as deputy chief for internal policy and is believed by U.S. officials to have responsibility for intelligence collected by Russian agencies about the U.S. election, the Western intelligence source said.", "timestamp": "2016-09-23", "title": "Hillary for America Statement on Bombshell Report About Trump Aide's Chilling Ties To Kremlin"}

This is an exceptionally good-looking group. [Laughter] And there are just so many friends here that it feels like one of our house parties—[laughter]—but there's no dancing this afternoon. We're here just to acknowledge what an extraordinary achievement has been accomplished by Mr. Lonnie Bunch and everybody who helped make this day possible.\nNow, I want to just talk about Lonnie for a second. When Lonnie first came here from Chicago to start work on this museum a decade ago, he could not even find somebody to give him a key to his office. [Laughter] Nobody had heard of this museum. And now you cannot miss it.\nAudience members. Yes!\nThe President. A breathtaking new building right in the heart of the National Mall and that is what we call progress.\nAudience member. Yes!\nThe President. It could not have been done without the persistence, the wisdom, the dedication, the savvy, the ability to make people feel guilty—[laughter]—the begging, the deal-making, and just the general street smarts of Lonnie——\nAudience member. That's right.\nThe President. ——and his entire team. So please give him a big round of applause for all the work that he has done.\nBut of course, this is also about more than Lonnie. This is about people who for more than a century, advocated and organized and raised funds and donated artifacts so that the story of the African American experience could take its rightful place in our national memory. It's a story that is full of tragedy and setbacks, but also great joy and great victories. And it is a story that is not just part of the past, but it is alive and well today in every corner of America. And that's certainly true today in this house, a house that was built by slaves.\nAudience members. Yes. Yes.\nThe President. Now, I can't name everybody that is here, but I'm going to have to give you a little bit of a taste. This room is like a living museum of its own. Right now Madame Tussauds would be very jealous. [Laughter]\nWe've got icons of the entertainment industry like Quincy Jones and Dick Gregory and Phylicia Rashad.\nAudience members. Yes!\nThe President. We've got the first Black woman in space, Mae Jemison. And we have the woman who owns the universe, Oprah Winfrey. [Laughter]\nWe've got those drum majors for justice, like John Lewis. Audience members. Yes!\nThe President. And Andrew Young.\nAudience members. Yes!\nThe President. And C.T. Vivian.\nAudience member. There you go!\nThe President. And Jesse Jackson.\nAudience members. Yes!\nThe President. And we've got the next generation of warriors for justice, like Brittany Packnett and DeRay Mckesson.\nWe've got personal heroes of mine like Harry Belafonte, who still is the best looking man in the room at 90-something years old. [Laughter] I'm just telling the truth. [Laughter]\nSo this is an extraordinary group. But the thing about this museum is that it's more about—it's more than just telling stories about the famous. It's not just about the icons. There is plenty of space for Harriet Tubman and Dr. King and Muhammed Ali. But what makes the museum so powerful and so visceral is that it's the story of all of us.\nAudience members. Yes!\nThe President. The folks whose names you never heard of, but whose contributions, day after day, decade after decade, combined to push us forward and the entire Nation forward.\nIt's the maids who decided, you know what, I'm tired of segregation, and I'm going to walk for my freedom. It's the porters who not only worked tirelessly to support their families, but ultimately helped bring about the organization that led to better working conditions for all Americans here in the United States. It's about our moms and grandparents and uncles and aunts who just did the right thing and raised great families, despite assaults on their dignity on every single day.\nYou see it in the dignity of the artifacts that are in the museum: the dignity of an enslaved family, what it must have been like to try to live in that tiny cabin; those slaves who dared to marry, even though it was illegal for them to do so; folks who were forced to sit in the back of a train, but went about their business anyway and tried to instill in their children a sense that this isn't who we are and there's going to be more someday.\nYou see it in the men and the women who rushed to the warfronts to secure all of our freedom, understanding that when they came home they might not yet be free; the students who walked passed angry crowds to integrate our schools; the families huddling around a Bible to steel their faith for the challenges ahead; that quiet, determined dignity and hope.\nEverybody here has somebody in mind when we think of those kinds of folks, who couldn't make it to this room, but whose stories are our stories——\nAudience member. Yes.\nThe President. ——and whose stories are represented at this museum. It might be an ancestor who ran to freedom or an aunt or uncle who pushed back against Jim Crow or a friend who marched or sat in. Or it might be young people who were organizing against cynicism today. But the point is that all of us cannot forget that the only reason that we're standing here is because somebody somewhere stood up for us: stood up when it was risky, stood up when it was not popular. And somehow, standing up together managed to change the world.\nYou know, the timing of this is fascinating—[laughter].\nAudience member. Yes.\nThe President. ——because in so many ways, it is the best of times, but in many ways, these are also troubled times.\nAudience member. Yes.\nAudience member. Yes, it is. Yes.\nThe President. History doesn't always move in a straight line.\nAudience member. That's right.\nThe President. And without vigilance, we can go backwards as well as forwards.\nAudience members. That's right. That's right.\nThe President. And so part of the reason that I am so happy the museum is opening this weekend is because it allows all of us as Americans to put our current circumstances——\nAudience member. Yes.\nThe President. ——in a historical context.\nAudience members. That's right. Yes! Yes!\nThe President. My hope is that as people are seeing what's happened in Tulsa or Charlotte on television and perhaps are less familiar with not only the history of the African American experience, but also how recent some of these challenges have been, upon visiting the museum, may step back and say, I understand.\nAudience member. Yes.\nThe President. I sympathize. I empathize. I can see why folks might feel angry, and I want to be part of the solution——\nAudience member. Yes!\nThe President. ——as opposed to resisting change.\nAudience member. That's right.\nThe President. My hope is that Black folks watching those same images on television, and then seeing the history represented at this museum, can say to themselves, the struggles we're going through today are connected to the past, and yet all that progress we've made tells me that I cannot and will not sink into despair.\nAudience members. Yes!\nThe President. Because if we join hands, and if we do things right, if we maintain our dignity, and we continue to appeal to the better angels of this Nation, progress will be made.\nI was telling Michelle—many of you know I get 10 letters a day from constituents, and it's a great way for me to keep a pulse on how folks other than the pundits on cable TV are thinking. [Laughter] And it's a—I know it's a representative group because sometimes people say, Mr. President, we just love you, and we especially love Michelle. [Laughter] And you're doing such a great job and thank you. And then, there are others who write and say, Mr. President, you're an idiot—[laughter]—and you've ruined this country. And so I know I'm getting a real—[laughter]—sampling of American public opinion.\nLast night, as I was reading through my letters, I'd say about half of them said, Mr. President, why are you always against police? And why aren't you doing enough to deal with these rioters and the violence? And then, the other half were with some Black folks saying, Mr. President, why aren't you doing something about the police? [Laughter] And when are we actually going to get justice?\nAnd I understand the nature of that argument because this is a dialogue we've been having for 400 years.\nAudience members. Yes! Tell the truth!\nThe President. And the fact of the matter is, is that one of the challenges we have in generating a constructive discussion about how to solve these problems is because what people see on television and what they hear on the radio is bereft of context and ignores history.\nAudience member. Yes!\nThe President. And so people are just responding as if none of what's represented in this museum ever happened. And that's true for all of us, not just some of us.\nAnd so when I imagine children—White, Black, Latino, Asian, Native American—wandering through that museum and sitting at that lunch counter and imagining what it would be like to stand on that auction block——\nAudience member. Oh, yes!\nThe President. ——and then also looking at Shaq's shoes—[laughter]—and Chuck Berry's red Cadillac—[laughter]—my hope is, is that this complicated, difficult, sometimes harrowing, but I believe ultimately triumphant, story will help us talk to each other.\nAudience member. That's right!\nThe President. And more important, listen to each other, and even more important, see each other——\nAudience members. Yes! Yes!\nThe President. ——and recognize the common humanity that makes America what it is.\nSo that's a lot of weight to put on one institution.\n[At this point, the First Lady patted National Museum of African American History and Culture Director Lonnie G. Bunch's shoulder.]\nThe First Lady. But you can do it. [Laughter]\nThe President. But Michelle and I, having taken Michelle's mom and our daughters to see it, we feel confident that it will not just meet expectations, but far exceed them. And it would not have happened without all of you, so you should be very, very proud.\nCongratulations. God bless you. God bless America.

Whether for sport, sustenance, or both, these activities provide opportunities for Americans to connect with those around them—from tribal elders sharing sacred practices to parents spending time outdoors with their children. On this day, as we celebrate America's hunters and fishers for the ways in which they have strengthened our communities, we also honor their call to serve as good stewards of our lands and waters.\nAnglers and hunters were some of the earliest conservation leaders, and they remain key partners in safeguarding the important recreational opportunities provided by our unparalleled natural spaces. Caring for our environment is critical for supporting hunting and fishing, and today we recognize the growing urgency of conserving our Nation's lands, waters, and ecosystems so that more Americans can enjoy all they have to offer. That is why I continue to call on the Congress to permanently fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which has helped create new opportunities for hunting and fishing.\nOutdoor areas across America are renowned for their beauty and for the wealth of recreational activities they support. To secure this legacy, my Administration has protected more acres of public lands and waters than any other in our Nation's history—and this past summer, I established the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument, which preserves access to hunting. And at national wildlife refuges, in forests, and on public and private lands throughout our country, we have expanded opportunities for Americans to hunt, fish, and reconnect with nature.\nHunting and fishing strengthen local economies, provide sustenance, and help Americans experience the outdoors. By enriching our communities and bringing people together, hunters and anglers have carried forward traditions dating back to long before our Nation's founding. On National Hunting and Fishing Day, we recognize the majestic landscapes that make these activities possible for Americans around our country. As we acknowledge the important cultural heritage surrounding hunting and fishing, let us vow to protect our Nation's remarkable outdoor spaces for generations to come.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 24, 2016, as National Hunting and Fishing Day. I invite all Americans to observe this day with appropriate activities in our great outdoors.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-09-23", "title": "Proclamation 9500—National Hunting and Fishing Day, 2016"}

On National Public Lands Day, Americans from coast-to-coast celebrate these spaces by participating in the largest single-day volunteer effort to restore and enhance the lands we all enjoy. Volunteers will remove litter and invasive plant species, blaze new trails and maintain existing ones, and plant seeds that will grow in the years to come—taking full advantage of the chance to give back to the lands that have given us all so much.\nOur public lands reflect our shared history, and enable us to connect to each other and to something bigger than ourselves. National Parks, forests, wildlife refuges, conservation lands, and marine sanctuaries not only strengthen our economy through tourism and provide endless recreational and educational opportunities, but are also home to important biodiversity and rich ecosystems. I am proud that my Administration has protected hundreds of millions of acres of these vital lands and waters—more than any Administration in history. Through the America's Great Outdoors Initiative, we have also promoted innovative, community-level efforts to conserve outdoor spaces and reconnect Americans with nature. And through the 21st Century Conservation Corps, we have worked to inspire millions of young adults and veterans to engage in hands-on service in the great outdoors.\nOn National Public Lands Day, all federally managed public lands and waters are offering free admission so Americans can observe this day not just by caring for these spaces, but by enjoying their vast wonders. To ensure more young people can discover our great outdoors, my \"Every Kid in a Park\" initiative is again giving fourth grade students and their families free access to all National Parks and other Federal lands for an entire year. And as the National Park Service celebrates 100 years of preserving and protecting these important spaces, we are encouraging more Americans to \"Find Your Park\" and explore the extraordinary parks and public lands in their communities.\nAs stewards of our environment and caretakers of these public lands, we must build on our legacy of conservation. Climate change poses the single biggest threat to our natural resources. Across our country, we are experiencing stronger storms, harsher droughts, increased flooding, and longer wildfire seasons that put these public spaces at risk—which is why any effort to fully combat climate change must include protecting our land, water, and wildlife. Let us rededicate ourselves to this critical work and continue looking after these natural treasures and protecting our historic and cultural heritage for generations to come.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 24, 2016, as National Public Lands Day. I encourage all Americans to participate in a day of public service for our lands.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-09-23", "title": "Proclamation 9501—National Public Lands Day, 2016"}

From the deafening sounds of combat to the silence of the sacred hills at Arlington, we remember the countless sacrifices our service members make to preserve the freedoms we too often take for granted. No one understands the true price of these freedoms like our Gold Star families, whose humility, even in times of grief, represents the best of our country. Today, we recognize their sacrifices by listening to their stories, sharing in their pain and pride, and pledging to do all we can to honor them and the loved ones they hold close in their hearts.\nThrough unspeakable sorrow, our Gold Star families suffer from loss that can never be restored—pain that can never truly be healed. It is because of their selfless character and unfailing grace that Americans can come home each day, gather with family and friends, and live in peace and security. And though the debt our fallen soldiers and their families pay is one we can never fully pay back, we must continue to support our veterans when they come home and stand by our military families who endure unthinkable loss. We must maintain the sacred covenant we share with our veterans by ensuring they have the care and benefits they deserve, and as citizens, we must all work to lift each other up in a manner that is worthy of those who laid down their lives to protect the land and freedoms we cherish.\nLess than one percent of our Nation wear the uniform, but all of us have an obligation to acknowledge the losses endured by Gold Star Mothers and Families and to fill the painful absence of their loved ones with our profound gratitude. We must strive to support these families—not just with words, but with actions—by being there every day for the parents, spouses, and children who feel the weight of their loss. On this day of remembrance, may we carry forward the work of those who gave their last full measure of devotion and vow to keep their memories burning bright in our hearts. And may we lift up their families, who have steadfastly supported their mission through immeasurable heartbreak, by remaining a Nation worthy of their sacrifice.\nThe Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 115 of June 23, 1936 (49 Stat. 1985 as amended), has designated the last Sunday in September as \"Gold Star Mother's Day.\"\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 25, 2016, as Gold Star Mother's and Family's Day. I call upon all Government officials to display the flag of the United States over Government buildings on this special day. I also encourage the American people to display the flag and hold appropriate ceremonies as a public expression of our Nation's gratitude and respect for our Gold Star Mothers and Families.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-09-23", "title": "Proclamation 9502—Gold Star Mother's and Family's Day, 2016"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118950", "text": "To the Senate of the United States:\nI am returning herewith without my approval S. 2040, the \"Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act\" (JASTA), which would, among other things, remove sovereign immunity in U.S. courts from foreign governments that are not designated state sponsors of terrorism.\nI have deep sympathy for the families of the victims of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 (9/11), who have suffered grievously. I also have a deep appreciation of these families' desire to pursue justice and am strongly committed to assisting them in their efforts.\nConsistent with this commitment, over the past 8 years, I have directed my Administration to pursue relentlessly al-Qa'ida, the terrorist group that planned the 9/11 attacks. The heroic efforts of our military and counterterrorism professionals have decimated al-Qa'ida's leadership and killed Osama bin Laden. My Administration also strongly supported, and I signed into law, legislation which ensured that those who bravely responded on that terrible day and other survivors of the attacks will be able to receive treatment for any injuries resulting from the attacks. And my Administration also directed the Intelligence Community to perform a declassification review of \"Part Four of the Joint Congressional Inquiry into Intelligence Community Activities Before and After the Terrorist Attacks of September 11,\" so that the families of 9/11 victims and broader public can better understand the information investigators gathered following that dark day of our history.\nNotwithstanding these significant efforts, I recognize that there is nothing that could ever erase the grief the 9/11 families have endured. My Administration therefore remains resolute in its commitment to assist these families in their pursuit of justice and do whatever we can to prevent another attack in the United States. Enacting JASTA into law, however, would neither protect Americans from terrorist attacks nor improve the effectiveness of our response to such attacks. As drafted, JASTA would allow private litigation against foreign governments in U.S. courts based on allegations that such foreign governments' actions abroad made them responsible for terrorism-related injuries on U.S. soil. This legislation would permit litigation against countries that have neither been designated by the executive branch as state sponsors of terrorism nor taken direct actions in the United States to carry out an attack here. The JASTA would be detrimental to U.S. national interests more broadly, which is why I am returning it without my approval.\nFirst, JASTA threatens to reduce the effectiveness of our response to indications that a foreign government has taken steps outside our borders to provide support for terrorism, by taking such matters out of the hands of national security and foreign policy professionals and placing them in the hands of private litigants and courts.\nAny indication that a foreign government played a role in a terrorist attack on U.S. soil is a matter of deep concern and merits a forceful, unified Federal Government response that considers the wide range of important and effective tools available. One of these tools is designating the foreign government in question as a state sponsor of terrorism, which carries with it a litany of repercussions, including the foreign government being stripped of its sovereign immunity before U.S. courts in certain terrorism-related cases and subjected to a range of sanctions. Given these serious consequences, state sponsor of terrorism designations are made only after national security, foreign policy, and intelligence professionals carefully review all available information to determine whether a country meets the criteria that the Congress established.\nIn contrast, JASTA departs from longstanding standards and practice under our Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and threatens to strip all foreign governments of immunity from judicial process in the United States based solely upon allegations by private litigants that a foreign government's overseas conduct had some role or connection to a group or person that carried out a terrorist attack inside the United States. This would invite consequential decisions to be made based upon incomplete information and risk having different courts reaching different conclusions about the culpability of individual foreign governments and their role in terrorist activities directed against the United States—which is neither an effective nor a coordinated way for us to respond to indications that a foreign government might have been behind a terrorist attack.\nSecond, JASTA would upset longstanding international principles regarding sovereign immunity, putting in place rules that, if applied globally, could have serious implications for U.S. national interests. The United States has a larger international presence, by far, than any other country, and sovereign immunity principles protect our Nation and its Armed Forces, officials, and assistance professionals, from foreign court proceedings. These principles also protect U.S. Government assets from attempted seizure by private litigants abroad. Removing sovereign immunity in U.S. courts from foreign governments that are not designated as state sponsors of terrorism, based solely on allegations that such foreign governments' actions abroad had a connection to terrorism-related injuries on U.S. soil, threatens to undermine these longstanding principles that protect the United States, our forces, and our personnel.\nIndeed, reciprocity plays a substantial role in foreign relations, and numerous other countries already have laws that allow for the adjustment of a foreign state's immunities based on the treatment their governments receive in the courts of the other state. Enactment of JASTA could encourage foreign governments to act reciprocally and allow their domestic courts to exercise jurisdiction over the United States or U.S. officials—including our men and women in uniform—for allegedly causing injuries overseas via U.S. support to third parties. This could lead to suits against the United States or U.S. officials for actions taken by members of an armed group that received U.S. assistance, misuse of U.S. military equipment by foreign forces, or abuses committed by police units that received U.S. training, even if the allegations at issue ultimately would be without merit. And if any of these litigants were to win judgments—based on foreign domestic laws as applied by foreign courts—they would begin to look to the assets of the U.S. Government held abroad to satisfy those judgments, with potentially serious financial consequences for the United States.\nThird, JASTA threatens to create complications in our relationships with even our closest partners. If JASTA were enacted, courts could potentially consider even minimal allegations accusing U.S. allies or partners of complicity in a particular terrorist attack in the United States to be sufficient to open the door to litigation and wide-ranging discovery against a foreign country—for example, the country where an individual who later committed a terrorist act traveled from or became radicalized. A number of our allies and partners have already contacted us with serious concerns about the bill. By exposing these allies and partners to this sort of litigation in U.S. courts, JASTA threatens to limit their cooperation on key national security issues, including counterterrorism initiatives, at a crucial time when we are trying to build coalitions, not create divisions.\nThe 9/11 attacks were the worst act of terrorism on U.S. soil, and they were met with an unprecedented U.S. Government response. The United States has taken robust and wide-ranging actions to provide justice for the victims of the 9/11 attacks and keep Americans safe, from providing financial compensation for victims and their families to conducting worldwide counterterrorism programs to bringing criminal charges against culpable individuals. I have continued and expanded upon these efforts, both to help victims of terrorism gain justice for the loss and suffering of their loved ones and to protect the United States from future attacks. The JASTA, however, does not contribute to these goals, does not enhance the safety of Americans from terrorist attacks, and undermines core U.S. interests.\nFor these reasons, I must veto the bill.\nBARACK OBAMA\nThe White House,\nSeptember 23, 2016.", "timestamp": "2016-09-23", "title": "Message to the Senate Returning Without Approval the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act"}

It's wonderful to be here in Virginia, a state where I have so many great friends and wonderful employees.\nTremendous polls keep coming in. A brand new Rasmussen poll has us up 5 points nationwide.\nOn November 8th, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.\nWe are going to take on the big donors, and big business, and big media – we are going to take on the rigged system that has shipped America's wealth to other countries.\nWe are going to replace our failed and corrupt establishment with a new government that serves you, your family, and your country.\nMy economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.\nWe will cut taxes for all working and middle-class households in America.\nWe will reduce regulations, which will put more money into the hands of our poorest workers and bring thousands of new companies to our shores.\nWe will unleash American energy, creating millions of new jobs and lowering energy costs. The Obama-Clinton energy restrictions are nothing more than a massive tax on the poor – we will remove those restrictions day one.\nWe will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare.\nPresident Obama promised his plan would reduce premiums by $2,500 dollars. Instead, they surged $5,000.\nOur replacement plan includes expanded access to Healthcare Savings Accounts, with support for those who need it. It includes allowing Americans to buy health insurance across state lines in all 50 states, creating a dynamic and competitive new market – they will be competing for your business.\nWe're also going to block grant Medicaid so states can develop innovative solutions to make sure no citizen in poverty ever falls through the cracks. High-risk pools will also help to ensure that those with pre-existing conditions will always get the quality coverage they need.\nOn trade, we are going to end the international abuse, the foreign cheating, and the one-sided rules that govern NAFTA and the World Trade Organization. Right now, America eliminates its tariffs, but then other countries tax our goods with backdoor tariffs and close their markets.\nOur massive, chronic trade deficits are destroying the middle class – and shifting money away from workers to large corporations who have no borders. There's a reason hedge funds and Wall Street are giving tens of millions to my opponent.\nHillary Clinton is the voice for the global special interests.\nI am running to be the voice of the forgotten men and women.\nMy opponent likes to say that for decades, she has been \"fighting for women.\" That she has been \"fighting for children.\"\nWhy then are 70 million American women and children living in poverty, or on the brink of poverty? Why has she provided no relief for the millions of Americans in search of affordable, reliable quality childcare? You know the old saying, \"Watch what I do, not what I say.\"\nAt the Trump Organization, and in my campaign for President, women occupy some of the highest positions. I have employed thousands of women in my company. Women of different backgrounds. Women of many talents.\nAnd just last week, joined by my daughter, Ivanka, I laid out my plan for childcare and eldercare. That plan has many great features, including tax-free childcare savings accounts. Low-income parents are given tax credits they can put straight into those accounts, and then get a $500 dollar per child match for those savings accounts deposits.\nFamilies can also deduct the cost of childcare from their taxes, a huge tax cut for the middle class.\nWe have also talked about improving education. My plan includes school choice for every disadvantaged child in America.\nWe are also going to bring down the cost of college.\nUniversities get massive federal funds, and huge tax breaks for their endowments – but then they don't spend those funds or those endowments on their students. I will work with Congress to make sure these special federal benefits are not available unless universities begin to reduce tuition and student debt. This will get to the problem at the source, and reduce both the cost for students and the cost for taxpayers. Our students are drowning and we're going to fix it.\nWomen also value security. They want a Commander-in-Chief that will defeat radical Islamic terrorism, stop the massive inflow of refugees, protect our borders, and who will reduce the rising crime and violence in our cities.\nAs I campaign across this country, I hear so many stories and pleas, from women especially, about drug addiction and opioid use. They are doing their best in their communities and for their families to provide a safe and nurturing environment.\nBut even the best-laid plans cannot always protect our youth, and increasingly, many adults, from the scourge of drugs. We lose thousands of our fellow Americans every year to opioid use. I will stop the drug inflow from our borders. These drugs come over the border and make their way into our urban and rural communities, and into our suburbs.\nThis must change. Every change starts with a conversation. Together, we will have this conversation. And we will make this change.\nThe changes will start immediately.\nHere, in Virginia, we are going to end the war on American energy. Hillary Clinton says she wants to put the miners out of work. Clinton and Kaine also want to shut down shale, and shut down natural gas. The Clinton regulatory agenda will drive up electricity prices for Virginia families and will cost the U.S. economy over $5 trillion.\nBy the way, less than a week after taking office, Tim Kaine proposed a $4 billion dollar tax hike in Virginia, including on people earning as little as $17,000 dollars a year.\nWe are going to open up all sources of American energy and bring jobs, wealth, and cheaper electricity to Virginia.\nAnother major part of our agenda is safety.\nI believe every family in America is entitled to live in safety and peace.\nToday, the nation just opened the Smithsonian National Museum of African-American History and Culture. We congratulate and honor those involved with the project, and recognize today the incredible contributions of the African-American community to this nation.\nAfrican-Americans have given so much to this nation and sacrificed so much for this nation.\nMany African-Americans are succeeding so greatly in our country, and I will make sure their success is protected and supported.\nAt the same time, too many African-Americans have been left behind and trapped in poverty.\nI will fight to make sure every single African-American child in this country is fully included in the American Dream.\nThat includes the new civil rights issue of our time: School Choice.\nDemocrats have run the inner cities for half a century or more, and produced only more joblessness and poverty.\nThe jobs are leaving, the schools are failing, and crime is rising.\nTo those suffering, I say: Vote for Donald Trump. What do you have to lose? I will fix it. I will fight harder for you than anyone has before.\nThe policies of Hillary Clinton have brought only suffering in our inner cities – just like her bad judgment overseas unleashed suffering everywhere she went.\nOf course, she got rich through it all – the Clintons made another $60 million in gross income while she was Secretary of State.\nWorst of all, she put her public office up for sale – and then bleached her emails, and destroyed her phones, to try to cover her tracks following a congressional subpoena.\nThere's a reason the hedge fund managers are donating to Hillary Clinton's campaign – and not mine. Everybody getting rich off the rigged system, and who wants nothing to change, are throwing their money at Hillary Clinton.\nMy campaign is powered by my own money, and by small dollar donations from everyday patriotic citizens.\n95% of our donors are small dollar donations. Every dollar helps us deliver your country back to you.\nOur campaign is about breaking up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives. They're all part of the same political establishment.\nThey go to the same restaurants, they attend the same conferences, they have the same friends and connections. They all support the same ideology of globalism that makes them rich while shipping your jobs, your factories, and your wealth to other countries.\nI am not running to be President of the World. I am running to be President of the United States. I Am For America – and America First.\nTogether, we will rebuild this country beyond our greatest dreams.\nGovernment will start working again. Fixing things is what I do. Just look at my projects in New York, where I turned rundown spaces into new centers of business, activity and opportunity – where others saw only problems, I saw only potential.\nWe turned empty lots into homes, offices and living memories for thousands of workers and families.\nThat's what I want to do for our country – I want to go into the neglected neighborhoods, the failing schools, the forgotten stretches of this nation, and unlock their potential for all of our people.\nI've made a living for years looking at unused spaces and imagining what they could be. Politicians look at blighted neighborhoods and offer only excuses – I look at those same neighborhoods and offer solutions.\nWe spend so much time thinking about how things used to be, we've stopped thinking about how great things could be – all we have to do is tune out the doubters, the cynics, and the naysayers.\nWe are a nation of strivers, dreamers, and believers – and that's the spirit that will carry us to victory in November, and to great victories as a nation.\nIt's that same spirit of resilience I have seen visiting the flood-ravaged towns in Louisiana, or meeting with the incredible but hard-hit people in cities and towns like Flint, Michigan.\nIt used to be the cars were made in Flint, and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Today, cars are made in Mexico, and you can't drink the water in Flint. We'll turn it all around.\nBut that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th.\nYou have to knock on doors. You have to pick up that phone. Go to our website to learn more. You have to campaign on the streets. Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country. To beat the system, you have to lift your voice, pound the pavement, and get out the vote.\nYou have 44 days until the big vote. You have 44 days to make possible every dream you ever dreamed of for your country.\nYou have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman, and child in this nation.\nThe arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.\nThis November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back – Bigger and Better and Stronger than Ever Before.\nHere is just some of what will happen starting in January of 2017:\nI am going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; unleash American energy; end illegal immigration – and yes we will build the wall [Mexico will pay]; save the 2nd amendment, and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\nWe will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools, and hospitals.\nAmerican cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.\nAmerican steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.\nAnd we will put our great miners and steelworkers back to work.\nAmerican hands will rebuild this nation – and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.\nWe will put new American steel into the spine of this country.\nI will fight for every neglected part of this nation – and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\nIt is time to break with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.\nHillary Clinton has a 3-word campaign pledge. It reads: \"I'm With Her.\"\nI have a different pledge: I'm With You – the American People.\nTo all of our people, in all of our cities and towns, I say these words to you tonight: I'm with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you.\nOnce more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.\nWe Will Make America Wealthy Again.\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\nThank you, and God Bless!", "timestamp": "2016-09-24", "title": "Remarks at a Rally at Berglund Center in Roanoke, Virginia"}

This weekend, we'll dedicate the newest American icon on our National Mall: the National Museum of African American History and Culture. It's a beautiful building, five stories high and some 70 feet below the ground, situated just across the street from the Washington Monument.\nAnd this museum tells a story of America that hasn't always taken a front seat in our national narrative. As a people, we've rightfully passed on the tales of the giants who built this country. But too often, willful or not, we've chosen to gloss over or ignore entirely the experience of millions upon millions of others.\nBut this museum chooses to tell a fuller story. It's doesn't gauze up some bygone era or avoid uncomfortable truths. Rather, it embraces the patriotic recognition that America is a constant work in progress; that each successive generation can look upon our imperfections and decide that it is within our collective power to align this Nation with the high ideals of our founding.\nThat's what you'll see inside. You'll see it in the shackles of an enslaved child and in the hope of Harriet Tubman's gospel hymnal. You'll see it in the tragedy of Emmett Till's coffin and in the resilience of a lunch counter stool and the triumph of a Tuskegee airplane. You'll see it in the shadow of a prison guard tower and in the defiance of Jesse Owens's cleats and in the American pride of Colin Powell's uniform.\nAll of that isn't simply the African-American story, it's part of the American story. And so it is entirely fitting that we tell this story on our National Mall, the same place we tell the stories of Washington and Jefferson and our independence; the story of Lincoln who saved our Union and the GIs who defended it; the story of King who summoned us all toward the mountaintop.\nThat's what we'll celebrate not just this weekend, but in the years and generations ahead: a fuller account of our glorious American story. It's a chance to reflect on our past and set a course for the future. Because here in this country, all of us, no matter what our station in life, have the chance to pick up the pen and write our own chapter for our time.\nThanks, everybody, and have a great weekend.", "timestamp": "2016-09-24", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}

Butts III, president, State University of New York at Old Westbury, and pastor, Abyssinian Baptist Church in New York City; civil rights activist Ruby Bridges Hall; former Secretary of State Colin L.

Jemison; musician Aretha Franklin; and Washington, DC, resident Ruth Odom Bonner and her great-granddaughter Christine.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119041", "text": "James Baldwin once wrote, \"For while the tale of how we suffer, and how we are delighted, and how we may triumph is never new, it always must be heard.\" For while the tale of how we suffer, and how we are delighted, and how we may triumph is never new, it always must be heard.\nToday, as so many generations have before, we gather on our National Mall to tell an essential part of our American story, one that has at times been overlooked. We come not just for today, but for all time.\nPresident and Mrs. Bush; President Clinton; Vice President and Dr. Biden; Chief Justice Roberts; Secretary Skorton; Reverend Butts; distinguished guests: Thank you. Thank you for your leadership in making sure this tale is told. We're here in part because of you and because of all those Americans—the Civil War vets, the civil rights foot soldiers, the champions of this effort on Capitol Hill—who, for more than a century, kept the dream of this museum alive.\nIt includes our leaders in Congress, Paul Ryan and Nancy Pelosi. It includes one of my heroes, John Lewis, who, as he has so often, took the torch from those who came before him and brought us past the finish line. It includes the philanthropists and benefactors and advisory members who have so generously given not only their money, but their time. It includes the Americans who offered up all the family keepsakes tucked away in grandma's attic. And of course, it includes a man without whose vision and passion and persistence we would not be here today: Mr. Lonnie Bunch.\nWhat we can see of this building—the towering glass, the artistry of the metalwork—is surely a sight to behold. But beyond the majesty of the building, what makes this occasion so special is the larger story it contains. Below us, this building reaches down 70 feet, its roots spreading far wider and deeper than any tree on this Mall. And on its lowest level, after you walk past remnants of a slave ship, after you reflect on the immortal declaration that \"all men are created equal,\" you can see a block of stone. On top of this stone sits a historical marker, weathered by the ages. And that marker reads: \"General Andrew Jackson and Henry Clay spoke from this slave block . . . during the year 1830.\"\nI want you to think about this. Consider what this artifact tells us about history, about how it's told, and about what can be cast aside. On a stone where day after day, for years, men and women were torn from their spouse or their child, shackled and bound, and bought and sold, and bid like cattle; on a stone worn down by the tragedy of over a thousand bare feet—for a long time, the only thing we considered important, the singular thing we once chose to commemorate as \"history\" with a plaque were the unmemorable speeches of two powerful men.\nAnd that block, I think, explains why this museum is so necessary. Because that same object, reframed, put in context, tells us so much more. As Americans, we rightfully passed on the tales of the giants who built this country, who led armies into battle, who waged seminal debates in the halls of Congress and the corridors of power. But too often, we ignored or forgot the stories of millions upon millions of others, who built this Nation just as surely, whose humble eloquence, whose calloused hands, whose steady drive helped to create cities, erect industries, build the arsenals of democracy.\nAnd so this national museum helps to tell a richer and fuller story of who we are. It helps us better understand the lives, yes, of the President, but also the slave; the industrialist, but also the porter; the keeper of the status quo, but also of the activist seeking to overthrow that status quo; the teacher or the cook alongside the statesman. And by knowing this other story, we better understand ourselves and each other. It binds us together. It reaffirms that all of us are America; that African American history is not somehow separate from our larger American story, it's not the underside of the American story, it is central to the American story. That our glory derives not just from our most obvious triumphs, but how we've wrested triumph from tragedy, and how we've been able to remake ourselves, again and again and again, in accordance with our highest ideals.\n\"I, too, am America.\"\nThe great historian John Hope Franklin, who helped to get this museum started, once said, \"Good history is a good foundation for a better present and future.\" He understood, the best history doesn't just sit behind a glass case; it helps us to understand what's outside the case. The best history helps us recognize the mistakes that we've made and the dark corners of the human spirit that we need to guard against. And yes, a clear-eyed view of history can make us uncomfortable, and it will shake us out of familiar narratives. But it is precisely because of that discomfort that we learn and grow and harness our collective power to make this Nation more perfect.\nThat's the American story that this museum tells: one of suffering and delight; one of fear, but also of hope; of wandering in the wilderness and then seeing out on the horizon a glimmer of the Promised Land.\nIt is in this embrace of truth, as best as we can know it, in the celebration of the entire American experience, where real patriotism lies. As President Bush just said, a great nation doesn't shy from the truth. It strengthens us. It emboldens us. It should fortify us. It is an act of patriotism to understand where we've been. And this museum tells the story of so many patriots.\nYes, African Americans have felt the cold weight of shackles and the stinging lash of the field whip. But we've also dared to run north and sing songs from Harriet Tubman's hymnal. We've buttoned up our Union Blues to join the fight for our freedom. We've railed against injustice for decade upon decade, a lifetime of struggle and progress and enlightenment that we see etched in Frederick Douglass's mighty, leonine gaze.\nYes, this museum tells a story of people who felt the indignity, the small and large humiliations of a \"Whites Only\" sign, or wept at the side of Emmett Till's coffin or fell to their knees on shards of stained glass outside a church where four little girls died. But it also tells the story of the Black and White youth sitting alongside each other, straight backed, so full of dignity on those lunch counter stools; the story of 6-year-old Ruby Bridges, pigtails, fresh pressed dress, walking that gauntlet to get to school; Tuskegee Airmen soaring the skies not just to beat a dictator, but to reaffirm the promise of our democracy and remind us that all of us are created equal.\nThis is the place to understand how protest and love of country don't merely coexist, but inform each other; how men can proudly win the gold for their country, but still insist on raising a black-gloved fist; how we can wear an \"I Can't Breathe\" T-shirt and still grieve for fallen police officers. Here's the America where the razor-sharp uniform of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff belongs alongside the cape of the Godfather of Soul. [Laughter] We have shown the world that we can float like butterflies and sting like bees; that we can rocket into space like Mae Jemison, steal home like Jackie, rock like Jimi, stir the pot like Richard Pryor; or we can be sick and tired of being sick and tired, like Fannie Lou Hamer, and still \"Rock Steady\" like Aretha Franklin. [Laughter]\nWe are large, Walt Whitman told us, containing multitudes. We are large, containing multitudes. Full of contradictions. That's America. That's what makes us go. That's what makes us extraordinary. And as is true for America, so is true for the African American experience. We're not a burden on America or a stain on America or an object of pity or charity for America. We're America.\nAnd that's what this museum explains: the fact that our stories have shaped every corner of our culture. The struggles for freedom that took place made our Constitution a real and living document, tested and shaped and deepened and made more profound its meaning for all people. The story told here doesn't just belong to Black Americans; it belongs to all Americans, for the African American experience has been shaped just as much by Europeans and Asians and Native Americans and Latinos. We have informed each other. We are polyglot, a stew.\nScripture promised that if we lift up the oppressed, then our light will rise in the darkness, and our night will become like the noonday. And the story contained in this museum makes those words prophecy. And that's what this day is about. That's what this museum is about. I, too, am America. It is a glorious story, the one that's told here. It is complicated and it is messy and it is full of contradictions, as all great stories are, as Shakespeare is, as Scripture is. And it's a story that perhaps needs to be told now more than ever.\nA museum alone will not alleviate poverty in every inner city or every rural hamlet. It won't eliminate gun violence from all our neighborhoods or immediately ensure that justice is always colorblind. It won't wipe away every instance of discrimination in a job interview or a sentencing hearing or folks trying to rent an apartment. Those things are up to us, the decisions and choices we make. It requires speaking out and organizing and voting until our values are fully reflected in our laws and our policies and our communities.\nBut what this museum does show us is that even in the face of oppression, even in the face of unimaginable difficulty, America has moved forward. And so this museum provides context for the debates of our times. It illuminates them and gives us some sense of how they evolved and perhaps keeps them in proportion. Perhaps they can help a White visitor understand the pain and anger of demonstrators in places like Ferguson and Charlotte. But it can also help Black visitors appreciate the fact that not only is this younger generation carrying on traditions of the past, but within the White communities across the Nation, we see the sincerity of law enforcement officers and officials who, in fits and starts, are struggling to understand and are trying to do the right thing.\nIt reminds us that routine discrimination and Jim Crow aren't ancient history, it's just a blink in the eye of history. It was just yesterday. And so we should not be surprised that not all the healing is done. We shouldn't despair that it's not all solved. And knowing the larger story should instead remind us just how remarkable the changes that have taken place truly are—just in my lifetime—and thereby inspire us to further progress.\nAnd so, hopefully, this museum can help us talk to each other. And more importantly, listen to each other. And most importantly, see each other—Black and White and Latino and Native American and Asian American—see how our stories are bound together and bound together with women in America and workers in America and entrepreneurs in America and LGBT Americans. And for young people who didn't live through the struggles represented here, I hope you draw strength from the changes that have taken place. Come here and see the power of your own agency. See how young John Lewis was. [Laughter] These were children who transformed a nation in a blink of an eye. Young people, come here and see your ability to make your mark.\nThe very fact of this day does not prove that America is perfect, but it does validate the ideas of our founding, that this country born of change, this country born of revolution, this country of we the people, this country can get better.\nAnd that's why we celebrate, mindful that our work is not yet done; mindful that we are but on a waystation on this common journey towards freedom. And how glorious it is that we enshrine it here, on some of our Nation's most hallowed ground; the same place where lives were once traded, but also where hundreds of thousands of Americans of all colors and creeds once marched. How joyful it is that this story take its rightful place, alongside Jefferson who declared our independence and Washington who made it real and alongside Lincoln who saved our Union and the GIs who defended it, alongside a new monument to a King, gazing outward, summoning us towards that mountaintop. How righteous it is that we tell this story here.\nFor almost 8 years, I have been blessed with the extraordinary honor of serving you in this office. And time and again, I've flown low over this Mall on Marine One, often with Michelle and our daughters. And President Clinton, President Bush, Laura, they'll tell you, it is a incredible sight. We pass right across the Washington Monument; it feels like you can reach out and touch it. And at night, if you turn the other way, you don't just see the Lincoln Memorial; Old Abe is lit up, and you can see him, his spirit glowing from that building. And we don't have many trips left. But over the years, I have always been comforted as I've watched this museum rise from this earth into this remarkable tribute. Because I know that years from now, like all of you, Michelle and I will be able to come here to this museum, and not just bring our kids, but hopefully, our grandkids. I imagine holding a little hand of somebody and tell them the stories that are enshrined here.\nAnd in the years that follow, they'll be able to do the same. And then, we'll go to the Lincoln Memorial, and we'll take a view atop the Washington Monument. And together, we'll learn about ourselves, as Americans: our sufferings, our delights, and our triumphs. And we'll walk away better for it, better because we better grasp the truth. We'll walk away that much more in love with this country, the only place on Earth where this story could have unfolded.\nIt is a monument, no less than the others on this Mall, to the deep and abiding love for this country and the ideals upon which it is founded. For we, too, are America.\nSo enough talk. President Bush was timing me. [Laughter] He had the over-under at 25. [Laughter] Let us now open this museum to the world. Today we have with us a family that reflects the arc of our progress: the Bonner family, four generations in all, starting with gorgeous 7-year-old Christine and going up to gorgeous 99-year-old Ruth.\nNow, Ruth's father, Elijah Odom, was born into servitude in Mississippi. He was born a slave. As a young boy, he ran, though, to his freedom. He lived through Reconstruction, and he lived through Jim Crow. But he went on to farm and graduate from medical school and gave life to the beautiful family that we see today, with a spirit reflected in beautiful Christine, free and equal in the laws of her country and in the eyes of God. So, in a brief moment, their family will join us in ringing a bell from the First Baptist Church in Virginia, one of the oldest Black churches in America, founded under a grove of trees in 1776. And the sound of this bell will be echoed by others in houses of worship and town squares all across this country, an echo of the ringing of bells that signaled Emancipation more than a century and a half ago; the sound, and the anthem, of American freedom.\nGod bless you. God bless the United States of America.", "timestamp": "2016-09-24", "title": "Remarks at the Dedication Ceremony for the National Museum of African American History and Culture"}

The leaders also participated in a dialogue with the private sector and a broader audience of stakeholders on Central America, to discuss innovative activities in the areas of infrastructure, logistics, and energy.\nThe governments of El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and the United States reaffirmed their commitments enshrined in the Blair House Communique on February 24, 2016.  One such example has been the establishment of consultative groups in each country to provide oversight of the Plan, with participation of the public and private sectors, and of civil society.  The dialogue between the leaders was based on the commitments established during the January 14, February 24, and May 3, 2016 meetings that defined specific objectives with regard to security, governance, and prosperity in the region, including efforts to promote safe, legal, and orderly migration that include public messaging campaigns to combat irregular migration and provide comprehensive assistance to returned migrants.\nIn their remarks, the Northern Triangle presidents highlighted the progress each government has made, and emphasized the actions undertaken at a regional level, such as the trade and customs integration process, the establishment of a Regional Plan for Combatting Organized Crime, the creation of a Tri-national Force addressing organized crime, and the integration of investigations and information systems related to gangs, with efforts coordinated by public prosecutors.\nAdditionally, they highlighted progress and accomplishments at the national level:\nIn El Salvador, in the wake of the government's efforts to improve security, homicides have dropped approximately 50 percent since the beginning of the year.  El Salvador has also aggressively targeted the financial networks of transnational criminal organizations.  Operation Jaque resulted in the July arrest of 78 individuals and the seizure of real estate properties, 178 vehicles, and over 600 bank accounts.  In addition, the government has established public-private dialogues on economic growth, security, and education.  These discussions have helped develop specific proposals such as the Plan Safe El Salvador and the approval of reforms to promote private investment.  Currently, the President is leading a dialogue on taxation with the main political parties.  In the fight against corruption, the Secretariat of Transparency and Anti-Corruption presented more than 150 cases of alleged corruption in public administration to the Attorney General's Office.  The Attorney General's Office has received support from the Executive, including additional funding to hire more assistant prosecutors.\nGuatemala has significantly increased tax collection through judicial and administrative measures, and has adopted new methods to combat tax evasion and contraband.  The government continues to fight corruption and strengthen the Public Prosecutor's office.  In the area of security, as a result of the strengthening and modernization of the National Civilian Police, there has been a decrease in the homicide rate, continued efforts to dismantle criminal organizations, and a record number of drug seizures.  The government recently presented an urban development policy to promote job creation and improve standards of living.  To strengthen coordination and alignment actions of the Plan, the government's Consultative Body agreed to implement a pilot plan in three municipalities.\nIn Honduras, notable achievements include the implementation of the Mission to Support the Fight Against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (known by its Spanish acronym MACCIH) and a sustained increase in tax revenue, projected to be 17.2 percent of Gross Domestic Product in 2016.  In addition, there has been unprecedented progress by the Special Commission for the Clean-Up and Transformation of the National Police, which has removed 40 percent of Honduran police officers and referred information on their cases to the judicial system.  Honduras also continues with capacity building of the National Police and the dismantling of human trafficking and smuggling organizations, as well as ongoing efforts against extortion.  The government, together with the private sector, launched the Honduras 20/20 program to strengthen the priority productive sectors of the national economy, fostering job creation for its citizens.

I'm Lester Holt, anchor of \"NBC Nightly News.\" I want to welcome you to the first presidential debate.\nThe participants tonight are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization. The commission drafted tonight's format, and the rules have been agreed to by the campaigns.\nThe 90-minute debate is divided into six segments, each 15 minutes long. We'll explore three topic areas tonight: Achieving prosperity; America's direction; and securing America. At the start of each segment, I will ask the same lead-off question to both candidates, and they will each have up to two minutes to respond. From that point until the end of the segment, we'll have an open discussion.\nThe questions are mine and have not been shared with the commission or the campaigns. The audience here in the room has agreed to remain silent so that we can focus on what the candidates are saying.\nI will invite you to applaud, however, at this moment, as we welcome the candidates: Democratic nominee for president of the United States, Hillary Clinton, and Republican nominee for president of the United States, Donald J. Trump. [applause]\nCLINTON: How are you, Donald? [applause]\nHOLT: Good luck to you. [applause]\nWell, I don't expect us to cover all the issues of this campaign tonight, but I remind everyone, there are two more presidential debates scheduled. We are going to focus on many of the issues that voters tell us are most important, and we're going to press for specifics. I am honored to have this role, but this evening belongs to the candidates and, just as important, to the American people.\nCandidates, we look forward to hearing you articulate your policies and your positions, as well as your visions and your values. So, let's begin.\nWe're calling this opening segment \"Achieving Prosperity.\" And central to that is jobs. There are two economic realities in America today. There's been a record six straight years of job growth, and new census numbers show incomes have increased at a record rate after years of stagnation. However, income inequality remains significant, and nearly half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.\nBeginning with you, Secretary Clinton, why are you a better choice than your opponent to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of American works?\nCLINTON: Well, thank you, Lester, and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us.\nThe central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together. Today is my granddaughter's second birthday, so I think about this a lot. First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes.\nI want us to invest in you. I want us to invest in your future. That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business. We also have to make the economy fairer. That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work.\nI also want to see more companies do profit-sharing. If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top.\nAnd I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work. I've heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you're under. So let's have paid family leave, earned sick days. Let's be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college.\nHow are we going to do it? We're going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes.\nFinally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, it's good to be with you. We're going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country. You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better. I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th.\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton, thank you.\nMr. Trump, the same question to you. It's about putting money—more money into the pockets of American workers. You have up to two minutes.\nTRUMP: Thank you, Lester. Our jobs are fleeing the country. They're going to Mexico. They're going to many other countries. You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product. They're devaluing their currency, and there's nobody in our government to fight them. And we have a very good fight. And we have a winning fight. Because they're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing.\nSo we're losing our good jobs, so many of them. When you look at what's happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said it's the eighth wonder of the world. They're building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants. With the United States, as he said, not so much.\nSo Ford is leaving. You see that, their small car division leaving. Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio. They're all leaving. And we can't allow it to happen anymore. As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that. We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do, but perhaps we'll be talking about that later.\nBut we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us. We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people. All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis. They left—fired 1,400 people. They're going to Mexico. So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this.\nWe cannot let it happen. Under my plan, I'll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses. That's going to be a job creator like we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan. It's going to be a beautiful thing to watch.\nCompanies will come. They will build. They will expand. New companies will start. And I look very, very much forward to doing it. We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond?\nCLINTON: Well, I think that trade is an important issue. Of course, we are 5 percent of the world's population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent. And we need to have smart, fair trade deals.\nWe also, though, need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions. And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again. In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we've ever had.\nI call it trumped-up trickle-down, because that's exactly what it would be. That is not how we grow the economy.\nWe just have a different view about what's best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes.\nI think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives. I understand that. You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that's all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there.\nI don't buy that. I have a different experience. My father was a small-businessman. He worked really hard. He printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going.\nAnd so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better we'll grow. That's the kind of economy I want us to see again.\nHOLT: Let me follow up with Mr. Trump, if you can. You've talked about creating 25 million jobs, and you've promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans. How are you going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas? How, specifically, are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back?\nTRUMP: Well, for one thing—and before we start on that—my father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world, and I say that only because that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.\nOur country's in deep trouble. We don't know what we're doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China. They're the best, the best ever at it. What they're doing to us is a very, very sad thing.\nSo we have to do that. We have to renegotiate our trade deals. And, Lester, they're taking our jobs, they're giving incentives, they're doing things that, frankly, we don't do.\nLet me give you the example of Mexico. They have a VAT tax. We're on a different system. When we sell into Mexico, there's a tax. When they sell in—automatic, 16 percent, approximately. When they sell into us, there's no tax. It's a defective agreement. It's been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven't done anything about it.\nNow, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton—yes, is that OK? Good. I want you to be very happy. It's very important to me.\nBut in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently. She's been doing this for 30 years. And why hasn't she made the agreements better? The NAFTA agreement is defective. Just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact...\nHOLT: Let me interrupt just a moment, but...\nTRUMP: Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we've created a movement. They should have been doing this for years. What's happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is—look, we owe $20 trillion. We cannot do it any longer, Lester.\nHOLT: Back to the question, though. How do you bring back—specifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers? How do you make them bring the jobs back?\nTRUMP: Well, the first thing you do is don't let the jobs leave. The companies are leaving. I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them. They're leaving, and they're leaving in bigger numbers than ever.\nAnd what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck. We wish you a lot of luck. But if you think you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you're wrong.\nAnd once you say you're going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this, because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave, because in many cases, they own the companies. So what I'm saying is, we can stop them from leaving. We have to stop them from leaving. And that's a big, big factor.\nHOLT: Let me let Secretary Clinton get in here.\nCLINTON: Well, let's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago. We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s. That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.\nIn fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis. He said, back in 2006, \"Gee, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money.\" Well, it did collapse.\nTRUMP: That's called business, by the way.\nCLINTON: Nine million people—nine million people lost their jobs. Five million people lost their homes. And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.\nNow, we have come back from that abyss. And it has not been easy. So we're now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy, but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place.\nIndependent experts have looked at what I've proposed and looked at what Donald's proposed, and basically they've said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession.\nThey've looked at my plans and they've said, OK, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy. Take clean energy. Some country is going to be the clean- energy superpower of the 21st century. Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I think it's real.\nTRUMP: I did not. I did not. I do not say that.\nCLINTON: I think science is real.\nTRUMP: I do not say that.\nCLINTON: And I think it's important that we grip this and deal with it, both at home and abroad. And here's what we can do. We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels. We can have enough clean energy to power every home. We can build a new modern electric grid. That's a lot of jobs; that's a lot of new economic activity.\nSo I've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that we're going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we've made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place.\nHOLT: Mr. Trump?\nTRUMP: She talks about solar panels. We invested in a solar company, our country. That was a disaster. They lost plenty of money on that one.\nNow, look, I'm a great believer in all forms of energy, but we're putting a lot of people out of work. Our energy policies are a disaster. Our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt. You can't do what you're looking to do with $20 trillion in debt.\nThe Obama administration, from the time they've come in, is over 230 years' worth of debt, and he's topped it. He's doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven-and-a-half years, to be semi- exact.\nSo I will tell you this. We have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs. And we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand, because they're not doing it.\nAnd all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving, they're gone.\nAnd, Hillary, I'd just ask you this. You've been doing this for 30 years. Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now? For 30 years, you've been doing it, and now you're just starting to think of solutions.\nCLINTON: Well, actually...\nTRUMP: I will bring—excuse me. I will bring back jobs. You can't bring back jobs.\nCLINTON: Well, actually, I have thought about this quite a bit.\nTRUMP: Yeah, for 30 years.\nCLINTON: And I have—well, not quite that long. I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s. I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again...\nTRUMP: Well, he approved NAFTA...\n[crosstalk]\nCLINTON: ... million new jobs, a balanced budget...\nTRUMP: He approved NAFTA, which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country.\nCLINTON: Incomes went up for everybody. Manufacturing jobs went up also in the 1990s, if we're actually going to look at the facts.\nWhen I was in the Senate, I had a number of trade deals that came before me, and I held them all to the same test. Will they create jobs in America? Will they raise incomes in America? And are they good for our national security? Some of them I voted for. The biggest one, a multinational one known as CAFTA, I voted against. And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals.\nBut let's not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy. I think it is a part of it, and I've said what I'm going to do. I'm going to have a special prosecutor. We're going to enforce the trade deals we have, and we're going to hold people accountable.\nWhen I was secretary of state, we actually increased American exports globally 30 percent. We increased them to China 50 percent. So I know how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs.\nHOLT: Very quickly...\nTRUMP: But you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to...\nCLINTON: Well, I've been a senator, Donald...\nTRUMP: You haven't done it. You haven't done it.\nCLINTON: And I have been a secretary of state...\nTRUMP: Excuse me.\nCLINTON: And I have done a lot...\nTRUMP: Your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry.\nCLINTON: Well, that's your opinion. That is your opinion.\nTRUMP: You go to New England, you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinton, and you will see devastation where manufacture is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent. NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country.\nAnd now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership. You were totally in favor of it. Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, I can't win that debate. But you know that if you did win, you would approve that, and that will be almost as bad as NAFTA. Nothing will ever top NAFTA.\nCLINTON: Well, that is just not accurate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out. I wrote about that in...\nTRUMP: You called it the gold standard.\n[crosstalk]\nTRUMP: You called it the gold standard of trade deals. You said it's the finest deal you've ever seen.\nCLINTON: No.\nTRUMP: And then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it.\nCLINTON: Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts. The facts are—I did say I hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated...\nTRUMP: Not.\nCLINTON: ... which I was not responsible for, I concluded it wasn't. I wrote about that in my book...\nTRUMP: So is it President Obama's fault?\nCLINTON: ... before you even announced.\nTRUMP: Is it President Obama's fault?\nCLINTON: Look, there are differences...\nTRUMP: Secretary, is it President Obama's fault?\nCLINTON: There are...\nTRUMP: Because he's pushing it.\nCLINTON: There are different views about what's good for our country, our economy, and our leadership in the world. And I think it's important to look at what we need to do to get the economy going again. That's why I said new jobs with rising incomes, investments, not in more tax cuts that would add $5 trillion to the debt.\nTRUMP: But you have no plan.\nCLINTON: But in—oh, but I do.\nTRUMP: Secretary, you have no plan.\nCLINTON: In fact, I have written a book about it. It's called \"Stronger Together.\" You can pick it up tomorrow at a bookstore...\nTRUMP: That's about all you've...\n[crosstalk]\nHOLT: Folks, we're going to...\nCLINTON: ... or at an airport near you.\nHOLT: We're going to move to...\nCLINTON: But it's because I see this—we need to have strong growth, fair growth, sustained growth. We also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business.\nSo we have a very robust set of plans. And people have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs, and explode the debt which would have a recession.\nTRUMP: You are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history. You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history. You are going to drive business out. Your regulations are a disaster, and you're going to increase regulations all over the place.\nAnd by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan. I'm very proud of it. It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs. But regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence.\nWhen I go around—Lester, I tell you this, I've been all over. And when I go around, despite the tax cut, the thing—the things that business as in people like the most is the fact that I'm cutting regulation. You have regulations on top of regulations, and new companies cannot form and old companies are going out of business. And you want to increase the regulations and make them even worse.\nI'm going to cut regulations. I'm going to cut taxes big league, and you're going to raise taxes big league, end of story.\nHOLT: Let me get you to pause right there, because we're going to move into—we're going to move into the next segment. We're going to talk taxes...\nCLINTON: That can't—that can't be left to stand.\nHOLT: Please just take 30 seconds and then we're going to go on.\nCLINTON: I kind of assumed that there would be a lot of these charges and claims, and so...\nTRUMP: Facts.\nCLINTON: So we have taken the home page of my website, HillaryClinton.com, and we've turned it into a fact-checker. So if you want to see in real-time what the facts are, please go and take a look. Because what I have proposed...\nTRUMP: And take a look at mine, also, and you'll see.\nCLINTON: ... would not add a penny to the debt, and your plans would add $5 trillion to the debt. What I have proposed would cut regulations and streamline them for small businesses. What I have proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy, because they have made all the gains in the economy. And I think it's time that the wealthy and corporations paid their fair share to support this country.\nHOLT: Well, you just opened the next segment.\nTRUMP: Well, could I just finish—I think I...\n[crosstalk]\nHOLT: I'm going to give you a chance right here...\nTRUMP: I think I should—you go to her website, and you take a look at her website.\nHOLT: ... with a new 15-minute segment...\nTRUMP: She's going to raise taxes $1.3 trillion.\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, I'm going to...\nTRUMP: And look at her website. You know what? It's no difference than this. She's telling us how to fight ISIS. Just go to her website. She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website. I don't think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much.\nHOLT: The next segment, we're continuing...\nCLINTON: Well, at least I have a plan to fight ISIS.\nHOLT: ... achieving prosperity...\nTRUMP: No, no, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do.\nCLINTON: No, we're not. No, we're not.\nTRUMP: See, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do. No wonder you've been fighting—no wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life.\nCLINTON: That's a—that's—go to the—please, fact checkers, get to work.\nHOLT: OK, you are unpacking a lot here. And we're still on the issue of achieving prosperity. And I want to talk about taxes. The fundamental difference between the two of you concerns the wealthy.\nSecretary Clinton, you're calling for a tax increase on the wealthiest Americans. I'd like you to further defend that. And, Mr. Trump, you're calling for tax cuts for the wealthy. I'd like you to defend that. And this next two-minute answer goes to you, Mr. Trump.\nTRUMP: Well, I'm really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going create tremendous jobs. They're going to expand their companies. They're going to do a tremendous job.\nI'm getting rid of the carried interest provision. And if you really look, it's not a tax—it's really not a great thing for the wealthy. It's a great thing for the middle class. It's a great thing for companies to expand.\nAnd when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies, and when they're going to bring $2.5 trillion back from overseas, where they can't bring the money back, because politicians like Secretary Clinton won't allow them to bring the money back, because the taxes are so onerous, and the bureaucratic red tape, so what—is so bad.\nSo what they're doing is they're leaving our country, and they're, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country. And instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work, because they can't work out a deal to—and everybody agrees it should be brought back.\nInstead of that, they're leaving our country to get their money, because they can't bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they can't get together. Because we have—we have a president that can't sit them around a table and get them to approve something.\nAnd here's the thing. Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done, $2.5 trillion. I happen to think it's double that. It's probably $5 trillion that we can't bring into our country, Lester. And with a little leadership, you'd get it in here very quickly, and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful.\nBut we have no leadership. And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton.\nHOLT: All right. You have two minutes of the same question to defend tax increases on the wealthiest Americans, Secretary Clinton.\nCLINTON: I have a feeling that by, the end of this evening, I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened.\nTRUMP: Why not?\nCLINTON: Why not? Yeah, why not? [laughter]\nYou know, just join the debate by saying more crazy things. Now, let me say this, it is absolutely the case...\nTRUMP: There's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into their country.\nHOLT: This is—this is Secretary Clinton's two minutes, please.\nTRUMP: Yes.\nCLINTON: Yeah, well, let's start the clock again, Lester. We've looked at your tax proposals. I don't see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals you're referring to that would cause the repatriation, bringing back of money that's stranded overseas. I happen to support that.\nTRUMP: Then you didn't read it.\nCLINTON: I happen to—I happen to support that in a way that will actually work to our benefit. But when I look at what you have proposed, you have what is called now the Trump loophole, because it would so advantage you and the business you do. You've proposed an approach that has a...\nTRUMP: Who gave it that name? The first I've—who gave it that name?\n[crosstalk]\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, this is Secretary Clinton's two minutes.\nCLINTON: ... $4 billion tax benefit for your family. And when you look at what you are proposing...\nTRUMP: How much? How much for my family?\nCLINTON: ... it is...\nTRUMP: Lester, how much?\nCLINTON: ... as I said, trumped-up trickle-down. Trickle-down did not work. It got us into the mess we were in, in 2008 and 2009. Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn't worked.\nAnd a lot of really smart, wealthy people know that. And they are saying, hey, we need to do more to make the contributions we should be making to rebuild the middle class.\nI don't think top-down works in America. I think building the middle class, investing in the middle class, making college debt-free so more young people can get their education, helping people refinance their—their debt from college at a lower rate. Those are the kinds of things that will really boost the economy. Broad-based, inclusive growth is what we need in America, not more advantages for people at the very top.\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, we're...\nTRUMP: Typical politician. All talk, no action. Sounds good, doesn't work. Never going to happen. Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of what's going on.\nNow, look, we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression. And believe me: We're in a bubble right now. And the only thing that looks good is the stock market, but if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that's going to come crashing down.\nWe are in a big, fat, ugly bubble. And we better be awfully careful. And we have a Fed that's doing political things. This Janet Yellen of the Fed. The Fed is doing political—by keeping the interest rates at this level. And believe me: The day Obama goes off, and he leaves, and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf, when they raise interest rates, you're going to see some very bad things happen, because the Fed is not doing their job. The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton.\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, we're talking about the burden that Americans have to pay, yet you have not released your tax returns. And the reason nominees have released their returns for decades is so that voters will know if their potential president owes money to—who he owes it to and any business conflicts. Don't Americans have a right to know if there are any conflicts of interest?\nTRUMP: I don't mind releasing—I'm under a routine audit. And it'll be released. And—as soon as the audit's finished, it will be released.\nBut you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections, where I filed a 104-page essentially financial statement of sorts, the forms that they have. It shows income—in fact, the income—I just looked today—the income is filed at $694 million for this past year, $694 million. If you would have told me I was going to make that 15 or 20 years ago, I would have been very surprised.\nBut that's the kind of thinking that our country needs. When we have a country that's doing so badly, that's being ripped off by every single country in the world, it's the kind of thinking that our country needs, because everybody—Lester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, of almost $800 billion a year. You know what that is? That means, who's negotiating these trade deals?\nWe have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals.\nHOLT: The IRS says an audit...\nTRUMP: Excuse me.\nHOLT: ... of your taxes—you're perfectly free to release your taxes during an audit. And so the question, does the public's right to know outweigh your personal...\nTRUMP: Well, I told you, I will release them as soon as the audit. Look, I've been under audit almost for 15 years. I know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited. I said, do you get audited? I get audited almost every year.\nAnd in a way, I should be complaining. I'm not even complaining. I don't mind it. It's almost become a way of life. I get audited by the IRS. But other people don't.\nI will say this. We have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of. I will release my tax returns—against my lawyer's wishes—when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted. As soon as she releases them, I will release. [applause]\nI will release my tax returns. And that's against—my lawyers, they say, \"Don't do it.\" I will tell you this. No—in fact, watching shows, they're reading the papers. Almost every lawyer says, you don't release your returns until the audit's complete. When the audit's complete, I'll do it. But I would go against them if she releases her e-mails.\nHOLT: So it's negotiable?\nTRUMP: It's not negotiable, no. Let her release the e-mails. Why did she delete 33,000...\nHOLT: Well, I'll let her answer that. But let me just admonish the audience one more time. There was an agreement. We did ask you to be silent, so it would be helpful for us. Secretary Clinton?\nCLINTON: Well, I think you've seen another example of bait-and- switch here. For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns. You can go and see nearly, I think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns, but everyone has done it. We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when you're under audit.\nSo you've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns? And I think there may be a couple of reasons. First, maybe he's not as rich as he says he is. Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be.\nThird, we don't know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks. Or maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax.\nTRUMP: That makes me smart.\nCLINTON: So if he's paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health. And I think probably he's not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible, that he's trying to hide.\nAnd the financial disclosure statements, they don't give you the tax rate. They don't give you all the details that tax returns would. And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see. And I have no reason to believe that he's ever going to release his tax returns, because there's something he's hiding.\nAnd we'll guess. We'll keep guessing at what it might be that he's hiding. But I think the question is, were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts? Who does he owe money to? Well, he owes you the answers to that, and he should provide them.\nHOLT: He also—he also raised the issue of your e-mails. Do you want to respond to that?\nCLINTON: I do. You know, I made a mistake using a private e- mail.\nTRUMP: That's for sure.\nCLINTON: And if I had to do it over again, I would, obviously, do it differently. But I'm not going to make any excuses. It was a mistake, and I take responsibility for that.\nHOLT: Mr. Trump?\nTRUMP: That was more than a mistake. That was done purposely. OK? That was not a mistake. That was done purposely. When you have your staff taking the Fifth Amendment, taking the Fifth so they're not prosecuted, when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the Fifth, I think it's disgraceful. And believe me, this country thinks it's—really thinks it's disgraceful, also.\nAs far as my tax returns, you don't learn that much from tax returns. That I can tell you. You learn a lot from financial disclosure. And you should go down and take a look at that.\nThe other thing, I'm extremely underleveraged. The report that said $650—which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, that's really not a lot of money. It's not a lot of money relative to what I had.\nThe buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which was—actually, it wasn't even a bad story, to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion. And the $650 isn't even on that. But it's not $650. It's much less than that.\nBut I could give you a list of banks, I would—if that would help you, I would give you a list of banks. These are very fine institutions, very fine banks. I could do that very quickly.\nI am very underleveraged. I have a great company. I have a tremendous income. And the reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way. It's because it's about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money.\nWhen we have $20 trillion in debt, and our country's a mess, you know, it's one thing to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our bridges are good and everything's in great shape, our airports. Our airports are like from a third world country.\nYou land at LaGuardia, you land at Kennedy, you land at LAX, you land at Newark, and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredible—you come in from China, you see these incredible airports, and you land—we've become a third world country.\nSo the worst of all things has happened. We owe $20 trillion, and we're a mess. We haven't even started. And we've spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, according to a report that I just saw. Whether it's 6 or 5, but it looks like it's 6, $6 trillion in the Middle East, we could have rebuilt our country twice.\nAnd it's really a shame. And it's politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem. Our country has tremendous problems. We're a debtor nation. We're a serious debtor nation. And we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals. And we don't have the money, because it's been squandered on so many of your ideas.\nHOLT: We'll let you respond and we'll move on to the next segment.\nCLINTON: And maybe because you haven't paid any federal income tax for a lot of years. [applause]\nAnd the other thing I think is important...\nTRUMP: It would be squandered, too, believe me.\nCLINTON: ... is if your—if your main claim to be president of the United States is your business, then I think we should talk about that. You know, your campaign manager said that you built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys.\nAnd, indeed, I have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, Donald. I've met dishwashers, painters, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers, like my dad was, who you refused to pay when they finished the work that you asked them to do.\nWe have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses. It's a beautiful facility. It immediately was put to use. And you wouldn't pay what the man needed to be paid, what he was charging you to do...\nTRUMP: Maybe he didn't do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work...\nCLINTON: Well, to...\nTRUMP: Which our country should do, too.\nCLINTON: Do the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they produced, and then refused to pay them?\nI can only say that I'm certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you. He provided a good middle-class life for us, but the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides.\nAnd when we talk about your business, you've taken business bankruptcy six times. There are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once. You call yourself the King of Debt. You talk about leverage. You even at one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the United States.\nTRUMP: Wrong. Wrong.\nCLINTON: Well, sometimes there's not a direct transfer of skills from business to government, but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government.\nHOLT: Let's let Mr. Trump...\nCLINTON: And we need to be very clear about that.\nTRUMP: So, yeah, I think—I do think it's time. Look, it's all words, it's all sound bites. I built an unbelievable company. Some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, real estate assets anywhere in the world, beyond the United States, in Europe, lots of different places. It's an unbelievable company.\nBut on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there. And when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didn't get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation.\nNow, if you want to change the laws, you've been there a long time, change the laws. But I take advantage of the laws of the nation because I'm running a company. My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies. And that's what I do.\nBut what she doesn't say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me. I'll give you an example. We're just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I don't get there one way, I'm going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another.\nBut we're opening the Old Post Office. Under budget, ahead of schedule, saved tremendous money. I'm a year ahead of schedule. And that's what this country should be doing.\nWe build roads and they cost two and three and four times what they're supposed to cost. We buy products for our military and they come in at costs that are so far above what they were supposed to be, because we don't have people that know what they're doing.\nWhen we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy. The Trump International is way under budget and way ahead of schedule. And we should be able to do that for our country.\nHOLT: Well, we're well behind schedule, so I want to move to our next segment. We move into our next segment talking about America's direction. And let's start by talking about race.\nThe share of Americans who say race relations are bad in this country is the highest it's been in decades, much of it amplified by shootings of African-Americans by police, as we've seen recently in Charlotte and Tulsa. Race has been a big issue in this campaign, and one of you is going to have to bridge a very wide and bitter gap.\nSo how do you heal the divide? Secretary Clinton, you get two minutes on this.\nCLINTON: Well, you're right. Race remains a significant challenge in our country. Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they're treated in the criminal justice system. We've just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte.\nAnd we've got to do several things at the same time. We have to restore trust between communities and the police. We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they're well prepared to use force only when necessary. Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law.\nRight now, that's not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods. So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform. I've laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system.\nBut we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform. So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal. And we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.\nThe gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together. So we have to do two things, as I said. We have to restore trust. We have to work with the police. We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them. And we have to tackle the plague of gun violence, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we're seeing today.\nHOLT: All right, Mr. Trump, you have two minutes. How do you heal the divide?\nTRUMP: Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn't want to use a couple of words, and that's law and order. And we need law and order. If we don't have it, we're not going to have a country.\nAnd when I look at what's going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at what's going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it's—I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long—we need law and order in our country.\nI just got today the, as you know, the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, we just—just came in. We have endorsements from, I think, almost every police group, very—I mean, a large percentage of them in the United States.\nWe have a situation where we have our inner cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are living in he'll because it's so dangerous. You walk down the street, you get shot.\nIn Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st. Thousands of shootings. And I'm saying, where is this? Is this a war-torn country? What are we doing? And we have to stop the violence. We have to bring back law and order. In a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years, in fact, almost 4,000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president, over—almost 4,000 people in Chicago have been killed. We have to bring back law and order.\nNow, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York. It brought the crime rate way down. But you take the gun away from criminals that shouldn't be having it.\nWe have gangs roaming the street. And in many cases, they're illegally here, illegal immigrants. And they have guns. And they shoot people. And we have to be very strong. And we have to be very vigilant.\nWe have to be—we have to know what we're doing. Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything. We have to protect our inner cities, because African-American communities are being decimated by crime, decimated.\nHOLT: Your two—your two minutes expired, but I do want to follow up. Stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York, because it largely singled out black and Hispanic young men.\nTRUMP: No, you're wrong. It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge. It was taken away from her. And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would have won an appeal. If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where it's allowed.\nHOLT: The argument is that it's a form of racial profiling.\nTRUMP: No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldn't have them.\nThese are felons. These are people that are bad people that shouldn't be—when you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk.\nYou need more police. You need a better community, you know, relation. You don't have good community relations in Chicago. It's terrible. I have property there. It's terrible what's going on in Chicago.\nBut when you look—and Chicago's not the only—you go to Ferguson, you go to so many different places. You need better relationships. I agree with Secretary Clinton on this.\nYou need better relationships between the communities and the police, because in some cases, it's not good.\nBut you look at Dallas, where the relationships were really studied, the relationships were really a beautiful thing, and then five police officers were killed one night very violently. So there's some bad things going on. Some really bad things.\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton...\nTRUMP: But we need—Lester, we need law and order. And we need law and order in the inner cities, because the people that are most affected by what's happening are African-American and Hispanic people. And it's very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen.\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton?\nCLINTON: Well, I've heard—I've heard Donald say this at his rallies, and it's really unfortunate that he paints such a dire negative picture of black communities in our country.\nTRUMP: Ugh.\nCLINTON: You know, the vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids. There's a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up.\nBut we do always have to make sure we keep people safe. There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective. Stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective. It did not do what it needed to do.\nNow, I believe in community policing. And, in fact, violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991. Property crime is down 40 percent. We just don't want to see it creep back up. We've had 25 years of very good cooperation.\nBut there were some problems, some unintended consequences. Too many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses. And it's just a fact that if you're a young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated. So we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system. We cannot just say law and order. We have to say—we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little.\nWe need to have more second chance programs. I'm glad that we're ending private prisons in the federal system; I want to see them ended in the state system. You shouldn't have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans. So there are some positive ways we can work on this.\nAnd I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us. Right now—and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby—right now, we've got too many military- style weapons on the streets. In a lot of places, our police are outgunned. We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm.\nAnd we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who's on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country. If you're too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun. So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way.\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton, last week, you said we've got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias. Do you believe that police are implicitly biased against black people?\nCLINTON: Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police. I think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other. And therefore, I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way?\nBut when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers.\nI've met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago. They admit it's an issue. They've got a lot of concerns. Mental health is one of the biggest concerns, because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street.\nThey want support, they want more training, they want more assistance. And I think the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that.\nHOLT: Mr. Trump...\nTRUMP: I'd like to respond to that.\nHOLT: Please.\nTRUMP: First of all, I agree, and a lot of people even within my own party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no- fly lists. I agree with you. When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I'm very proud of. These are very, very good people, and they're protecting the Second Amendment.\nBut I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists. And when people are on there, even if they shouldn't be on there, we'll help them, we'll help them legally, we'll help them get off. But I tend to agree with that quite strongly.\nI do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words super-predator about young black youth. And that's a term that I think was a—it's—it's been horribly met, as you know. I think you've apologized for it. But I think it was a terrible thing to say.\nAnd when it comes to stop-and-frisk, you know, you're talking about takes guns away. Well, I'm talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them. And I don't think—I really don't think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth.\nI think maybe there's a political reason why you can't say it, but I really don't believe—in New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders. Five hundred murders is a lot of murders. It's hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good?\nBut we went from 2,200 to 500. And it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg. And it was terminated by current mayor. But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did. It had a very, very big impact.\nCLINTON: Well, it's also fair to say, if we're going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders. So there is...\nTRUMP: No, you're wrong. You're wrong.\nCLINTON: No, I'm not.\nTRUMP: Murders are up. All right. You check it.\nCLINTON: New York—New York has done an excellent job. And I give credit—I give credit across the board going back two mayors, two police chiefs, because it has worked. And other communities need to come together to do what will work, as well.\nLook, one murder is too many. But it is important that we learn about what has been effective. And not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want. Who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe?\nBut let's also add, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods. And so we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem.\nHOLT: This conversation is about race. And so, Mr. Trump, I have to ask you for five...\nTRUMP: I'd like to just respond, if I might.\nHOLT: Please—20 seconds.\nTRUMP: I'd just like to respond.\nHOLT: Please respond, then I've got a quick follow-up for you.\nTRUMP: I will. Look, the African-American community has been let down by our politicians. They talk good around election time, like right now, and after the election, they said, see ya later, I'll see you in four years.\nThe African-American community—because—look, the community within the inner cities has been so badly treated. They've been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians, because that's what it is. They've controlled these communities for up to 100 years.\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, let me...\n[crosstalk]\nCLINTON: Well, I—I do think...\nTRUMP: And I will tell you, you look at the inner cities—and I just left Detroit, and I just left Philadelphia, and I just—you know, you've seen me, I've been all over the place. You decided to stay home, and that's OK. But I will tell you, I've been all over. And I've met some of the greatest people I'll ever meet within these communities. And they are very, very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done.\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, I...\nCLINTON: I think—I think—I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And, yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that's a good thing. [applause]\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, for five years, you perpetuated a false claim that the nation's first black president was not a natural-born citizen. You questioned his legitimacy. In the last couple of weeks, you acknowledged what most Americans have accepted for years: The president was born in the United States. Can you tell us what took you so long?\nTRUMP: I'll tell you very—well, just very simple to say. Sidney Blumenthal works for the campaign and close—very close friend of Secretary Clinton. And her campaign manager, Patti Doyle, went to—during the campaign, her campaign against President Obama, fought very hard. And you can go look it up, and you can check it out.\nAnd if you look at CNN this past week, Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened. Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it. They were pressing it very hard. She failed to get the birth certificate.\nWhen I got involved, I didn't fail. I got him to give the birth certificate. So I'm satisfied with it. And I'll tell you why I'm satisfied with it.\nHOLT: That was...\n[crosstalk]\nTRUMP: Because I want to get on to defeating ISIS, because I want to get on to creating jobs, because I want to get on to having a strong border, because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country.\nHOLT: I will let you respond. It's important. But I just want to get the answer here. The birth certificate was produced in 2011. You've continued to tell the story and question the president's legitimacy in 2012, '13, '14, '15...\nTRUMP: Yeah.\nHOLT: .... as recently as January. So the question is, what changed your mind?\nTRUMP: Well, nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it. I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course. But nobody was caring much about it. But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate. And I think I did a good job.\nSecretary Clinton also fought it. I mean, you know—now, everybody in mainstream is going to say, oh, that's not true. Look, it's true. Sidney Blumenthal sent a reporter—you just have to take a look at CNN, the last week, the interview with your former campaign manager. And she was involved. But just like she can't bring back jobs, she can't produce.\nHOLT: I'm sorry. I'm just going to follow up—and I will let you respond to that, because there's a lot there. But we're talking about racial healing in this segment. What do you say to Americans, people of color who...\n[crosstalk]\nTRUMP: Well, it was very—I say nothing. I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it. He should have produced it a long time before. I say nothing.\nBut let me just tell you. When you talk about healing, I think that I've developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community. I think you can see that.\nAnd I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion. And I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate.\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton?\nCLINTON: Well, just listen to what you heard. [laughter]\nAnd clearly, as Donald just admitted, he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage, and Lester Holt was going to be asking us questions, so he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed.\nBut it can't be dismissed that easily. He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen. There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it.\nBut, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy. He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department.\nSo he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior. And the birther lie was a very hurtful one. You know, Barack Obama is a man of great dignity. And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.\nBut I like to remember what Michelle Obama said in her amazing speech at our Democratic National Convention: When they go low, we go high. And Barack Obama went high, despite Donald Trump's best efforts to bring him down.\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, you can respond and we're going to move on to the next segment.\nTRUMP: I would love to respond. First of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama. You treated him with terrible disrespect. And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are. It doesn't work that way. You were after him, you were trying to—you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures. I don't think you can deny that.\nBut just last week, your campaign manager said it was true. So when you tried to act holier than thou, it really doesn't work. It really doesn't.\nNow, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father's company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country—it was a federal lawsuit—were sued. We settled the suit with zero—with no admission of guilt. It was very easy to do.\nI notice you bring that up a lot. And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don't do on you. Maybe I'm trying to save the money.\nBut, frankly, I look—I look at that, and I say, isn't that amazing? Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and it's just one of those things.\nI'll go one step further. In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it. No discrimination against African- Americans, against Muslims, against anybody. And it's a tremendously successful club. And I'm so glad I did it. And I have been given great credit for what I did. And I'm very, very proud of it. And that's the way I feel. That is the true way I feel.\nHOLT: Our next segment is called \"Securing America.\" We want to start with a 21st century war happening every day in this country. Our institutions are under cyber attack, and our secrets are being stolen. So my question is, who's behind it? And how do we fight it?\nSecretary Clinton, this answer goes to you.\nCLINTON: Well, I think cyber security, cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president, because clearly we're facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries. There are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they can use to make money.\nBut increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states. The most recent and troubling of these has been Russia. There's no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and I am deeply concerned about this. I know Donald's very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin, but Putin is playing a really...\n[crosstalk]\n...tough, long game here. And one of the things he's done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee. And we recently have learned that, you know, that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information. We need to make it very clear—whether it's Russia, China, Iran or anybody else—the United States has much greater capacity. And we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information, our private-sector information or our public-sector information.\nAnd we're going to have to make it clear that we don't want to use the kinds of tools that we have. We don't want to engage in a different kind of warfare. But we will defend the citizens of this country.\nAnd the Russians need to understand that. I think they've been treating it as almost a probing, how far would we go, how much would we do. And that's why I was so—I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans. That is just unacceptable. It's one of the reasons why 50 national security officials who served in Republican information—in administrations...\nHOLT: Your two minutes have expired.\nCLINTON: ... have said that Donald is unfit to be the commander- in-chief. It's comments like that that really worry people who understand the threats that we face.\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, you have two minutes and the same question. Who's behind it? And how do we fight it?\nTRUMP: I do want to say that I was just endorsed—and more are coming next week—it will be over 200 admirals, many of them here—admirals and generals endorsed me to lead this country. That just happened, and many more are coming. And I'm very proud of it.\nIn addition, I was just endorsed by ICE. They've never endorsed anybody before on immigration. I was just endorsed by ICE. I was just recently endorsed—16,500 Border Patrol agents.\nSo when Secretary Clinton talks about this, I mean, I'll take the admirals and I'll take the generals any day over the political hacks that I see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge. OK? Because look at the mess that we're in. Look at the mess that we're in.\nAs far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said. We should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we're not. I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC. She's saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don't—maybe it was. I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?\nYou don't know who broke in to DNC.\nBut what did we learn with DNC? We learned that Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of by your people, by Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Look what happened to her. But Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of. That's what we learned.\nNow, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we don't know, because the truth is, under President Obama we've lost control of things that we used to have control over.\nWe came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they're beating us at our own game. ISIS.\nSo we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. It is—it is a huge problem. I have a son. He's 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe it's hardly doable.\nBut I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing. But that's true throughout our whole governmental society. We have so many things that we have to do better, Lester, and certainly cyber is one of them.\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton?\nCLINTON: Well, I think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing. I have put forth a plan to defeat ISIS. It does involve going after them online. I think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize, even direct people in our country and Europe and elsewhere.\nBut we also have to intensify our air strikes against ISIS and eventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa, end their claim of being a Caliphate.\nWe're making progress. Our military is assisting in Iraq. And we're hoping that within the year we'll be able to push ISIS out of Iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in Syria.\nBut we have to be cognizant of the fact that they've had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we have to make this the top priority.\nAnd I would also do everything possible to take out their leadership. I was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership when I was secretary of state, including, of course, taking out bin Laden. And I think we need to go after Baghdadi, as well, make that one of our organizing principles. Because we've got to defeat ISIS, and we've got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online.\nHOLT: You mention ISIS, and we think of ISIS certainly as over there, but there are American citizens who have been inspired to commit acts of terror on American soil, the latest incident, of course, the bombings we just saw in New York and New Jersey, the knife attack at a mall in Minnesota, in the last year, deadly attacks in San Bernardino and Orlando. I'll ask this to both of you. Tell us specifically how you would prevent homegrown attacks by American citizens, Mr. Trump?\nTRUMP: Well, first I have to say one thing, very important. Secretary Clinton is talking about taking out ISIS. \"We will take out ISIS.\" Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got out—what, they shouldn't have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster. And ISIS was formed.\nSo she talks about taking them out. She's been doing it a long time. She's been trying to take them out for a long time. But they wouldn't have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that. And then you wouldn't have had them.\nOr, as I've been saying for a long time, and I think you'll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil—and we should have taken the oil—ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income. And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil—a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters.\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton?\nCLINTON: Well, I hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard. Donald supported the invasion of Iraq.\nTRUMP: Wrong.\nCLINTON: That is absolutely proved over and over again.\nTRUMP: Wrong. Wrong.\nCLINTON: He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time.\nBut the larger point—and he says this constantly—is George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama.\nAnd the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then-Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that.\nBut let's talk about the question you asked, Lester. The question you asked is, what do we do here in the United States? That's the most important part of this. How do we prevent attacks? How do we protect our people?\nAnd I think we've got to have an intelligence surge, where we are looking for every scrap of information. I was so proud of law enforcement in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey. You know, they responded so quickly, so professionally to the attacks that occurred by Rahami. And they brought him down. And we may find out more information because he is still alive, which may prove to be an intelligence benefit.\nSo we've got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East. That means we've got to work more closely with our allies, and that's something that Donald has been very dismissive of.\nWe're working with NATO, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism. We're working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations. Donald has consistently insulted Muslims abroad, Muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with Muslim nations and with the American Muslim community.\nThey're on the front lines. They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else. They need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away as some of Donald's rhetoric, unfortunately, has led to.\nHOLT: Mr. Trump...\nTRUMP: Well, I have to respond.\nHOLT: Please respond.\nTRUMP: The secretary said very strongly about working with—we've been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyone's ever seen. You look at the Middle East, it's a total mess. Under your direction, to a large extent.\nBut you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, that's another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly. They were choking on the sanctions. And now they're going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way they're going.\nBut when you look at NATO, I was asked on a major show, what do you think of NATO? And you have to understand, I'm a businessperson. I did really well. But I have common sense. And I said, well, I'll tell you. I haven't given lots of thought to NATO. But two things.\nNumber one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren't paying their fair share. Number two—and that bothers me, because we should be asking—we're defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they're supposed to be paying by treaty and contract.\nAnd, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because—and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest—but I said, they do not focus on terror. And I was very strong. And I said it numerous times.\nAnd about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division. And I think that's great. And I think we should get—because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO. It's a lot of money to protect other people. But I'm all for NATO. But I said they have to focus on terror, also.\nAnd they're going to do that. And that was—believe me—I'm sure I'm not going to get credit for it—but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.\nI think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS, and we have to do it fast, when ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton. And believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops. Not only that, you named the day. They couldn't believe it. They sat back probably and said, I can't believe it. They said...\nCLINTON: Lester, we've covered...\nTRUMP: No, wait a minute.\nCLINTON: We've covered this ground.\nTRUMP: When they formed, when they formed, this is something that never should have happened. It should have never happened. Now, you're talking about taking out ISIS. But you were there, and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant. Now it's in over 30 countries. And you're going to stop them? I don't think so.\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, a lot of these are judgment questions. You had supported the war in Iraq before the invasion. What makes your...\nTRUMP: I did not support the war in Iraq.\nHOLT: In 2002...\nTRUMP: That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her, because she—frankly, I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.\nHOLT: My question is, since you supported it...\nTRUMP: Just—would you like to hear...\nHOLT: ... why is your—why is your judgment...\nTRUMP: Wait a minute. I was against the war in Iraq. Just so you put it out.\nHOLT: The record shows otherwise, but why—why was...\nTRUMP: The record does not show that.\nHOLT: Why was—is your judgment any...\nTRUMP: The record shows that I'm right. When I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anyone's asked me that, I said, very lightly, I don't know, maybe, who knows? Essentially. I then did an interview with Neil Cavuto. We talked about the economy is more important. I then spoke to Sean Hannity, which everybody refuses to call Sean Hannity. I had numerous conversations with Sean Hannity at Fox. And Sean Hannity said—and he called me the other day—and I spoke to him about it—he said you were totally against the war, because he was for the war.\nHOLT: Why is your judgment better than...\nTRUMP: And when he—excuse me. And that was before the war started. Sean Hannity said very strongly to me and other people—he's willing to say it, but nobody wants to call him. I was against the war. He said, you used to have fights with me, because Sean was in favor of the war.\nAnd I understand that side, also, not very much, because we should have never been there. But nobody called Sean Hannity. And then they did an article in a major magazine, shortly after the war started. I think in '04. But they did an article which had me totally against the war in Iraq.\nAnd one of your compatriots said, you know, whether it was before or right after, Trump was definitely—because if you read this article, there's no doubt. But if somebody—and I'll ask the press—if somebody would call up Sean Hannity, this was before the war started. He and I used to have arguments about the war. I said, it's a terrible and a stupid thing. It's going to destabilize the Middle East. And that's exactly what it's done. It's been a disaster.\nHOLT: My reference was to what you had said in 2002, and my question was...\nTRUMP: No, no. You didn't hear what I said.\nHOLT: Why is your judgment—why is your judgment any different than Mrs. Clinton's judgment?\nTRUMP: Well, I have much better judgment than she does. There's no question about that. I also have a much better temperament than she has, you know? [laughter]\nI have a much better—she spent—let me tell you—she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising—you know, they get Madison Avenue into a room, they put names—oh, temperament, let's go after—I think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is my temperament. I have a winning temperament. I know how to win. She does not have a...\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton?\nTRUMP: Wait. The AFL-CIO the other day, behind the blue screen, I don't know who you were talking to, Secretary Clinton, but you were totally out of control. I said, there's a person with a temperament that's got a problem.\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton?\nCLINTON: Whew, OK. [laughter]\nLet's talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald, first, NATO. You know, NATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5, and basically it says this: An attack on one is an attack on all. And you know the only time it's ever been invoked? After 9/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side.\nWith respect to Iran, when I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb. They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration. They had built covert facilities. They had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away.\nAnd we had sanctioned them. I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn't enough. So I spent a year-and-a-half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran.\nAnd we did drive them to the negotiating table. And my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot. That's diplomacy. That's coalition-building. That's working with other nations.\nThe other day, I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of Iran, and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship. He said, you know, if they taunted our sailors, I'd blow them out of the water and start another war. That's not good judgment.\nTRUMP: That would not start a war.\nCLINTON: That is not the right temperament to be commander-in- chief, to be taunted. And the worst part...\nTRUMP: No, they were taunting us.\nCLINTON: ... of what we heard Donald say has been about nuclear weapons. He has said repeatedly that he didn't care if other nations got nuclear weapons, Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia. It has been the policy of the United States, Democrats and Republicans, to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons. He even said, well, you know, if there were nuclear war in East Asia, well, you know, that's fine...\nTRUMP: Wrong.\nCLINTON: ... have a good time, folks.\nTRUMP: It's lies.\nCLINTON: And, in fact, his cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling. That is the number-one threat we face in the world. And it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material. So a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes, as far as I think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned.\nTRUMP: That line's getting a little bit old, I must say. I would like to...\nCLINTON: It's a good one, though. It well describes the problem. [laughter]\nTRUMP: It's not an accurate one at all. It's not an accurate one. So I just want to give a lot of things—and just to respond. I agree with her on one thing. The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your—your president thinks.\nNuclear is the single greatest threat. Just to go down the list, we defend Japan, we defend Germany, we defend South Korea, we defend Saudi Arabia, we defend countries. They do not pay us. But they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service and we're losing a fortune. That's why we're losing—we're losing—we lose on everything. I say, who makes these—we lose on everything. All I said, that it's very possible that if they don't pay a fair share, because this isn't 40 years ago where we could do what we're doing. We can't defend Japan, a behemoth, selling us cars by the million...\nHOLT: We need to move on.\nTRUMP: Well, wait, but it's very important. All I said was, they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out. We're a country that owes $20 trillion. They have to help us out.\nHOLT: Our last...\nTRUMP: As far as the nuclear is concerned, I agree. It is the single greatest threat that this country has.\nHOLT: Which leads to my next question, as we enter our last segment here on the, still on the subject of securing America. On nuclear weapons, President Obama reportedly considered changing the nation's longstanding policy on first use. Do you support the current policy? Mr. Trump, you have two minutes on that.\nTRUMP: Well, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, she's very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries. But Russia has been expanding their—they have a much newer capability than we do. We have not been updating from the new standpoint.\nI looked the other night. I was seeing B-52s, they're old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them. We are not—we are not keeping up with other countries. I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it. But I would certainly not do first strike.\nI think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it's over. At the same time, we have to be prepared. I can't take anything off the table. Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we're doing nothing there. China should solve that problem for us. China should go into North Korea. China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea.\nAnd by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think I've ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal. Iran is one of their biggest trading partners. Iran has power over North Korea.\nAnd when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea. And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places.\nAnd when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didn't you do that? Why didn't you add other things into the deal? One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash. Nobody's ever seen that before. That turned out to be wrong. It was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages. It certainly looks that way.\nSo you say to yourself, why didn't they make the right deal? This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history. The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems. All they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they don't have to do much.\nHOLT: Your two minutes is expired.\nTRUMP: And they're going to end up getting nuclear. I met with Bibi Netanyahu the other day. Believe me, he's not a happy camper.\nHOLT: All right. Mrs. Clinton, Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.\nCLINTON: Well, let me—let me start by saying, words matter. Words matter when you run for president. And they really matter when you are president. And I want to reassure our allies in Japan and South Korea and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them.\nIt is essential that America's word be good. And so I know that this campaign has caused some questioning and worries on the part of many leaders across the globe. I've talked with a number of them. But I want to—on behalf of myself, and I think on behalf of a majority of the American people, say that, you know, our word is good.\nIt's also important that we look at the entire global situation. There's no doubt that we have other problems with Iran. But personally, I'd rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be facing that.\nAnd Donald never tells you what he would do. Would he have started a war? Would he have bombed Iran? If he's going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to Iranian facilities that we never had before, then he should tell us what his alternative would be. But it's like his plan to defeat ISIS. He says it's a secret plan, but the only secret is that he has no plan.\nSo we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues. People around the word follow our presidential campaigns so closely, trying to get hints about what we will do. Can they rely on us? Are we going to lead the world with strength and in accordance with our values? That's what I intend to do. I intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on, both here at home and around the world, to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity, but also stand up to bullies, whether they're abroad or at home.\nWe cannot let those who would try to destabilize the world to interfere with American interests and security...\nHOLT: Your two minutes is...\nCLINTON: ... to be given any opportunities at all.\nHOLT: ... is expired.\nTRUMP: Lester, one thing I'd like to say.\nHOLT: Very quickly. Twenty seconds.\nTRUMP: I will go very quickly. But I will tell you that Hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat ISIS, which she could have defeated by never having it, you know, get going in the first place. Right now, it's getting tougher and tougher to defeat them, because they're in more and more places, more and more states, more and more nations.\nHOLT: Mr. Trump...\nTRUMP: And it's a big problem. And as far as Japan is concerned, I want to help all of our allies, but we are losing billions and billions of dollars. We cannot be the policemen of the world. We cannot protect countries all over the world...\nHOLT: We have just...\nTRUMP: ... where they're not paying us what we need.\nHOLT: We have just a few final questions...\nTRUMP: And she doesn't say that, because she's got no business ability. We need heart. We need a lot of things. But you have to have some basic ability. And sadly, she doesn't have that. All of the things that she's talking about could have been taken care of during the last 10 years, let's say, while she had great power. But they weren't taken care of. And if she ever wins this race, they won't be taken care of.\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, this year Secretary Clinton became the first woman nominated for president by a major party. Earlier this month, you said she doesn't have, quote, \"a presidential look.\" She's standing here right now. What did you mean by that?\nTRUMP: She doesn't have the look. She doesn't have the stamina. I said she doesn't have the stamina. And I don't believe she does have the stamina. To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.\nHOLT: The quote was, \"I just don't think she has the presidential look.\"\nTRUMP: You have—wait a minute. Wait a minute, Lester. You asked me a question. Did you ask me a question?\nYou have to be able to negotiate our trade deals. You have to be able to negotiate, that's right, with Japan, with Saudi Arabia. I mean, can you imagine, we're defending Saudi Arabia? And with all of the money they have, we're defending them, and they're not paying? All you have to do is speak to them. Wait. You have so many different things you have to be able to do, and I don't believe that Hillary has the stamina.\nHOLT: Let's let her respond.\nCLINTON: Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina. [applause]\nTRUMP: The world—let me tell you. Let me tell you. Hillary has experience, but it's bad experience. We have made so many bad deals during the last—so she's got experience, that I agree. [applause]\nBut it's bad, bad experience. Whether it's the Iran deal that you're so in love with, where we gave them $150 billion back, whether it's the Iran deal, whether it's anything you can—name—you almost can't name a good deal. I agree. She's got experience, but it's bad experience. And this country can't afford to have another four years of that kind of experience.\nHOLT: We are at—we are at the final question. [applause]\nCLINTON: Well, one thing. One thing, Lester.\nHOLT: Very quickly, because we're at the final question now.\nCLINTON: You know, he tried to switch from looks to stamina. But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs, and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers, who has said...\nTRUMP: I never said that.\nCLINTON: .... women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.\nTRUMP: I didn't say that.\nCLINTON: And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest. He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them. And he called this woman \"Miss Piggy.\" Then he called her \"Miss Housekeeping,\" because she was Latina. Donald, she has a name.\nTRUMP: Where did you find this? Where did you find this?\nCLINTON: Her name is Alicia Machado.\nTRUMP: Where did you find this?\nCLINTON: And she has become a U.S. citizen, and you can bet...\nTRUMP: Oh, really?\nCLINTON: ... she's going to vote this November.\nTRUMP: OK, good. Let me just tell you... [applause]\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, could we just take 10 seconds and then we ask the final question...\nTRUMP: You know, Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials. Some of it's said in entertainment. Some of it's said—somebody who's been very vicious to me, Rosie O'Donnell, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her.\nBut you want to know the truth? I was going to say something...\nHOLT: Please very quickly.\nTRUMP: ... extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, \"I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice.\" But she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me, many of which are absolutely untrue. They're untrue. And they're misrepresentations.\nAnd I will tell you this, Lester: It's not nice. And I don't deserve that.\nBut it's certainly not a nice thing that she's done. It's hundreds of millions of ads. And the only gratifying thing is, I saw the polls come in today, and with all of that money...\nHOLT: We have to move on to the final question.\nTRUMP: ... $200 million is spent, and I'm either winning or tied, and I've spent practically nothing. [applause]\nHOLT: One of you will not win this election. So my final question to you tonight, are you willing to accept the outcome as the will of the voters? Secretary Clinton?\nCLINTON: Well, I support our democracy. And sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. But I certainly will support the outcome of this election.\nAnd I know Donald's trying very hard to plant doubts about it, but I hope the people out there understand: This election's really up to you. It's not about us so much as it is about you and your families and the kind of country and future you want. So I sure hope you will get out and vote as though your future depended on it, because I think it does.\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, very quickly, same question. Will you accept the outcome as the will of the voters?\nTRUMP: I want to make America great again. We are a nation that is seriously troubled. We're losing our jobs. People are pouring into our country.\nThe other day, we were deporting 800 people. And perhaps they passed the wrong button, they pressed the wrong button, or perhaps worse than that, it was corruption, but these people that we were going to deport for good reason ended up becoming citizens. Ended up becoming citizens. And it was 800. And now it turns out it might be 1,800, and they don't even know.\nHOLT: Will you accept the outcome of the election?\nTRUMP: Look, here's the story. I want to make America great again. I'm going to be able to do it. I don't believe Hillary will. The answer is, if she wins, I will absolutely support her. [applause]\nHOLT: All right. Well, that is going to do it for us. That concludes our debate for this evening, a spirit one. We covered a lot of ground, not everything as I suspected we would.\nThe next presidential debates are scheduled for October 9th at Washington University in St. Louis and October 19th at the University of Nevada Las Vegas. The conversation will continue.\nA reminder. The vice presidential debate is scheduled for October 4th at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia.

Shuster, R-PA, and 3 cosponsors)\nWhile H.R. 5303 would advance some of the Administration's policies and principles including building a foundation for long-term economic growth, addressing significant risks to public safety, strengthening the Nation's resilience to the impacts of climate change, and protecting and restoring our environment, it should be improved with additional reforms and elimination of problematic provisions. Additionally, the Administration believes that the Congress should quickly pass targeted funding to support Flint, Michigan, whether in the Water Resources Development Act or another vehicle.\nH.R. 5303 would authorize the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) to construct several new projects that the Administration has recommended for authorization. New project and study authorizations should be limited to those most likely to provide high economic or environmental returns to the Nation or address a significant risk to public safety within the Corps' three main mission areas: flood and storm damage reduction; commercial navigation; and aquatic ecosystem restoration. The Administration supports provisions in the bill to de-authorize projects that no longer meet the Nation's needs.\nCreating and maintaining the Nation's water resources infrastructure is a shared responsibility between Federal and non-Federal beneficiaries and requires that the management, use, protection, and restoration of our water resources continue to evolve to meet the Nation's future needs. The Administration welcomes the efforts in the bill to expand options for non-federal project partners who want to cover more of, or all of, the costs to study or construct a Corps project.\nThis legislation impedes Administration efforts to both enhance resilience and increase public-private collaboration and private investment in environmental restoration by establishing a confusing and duplicative mitigation bank program overseen by the RESTORE Council, which includes Governors from only the five states along the Gulf Coast.\nThe Administration urges the Congress to enact an important reform of the laws governing the Inland Waterways Trust Fund, which a proposal in the President's FY 2017 Budget would accomplish. The proposal would raise $1.3 billion in additional revenue over 10 years from the commercial users of these waterways, which would help finance future capital investment and maintenance work on these waterways that will benefit these users and support economic growth.\nThe Administration remains committed to working with the Congress on bipartisan legislation to address the Nation's water resources challenges.", "timestamp": "2016-09-26", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 5303 - Water Resources Development Act of 2016"}
{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119006", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n**Please see below for a correction, marked with an asterisk.\n1:15 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Happy Monday. Hope you all had a pleasant weekend. I do not have any announcements at the top so we can go straight to your questions.\nKevin, do you want to start?\nQ: Sure, thank you, Josh. I wanted to ask about tonight's debate, and, in particular, how does the President plan to watch it? With the family? With staff? By himself? What may be his biggest concern going into the debate? And does -- there's been a lot of talk about what -- the role of a moderator and whether the moderator should be an aggressive fact-checker. Does the President have any thoughts about that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I anticipate that this fall Monday evening will be similar to other fall Monday evenings in the White House residence, which is that the President will be working tonight with the television on in the background. I think the one difference will be instead of Monday Night Football, there will be a little more politics being discussed in the context of the debate.\nAnd the President had an opportunity to answer some questions last week from ABC where he talked about how important it is, he believes, for Secretary Clinton to talk about those aspects of her career I think provide people -- provide some insight so that people understand exactly what motivates her to seek the office of the presidency. And he obviously believes that she's got a strong case to make. That's why he's spoken publicly so many times in support of her campaign.\nWith regard to the moderators, there's plenty of advice that's going around to both the candidates and the moderator. I haven't spoken to the President about any advice he may have for Mr. Holt tonight, but I think anybody that's spent any time around Lester knows that he is somebody who is always well prepared. And I suspect that having spent a decent portion of the last several decades in broadcast journalism that he'll perform well even under the intense spotlight of a presidential debate.\nQ: Wanted to ask about Aleppo as well. It seems like the news reports are indicating that it becomes more dire by the hour. And can you provide some update of what the administration is doing to try to stop the carnage? And is it warming to the prospects of expanding the sanctions regime, as some in Congress want to do?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, the situation in Syria continues to worsen. And the situation in Syria has been terrible and the bloodshed sickening. But we've seen that, over the weekend, it just got worse. And I think anybody who's following these news reports, whether you're an official with the United States government or just a human being reading the news, understanding the toll that this violence is taking on the lives of so many innocent people, you've got to be deeply concerned about it. And the President certainly is.\nWhat we have seen from the Assad regime and the Russians is a concerted campaign to strike civilian targets to bomb civilians into submission. And it's taken a variety of forms. And over the weekend, we saw the specific targeting of the headquarters, or staging areas used by the White Helmets -- the relief organization, the first responders in Syria -- that are just trying to provide for the basic needs and safety and well-being of citizens who are caught in the crossfire.\nThere were also military strikes against the facilities that ensure that civilians in eastern Aleppo have access to drinking water. The idea of weaponizing access to a clean water supply for civilians is beyond the pale. And people of good conscience around the world should speak up, and are speaking up. And I know that there was a vigorous discussion about this at the U.N. Security Council just last night. And I certainly would encourage you to take a look at the remarks from Ambassador Power, where she talked about this situation and tried to make a very forceful case about the consequences of this situation for the rest of the international community, and how important it is for the international community to speak with one voice in condemning these actions and not allowing these norms to be eroded.\nIt's clear what the consequences will be for Russia as well. They are drawing themselves even deeper into a sectarian conflict inside of Syria. They're increasingly isolated in the international community. They're going to have to expend significant additional resources to shore up their efforts there. These are resources that are not in ample supply in Russia. We know that their economy is struggling and that their currency reserves have plummeted in just the last couple of years. And we know that poses a risk to Russia and their presence not just in Syria, it also poses a risk to Russia back home, because we know that this kind of violence and chaos that's being sown in Syria only fuels extremism in Syria and around the world.\nBut this is the choice that Russia has made, and it's one that they'll have to account for.\nQ: Any warming to the expansion of sanctions regime regarding supporters or entities that do business with al-Assad?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, sanctions has always been a tool on the table available to the United States. The concern we have with the current congressional proposal that's being debated is that it would deploy those sanctions essentially unilaterally. And what we have found is that the sanctions tool is most effectively used when it is deployed in close coordination with our allies and partners around the world.\nBy carefully coordinating the implementation of sanctions, we can ensure that these sanctions essentially serve as a force multiplier -- that the kinds of financial penalties that can be imposed by the United States are multiplied when they are imposed in close coordination with our allies and partners. And that's what we have typically sought to do.\nWhat we've also refrained from doing is discussing in detail -- or discussing in advance the detailed aspects of our sanctions strategy, primarily because we don't want to telegraph our intentions so as to allow the targets of those sanctions to take actions that would circumvent our actions.\nSo if and when we have made a policy decision to move forward with imposing additional financial penalties against the Assad regime, or other entities that work closely with the Assad regime, that's something that we'll discuss only after that decision has been made and those penalties have been imposed.\nAyesha.\nQ: A little more on Syria. You said that Russia will have to kind of answer for their actions, but I wonder, who is Russia going to answer to? And with this -- and I was just trying to -- does the administration have a specific plan B now that this ceasefire has failed? Is there going to be a change in course? Is there going to be a change in actions or approach from the administration? Are there new things that you guys are considering doing -- taking in Syria?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have any announcements at this point. But I think with regard to Russia, what I would say is simply that Russia will have to account for their actions in the context of the consequences they are likely to provoke. Russia is further isolated in the international community. And, again, I think that was on display in rather vivid detail at the United Nations Security Council meeting last night. Russia is going to have to invest more in their efforts inside of Syria in order to prop up the presence that they have there, in order to further shore up the Assad regime.\nAnd Russia is going to have to deal with the fall out because their actions are fueling extremism, not just in Syria and not just in the region, but around the world, including in Russia. And those are actions that I think you'd have a hard time arguing are in their national interest. They certainly don't seem part of a coordinated strategy. But, again, that's something that the Russians themselves will have to account for.\nQ: I wanted to ask a question in light of an FBI report that violent crime in the U.S. increased in 2015, so I wanted to get an administration response to that. And also, in general, in the past couple of days we've seen -- we saw -- well, today, we saw shootings in Houston that I think nine were injured. We saw a shooting over the weekend at a mall in Washington -- I think that may have killed five. These shootings, they continue to happen. It seems like they get attention but not as much -- maybe there might be a little uptick in interest if it seems like it's connected to international terrorism, but other than that, they seem to happen and fade quickly. Like, is the administration concerned that the country is becoming somewhat numb to the violence and to these types of shootings?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we'll start first with the statistics. What the numbers indicate is that since President Obama took office in 2009, the violent crime rate in the United States has fallen 15 percent and the violent crime rate in the United States is near historic lows. And there's ample evidence to indicate that even in those communities where we saw an increase last year in 2015, so far in 2016, in some of those cities we've seen violent crime fall. So I think this is an indication that the country is safer, as measured by the violent crime rate, than it was in any year under the previous four Presidents.\nNow, there, of course, is more that we can do to fight violent crime. The President has advocated additional resources for our men and women in law enforcement. The President has advocated for improved training, so not just hiring additional police officers but also improved training and resources that can be used to make our men and women in law enforcement even more effective than they already are. The President has advocated for criminal justice reform. And there's ample evidence to indicate that effective criminal justice reform would further reduce the recidivism rate in this country, which would have a positive impact in reducing violence.\nSo we've made important progress in this area. The country is safer under President Obama than it has been under previous Presidents, as measured by the violent crime rate. But the President believes that there is more that we can and should do. And there's no area where the President has been more outspoken than taking action on common-sense gun safety measures that would make it harder for criminals and others who shouldn't have them to buy a gun.\nAnd we have never made the case that passing a law like one that would close the background check loophole would prevent every act of gun violence, but there's plenty of evidence to indicate that it could have a positive impact on reducing incidents of gun violence. And we could do all of that without undermining the constitutional right of law-abiding Americans.\nSo the President is going to continue to be outspoken on that, and he will moving forward.\nWith regard to the two shooting incidents that you referred to over the last 72 hours or so, I'd refer you to local law enforcement in both situations for a specific update on the investigation. I believe that the FBI in Washington State has indicated that, thus far, there is no connection to international terrorism at this point. But that investigation continues. And I know that the local law enforcement authorities have indicated that they have a suspect in custody. So that investigation continues.\nBut this cycle that you've cited of a mass shooting, intense public interest for short period of time, and then attention migrating to other places is not a new one, and one we've seen in this country that even pre-dates President Obama's inauguration. And it's one the President has expressed deep frustration about. But, ultimately, as the President has indicated, enough citizens are going to have to demonstrate enough passion for this issue to persuade the Congress to pursue a different approach and actually consider common-sense measures that would protect Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans but do more to ensure that -- or to at least make it harder for individuals who shouldn't be able to get a gun from getting one.\nMichelle.\nQ: Is the President going to try anything else in terms of gun violence?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any announcements at this point, but the President and his team are always reviewing available options. But the President made a big announcement at the beginning of this year about using his executive authority to make it harder for people to obtain a firearm at a gun show, for example, without undergoing a background check.\nAnd really, this is a situation where the ball is in the court of the United States Congress. And, ultimately, they're going to have to hear from the American people that this is a priority. That I think is the only way we're going to be able to get the attention of a sufficient number of members of Congress to take serious action.\nQ: Even at this point, you're not ruling out that he might take additional executive action?\nMR. EARNEST: I would not rule that out.\nQ: And we've heard the administration use words now relating to Russia's actions in Syria like \"barbarism,\" \"unacceptable,\" \"outrage.\" But you've also said that trying to forge a ceasefire will be a test for Russia. Haven't they already failed that test miserably?\nMR. EARNEST: Thus far, I think that's fair to say. When you have a country that's using its military might to prop up a murderous regime, target the water supply of civilians, to target the headquarters that are used by first responders, to target refugee camps, to target humanitarian aid convoys or, in any of those instances, to support a regime that's doing exactly that -- I think that indicates that they failed the test. I think the question now is, at what point is Russia prepared to try a different strategy?\nAgain, the strategy that they are currently pursuing is one that only further deepens their involvement in a sectarian conflict, and it's hard to see how that benefits Russia's national security or benefits the Russian people. Our concern is that furthering that sectarian conflict only fuels extremism that poses a threat to the region and the world.\nAnd that's why the President has worked hard to build and lead a 67-member coalition that is applying significant pressure to ISIL and to other extremists that are operating inside of Syria. That's the way to keep the American people safe and to protect our national security interests. But it's unfortunate that the Russians are pursuing a strategy that is in such direct conflict with that.\nQ: So when you hear the Foreign Minister say that there's still a chance that a ceasefire could be worked out, do you at all take those words seriously?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think we've gotten to the point, Michelle, where we evaluate Russia's approach to this situation not by listening to the words of their ambassador but by watching the actions of their military. And, unfortunately, in recent days, we've seen their military support or directly engage in the kinds of acts that are roundly condemned by the civilized world. That is not indicative of a country that's serious about pursuing peace, or even about pursuing an approach that seems to be in the national security interest of their country and the world.\nQ: So at what point do you say what they exhibited shows no seriousness at all toward establishing a ceasefire? And why even try -- like, why go through the motions if they've already done this, this, and this?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Michelle, I don't think the administration is going to be in a position of apologizing for pursuing peace. The truth is, in the context of the negotiations that we've already engaged in with the Russians, the United States and our international partners have not been in a position where we have had to make any concessions. It was because of our intense skepticism and doubts about Russia's credibility that we insisted the Russians live up to their commitments before the United States would follow through on the actions we know the Russians are seeking, and that was military cooperation.\nSo the United States has not had to make any concessions in order to pursue peace. We were quite clear from the beginning that our efforts against extremists was going to continue unabated, and that if Russia wanted to cooperate with those efforts they would have to demonstrate a commitment to reducing the violence and allowing the flow of humanitarian assistance to reach those who were in need. They haven't lived up to that bargain, which means they have not gotten the kind of military cooperation that they would like to see. But the United States and our coalition partners have continued, unabated, in our campaign to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL, and to apply pressure and take other extremists off the battlefield as well.\nQ: Okay. And we heard the President's advice for Hillary Clinton for the debate. Does he or the administration have any advice for Donald Trump? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Even if we did I'm confident it would go unheard.\nQ: All right, thanks.\nQ: Hi, Josh. Can we talk about JASTA? Does the White House have a latest count on congressional support for the bill? Does it look like it's going to, as Mitch McConnell says, override the President's veto, for the first time in his presidency, this week?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not here to make any predictions or to provide any vote counts. We continue to make our case to members of Congress. We've acknowledged from the beginning that this was going to be an uphill fight, but there have been some high-profile members of Congress that had indicated some openness to our position and some unease with the consequence of moving forward with the legislation that Congress has passed.\nSo you saw Congressman Thornberry from Texas write a letter -- he's somebody who is not somebody we regularly look to, to support the President's agenda in Congress -- but in this case, he stood up, to his credit, and make a principled case for outlining his concerns with the bill.\nWe saw a similar letter from Congressman Adam Smith. He is a Democrat from Washington State. He is somebody who is a more consistent supporter of the President's policies, but he's arrived at some similar conclusions. And I think that's an indication of the principled nature of the position that the President has argued. But as we know, two members, two votes is not enough to sustain the President's veto in the United States House of Representatives, so there's some important work that we have ahead of us.\nFortunately, Congressman Thornberry and Congressman Smith are viewed as two influential members of the House Republican Conference and the House Democratic Caucus respectively. They are well regarded for their experience and knowledge of these issues. And hopefully they're making a case among their colleagues as well. We certainly would benefit from their advocacy.\nQ: Has the White House spoken with the Saudis to discuss the possibility of the override?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have an update on those kinds of conversations. Obviously, I think as I acknowledged last week, given the significant consequences for our country's relationship with Saudi Arabia, you won't be surprised to hear that the Saudi government has been in touch with the Obama administration about this piece of legislation. But I would also hasten to add we've heard from a lot of other countries, too, who have expressed similar concerns about the potential impact of this bill. And there was a letter that was provided by the European Union voicing their deep concerns about the impact that this legislation would have on the U.S. relationship with countries all around the world.\nSo it's not just our partners in Saudi Arabia who are concerned about this bill. Some of our closest allies in Europe are deeply concerned about it, too. And this is, again, consistent with the argument that we have made that we're not just concerned about the impact that this bill would have on the U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia; we're deeply concerned about the impact that this bill would have on the U.S. relationship with countries all around the world. And that's why the President vetoed it at the end of last week. And that's the basis for the argument that we're making to members of Congress that they should sustain the President's veto.\nQ: On the crime bill, is the President disappointed overall in the idea that violent crime has gone up by 3.9 percent, even though it's still at historically low levels? Is he disappointed by that?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the President is gratified that the United States is currently in a period where violent crime is at or near historic lows. Is there more that we could do to try to prevent more violent crime? Yes. And that means we can provide additional resources to our law enforcement. We can pass some common-sense gun safety legislation. We can certainly reform our criminal justice system in a way that would have a positive impact on recidivism rates.\nSo there certainly is more that we can do, and the President has put those kinds of efforts at the front of his domestic agenda. So the President believes there's more that we can do, but he certainly is gratified that our country is benefitting from historically lows or near-historic -- violent crime rates at or near historic lows.\nQ: Okay. And then just on the debate. When was the last time the President spoke with Hillary Clinton? And will he be calling her before to wish her good luck tonight?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any calls the President has planned for today. But I know the President had an opportunity to see Secretary Clinton a couple of times not last week but the week before. I don't know that they had a detailed debate strategy discussion, but the President has got some experience of going head to head with Secretary Clinton in the context of a debate, and she performed quite well in those settings. And I think the President expects her to do the same tonight.\nJordan.\nQ: Josh, the President's veto message made a pretty passionate case against the bill. So I'm wondering if he is going to --\nMR. EARNEST: Are you saying that his spokesperson hasn't? (Laughter.)\nQ: Not a comment on you. (Laughter.) It was three pages. But given that, is he going to get personally involved in lobbying members of Congress against the bill?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I don't have a detailed accounting of the President's involvement in this lobbying effort, but the President's views are well known and the President has had an opportunity to convey those to members of Congress at different points. So there's no doubt about the position that the administration has taken, and there's no doubt about the personal views of the President when it comes to this issue. And I think he made that quite clear not just in the act of vetoing the legislation, but in explaining in that statement exactly why he had chosen to veto the bill.\nSo there's no ambiguity about the President's position. What the President says in private is reflected in his public statements on this. And our vote count would be a little bit higher if those who expressed some unease in private with the impact of the bill had that show up in their public votes as well.\nQ: So do you think some of these folks who are wavering in private, especially Democrats, don't you think it would maybe help them to make that position public if they got a personal call or conversation with the President?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, maybe. You can also imagine a situation where these members of Congress would say, I didn't take this position because the President asked me to, I took this position because it's the right one.\nSo each individual member of Congress has their own approach to these kinds of questions. But for anybody who is wondering exactly what the President's position is on this bill, I think we have been unambiguous about the deep concern that he has about the impact that this bill would have on our relationship with countries around the world, including the relationship the United States enjoys with some of our closest allies.\nI'll just point out something that I've pointed out before. The President is not the only national security expert in America to harbor these concerns. There are other high-profile Republican legal and national security experts who have expressed their concerns with this bill. Even President George W. Bush's Attorney General, Michael Mukasey, has expressed his concern about this bill and has indicated publically what those concerns are. So we certainly welcome that show of bipartisan support from a variety of national security experts that have made clear they have concerns with this, too.\nQ: Lastly, on the CR. I know last week you expressed some frustration that Flint aid wasn't included in the package. Is that something that, if it's not included in the CR, that's sort of a red line for you guys where you're not going to sign it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Jordan, I think what I indicated yesterday is -- not yesterday, it was Friday -- I indicated Friday the President's view that Congress has some more work to do. And he is disappointed that -- after months of suggesting that Congress did have an important role to play in providing significant assistance to Flint and other communities that have been enduring lead contamination in their drinking water, that there is a role for Congress to play in helping those communities address that problem, the President has been making that case for months and is disappointed that we haven't seen the kind of congressional response that the President believes this situation deserves.\nSo there are plenty of Democrats that are up there advocating for the kind of approach that the President believes is appropriate for Congress to pursue, and we just need to get some Republicans committed to this effort, too. And if we do, we'll be able to mobilize the kind of response that, frankly, the American people and the people of Flint readily deserve.\nJames. Nice to see you today.\nQ: Josh, thank you very much. Nice to be back with you. First, on the FBI report about crime statistics. As you know, that is an annual report which compiles statistics from I assume tens of thousands of jurisdictions -- lots of them, anyway. In responding to the findings of the report, you just declared that America is safer under President Obama than it has been under any of the last four Presidents, a period that will take us back to 1981. Since law enforcement is chiefly a local endeavor, are you asserting some causative role for President Obama in the historically low crime rates that we have today?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there certainly have been some steps that the Obama administration has taken to support local law enforcement. But I've routinely been asked this question the other way, which is, why hasn't the Obama administration done more to impose some of our policy solutions on local law enforcement agencies? And at each turn, I've noted the longstanding tradition in the United States of delegating responsibility for law enforcement to the local level. And the President believes --\nQ: If we could stick with the question that I asked, and not the one you are frequently asked. Are you asserting some causative role for President Obama in the crime levels for which you just seemed to take credit for?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't think that there is any one direct causation that we can draw, but I think the President is proud of the positive contribution to this effort that his administration has made.\nQ: Since you asserted that the numbers show that Americans are safer from violent crime now than they have been at any time in the last 35 years, is it safe for us also to conclude that Americans are safer from mass shootings now than at any time?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the data indicates -- well, I don't know what the data indicates. I guess we'd have to ask the FBI about that. So we can go take a look at the numbers and see what they say.\nQ: And lastly, on JASTA, when historians look back on this episode and seek to re-create everything that was going on which culminated in the President's veto and, perhaps, may yet see an override or further developments of one kind or another, will they justifiably see that there was at work something that we might -- for lack of a better term -- call the Saudi lobby?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't know. I mean, I guess --\nQ: We hear about the Israel lobbies, right? All the time. Is there a Saudi lobby?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I know that there's been a lot of public reporting about the Saudi government trying to mobilize their friends and allies to express their opinion about this bill. With regard to the President's decision, I think we've been quite clear that his decision is motivated by the impact that this bill would have not just on Saudi Arabia but on countries around the world. So I don't know -- I can't speak to what extent there was an aggressive lobbying effort here in the administration, but based on the public reporting I've seen, there appears to be a rather intense effort by the Saudi government to lobby Capitol Hill, and it remains to be seen how successful that will be.\nQ: Does the President believe in the existence of either an Israel lobby or a Saudi lobby?\nMR. EARNEST: I will say that this is the first time that I've heard the words, Saudi lobby. Maybe that means I need to get out more, but it's the first time that I've heard it.\nQ: Does he believe in the existence of an Israel lobby?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't asked him that question. I think it is clear that the Israeli government has worked hard to build relationships here in Washington that allow them to exert some influence on Capitol Hill. But I don't know if that crosses the threshold of being described as a lobby or not, or just a country that is a close ally of the United States and has friends on both sides of the aisle. That clearly is true.\nRon.\nQ: In terms of timing, how much time do you think you have with this veto override?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm certainly no expert when it comes to legislative procedure, so I'd probably refer you to one of my counterparts in Leader McConnell's office to describe how long it will be before the Senate takes action to consider the President's veto and to hold a vote to override it. From there, of course, it will go straight to the House of Representatives and I'm not sure how long that takes, and I'm also not sure how long it would then take the House to act on it.\nQ: We're talking, do you think, in terms of trying to even discuss this matter with legislators, you obviously have some sense of urgency, though, that you don't have unlimited amounts of time. You have days?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, our approach has been to make a forceful case to members of Congress. I don't know how long we have to take. Just as somebody who observes the legislative process, sometimes things that seem like they should take a long time in Capitol Hill get done really quickly, and things that seem like they should get done really quickly take an inordinate amount of time. So I don't know how long this will take, but certainly, since the President received the bill 13 days ago, we have been\n-- 13 or 14 days ago -- we have been engaged in an effort to persuade members of Congress that they should sustain the President's veto and consider a different approach.\nQ: And similarly, with the CR, do you -- what is the status of that, as you perceive it, in terms of timing? And we know there's a deadline, but --\nMR. EARNEST: We do know there's a deadline.\nQ: -- do you see this coming together? Do you see huge obstacles? How engaged is the White House in the --\nMR. EARNEST: I'm quite reluctant to predict congressional outcomes these days. There is a deadline looming before Congress, September 30th. That's the end of the fiscal year. And it seems like at least every year of the Obama presidency, we've spent some portion of the last week in September worrying whether or not Congress was going to do its job and get its act together and ensure that the government would be funded and not shut down.\nUnfortunately, Republicans who promised to get Congress moving again if they were handed the reins of the Congress have broken that promise and they have failed. And we, once again, here are four days before the deadline, and we're publicly wondering if Congress is going to fulfill their most basic responsibility, and that is are they going to succeed in passing a budget to keep the government open.\nAnd what we have seen time and time again is a reliance on the part of Republicans to try to do things on party-line votes. And that just doesn't work. And I think it accounts for so many of their failures over the course of the last several years. They're going to have to work with Democrats in both the House and the Senate, it appears, to pass this budget. So they better get to work.\nQ: And just to clarify something. Charlotte -- is the Department of Justice still just monitoring the situation there, or is there now an \"investigation\" of the Scott shooting?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't seen an announcement from the Department of Justice about an investigation, but if there's an announcement it will come from them.\nQ: Because there were some statements from some community activists there that they were under the impression that there was now an investigation underway.\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't seen that statement from the Department of Justice, but you can check with them about the status.\nQ: And just lastly, on the debate tonight, you said, you know, it will be on in the background and not ESPN, or -- is too much being made of this whole thing, do you thing? Is that the point? You said the President -- is this your sense of the coverage, which I'm sure you're aware of and all that --\nMR. EARNEST: It's hard to escape.\nQ: Do you think too much is being made of this whole moment in the campaign?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I wouldn't say that. This is an important moment in the campaign. And anybody that's worked on a campaign at any level understands how significant candidate debates are. And it's an opportunity for the candidates to square off and to speak for themselves in answering questions and describing their experience and their vision and their priorities.\nAnd, look, there hasn't been a lot of space for that in the context of this presidential election. So this is a rather unique opportunity for that kind of discussion to take place, and I think people are quite interested to see -- to tune in and see how the individual candidates handle themselves in this setting.\nQ: And it comes at a time when there's a lot of reporting suggesting that the polls have tightened almost into a deadlock. And I know we can argue the merits of polls or not polls, but certainly it is important that the public perception is that the race is tightening now. Is that what you're -- you can see that. And is there any level of concern -- the White House, the President -- about this state of the race, if you will?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, if reports about tightening polls convince more people to tune into the debate and educate themselves about the positions taken by the individual candidates, and impress upon voters the need to be engaged in the political debate in this country, that's a good thing. I can't speak to the accuracy of the polls. I don't know if they're accurate or not.\nQ: So you don't know whether the race has tightened or not?\nMR. EARNEST: I do not. You've got plenty of polling analysts that are making good money offering that kind of advice to all of you.\nWhat I will say is that the President -- regardless of what the polls say, the stakes in the election are high. And whether the polls indicate a nail-biter or a blowout, people should be tuned in. People should be focused on the debates, and people should cast a vote regardless of which candidate you support. Because the next President of the United States is going to have a lot of influence over the future of the country. And the President has made quite clear what his views are and who he's supporting. But, look, if there are more people involved, that's only a good thing for the country.\nQ: Do you have any preview of the President's travel? October is just four or five days away, and you said twice a week he'd be out there.\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any travel announcements yet, but stay tuned and we'll have some more details.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, what will President Obama be saying about the Dakota access pipeline in his speech today?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Mark, as it relates to that specific project, there obviously is a review that's being conducted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to evaluate the most effective way to move forward. I would not expect an extensive discussion of that specific project in the President's remarks.\nThere has been an effort on the part of the EPA and the Department of Interior to go back and review more broadly the procedure for soliciting input from Native populations across the United States for projects like this. And I think that does reflect a commitment on the part of the Obama administration to strengthen the relationship between the federal government and tribal governments across the country.\nSo I don't know if the President will talk about that at length either. It's not really the kind of topic that is going to bring an audience to their feet, but it certainly is the kind of issue that the people in attendance at the Tribal Nations Summit are interested in. And I think the announcement of that review was welcomed by tribal leaders across the country.\nQ: Does President Obama have a view on the pipeline, or is he waiting for the results of the review?\nMR. EARNEST: With regard to the actual -- to the Dakota access pipeline, that's something that will be determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in consultation with *the EPA and the Department of Interior. So I've not heard the President express an opinion about that particular project.\nQ: Any readout on the conference call with the rabbis today?\nMR. EARNEST: The President is doing a conference call with rabbis today in honor of the upcoming celebration of the Jewish New Year. I didn't hear how the call went, but we'll see if we can get you some information about it.\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, President Obama took action as he laid out to stop imminent slaughter in Benghazi, took action to help the Yazidis in a limited way. Has the President rule out any kind of intervention or action in Aleppo?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President is continuing to get advice from his national security team, including from the military leaders at the Department of Defense reviewing all of the available options. I think what is unique to the situation in Aleppo is that the bloody attacks that are being waged there are being carried out in a heavily populated, urban area, where there are a large number of innocent civilians caught in the crossfire.\nThe two situations that you cited, the Yazidis in Iraq were obviously is a situation where they were on Sinjar Mountain, and there were some approaching ISIL fighters that were taken off the battlefield, and that was able to protect Yazidi population.\nIn Benghazi, the President has talked about how important it was to make a decision in advance of the Gaddafi regime's military forces reaching the city. And so the strikes that were taken there to protect the innocent population that Gaddafi had vowed to slaughter in Benghazi were carried out in advance of the military reaching the city.\nObviously the situation in Aleppo is different. You have a bombing campaign being waged by the Assad regime and by the Russians that is taking place in densely populated urban area without regard to civilian casualties. And that certainly would make a U.S. military intervention in that specific campaign significantly more complicated than the two examples you cited.\nQ: So you're saying too difficult or too late, circumstantially, to intervene?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not ruling anything out. The President is going to continue to rely on advice from his national security team, including from his military commanders, including those who are closely following the situation on the ground inside of Syria. But I'm just trying to draw a distinction between the two other examples of military intervention that you cited in illustrating why they're different than the situation the President and the world now faces.\nQ: You've talked extensively in this room about how -- on or off the table really at this point. Diplomacy is your path forward, a political decision has to be made. The situation being so acute in Aleppo, as you've described -- bombing waterways, U.N. says using bunker buster bombs to blow up underground hospitals and bomb shelters -- in targeting the same kind of civil society that the administration is arguing should be involved in negotiations in the future, if you're targeting and eliminating populations who would be at that table, how can you still support credibly that that's your policy diplomatically to lead to negotiations without defending those people?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Margaret, you are right that it is very difficult to engage diplomatically, and it's very difficult to follow through on specific diplomatically negotiated solutions while what you're describing is taking place. That's why all along, throughout the talks that we've had with the Russians, we've insisted that there be a protracted period of calm and that the steady flow of humanitarian assistance is able to move into those communities that need it the most. That has always been essentially the precondition for any sort of negotiated cooperation between the United States and Russia.\nQ: Didn't they provide their answer to that proposal? I mean, with the bombings that you've seen in the past few days? The French ambassador at the U.N. and the French ambassador here in Washington is basically saying the Russians have shown us they either can't or won't deliver Assad. But you disagree? You think they can and possibly will still deliver Assad?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the question right now, Margaret, is are they willing to live up the commitments that they previously made. Obviously the doubt about that grows every day, particularly as we see those attacks worsen. And, yes, there continue to be questions about whether or not Russia is capable of or willing to exercise influence over the Assad regime to reduce the violence inside of Syria. There are doubts about that, and those doubts only grow as these attacks worsen.\nSo, no, there's not been much that I've had to say today or even over the last several days that sound like they are defending Russia's capabilities or credibility. If anything, the doubts harbored by the administration about Russia and their intent are growing.\nQ: Is there any feeling of urgency given how bloody and brutal this new campaign is in Aleppo? And when will we get a decision on some of those things are being debated?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I -- \"debated\" is not a word that I used. I think this is an issue --\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nMR. EARNEST: Look, this is an issue that the President and his team have been discussing and focused on and worried about and concerned about for many years now. And like I said at the top, the situation in Syria, as bad as it is, only continues to worsen in some of the most unthinkable ways. This idea that there are Assad regime military forces, or even Russia forces, that are using enhanced or more powerful weapons to try to bomb hospitals or even daycare centers, playgrounds I think they were describing in some of these reports, that were moved underground to try to protect innocent children -- the idea that first responders, the White Helmets, as they're described, would be targeted, or a humanitarian aid convoy would be targeted -- it's sickening. It's beyond the pale.\nAnd it's not just morally questionable, at best; I think we can say it's immoral to target a humanitarian aid convoy. But it also is in conflict with the stated goal and strategy that the Russians have laid out.\nSo, look, I'm not going to stand up here and defend Russia's credibility. If anything, I spent most of the last week or so raising doubts about it. But, again --\nQ: But you're giving them the benefit of the doubt.\nMR. EARNEST: We're not giving them anything. And I think that's the important thing for people to understand --\nQ: Have you taken the offer off the table to restart negotiations with the potential of having military coordination in the future?\nMR. EARNEST: No. The negotiations haven't started. I'm not sure that they're ongoing right now. But it's important for people to --\nQ: But the offer stands.\nMR. EARNEST: That's not a concession. Seeking peace is not a concession. Seeking peace is our goal. We're trying to --\nQ: Right, coordination was the leverage. That's still an option?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, coordination is what Russia says is what they want. And it will not be provided by the United States until they deliver on the commitments that they have made. And they have not delivered on those commitments. If anything, they have walked back from them.\nSo the United States has not been in the position where we are providing anything to the Russians. I think the question right now on the part of the United States is, what is it that we can do to build a movement toward peace. And that search has been rather fruitless in the last few days.\nQ: On sanctions, when you were asked earlier about the congressional proposal, you said it wouldn't be effective if it's purely unilateral. Is the administration in negotiations or in any kind of proposal conversation with any of its allies to go ahead -- because obviously it wouldn't go through the U.N. But is there any kind of coordination with France, with Britain, with other powers in the EU to try to leverage sanctions -- where you might get people to sign up?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I can't speak to the details of the kind of diplomatic engagements that are ongoing with our allies. And I know that Secretary Kerry, over the weekend, had an opportunity to meet with -- or have a conversation with some of our European allies about the situation in Syria. I'll let the State Department give a readout in terms of describing how prominently that question of sanctions featured in that discussion.\nBut it is certainly accurate to say that the United States continues to engage deeply with our allies. And there are a variety of potential strategies that are discussed in each of those conversations.\nQ: But, respectfully and not to put too fine a point on it, though, I mean, it's all based on rhetoric at this point. There's a lot of rhetoric. There's a lot of oratory. But there isn't at this point anything you can say that's being considered the have any kind of intervention to stop what's happening in Aleppo, or in Syria more broadly, or to have any kind of action against Russia for the targeting of the aid convoy?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there obviously are some limitations -- there are certain elements of our strategy that we do not discuss publicly. But what I can say is certainly the United States and the President's national security team is quite focused on confronting the most direct threats to U.S. national security. And that's why you are seeing such a sustained effort on the part of the United States military and our 67-member coalition to go after ISIL. And when you consider the territory that ISIL previously controlled in Iraq and in Syria, about 40 percent of that has been retaken. That's an indication of the progress that we're making on the ground.\nBut there continue to be some areas of Syria that are undeniably war-torn. And there are lives and communities that have been shattered as a result of this violence. And it is heartbreaking. And it only fuels the kind of extremism that the administration is mostly concerned about. And we're going to pursue every available channel that we can, including peace, including the pursuit of peace, including negotiations, to try to bring the violence down, to try to ramp up the humanitarian aid that is able to get through, and to try to stop a lot of that bloodshed. But the last few days have not been good.\nGardiner.\nQ: You probably answered this, but I just want to understand, are you willing to cut yet another deal with the Russians? Is this the last deal they have to live up to in order for things to happen? Where are you in your negotiations with the Russians? Again, are you sitting at the table ready to do -- strike yet another deal that they would potentially walk away from, as they have this last one?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Gardiner, it is hard to imagine the United States reaching any other negotiated agreement with the Russians until they live up to the commitments that they've made to reduce the violence and allow for the free flow of humanitarian access and aid to the communities that need it most in Syria.\nSo that's the state of play. The international community is awaiting a tangible sign from the Russians that they're prepared to live up to the commitments that they've made. Thus far, their credibility is increasingly flimsy and doubts are rising about whether or not they have the influence with the Assad regime that they claim to have.\nAnd, look, if the conclusion of the international community is that Russia doesn't have the influence that they claim to have with the Assad regime, then, yes, that probably means we're going to have to pursue a different path to reaching the kind of political transition that we know is necessary to address the chaotic situation inside of Syria.\nQ: Does that mean this notion of sharing targeting information with the Russians -- is that off the table forever? Or is it still out there, potentially, if the Russians live up to this past deal?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the way that I would say it, Gardiner, is that it is not going to be on the table until we see the Russians live up to the commitments that they've made in terms of reducing violence and allowing humanitarian aid to be delivered with some consistency. And over the last week, week and a half, we have not seen that, despite Russia's stated commitments. And that's why it's difficult to envision any sort of military cooperation with them, because all along that military cooperation was contingent on Russia performing the duties they committed to perform. And not only have they failed in that effort, they've actually be doubling down on the kinds of strategies that we've been trying to prevent in the first place.\nQ: Over the weekend there was a picture of the First Lady and President George Bush in an embrace that sort of went viral. Can you just explain the relationship between them? Is it of affection? Just tell us more about that hug. (Laughter.)\nQ: And I have a follow-up. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Gardiner, I think what is obvious from the photo is that Mrs. Obama has genuine affection for former President Bush. And while they were not photographed hugging -- at least that I'm aware of -- Mrs. Obama also has a lot of affection for Mrs. Bush, as well. Over the years, they have had an opportunity to appear together at events, some of them somber and some of them celebratory. And, look, there's been a lot of discussion about how people who have served in the Oval Office, even if they have different political philosophies and belong to different political parties, have a lot of appreciation for people who have assumed similar burdens. And I think that's certainly true in this case.\nThe hug was not an indication that political difference of opinion have been resolved. But I think it is a reminder that people who have different views but love their country can find ways to cooperate in a way that's good for the country.\nAnd, look, the President -- President Obama -- in his comments, made reference to the fact that it was President Bush that signed into law the bill that initiated the construction of the project. And I think it's an indication that, again, for our political differences, a shared commitment to a set of basic American values is what has long made the United States of America the greatest country on Earth.\nQ: Josh, one more. On TPP. It's clearly one of the last big priorities of the administration. You just sent out a note from Secretary Pritzker highlighting the TPP benefits for small businesses. There is a sense on Capitol Hill that you're going to have to give something to McConnell and Ryan to get TPP through a lame duck session of Congress. Can you give us any hint about what you guys are willing to kind of give up to get this thing going? Are there discussions yet about this going on in the White House? Is there just sort of a wait for the election? Where are you on getting TPP done?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, the administration is committed to working closely with Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan's office to find the most effective path forward in Congress for the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\nBoth Speaker Ryan and Leader McConnell, throughout their decades-long service in the Congress, have been ardent proponents of agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. So I'm not aware of any deal that's going to be cut. I think the case the President would make is consider your previous position and your philosophy on these kinds of issues and recognize that, regardless of the outcome of the presidential election, there's not likely to be a President sitting in the Oval Office for the next four years that supports this.\nSo there is a now-or-never element to this. But look, ultimately people like Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan are experts in the legislative process and they certainly are experts when it comes to congressional politics. And in this case, our interests are aligned. We're eager to work with them to get this deal across the finish line, as are a number of outside organizations who wield significant influence in American politics but don't typically use that influence to advocate for President Obama's agenda. These are organizations like the Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable and National Association of Manufacturers and the Farm Bureau -- these are all organizations, Republican-leaning organizations, that are strong supporters of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\nSo we certainly would count on them to also advance our case and to make clear to Republican leaders in Congress that this is an important priority for the country, an important priority for our economy. And we'll see what happens. Should make for an interesting fall and winter.\nToluse.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. You've talked a lot about the credibility of Russia in the Syrian issue, and said the credibility is -- their influence over the Assad regime is questionable. I'm wondering if the U.S. and the international community's credibility with the opposition forces is at risk, given the fact that you've advocated for two ceasefires that have fallen apart and right now members of the opposition are crying out against the silence of the international community. Do you worry that if you come back to the opposition with a future deal that they're going to be less likely to put down their arms or separate themselves from Nusra because they worry about what's happened in the past and don't give the U.S. and the international community that public credibility?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, Toluse, the President and the administration are not going to be in a position of apologizing for advocating for peace. And that's what we have sought to do in the context of these protracted diplomatic discussions with the Russians.\nTrying to get Russia -- the country that appears to have the most influence with the Assad regime -- to use that influence to protect innocent people has been our strategy, at least for trying to address the political situation in Syria. We've obviously had another very forceful strategy for countering extremist elements, including ISIL, inside of Iraq and in Syria that's involved carrying out 15,000 airstrikes and a number of other things. But when it comes to trying to address the kind of violence that's plagued communities like Aleppo, that's been our approach. And it's not like there are a whole bunch of other people advocating a different approach. There have not been a lot of specific alternative proposals that people are encouraging President Obama to pursue.\nSo with regard to opposition forces on the ground inside of Syria, our message to them has been -- for some of them, has been that we're very focused on ISIL and we want them to be focused on ISIL too. To the political opposition inside of Syria, our argument has been, we agree that a political transition inside of Syria is long overdue and we are deeply concerned by the increasing frequency with which the Assad regime has been willing to target civilian populations.\nSo those are -- that's in a nutshell has been President Obama's assessment of the situation. And given those facts on the ground, we have tried to pursue our goals with a clear-eyed sense of what our national security imperatives are and what our moral imperatives are. And even as the situation worsens and gets more difficult, we're still going to be guided by America's national security interest as the top priority, but also making sure that we're pursuing a strategy that's consistent with the kinds of values that we hold dear in this country.\nQ: On the crime stats that came out -- FBI Director Comey, last year, he talked a lot about a Ferguson effect, and now we are seeing -- at least in the numbers -- the number of homicides in violent crimes increasing between 2014 and 2015. Has that caused you to re-assess your reaction to the claim that there's been a Ferguson effect?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, based on the numbers that have been released today by the Department of Justice, I think even the Department of Justice has acknowledged that it's difficult to cite one specific cause for some of the changes that we see in the numbers. Presumably, that's also true in the numbers that we've seen in the first six months of 2016 that indicate a reduction in violent crime in some of the same cities where there was an increase last year. So I guess the point is, collecting this data is important and it certainly gives academics and experts an opportunity to carefully evaluate the trends and try to determine whether there are some policy changes that would make our country safer.\nThe thing that we do know by looking at the broader trends is that violent crime in this country is at or near historic lows, and that's a good thing. But the President is certainly advocating for policies that he believes would drive those numbers down even further.\nByron.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Some FBI documents released last week showed the President used a pseudonym to email with Secretary Clinton. Can you shed any light on what that exactly -- is that like a screenname or --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, did you assume the President's email address was b.obama@whitehouse.gov? (Laughter.)\nQ: I did not.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay, good. (Laughter.)\nQ: I tried it a few times. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Good. I see. I see. Good. So you didn't take it personally when you didn't get a response then?\nQ: That's true.\nMR. EARNEST: That's good. That's good.\nListen, I think what it means is it means that there are some common-sense security measures that have been put in place to protect the President's email. I think for obvious reasons we don't discuss a lot of those measures publicly, but the fact that it's not easy to predict exactly what the President's email address is, is, in fact, one of those measures.\nQ: Can you shed any light on how he uses email? Is it common for him to communicate with other Cabinet Secretaries directly by email, or is it more of a -- does he send personal emails? How does he use it?\nMR. EARNEST: There is a limited universe of people that can send emails to or receive emails from the President's email address. And, again, that is also a function of the security measures that we have in place. I don't know how many Cabinet members are in that universe. But I think the President largely uses email the way that other people do, too. He does a little business, but he also will exchange pleasantries and other personal notes via email as well. And I think Secretary Clinton -- at least based on the descriptions of the emails that he traded with Secretary Clinton indicate that that often is the nature of his conversations over email.\nQ: -- reports indicate that the President is using a secured government email device of some sort. Do you happen to know how emails on that account would be archived? Is every email he sends going to be considered a presidential record under the Presidential Record Act? Or are there going to be some personal correspondence that's exempt? Do you know anything about that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what I do know is I do know that all of the emails that he sends will be archived. I don't know how archivists will then treat that information, so I guess we'll have to see in the future. But I can confirm for you that those emails are saved consistent with the spirit of the Presidential Records Act.\nGregory.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. Do you email the President?\nMR. EARNEST: I've emailed the President before, yes.\nQ: What about? (Laughter.)\nQ: What's the address? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: I guess pursuant to --\nQ: Well, you come out here sometimes and you say, I've spoken to the President about something. Are those conversations always in the Oval Office? Or are there times when he will send you a message to relay to us through email?\nMR. EARNEST: It's almost always in a face-to-face conversation with the President when I cite that experience.\nQ: So are -- you said they're both business-conducted and some pleasantries. Are they mostly pleasantries with you, or does --\nMR. EARNEST: It's both. It's both. (Laughter.) This feels weirdly personal all of a sudden, doesn't it? (Laughter.)\nQ: Well, this is obviously unique in the history of the presidency.\nMR. EARNEST: Sure, I know, I understand.\nQ: You have this now, as Byron alluded to, an historical record that will chronicle how the President's thinking on any given --\nQ: Is he worried about you as a family man? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: I don't think that there will be a lot of anticipation on the part of historians eager to see what emails the President was trading with me. I don't think it will end up being that interesting. But, yes, some of it is work-related, some of it's not.\nQ: I mean, is he sending you like 50 emails a day, 200 emails a day? What is it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, no, I don't think I'm going to get into a lot of detail about this, but, no, the President doesn't send nearly as many emails as I think probably everybody in this room is required to do, primarily because --\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nMR. EARNEST: Not that I'm aware of. (Laughter.) Never in an email with me, I'll tell you that. But, look, the President also has a system that most of us don't benefit from, which is that he's got essentially a staff secretary that can make sure that memos and things are delivered directly to him and then are appropriately -- his response is appropriately circulated to people. So he doesn't rely on it -- need to rely on it in the same way that presumably all the rest of us do in terms of handling basic day-to-day functions.\nQ: Is it a volume as large as, say, that amassed by Secretary Clinton? That's what I'm trying to get at. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: I wouldn't characterize it further than that.\nDave, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Back along the lines of Toluse's question on the FBI statistics. Coming at a time when there's so much focus on protests and police shootings, isn't the White House at all concerned that this one-year rise in crime is playing into Donald Trump's hands about his campaign message about restoring law and order in the country?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I've not found that the release of new facts has much impact on the rhetoric we've seen on the campaign trail. So no, we have not been particularly concerned about that.\nQ: Okay. About the President's trip to Fort Lee on Wednesday to visit with the troops, obviously, can't -- politicking on a military base isn't allowed. And the President is going there to meet with troops, hold a town hall meeting. Yet, it's six weeks before a big election in a very important swing state, so how can you say this isn't at least a partly political trip?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Dave, I can tell you it's not a political trip. The President does not intend to do any politicking on a military base. I don't think the President should avoid traveling to a military base just because it's an election year; if anything, it's in the midst of an election year, we should have all that much more appreciation for the service and sacrifice that's made by our men and women in uniform and their families. And that's what the President will do when he travels to the military base, and there will be -- he expect to spend some time talking to servicemembers and their families, and then he also expects to spend some time answering some questions for a program that will be aired on CNN later that night.\nBut the President is very much looking forward to it. And I think it should be a good conversation.\nQ: Last question -- while he's there, does the President plan -- have any plans to highlight in particular the contributions of Muslim soldiers?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any specific plan that's in place for the President to do that, but I think there have been a number of other occasions where the President has had an opportunity to talk about the service and sacrifice of patriotic Muslims who serve in the United States military. So that's not the express purpose of the trip, but if it comes up the President won't hesitate to talk about it.\nThanks, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow. Enjoy the debate.\nEND 2:29 P.M.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122568", "text": "Today, the White House will host the 8th Annual White House Tribal Nations Conference, bringing together leaders from federally recognized tribes to Washington, DC. The President and members of his Cabinet will discuss a range of issues important to tribal leaders, with an emphasis on ways the federal government can continue to strengthen the nation-to-nation relationship and ensure that progress in Indian Country endures for years to come.\nThe Tribal Nations Conference delivers on a promise the President made during a visit to the Crow Nation in Montana in May 2008, where he pledged to host an annual summit with tribal leaders to ensure that tribal nations have a seat at the table when facing important decisions about their communities. This year's Conference – the President's eighth and final of his Presidency – marks the historic progress his Administration has made to strengthen the nation-to-nation relationship and build a more prosperous and resilient Indian Country.\nIn addition to today's Conference, the second annual White House Tribal Youth Gathering will be held on September 27, 2016 as part of the Generation Indigenous (Gen-I) initiative. The gathering will bring together approximately 100 Native youth leaders who will participate alongside tribal leaders and senior federal leaders in breakout sessions, panels, and youth-specific programming. Since the President launched Gen-I in 2014, thousands of American Indian and Alaska Native Youth have mobilized to address the most pressing needs facing their communities. Through youth engagement and strategic investments and policies, Gen-I has helped cultivate a new generation of tribal leaders and improve the lives of Native youth.\nIn recognizing that despite the incredible work completed in Indian Country over the past eight years, challenges still persist for Native Americans, today's Tribal Nations Conference will bring together tribal leaders and agency officials to identify key issues to address during the next chapter of the nation-to-nation relationship. These conversations will serve as a platform for tribal leaders to develop relationships with the federal government that will serve them in the coming weeks, months, and years. Today, the Administration is pleased to share highlights of the progress made in 2016 and announce new steps forward:\nAN ALL-OF-GOVERNMENT APPROACH TO SERVING INDIAN COUNTRY\nPublic Safety and Justice Subgroup of WHCNAA. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Department of the Interior (DOI) will co-chair the Public Safety & Justice Subgroup (Subgroup) of the WHCNAA. The Departments formed the Subgroup at the September 6, 2016 WHCNAA principals meeting in response to the needs expressed by tribal leaders for the WHCNAA to concentrate on the unique legal and public safety concerns facing Indian Country such as jurisdictional matters, violence in Indian Country, infrastructure, training and capacity for tribal police and judicial systems, and more. The Subgroup will coordinate with other agencies to address public safety issues from an inter-agency perspective, and will ensure input from tribal representatives.\nInteragency Trauma Initiative of the WHCNAA Health Subgroup. The federal government plays an important partnership role with tribal nations in improving the health and well-being of American Indian and Alaska Native communities. An area where this partnership is vital is in addressing traumatic events, some which may have been experienced historically and intergenerationally. The effects of trauma can be long-term and have effects on individuals, families, and communities. A few of the symptoms and effects are psychological distress, poor overall physical and mental health, and unmet medical and psychological needs.\nThese health impacts can be significant for American Indians and Alaska Natives who may also face disparities related to socioeconomic status, education, employment, access to services, the physical environment, food security, and physical activity, among others. To strengthen efforts focused on improving the well-being of tribal communities, the Health Subgroup is working to improve awareness on the impacts of trauma among executives, senior leaders, and employees; initiating collaborations across programs; and building the capacity for supporting trauma-informed services and practices.\nReinforcing the National Historic Preservation Act and Self Determination. The National Historic Preservation Act includes a provision for the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) to enter into agreements with Indian tribes to substitute a tribe's historic preservation regulations for the ACHP's regulations, commonly called the Section 106 process. Under such an arrangement, an Indian tribe has the ability to determine how federal agencies meet the requirements of Section 106 for projects on its lands. In March 2016, the ACHP entered into a substitution agreement with the Seminole Tribe of Florida whereby the tribe will carry out all historic preservation work on its tribal lands, a full expression of its sovereignty and self-determination. The agreement with the Seminole Tribe is only the second agreement the ACHP has entered into. The first was with the Narragansett Tribe in 2000. To both encourage other Indian tribes to consider such arrangements and to help them navigate the decision making process, the ACHP, in consultation with Indian tribes, will issue formal guidance in 2017.\nThe United States, Canada, and Mexico Commit to Improve Coordination on Violence Against Indigenous Women and Girls. On June 29, 2016 President Obama traveled to Ottawa, Canada for the North American Leaders' Summit, where he met with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and President Enrique Peсa Nieto of Mexico. The three presidents made a tri-lateral commitment to address the scourge of violence against indigenous women and girls that exists across North America. The commitment encompasses knowledge-sharing on best practices to prevent and respond the needs of indigenous women and girls, including enhancing cooperation between the three nations, improving judicial and social service provision, and strengthening the capacity of government health services to provide culturally sensitive services to all indigenous recipients.\nPROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR NATIVE YOUTH\nGathering Gen-I Native Youth. On September 27, the Administration will host the second annual Tribal Youth Gathering. Tomorrow's gathering builds upon a series of six events hosted by the White House, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which engaged over 500 youth in providing an understanding of the Generation Indigenous (Gen-I) Native Youth Challenge and providing participating youth the opportunity to share their perspectives on topics including health and wellness, community, education, culture, and leadership with the federal government. These events also included activities to promote youth leadership, skill building, and education all in an effort to provide participating youth with the tools to reach their full potential.\nMeasuring the Success of our Native Youth Programming. As a part of the Generation Indigenous (Gen-I) initiative, the WHCNAA and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) are working with federal agencies to establish metrics and collect data about challenges and disparities faced by Native youth. These metrics will be used to help track the effectiveness of federal efforts to close opportunity gaps, and will help identify where we are making progress, where we are falling short, and progress that can be made when the federal agencies take a coordinated approach in addressing issues that affect Native youth.\nEnhancing Support for Consistent Climate Change Education for Native Youth. In 2015 and 2016, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), the National Park Service (NPS), and other partners hosted the first two Tribal Youth Climate Leadership Congress (Congress) to promote youth engagement and positive community action for climate resilience for 89 native youth. The Congress is supported partly through the BIA's Tribal Climate Resilience Program to support Tribal youth working on climate change research. Additionally, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is continuing its Tribal Eco-Ambassador Program, which partners with federal scientists and tribal college and university students to address environmental problems, many of which are related to the impact of climate change.\nSupporting Education and Community Development through Tribal Colleges and Universities. In 2016, USDA's National Institute of Food and Agriculture invested $13.9 million in 34 Tribal Land Grant Institutions. The new awards support institutional research, education, and extension outreach capacity through projects that address student educational needs, provide positive tribal youth development experiences, and help to solve other locally identified tribal community, reservation, and regional development issues.\nEngaging Native Youth. In 2015, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) adopted the Native Youth Strategic Plan. In 2016, the agency sought input from tribal leaders and historic preservation staff on their priorities and how best to reach out to Native youth. Based on stakeholder input, the ACHP has produced an information packet about historic preservation geared for both Native youth and adults. The information is intended to introduce Native youth to historic preservation, both in general and as a potential career path. A report will also be issued and will include recommendations based on input from Native youth, tribal leaders, and tribal preservation professionals. It will be available at www.achp.gov/nap in the summer of 2017.\nIncreasing Support for Locally-Tailored Education Interventions. The Department of Education recently announced that it will make $17.4 million in new awards for the Native Youth Community Projects (NYCP) grants in FY 2016, which is triple the $5.3 million that was provided in FY 2015. NYCP supports preschool through college-level projects that help American Indian and Alaska Native youth prepare for college and careers. President Obama's FY 2017 budget request expands NYCP funding to $53 million. Technical assistance has been provided and will support these and the State-Tribal Education Programs STEP programs from pre-application through the implementation of their grants.\nInvesting in the Future of Youth in Indian Country. In FY 2016, the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS), a federal agency that administers AmeriCorps, will invest a record $3.5 million in tribally sponsored AmeriCorps programming and $1.25 million in education scholarships. The majority of the scholarship recipients are from Indian Country – who in exchange for their service will receive the scholarship to help pay for college or to repay student loans. AmeriCorps members will tutor and mentor youth, teach nutrition and physical activity, preserve language and cultural heritage, protect the environment, connect veterans and their families to job opportunities, prepare for disasters, and tackle substance abuse issues.\nTraining Community Changemakers. In September 2016, 120 Native Youth Ambassadors, ages 14-17, will participate in the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) National Native Youth Summit in Washington, DC, with the goal of developing the next generation of Native community leaders. Youth will explore what community means and the impact homes have on personal health, education, energy conservation, and finances. The youth will design a Local Empowerment Project, such as community beautification, community-based gardens, clean-up programs, mapping sacred spaces, distributing information about energy efficiency in the home, or creating a community youth health club to implement upon their return home.\nPromoting Economic and Social Development through Career Technical Education Pathways. The Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) Sherman Indian High School accepted a generous donation from the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians to continue a Career Technical Education Pathways Program that supports students attending the school. The funds support five distinct career technical education clusters. Students learn skills to work in agriculture, construction, health care, culinary arts, hospitality, tourism, and other careers. The program allows students at the boarding school to gain skills in industries promoting economic and social development for American Indian and Alaska Native communities.\n\"Culture & Meth Don't Mix\" Initiative. DOI's Office of the Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs in collaboration with BIA's Office of Justice Services (OJS), BIE, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), has created a program called \"Culture and Meth Don't Mix\" to provide a culturally appropriate approach for meth prevention among Native American youth through community and inter-agency involvement. The program includes a speaker series that will take place in BIE schools. The speakers will consist of speakers from OJS, a health professional recommended by SAMHSA, and one person from the community. There will be a different theme each month educating youth about the dangers of meth, focusing on the fact that Native culture does not have a place for meth use.\nEmployment Opportunities for Tribal Youth through Conservation Corps. In 2016, the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council began funding Tribal Youth Conservation Corps focused on coastal cleanup, restoration and community construction projects. Part of the Obama Administration's 21st Century Conservation Service Corps, the Tribal Youth Conservation Corps invests in the next generation of tribal leaders by providing job training skills to enhance these young people's ability to engage in the long-term Gulf restoration effort to help families, bolster local economies, and lead to a more resilient coast. $500,000 was specifically set aside to engage tribal youth in the region in these opportunities.\nSTRENGTHENING TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY\nUnited States to Assume Concurrent Criminal Jurisdiction. In January 2016, DOJ granted a request by the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe for the United States to assume concurrent criminal jurisdiction on the tribe's reservation in central Minnesota. The decision was the second assumption of jurisdiction granted by the Department of Justice under the landmark Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010, which gave the Department discretion to accept concurrent federal jurisdiction to prosecute violations of the General Crimes Act and the Major Crimes Act within areas of Indian country that are also subject to state criminal jurisdiction under Public Law 280. The decision regarding the Mille Lacs Band will take effect on January 1, 2017.\nIndian Country Criminal Investigator Training Program. The Indian Country Criminal Investigator Training Program is a joint training collaboration between FBI and BIA-OJS, hosted at FLETC-West in Artesia, New Mexico. The Indian Police Academy staff and the FBI Indian Country Crimes Unit developed a course focused on preparing to work on various crimes on Indian reservations. It includes expert instruction from a forensic pediatrician, a pathologist, and experts on investigations of child abuse and violent crimes under the Major Crimes Act. Students also receive 24 hours of forensic evidence collection; the course concludes with a practical exercise where students process a crime scene and determine investigative steps. The course will be run twice yearly and each session will have up to 24 students.\nTribal Re-entry. On April 29, 2016, President Obama issued a Presidential Memorandum appointing the Federal Interagency Reentry Council, a Cabinet-level working group comprised of more than 20 member agencies, to coordinate and leverage existing federal reentry resources; dispel myths and clarify policies related to reentry; elevate reentry programs and effective policies; and reduce policy barriers to successful reentry. As a part of the broader effort, the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) has developed resources on Tribal Reentry including: BJA Tribal Reentry Fact Sheet; National Reentry Resource Center's Tribal Affairs Page; American Probation and Parole Association website; and Strategies for Creating Offender Reentry Programs in Indian Country.\nConsolidating Tribal Lands. Authorized by the Cobell Settlement in 2009, which provided $1.9 billion to purchase fractional interests at fair market value within 10 years, DOI's Land Buy-Back Program has paid more than $850 million to individual landowners and restored the equivalent of approximately 1.6 million acres of land for tribes. The program has announced the next 105 locations, which includes more than 96 percent of landowners with fractional interests and more than 98 percent of both fractional interests and equivalent acres in program-eligible area.\nSupporting Federally-Recognized Tribal Governments to Request a Presidential Emergency or Major Disaster Declaration. The Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 (SRIA) amended the Stafford Act to provide tribal governments the option to request a Presidential emergency or major disaster declaration. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is working to finalize the Tribal Declarations Pilot Guidance, which describes the process for tribal governments to request Stafford Act declarations and associated disaster assistance while the Agency prepares for and conducts a notice and rulemaking process to implement this provision of SRIA through regulations. FEMA's 90-day consultation period on the second draft of the Tribal Declarations Pilot Guidance received nearly 800 comments from over 500 tribal officials, representing 178 federally-recognized tribal governments. FEMA aims to publish the guidance this fall to begin the pilot period.\nImplementing the Forest Service Trust Responsibility. National Forests and Grasslands often hold a historic connection to America's first stewards, and USDA is working to align its procedures with this unique relationship. In 2016, the USDA Forest Service published the final Tribal Relations Directives, which provide more consistency and efficacy in consultations with Tribal Nations and helps Forest Service employees understand the requirements, complexities and opportunities of tribal relations. The Directives describe the Forest Service's responsibility to implement programs and activities consistent with, and respecting, Indian treaty rights and fulfilling the federal government's trust responsibility with Indian tribes.\nStrengthening Sovereignty. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx appointed the first-ever Deputy Assistant Secretary for Tribal Government Affairs on May 16, 2016. Located in the Office of the Secretary, this position will serve as the liaison between tribes and tribal governments and the Department of Transportation. The Department also began the process of developing a Tribal Transportation Self-Governance Program (TTSGP). This program will provide tribes with an additional option on how they would like to carry out their transportation programs. DOT initiated the negotiated rulemaking process to propose regulations that would direct the TTSGP. The TTSGP Negotiated Rulemaking Committee, composed of tribal transportation leaders and federal officials, has already begun its work.\nConnecting Communities, and Improving Infrastructures. The Tribal Transit Program at the Federal Transit Administration is expanding its technical assistance efforts to tribes receiving funds through the Tribal Transit Technical Assistance Assessments initiative. Through these assessments, FTA collaborates with tribal transit leaders to review processes and identify areas in need of improvement and then assist with solutions to address these needs—all in a supportive and mutually beneficial manner. The FTA has performed 30 assessments and will continue these efforts. The Tribal Transportation Program is the largest program in the Office of Federal Lands Highway at the Federal Highway Administration, which is authorized at $465 million in FY 2016.\nPrioritizing Tribal Connectivity. Broadband is essential in the 21st Century, but today too many lack high speed access. The Administration has prioritized increasing broadband capabilities across Indian Country: as part of ConnectED, an initiative designed to connect schools and libraries to the digital age, the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) E-rate program provided broadband, Wi-Fi, and telecommunications funding to 245 tribal schools serving over 60,000 students and 31 tribal libraries last funding year alone; the National Telecommunications and Information Administration's (NTIA) published a planning toolkit for tribal governments to develop a Community Broadband Roadmap for building broadband networks, enhancing public computer centers, expanding broadband to unserved areas, encouraging public-private partnerships, and promoting broadband connectivity to homes, businesses and institutions; and starting December 1st, the enhanced Lifeline program subsidy, which is available to low-income people living on Tribal lands, can be used to help cover the cost of broadband service. Additionally, as a step towards providing tribal communities and entities with the resources they need to deploy broadband infrastructure, today the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Utilities Service is announcing that it will aim to double its annual investment in telecom broadband loans in Indian Country—to $50 million in FY17—and dedicate staff to providing tribes with technical assistance to help unlock existing resources. And because broadband is critical to creating opportunity for Native Youth, the President's Budget proposed significant investments in education information IT to enhance broadband and digital access for students at BIE-funded schools.\nSponsoring for Clean Energy. During 2016, the Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs (Indian Energy) will obligate nearly $15 million in direct support of clean energy deployment by tribes (Indian tribes and their governmental instrumentalities, including Alaska Native villages, Alaska Native Regional Corporations and Village Corporations, and Tribal Energy Resource Development Organizations). On August 17, DOE's Office of Indian Energy announced the availability of up to $3 million to initiate the first steps toward developing and sustaining renewable energy and energy efficiency on tribal lands.\nImproving Access to Data for American Indians and Alaska Natives (AIAN).  In 2016, BIA and the Census Bureau signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) as a first step in identifying and addressing AIAN data quality and availability issues. As a result of the MOU, BIA and Census are sharing geospatial data to improve the accuracy of tribal boundaries in time for the 2020 Census; a federal interagency work group was established to promote communication and collaboration; an inventory of existing federal AIAN data collections was developed to identify data gaps and establish a baseline for progress; and a series of workshops to address AIAN data issues is being planned.\nRefining, Expanding and Engaging in Tribal Consultation. In FY 2016, HUD published its revised tribal consultation policy, proposed a tribal advisory committee, and completed negotiated rulemaking. HUD issued a Federal Register Notice seeking public comment on a proposed Tribal Intergovernmental Advisory Committee to further facilitate communication between HUD and Federally-recognized Indian tribes on all HUD programs. In January, HUD completed negotiated rulemaking with tribal representatives on the Indian Housing Block Grant funding formula.\nTracking Federal Initiatives to Build Resilience in Indian Country. The White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) and the White House Council on Native American Affairs Environment, Climate, and Natural Resources Subgroup, have developed a progress report on the Tribal Supplemental Recommendations of the State, Local, and Tribal Leaders Task Force on Climate Preparedness and Resilience. The report identifies programs and policies that Federal agencies have developed or updated in response to the Tribal Supplemental Recommendations, which focus on the specific and unique perspectives of Native communities to build resilience to the impacts of climate change. Read more about it here.\nHEALTHY COMMUNITIES & ENVIRONMENTS IN INDIAN COUNTRY\nSupporting the Delivery of Traditional Foods in Indian Country. The 2014 Farm Bill provided additional flexibility for USDA to incorporate traditional foods into the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR) program managed by the USDA Food and Nutrition Service. In 2016, USDA increased the quantity and variety of traditional foods being distributed to low-income families and the elderly through FDPIR through the purchase of 120,000 pounds of bison, 216,000 pounds of frozen wild salmon, 55,000 pounds of wild rice, and 646,000 pounds of blue cornmeal, much of it supplied by Native American-owned businesses.\nPartnering to Build Resilience in Tribal Communities. Two new partnerships will enable 160 AmeriCorps VISTA members to serve in Tribal communities over the next three years. The Resilience AmeriCorps program will place AmeriCorps VISTA members at 55 tribal locations to boost their capacity to prepare for severe weather. This expansion includes Conservation Legacy, American Indian Higher Education Consortium, Enterprise Community Partners, Tribal Colleges and Universities and Tribal Housing Authorities. Building on the Let's Move in Indian Country and Seeds of Native Health initiatives, AmeriCorps VISTA is also joining with the University of Arkansas Law School's Indigenous Food and Agriculture Institute and the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Tribe to place AmeriCorps VISTA members in 10 tribes to help develop agricultural opportunities and nutritional priorities to benefit Tribal members.\nCombating Climate Change in Tribal Nations: Climate Resilience Toolkit. In 2015, the Administration expanded the Climate Resilience Toolkit to include a new \"Tribal Nations\" theme, comprised of more than 40 resources—with more to be added in the future—to assist Tribal nations in climate change planning, adaptation, and mitigation. Resources include a comprehensive Tribal Climate Change Adaptation Planning Toolkit, and a set of guidelines for considering traditional knowledge in climate change initiatives. In July 2016, NOAA, in collaboration with the U.S. Global Change Research Program and a number of agencies, released new capabilities through the Climate Resilience Toolkit; these included county-scale climate projections for the continental United States, making climate information more locally relevant.\nEngaging Communities and Connecting with Technical Experts and Resources through Community-based Data Collection. In 2015, EPA's Indian Environmental General Assistance Program provided a grant to the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium (ANTHC), to support the release of a Local Environmental Observer (LEO) App. Expanding on the successful computer-based tool, the App allows observers to share photos and text from the field, complete with GPS locations. The LEO Network provides a model for engaging communities and connecting with technical experts and resources to allow communities to monitor, respond to, and adapt to new impacts and health effects. LEO experts apply local and traditional knowledge, western science and modern technology to record and share observations and to raise awareness about the conditions in the circumpolar north. Due to the success of the program, EPA and ANTHC are working to expand LEO internationally and in the Lower 48.\nBuilding Knowledge and Connection for Environment, Climate Change, and Natural Resources. In May 2016, the Environment, Climate Change, and Natural Resources Subgroup—part of the White House Council on Native American Affairs—hosted a convening for Tribal leaders and Administration leadership to discuss the impacts of climate change on their Tribal communities. The Subgroup launched the Federal Tribal Climate Change Resource Guide-an online portal that creates a centralized place for Tribal government professionals to locate available resources from the federal government. This guide enables Tribal governments to identify resources, tools and expert advice from multiple agencies.\nSUPPORTING NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURE & HERITAGE\nSupporting Resiliency through Native Language and Culture. The Administration for Native Americans recently awarded nearly $3 million in funds under two new grant programs to support Native youth. The Native Language Community Coordination Demonstration Projects is a five-year demonstration project that will enable communities to increase their capacity to address gaps in providing continuous Native language instruction from childhood through post-secondary education. The Native Youth Initiative for Leadership, Empowerment, and Development (I-LEAD) funding will support community programs that promote Native American youth resiliency and foster protective factors such as connections with Native American languages and elders, positive peer groups, models of safe sanctuary, and more.\nProtecting Confidential Information. The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) has issued a \"Frequently Asked Questions\" guidance document on protecting sensitive information about historic properties under Section 304 of the National Historic Preservation Act. Federal agency officials, State and Tribal Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO/THPO), Indian tribes, Native Hawaiian organizations, and other stakeholders in the Section 106 process often ask ACHP staff how sensitive information about historic properties can be protected from public disclosure. This new guidance, available here, builds upon the successful Section 304 Webinar the ACHP offers about how Section 304 works to protect such information and thereby prevent harm to historic properties. In developing this guidance, the ACHP coordinated closely with the NPS' Keeper of the National Register of Historic Places program to ensure these FAQs identify the most commonly asked questions and provide helpful guidance to Section 106 practitioners as well as members of the public regarding what information may be withheld from disclosure, under what circumstances, and for what reasons.\nPreserving Tribal Culture and Values by Supporting Efforts to Repatriate Cultural Items from Abroad. DOJ has launched an interagency group on cultural property with DOI, the Department of State, and DHS, with a focus on international repatriation. Next steps include strengthening interagency cooperation, responding to Congressional requests for information and comments on legislation, and holding government-to-government consultations on international repatriation, which will be launched at the 2016 Tribal Nations Conference.\nWorking with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The ACHP issued new guidance about the linkages between the U.N. Declaration and tribal and Native Hawaiian preservation issues in the Section 106 review process. The guidance helps federal agencies understand the right of indigenous peoples to participate in decision making when their rights would be affected, including with respect to the destruction of historic properties or sacred places of religious or cultural significance. The ACHP has extensively promoted the Declaration within the historic preservation community and issued initial guidance regarding Section 106 consultation and the Declaration.\nSacred Sites MOU Executive Committee Announces New Training. As part of the deliverables of the Sacred Sites MOU, the Executive Committee of the Sacred Sites MOU is announcing the release of \"Native American Sacred Sites and the Federal Government, A Training for Federal Employees and Contract Staff Developed under the Sacred Sites Memorandum of Understanding,\" a comprehensive online training module for federal employees and contractors, which is also available for free to the public. The Sacred Sites MOU was signed by DOD, USDA, DOI, DOE, and ACHP to improve the protection of and tribal access to Indian sacred sites on federally managed land.", "timestamp": "2016-09-26", "title": "Fact Sheet: The 8th Annual White House Tribal Nations Conference"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122674", "text": "\"If we can reconceive of our government so that the interactions and the interplay between private sector, nonprofits, and government are opened up, and we use technology, data, social media in order to join forces around problems, then there's no problem that we face in this country that is not soluble.\" – President Barack Obama\nWith nearly two-thirds of Americans living in urban settings, many of our fundamental challenges—from climate change to equitable growth to improved health—will require our cities to be laboratories for innovation. The rapid pace of technological change, from the rise of data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and ubiquitous sensor networks to autonomous vehicles, holds significant promise for addressing core local challenges.\nThat's why last September the White House launched the Smart Cities Initiative to make it easier for cities, Federal agencies, universities, and the private sector to work together to research, develop, deploy, and testbed new technologies that can help make our cities more inhabitable, cleaner, and more equitable.\nToday, to kick off Smart Cities Week, the Administration is expanding this initiative, with over $80 million in new Federal investments and a doubling of the number of participating cities and communities, exceeding 70 in total. These new investments and collaborations will help cities of all sizes, including in the following key areas:\n•      Climate: The Administration is announcing nearly $15 million in new funding and two new coalitions to help cities and communities tackle energy and climate challenges. For example, one Department of Energy (DOE) campaign has already signed up 1,800 buildings representing 49 million square feet with data analytics tools that could reduce their energy footprint by 8 percent or more, on average.\n•      Transportation: The Administration is announcing more than $15 million in new grants and planned funding to evolve the future of urban transportation, including National Science Foundation (NSF) funding for researchers in Chattanooga to test, for the first time, how an entire urban network of connected and autonomous vehicles can automatically cooperate to improve travel efficiency and operate safely during severe weather events.\n•      Public safety: The Administration is announcing more than $10 million in new grants and planned funding for public safety, resilience, and disaster response. For example, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is funding the development of low-cost flood sensor-based tools in flood-prone areas of Texas, where predictive analytics will give first responders and local officials new capability to issue alerts and warnings, and the ability to respond more rapidly to save lives when a flood strikes.\n•      Transforming city services: MetroLab Network is launching a new effort to help cities adopt promising innovations in social programs, like a collaboration between three counties surrounding Seattle and the University of Washington to use predictive analytics to identify precisely when city services succeed in helping homeless individuals transition into permanent housing, offering the promise of a future of personalized intervention.\nBackground\nThe White House Smart Cities Initiative represents an example of how the Administration has worked over the past seven and a half years to develop a smarter, more collaborative approach to working with local communities—putting citizens, community groups, and local leaders at the center of its efforts. The Administration's approach involves working together with communities to identify local needs and priorities, develop and build upon evidence-based and data-driven solutions, and strategically invest Federal funding and technical assistance.\nThe Smart Cities Initiative is informed by and builds on the work of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST), including its Technology and the Future of Cities report. In the report, PCAST identified several actions that the Federal Government can take to help cities leverage technology, and which the initiative is already beginning to implement.\nThe initiative has supported a number of breakthrough activities in the last year. Two such examples are:\n•      Smart City Challenge: In June, the Department of Transportation (DOT) selected Columbus, Ohio to receive $40 million to prototype the future of urban transportation, out of 78 cities that accepted its Smart City Challenge. The city's plan, which will also leverage over $100 million in private resources, involves piloting new technologies, from connected vehicle technology that improves traffic flow and safety to data-driven efforts to improve public transportation access and health care outcomes to electric self-driving shuttles that will create new transportation options for underserved neighborhoods.\n•      Fitness Tracker for Cities: With funding from NSF and Argonne National Laboratory, the City of Chicago and the University of Chicago last month began installing a \"fitness tracker for the city\"—500 outdoor sensor boxes called the \"Array of Things\" that will allow the city and public to instantly obtain block-by-block data on air quality, noise levels, and traffic. This real-time open data will help researchers and city officials reduce air pollution, improve traffic safety, and more. For example, a team is already working to build a mobile application that will alert asthma sufferers about poor air quality based on real-time measurements taken on their city block.\nIn addition to the initiative, the Administration has also taken several complementary steps that support local innovation, including the newly-announced Advanced Wireless Research Initiative, through which NSF is working with the private sector to invest nearly $100 million to develop four city-scale testing platforms for wireless technologies, including 5G and beyond. Additionally, the Administration's Opportunity Project is spurring the creation of private sector digital tools based on Federal open data that help communities find information about resources needed to thrive, such as affordable housing, quality schools, and jobs. The Police Data Initiative and Data-Driven Justice Initiative are helping local authorities use data to improve community policing and divert low-level offenders out of the criminal justice system, respectively.\nThe upcoming White House Frontiers Conference, held in Pittsburgh on Wednesday, October 13, will further advance the initiative by bringing together some of the world's leading innovators to discuss how investing in science and technology frontiers—including smart and inclusive local communities—can help improve lives and keep America on the cutting edge of innovation.\nKey Steps by the Administration Being Announced Today\nNSF is announcing over $60 million in new smart cities-related grants in FY16 and planned new investments in FY17. NSF is bringing together academic researchers from an array of disciplines with community stakeholders to unlock transformational progress on important community challenges. Examples of this work include an effort by researchers in Chattanooga to test an entire urban network of automatically cooperating connected and autonomous vehicles; and a flood-warning pilot project in several Maryland cities that integrates sensor data and social media posts in a novel way to potentially save lives by providing advance notice of flash floods, which kill more people in the United States each year than tornadoes, hurricanes, or lightning. The investments include:\n•      $24.5 million in planned investment in FY17 and $8.5 million in new awards under the Smart & Connected Communities program.

A core challenge that communities face when implementing smart city solutions is limited expertise and resources needed to develop and deploy new large-scale technology projects. Successful public-private partnerships can be a cost-effective way to ensure the fastest delivery of improved services to local residents. To assist local communities, NTIA is releasing a toolkit for local officials and citizen groups to use as a guide for building productive public-private partnerships that will enable smart cities to flourish. Using Partnerships to Power a Smart City: A Toolkit for Local Communities identifies factors to consider when developing a partnership—including what to look for in a partner, assessing partner contributions, and how to structure the most fruitful partnership agreements.\nThe DHS Science and Technology Directorate is announcing an investment of $3.5 million for development of low-cost sensor technologies through its Flood Apex Program. The program is applying Internet of Things-based approaches to facilitate evacuations, flood monitoring, and resilience of critical infrastructure. For example, through a collaboration with the Lower Colorado River Authority, FEMA, and the National Weather Service in flood-prone areas of Texas, the program will share real-time data to give first responders and local officials the ability to respond more rapidly when a flood strikes and make the right preventive investments in flood protection to help save lives and protect infrastructure.\nThe Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Program is announcing a Federal Smart Cities and Communities Task Force. Recognizing the need for collaboration across agencies given the cross-cutting nature of community challenges like resilience, the task force is charged with developing a draft strategy for interagency cooperation on smart cities. It will also create a resource guide to Federal smart city programs, helping stakeholders discover the broad array of Federal funding opportunities and other resources. The draft strategy will be available for comment this fall, and the resource guide will be online in November.\nNew Steps Being Taken by Communities, Universities, Industry, and Others in Response to the Administration's Call to Action\nFour additional companies are joining the Administration's NSF-led Advanced Wireless Research Initiative, collectively committing over $8 million in in-kind contributions to help support the design, deployment, and operation of four city-scale advanced wireless testing platforms.

In his remarks, he referred to Leonard Matanky, honorary president, Rabbinical Council of America; and Jonah Dov Pesner, director, and Barbara Weinstein, associate director, Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism. Audio was not available for verification of the content of these remarks.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119042", "text": "Well, thank you so much, Rabbi, for the warm introduction. L'Shanah Tovah to everybody. Thanks for taking time to join this call. I know it's a busy and important time. I couldn't be more grateful to the Central Conference of American Rabbis, the Rabbinical Assembly, the Rabbinical Council of America, and the Reconstructionist Rabbinical Assembly for cosponsoring this call. And special thanks to Rabbi Jonah Pesner and Barbara Weinstein from the Religious Action Center for coordinating today's conversation.\nAs Rabbi Matanky noted, Rosh Hashanah is a time for reflection, and I'm not exempt from that. So, looking back on the last 8 years, I'm both proud of what we've accomplished together, but also mindful of the work we have before us.\nWhen it comes to the unshakeable commitment to Israel's security, we've taken a clear stand, and the recent signing of the memorandum of understanding constitutes the single largest pledge of military assistance in U.S. history to any country, totaling $38 billion over 10 years.\nI made a commitment to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, and because of our principled diplomacy, every pathway to a nuclear weapon is now closed off. Iran has dismantled two-thirds of its installed centrifuges, shipped out 98 percent of its enriched uranium, rendered its plutonium reactor core unusable, and adopted the most comprehensive nuclear inspection ever.\nOn the global fight against anti-Semitism, we've worked in partnership with Israel and other countries to take a lead role in organizing the first ever U.N. General Assembly meeting to combat anti-Semitism last year.\nAnd so on these issues and many others we have worked incredibly closely with many of you, allocating millions in assistance for Holocaust survivors, and ensuring that the U.N. finally recognized Yom Kippur as an official holiday, and more broadly, working to rebuild a sinking economy, so that we've cut the unemployment rate by more than half, provided health care to 20 million people who didn't have it before, ramped up our production of clean energy, signed a historic Paris Agreement that, hopefully, will curb the accelerating speed at which our planet is warming and could threaten the future of our children and our grandchildren.\nOf course, we've still got a lot of work to do: on the refugee crisis, on criminal justice reform, reducing violence, and creating a political culture in this country that's a little more functional. But a new year brings new hope, and the community represented on this phone call has always known what it means to stand up for the less fortunate, the stranger, the immigrant, the refugee. And so I'm confident that we can stand together and make sure that as we pass the baton to the next administration that we're going to be able to build on the enormous progress that we've already made.\nAnd I just want to reemphasize how grateful I am to all of you, not just for the work that the various associations and assemblies and congregations have had on policy issues, but just as importantly, or more importantly, the work that you do in your respective communities every single day to help those in need and to help lift up the values that helped to build this country.", "timestamp": "2016-09-26", "title": "Remarks During a Teleconference Call With Rabbis on the Observance of Rosh Hashanah"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "The President spoke at 3:52 p.m. in the Great Hall at the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium. In his remarks, he referred to Special Assistant to the President for Native American Affairs Karen R. Diver; Senior Associate Director of Public Engagement and Intergovernmental Affairs Tracy L. Canard Goodluck; and Melissa P. Gordon, mother of Lindsay M. Early, adjunct professor, Comanche Nation College.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119043", "text": "The President. Hello, everybody. Thank you. Thank you. Well, welcome to the Eighth White House Tribal Nations Conference. And what a amazing honor, and what a kind gesture for the honor song and the blanket and the hat. I have to say that I'm very glad that you also have a blanket for Michelle so she doesn't steal mine. [Laughter] She would too. I'm just saying. [Laughter] But that was very moving and is a reminder of the great friendships that we've developed over the last 8 years.\nI have a couple of people here who I want to acknowledge for their longstanding commitment to Indian Country: Sally Jewell, our Secretary of the Interior; Brian Cladoosby, president of the National Congress of American Indians. We're honored to have here Thomas Begay, one of the last surviving Navajo Code Talkers. And we have some just amazing young people here that I had a chance to meet earlier, including those who are participating in Generation Indigenous, so please give our young people a big round of applause. We're so proud of them.\nSo today the most important thing I want to say is thank you. After almost 8 years as your President, I have been so privileged to learn from you and spend time with many of you while visiting more tribal communities than any other President. Standing Rock Sioux Tribe here? Choctaw Nation? Alaska Natives? My trips to your nations and communities are days that I will never forget. We—Michelle and I—still talk about hosting those remarkable young people from Standing Rock Sioux Nation in the White House and taking them out for pizza. [Laughter] My staff still talks about all the wonderful people in Kotzebue, Alaska, who tried to—they tried to teach them Iñupiaq and tried to stuff them full of meat at Cariboufest. [Laughter] And my brothers at Crow Nation, brothers and sisters here, I may be an adopted son of the Crow Nation, but I try not to play favorites. [Laughter] Because I pledged to all of you when I first ran for President that I'd be a partner with all of you in the spirit of a true nation-to-nation relationship, to give all our children the future they deserve.\nSo we began by elevating Native American Affairs within the White House and across the Federal Government. The American people are served by so many dedicated, talented Native Americans like Larry Roberts, our Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs. Morgan Rodman, our Executive Director of the White House Council on Native American Affairs. Karen Diver and Tracy Goodluck, our Native American Affairs team at the White House. That's just a few. And by creating the White House Council of Native American Affairs, we created a permanent institution with a long-term, Cabinet-level focus on Indian Country, one that involves you through the decisionmaking process.\nSo I've been proud of what we've been able to do together. We haven't solved every issue. We haven't righted every wrong. But together, we've made significant progress in almost every area.\nTogether, we've permanently protected sacred lands for future generations. We've restored more than 428,000 acres of tribal homelands to their original owners. By signing the historic Cobell settlement into law, we established the Land Buy-Back Program, a $1.9 billion fund to consolidate individual Indian lands and restore them to Indian—tribal trusts. Together, we've strengthened your sovereignty, reauthorized the Violence Against Women Act so that tribes can prosecute those who commit domestic violence against women in Indian Country, whether they're Native American or not. We've worked to ensure your right to equal justice under the law and given more power to tribal courts and police. I know that many of you who have come together across tribes and across the country to support the community at Standing Rock. And together, you're making your voices heard.\nAnd in a spirit of cooperation and mutual respect, we've made a lot of progress for Indian Country over the past 8 years. And this moment highlights why it's so important that we redouble our efforts to make sure that every Federal agency truly consults and listens and works with you, sovereign-to-sovereign.\nTogether, we've worked to create jobs and expand opportunity by investing in clean energy projects and infrastructure and high-speed Internet that connects your communities to the broader economy. We've worked to secure quality, affordable health care for more people in Indian Country through the Affordable Care Act, including the permanent reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act.\nWe've invested in job training and tribal colleges and universities, and together, we've worked to return control of Indian education to tribal nations so that as we prepare our young people for the demands of a global economy, we're also teaching them in their own language and their own culture. Because we believe that all our native youth deserve a future as bright as any American child, without having to leave the land of their fathers and mothers. That's what's driven our work.\nAnd through Generation Indigenous, we've worked to connect more of our young people to each other, in one big network of opportunity across the country. So that's just some of the progress we've made together. And we've got to keep fighting to the finish line. Even after my time in this office comes to an end, I'm going to be standing alongside you because I believe that, yes, our progress depends in part on who sits in the Oval Office, and whether they're setting the right priorities, but lasting progress depends on all of us, not just who the President is. It depends on making the decisions that are good and right and just and our willingness to organize and mobilize and keep pushing for opportunity.\nAnd I'm optimistic that you will continue on the path forward that we've set. I'm optimistic that our progress will continue. The young people who I've met on this journey, more than anything else, who make me feel optimistic: the students who sang us the Lakota national anthem and told us about all the obstacles they've overcome and shared with us their dreams for the future; the students at the middle school in Dillingham, Alaska, who taught me a traditional Yup'ik dance.\nAudience member. Show us! [Laughter]\nThe President. Well, I can only do it when they're around—[laughter]—because I'm basically just watching them. It—they were very patient with me. [Laughter]\nAnd it's a young woman named Lindsay Early of the Comanche Nation in Oklahoma, who earlier this year wrote me a letter to tell me she was actually at a campaign speech I gave in Texas way back in 2008, where I pledged that I'd do my best to represent Native Americans. And Lindsay said in her letter that when she heard my pledge to her people, in the middle of my speech, she screamed as loud as she could from the balcony. And look, if you're President and somebody screams, that can mean many things, usually. [Laughter] Sometimes, it's good; sometimes, it's not so good. But according to Lindsay, it was good. And I answered back, I hear you girls, and when I'm elected, I won't forget you.\nWell, 8 years later, Lindsay's gone on to accomplish some pretty remarkable things. She was raised by a single mom, like me, and didn't have a lot of money or obvious advantages in life, but she earned a scholarship and graduated from college; moved back home to help her mom care for her 92-year-old grandmother. She took a job developing a new assisted-living facility, owned and operated by the Comanche Nation. And after that opened, she joined Teach For America. And now she teaches kindergarteners in her community by day, and Native America history to students at a tribal college at night.\nSo this is a young woman who knows the meaning of giving back. And her whole life, people told her how smart she was and that someday she'd go off into the world and make big changes. But in school, she came to a realization, and here's what she said: \"It was not 'going off' that would make Indian Country better, but returning with education and with the insight education brings. . . . My students have a sense of pride in them about who they are as indigenous individuals. . . . More than anything, they realize they are in control of their own destinies, and that's such a powerful thing to experience.\"\nSo you listen to somebody like Lindsay, who understands she's in charge of her own destiny and is now able to transmit that to the next generation, and how can you not be optimistic about this country's future? How can you not be optimistic about the future of all of the nations represented here?\nAnd, Lindsay, I want you to know that I heard you. I didn't forget you. And I want everybody in this auditorium and all the folks back home in your respective communities to know that this whole time, I've heard you. I have seen you. And I hope I've done right by you. And I hope I've set a direction that others will follow.\nI hope I've set a direction that others then follow, and I hope I've given more of our young people, like Lindsay and her students, that sense of hope and that sense of what an incredible gift they are to this country and that they're in control of their own destinies and that they're going to help shape the future of the United States of America.\nThank you all for your partnership.

Each year on National Voter Registration Day, we reaffirm the strong sense of civic pride among our people and encourage friends, family members, and neighbors to get involved in civic life by registering to vote.\nDemocracy is not a spectator sport. If we are serious about improving our country and ensuring our government reflects our values, we cannot afford to sit out on Election Day. Unfortunately, among those who are eligible to vote, too many choose not to—far too many people disenfranchise themselves by not getting involved. When we do not take full advantage of the right to vote, we not only give away our voice; our power; our ability to shape the future of the country we love—we also do a disservice to the generations of Americans before us who risked everything, including their lives, to protect this fundamental aspect of our Republic.\nOur brand of democracy is hard, and it requires our citizens to be able to fully participate in a smooth and effective way. Through a bipartisan, independent commission dedicated to improving the voting process, we are working to ensure our democracy and our elections function the way they are supposed to. Whether through strengthening mechanisms that allow more people to vote—such as online registration—or going door-to-door to register voters in our communities, we must make registering to vote easier. By protecting and expanding this right, we can ensure this grand experiment in self-government works for more Americans. For more information on how to register to vote, visit www.VOTE.USA.gov.\nIt is easy to feel frustrated when the pace of change is slow—and to lose hope in the political process as a result. But we cannot give in to that cynicism. Heroic things happen when people get involved. Our government is only as strong as what we put into it, and it is only reflective of the will of our citizenry when we exercise our right to vote. Today, as we once again celebrate National Voter Registration Day, let us carry forward the tradition of promoting voter registration and civic engagement, recommit to exercising one of the most precious of our democratic rights, and remember that the task of perfecting our Union belongs to us all.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 27, 2016, as National Voter Registration Day. I call upon all Americans to observe this day by ensuring they are registered to vote.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-09-26", "title": "Proclamation 9503—National Voter Registration Day, 2016"}

Smith, R-NE, and seven cosponsors)\nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 954. The Administration remains committed to providing Americans with accessible, quality, and affordable health coverage, including by addressing issues that arise when their health insurers stop offering coverage during the year. In such circumstances, the Administration has offered special enrollment periods, provided consumer outreach, and worked with state departments of insurance to ensure consumers have smooth transitions to other health plans. Individuals for whom coverage is unaffordable or who experience a hardship also may quality for an exemption from the individual-responsibility provision of the law. These options are available to all consumers in these circumstances, not just those enrolled in coverage through CO-OPs.\nH.R. 954 would exempt anyone whose CO-OP ends coverage during the year from the individual-responsibility provision. This is unnecessary given consumer protections already available. Moreover, it would create a bad precedent for using exemptions from the individual-responsibility provision to address unrelated concerns about the Affordable Care Act. The individual-responsibility provision is a necessary part of a system that prohibits discrimination against individuals with pre-existing conditions and requires guaranteed issuance. The provision helps prevent people from waiting until they get sick to buy health insurance or dropping health insurance when they believe they do not need it. Weakening the individual responsibility provision would increase health insurance premiums and decrease the number of Americans with coverage.\nThe Administration always is willing to work with the Congress on fiscally responsible ways to further improve health care affordability and the Affordable Care Act. The President's Budget offers a number of proposals to do so. However, H.R. 954 would be a step in the wrong direction, because it would create a precedent that undermines a key part of the law and would do nothing to help middle-class families obtain affordable health care.\nIf the President were presented with H.R. 954, he would veto the bill.", "timestamp": "2016-09-27", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 954 - CO-OP Consumer Protection Act of 2016"}

Secretary Clinton was introduced by Christine Bonaventure, a recent graduate of the nursing program at Wake Technical Community College.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119163", "text": "\"Thank you! Boy! Wow! Thank you! Wow! Did anybody see that debate last night? Oh, yes. One down, two to go. I am so excited to be back here at Wake Tech. I was here 8 years ago, and I was so impressed then with the kinds of programs and opportunities that are offered here to people like Christine that I wanted to come back, of course, to Raleigh, but I wanted to come back here to Wake Tech. When Christine was talking, I was backstage watching her on a screen we had there. And she kept saying about how she was about to cry. I was about to cry. Her story says so much, not just about her but about our country. We are a country of second chances and third and fourth chances for people willing to work for them, get up every day, do their best. That's the basic bargain of America. And I was really proud of Christine.\nAudience Member: We're proud of you!\nClinton: Thank you. Thank you. And I think her – I think her patients at Duke Regional are in for a treat because not only the skills that she learned here at Wake Tech but that personality, that get-up-and-go personality, is going to mean a lot to the people she's taking care of. So Christine, thank you and Godspeed.\nNow, I have to thank – I have to thank Dr. Stephen Scott, the president of Wake Tech Community College, all the administrators, the faculty, and the students of Wake Tech. Now, Dr. Scott told me that the enrollment's about 73,000. And what a tribute to what this institution represents. And I am a huge, huge supporter. I just see America differently. I think there's nothing we can't do if we make our minds up, roll up our sleeves, get working together, support institutions like Wake Tech, support people like Christine. And that's what I intend to do.\nNow, I want to thank your mayor, Mayor McFarlane. Thank you so much for being here. State Senator Dan Blue, Jr. I also want to recognize Linda Coleman, candidate for lieutenant governor of North Carolina. Linda came so close last time. And this time are you going to bring her over the finish line? And I'll tell you somebody else I'm really excited about. That is the Democratic candidate for the Senate, former State Representative Deborah Ross. I have watched – I have watched the campaign she's run and the intensity and the incredible passion that she brings to it. I'll tell you what, we sure could use her in Washington representative North Carolina. I want to thank all the elected officials who are here, and I want to do a special shout-out to a long-time friend of my husband's and mine, somebody who we admire so much who did really transform this state during his governorship. That's former Governor Jim Hunt.\nNow, there's a lot that I want to talk about today. But let me start with this because you may or may not know. Today is National Voter Registration Day. And you see some signs people are holding. 'I Will Vote.' Now, that's not only a great sign that shows you're committed to vote, but it's a website. And you can go to iwillvote.com to make sure you are registered. And I hope you all will, and I hope you'll tell everybody that you know to do the same, because we want to make sure people are registered.\nAnd there is still time to get registered here in North Carolina, and I hope that you will, because think about everything that's at stake in this election right here in North Carolina. The very mean-spirited, wrong-headed decision by your legislature and governor to pass and sign House Bill 2 has hurt this state. But more than that, it's hurt people. It has sent a message to so many people that, well, you're not really wanted. You're not really part of us. I think the American dream is big enough for everybody.\nThe other thing your governor and legislature did was everything they could to make voting harder for people. Now, they were pretty blatant about it. Make it harder for people of color. Make it harder for the elderly. And make it harder for the young. Now, some of that's been rolled back, thankfully, because it was so wrong and, I would argue, unconstitutional. But the best way to show, hey, in a democracy like ours we can have the most vigorous, vibrant debate, that's what it's about. But we want everybody to exercise his or her right to vote. That's the way we're supposed to be making decisions. It distorts our democracy if some groups of people try to prevent other people from being able to do that.\nNow, I have won elections and I have lost elections, so I know what the difference is. But I'll tell you this: I believe in what our founders established for us, to govern ourselves, to continue to widen the circle of opportunity, and that includes the opportunity to be heard, to express yourself, your voice and your vote. And the best way to reaffirm our commitment to that fundamental American value is to show up and vote, and demonstrate the importance of your vote.\nI believe that we may have a record-setting turnout in this election. Some folks who follow this are saying we could have the biggest turnout we've ever had. Now, that kind of makes sense because you could not have two more different visions about where we want our country to go in the future, and who we are fighting for. But early information is actually quite encouraging. We're seeing spikes in early voting. And we're seeing voting rates among African Americans, Latinos, and young people going up. And for the first time, the estimate is that young people could represent 25 percent of the vote.\nNow, I would love to see that. Obviously, I hope people vote for me. But I would love to see that because every election is about the future. And honestly, it's more about the future of young people and children than it's ever been because of the difference in the approaches and the experiences of me and my opponent.\nNow, last night I got a chance – I got a chance to say a few things about what I want to do if I'm so fortunate enough to be elected as your president. And I do have this old-fashioned idea that if I'm asking for your vote, I should tell you what I want to do. And I also got to convey my excitement about what we can do together. You see, I really think the central question in this election is what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we want to build for our children and our grandchildren.\nAnd I also got to convey my excitement about what we can do together. You see, I really think the central question in this election is what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we want to build for our children and our grandchildren. I think about that a lot, in part because I started out working for the Children's Defense Fund. It's always been my passion about what we can do [applause] to help more kids live up to their God-given potential.\nAnd during this campaign, people have asked me, 'Well, how did you get interested in that?'And the simple answer is my mother had such a neglected childhood. She was basically abandoned by her parents, sent to live with grandparents who didn't want her. By the age of 14, she was out on her own working in a home babysitting, keeping house. She was basically a maid. And when I think about my mother's own life and how she told me when I was old enough to understand how different her life was than the one that she created for me and my brothers, she would say she was so often saved by the kindness of other people.\nWe overlook the importance of just how we treat each other, the respect we show, the kindness, the love that we show. And I'm well aware that's not something you put necessarily on a campaign website, but I've been talking about it because I think we've got to re-assert our fundamental connection to each other.\nWhen my mother was in first grade, she never had any food, and her first grade teacher noticed that. In those days, they just brought food, a little bag of food, then they'd sit in the classroom and eat it, and my mother never had any food. And that first grade teacher noticed that and began to bring extra food but without embarrassing her. She would say, 'You know, Dorothy, I brought too much food. Would you like this sandwich? Would you like this milk?' And it wasn't until she herself was much older that my mother realized that that teacher fed her for that school year, something she didn't have to do, but her love for her students, her recognition of a child who wasn't well taken care of meant that she stepped in.\nAnd then when my mother worked as a maid, she really wanted to go to high school. She started working right before she would have been in high school because she had to get out of her grandparents' home. And the woman she worked for realized how much my mother wanted to go to high school, and so she said to her, 'If you get up early – it sounds like Christine getting up so early. If you get up early and you get your chores done, you can go to high school.' And that's what my mother did for four years, she got up early and then she literally had to run, run to get to high school. It sounds harsh, but not for my mom. She thought it was such a great gift of kindness that this woman gave her a place to live, gave her food to eat, gave her the chance to go to high school.\nSo when I talk about us being stronger together, I'm not just talking about what our government needs to do, I'm talking about what each of us can do to contribute. We do need to make sure – we need to make sure that our economy does work for everyone not just those at the top, and that means we've got to make investments in more good, new jobs, infrastructure jobs, advanced manufacturing jobs, technology and innovation, clean renewable energy jobs. And we've got to do more to help small businesses because that's where most of the new jobs will come from.\nAs I said last night, my dad was a small businessman. When he got out of the Navy after World War II, he started this small business printing drapery fabrics, and he had a print plant in Chicago. It was just – it was dark room. There was no natural light. He had two long tables and he'd spread that fabric on the table, and then he would take silkscreens – if you've ever seen one – and he'd start at one end and he'd put it down, he'd pour the paint in, and he'd take the squeegee and he'd lift it up and he'd go all the way down to the end of one table, and then he'd start on the other table, and he would do that until he got the job done. And I would help him out from time to time, so I knew how hard he worked. But he was so proud that he could give us a good middle class life because his dad was a factory worker. And so he was able to do what we want to see in America, keep going, keep reaching, move as high as your hard work and ambition will take you.\nSo I want us to have an economy that works for everyone, to grow the economy, to create more jobs, but I also want a fairer economy because – when you work hard, you should not be still in poverty at the end of the year. But if you are a minimum wage worker, if you work full time minimum wage, you will make $15,000 a year. Two-thirds of minimum wage workers are women, most of them with families to support. And I've talked to a lot of these women. Sometimes I'll be at a cafй or sometimes I'll be in a store and I'll just start talking to them, and they will tell me – it's one of the most humbling experiences about being out there talking to people is that if you're open to it, folks will tell you what's on their minds and their hearts.\nSo I've met women who are working two full-time minimum wage jobs to make enough to be able to support their kids. So we need to raise the national minimum wage and – and we need to guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work because – number one, it's fair. It's fair. And if your mother, your wife, your sister, or your daughter is working, don't you want to see her paid what she should be paid for the work she does?\nAnd the other thing I want to do, I want to make sure that more companies offer profit-sharing to their employees who help make the profits in the first place. It makes no sense to me that sharing in profits would only go to the top executives. I want more people in more jobs to realize the benefit of their hard work.\nAnd last night at the debate, one of my guests was Mark Cuban. Now, Mark Cuban, who is a real billionaire, by the way, he has used profit-sharing from his very first successful business, and he not only used it while the business was going, but when the business was sold. He shared the profits from the sale and made 300 of his employees millionaires overnight.\nNow, that's the kind of business leadership I want to hold up, because what we've seen from my opponent is someone, who his own campaign manager has said, builds a lot of businesses on the back of the little guy, stiffing people – dishwashers, painters, plumbers, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers – across America. Some of them have come forward. You can go to our website; you can see their stories. It's heartbreaking. And as I said last night, I'm really glad my dad never had a contract with Donald Trump when he was running his small business.\nAnd in addition to making the economy fair, we've got to make it work better for working families who are trying to balance family and work. It's really hard out there, isn't it? And just listening to Christine's story – getting up at 4:00 and studying, getting kids up at 7:00, going to school, going to work, going to another job – that's not an uncommon story. We've made it really hard for a lot of people.\nSo here's what I think we need to do, and it's not a luxury, it's a necessity – because I want more families to be able to go as far as their hard work will take them. And I've heard so many stories. They've told me – people have told me about the difficult choices they face and the stresses they're under. So let's finally, since every other advanced economy has already done this, let's have paid family leave so that when you're sick or your spouse or your child is sick or you have a newborn, you can take care of your loved ones. And let's have earned sick days so that you don't lose your job because you're sick or you go to work because you're sick. And let's finally have affordable childcare, which in lots of states costs as much or more than in-state college tuition. I don't think any family should ever have to pay more than 10 percent of your income for childcare, and we're going to fix that so that becomes the norm. And then let's make sure that every educational opportunity is available without sending you into debt and breaking your budget.\nNow, tomorrow in New Hampshire, Bernie Sanders and I are going to talk about the college plan for debt-free college at public universities that he and I have worked on since the end of our primary. And I want – I want every family in North Carolina to know help is on the way. And we're also going to work so that you can refinance the debt you already have at much lower rates and get it paid off a lot sooner.\nNow, how are we going to do that? Well, we're going to go where the money is, and the money is at the top. We're going to go after millionaires, billionaires and corporations. We're going to raise taxes on millionaires and billionaires, and we're going to close corporate loopholes. And I believe that we can get that done, in part because you're going to send Deborah Ross to the Senate so we're going to have another Democratic senator. But also because our government needs to start working for everybody again – not just those who have lobbyists and lawyers and influence. That hasn't worked out so well. We've got to get back to first principles. Our job is to give the maximum opportunities to the maximum number of Americans and to especially focus on people who are working their way out of poverty and people in the middle class who want to go as far as they can go. Let's be a government for the struggling, the striving and the successful.\nSo I'm excited about what we can do. I really am. And I'm going to leave it to the fact-checkers to go through all of – all of Donald Trump's claims. There were – there was a lot of work for fact-checkers last night. But here's a couple of things that caught my attention. He actually bragged about gaming the system to get out of paying his fair share of taxes. In fact, I think there's a strong probability he hasn't paid federal taxes a lot of years. And this is a man who goes around calling our military a disaster; who goes around criticizing every institution, from health care to education, our vets. But he probably hasn't paid a penny to support our troops or our vets or our schools or our health care systems.\nAnd when I confronted him with the reasons why he won't release his tax returns – and I got to that point where I said, well, maybe he's paid zero – he said that makes him smart. Now, if not paying taxes makes him smart, what does that make all the rest of us? I got to tell you, Bill and I have been blessed. We didn't come from millionaire families. My husband's father – his biological father died before he was born. His mother went to nursing school in order to support him. They struggled. They worked hard. And America gave him the chance to get a good education, pursue his dreams, end up being President. My dad, as I told you, worked hard.\nSo Bill and I have released all of our tax returns going back 40 years. And if you look, you'll see that we paid the highest marginal rate. We tried to give 10 percent to charity. Because we believe in this country and we believe with the blessings that we've been given, we should do our part.\nThe other thing he admitted last night was that he actually rooted for the housing crisis to happen. I don't think I'd make a big bragging point out of that. But he seemed to feel like, hey, it shows you how smart I am. He basically said, 'Yeah, if the housing market crashes, I can go in and buy stuff and make some more money.' I got to tell you, what kind of person believes that? What kind of person would want to root for nine million families losing their homes? One who should never be president is the answer to that question.\nAnd he made it very clear that he didn't prepare for that debate. At one point he was kind of digging me for spending time off the campaign trail to get prepared. But just trying to keep track of everything he says took a lot of time and effort. And I said, 'Yeah. You know what? I did prepare. And I'll tell you something else I prepared for. I prepared to be president of the United States, and I think that's good.'\nSo as I said in the beginning, we have two different visions here. I believe we are stronger together. That is at the core of what I've done over my years in advocacy and public service. I believe that America is already great, and it is our responsibility to make it even greater. I believe that as we make our economy work for everyone, we also need to keep our country safe, and we need to provide strong, steady leadership in the world with our allies and our partners. I've laid out my views on a range of national security and foreign policy issues. I've laid out my plan for defeating and destroying ISIS. And what we hear from my opponent is dangerously incoherent. It's unclear exactly what he is saying.\nBut words matter. And last night it sounded like he was basically telling our treaty allies in Asia, \"Hey, we're not sure we're going to be there for you even though we have a mutual defense treaty.\" Words matter. People here that and they start to doubt America's word, America's intention. I felt like I had to jump in and say, 'I just want to be clear. We will honor our treaties. We will support our allies and our partners.'\nThis is not reality TV. This is real. It's as real as it gets. so we're going to get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top. We're going to keep America safe, provide strong, steady leadership, and we are going to bring our country together across the divides that have pitted Americans against each other. Economic worries are not the only ones keeping families up at night, are they? There's still a lot we don't know about the recent incidents in Tulsa and Charlotte, but this we do know: We've got to bring communities together. We have to listen to each other. We have to make it clear that everyone is safer when there is respect from the law for the communities they protect, and respect for the law from the communities that are protected.\nAnd we've got to do something about the epidemic of gun violence that has taken too many, too many lives in our country. Again, I think we can come together. A very long majority of Americans and a majority of gun owners believe in comprehensive background checks. They believe in the Second Amendment, as I do. They believe in the right of individuals to have guns, as I do. But they believe, along with me, that we should not let guns fall into the wrong hands of people who will use them to kill other people, and make it so easy to get them.\nSo there's work to do. But it's great work. It's important work, starting right here in North Carolina. We have 42 days left. This election's going to be close. They all are these days. That's why every call you make, every door you knock on, every friend you register to vote, to make the difference. I want you, if you can, to text 'join,' j-o-i-n, to 47246, or go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to volunteer here in North Carolina. And I know there's a big overflow room, and I'm told they can hear me, so to my friends in the overflow, we want you to be just as involved as anyone else. Thank you for coming.\nSo remember, here in North Carolina, starting on October 20th, you can register and vote early at the same time at any one-stop early voting site in your county. And remember, it's not just the presidential race. It's the governor's race, the lieutenant governor's race, the U.S. Senate race, and other races up and down the ticket. Because we want to prove who we are as Americans in this election. We're not fearful. We don't want to build walls. We want to build bridges. We don't want to turn against each other. We want to work with one another. We want to set big goals again here in our country.\nI've got some big goals that I know we can achieve. Take climate change, which my opponent says is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I think it could be one of the biggest economic opportunities our country has ever seen, and I want us to take advantage of that. Do the right thing and benefit from it. That's what I'm offering. We're going to deploy a half a billion more solar panels in the first four years of my administration. And we will produce enough clean power to power every home in America within 10 years. And we're going to lead the world because some country is going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. Now, the way things are stacking up, I think it's either going to be Germany, China, or us. I want it to be us and it will be us.\nThat is exactly right. I love this country. I'm proud of this country. I want to be a leader who brings people together in our country, sets those goals, gets about the business of achieving them, and proves once and for all that love trumps hate.

Every single one of those registrations carries the voice of the Muslim-American community—and there's no stronger message against Trump's hateful and divisive rhetoric than Americans coming together with pride and dignity. That's exactly that type of work that Emerge USA does: empower the next generation of Muslims to lead in their communities.\"The Muslim community knows that the stakes in this election could not be higher. From proposing to ban all Muslims from entering the United States, to attacking a Muslim Gold Star family whose son sacrificed his life for our country, to suggesting we monitor Muslim communities and places of worship, Trump has spent his entire campaign pitting Americans against each other and denigrating the Muslim-American community. It's shameful. It's disrespectful. It's simply un-American. And it makes us less safe. Donald Trump's constant demonization of Muslims plays straight into ISIS' hands.\"While Trump continues to paint a dark and misleading picture of the Muslim-American community, groups like Emerge USA remind us of the incredible contributions the community has made to our country. Muslim-Americans are entrepreneurs and inventors, they are students and teachers, soldiers and police officers—in short, they are the  best of America. I'm so grateful for the endorsement and the support of Muslim Americans across the country, and I will continue fighting to advance equality and keep our country safe.\"", "timestamp": "2016-09-27", "title": "Hillary Clinton Statement on the Emerge USA PAC Endorsement"}
{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119576", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n12:49 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Well, well, well. (Laughter.) Where to start?\nQ: Are you talking about last night maybe?\nMR. EARNEST: Since I'm not sure where to start, Darlene, why don't you decide where we'll start?\nQ: Do you have any observations from the President about the debate last night? I mean, did he keep at least one ear on all or part of it?\nMR. EARNEST: As predicted, the President did have the debate on television last night in the Indian Treaty Room of the residence while he was reviewing his nightly to-do list.\nThe President had an opportunity to talk about this with Ryan Seacrest just a little bit earlier this afternoon. But, look, his main takeaway is that the candidate that he strongly supports is the candidate that performed quite strongly in the debate last night. She made a very powerful case, particularly at the beginning, for building on the economic progress this country has made in digging out of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. She laid out a strategy that's focused on cutting taxes for middle-class families, asking those at the top of the income scale to pay a little bit more, closing tax loopholes that only benefit the wealthy and the well-connected, focusing on investments in early childhood education and college education, growing our economy from the middle out.\nThat is precisely the economic strategy that President Obama has pursued, and that is the strategy that has yielded the longest streak of consecutive, monthly job growth numbers in our nation's history. And we saw in the Census data that was released just a couple of weeks ago that in 2015, the median income in this country rose higher than it ever has -- at least on record -- in one year, and that poverty declined as much in one year as it has in about 50 years.\nSo the President has pursued a strategy similar to the one that Secretary Clinton advocated, and our country has benefitted enormously from it. And he certainly was pleased to hear her deliver such a persuasive case about why that's a strategy that is worth building on.\nQ: What did he think when the subject turned to Donald Trump's taxes and his refusal to release them, and he bragged about how it made him smarter to not pay any federal income taxes? I mean, is there any reaction from the President to that? Or even from you? I know you said you don't want to stand up there every day and react to everything that Donald Trump says, but --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President is also in a position where he has a little bit more latitude to respond to these kinds of declarations. So I think what I'll just leave it to is the President is somebody who, when he was running for President, made a conscious decision to abide by the standard that's been observed for more than a generation, which is he made a decision to release his tax returns. And even while serving in office as President, he continues to release his tax returns on an annual basis. And I'm not aware of any federal law requiring it, but if every presidential candidate in both parties dating back to the '70s has done it, then it certainly is something that voters can expect. And the President believes that that kind of transparency is good for the process and good for voters as they make a really important decision about the future of the country.\nQ: On one other topic, Senate Democrats are threatening to block the CR this afternoon because it doesn't include money for Flint, Michigan, which is an issue that you've said has concerned the President. Does the White House support Senate Democrats in their stated attempt to block this bill this afternoon?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President has made clear for months that Congress needs to act to provide resources to this community of Flint. The President had an opportunity to visit that community back in the spring, and he met with the mayor, and he talked to some residents, he talked to federal officials who were responsible for coordinating the response. And what he saw was a community that had been let down by their government. And we've been advocating for months that Congress has a responsibility to step forward and provide resources to assist that community in their recovery.\nNow, the executive branch, the administration has certainly fulfilled our responsibilities. The President mobilized FEMA; FEMA handed out hundreds of thousands of liters of water. We have seen ramped-up assistance to meet the basic health care needs of children that potentially were negatively affected by drinking the water. And there's been an effort to try to address some of these problems at the community level. But there is a significant investment in infrastructure in Flint that's required to address this problem, and Congress has a responsibility to step forward and provide those resources. The President has been calling on them to do that for months.\nSo included in the proposed text -- at least based on what I've been told -- are steps that Congress has taken to provide relief to families in Louisiana and Maryland and other places that have been hit by historic flooding. Those are communities that need to be rebuilt as well, and the President was among the first to call on Congress to act to provide resources to Louisiana. And the President believes that Congress should do the same thing for Flint and other communities that are dealing with similar challenges.\nQ: Republicans say, though, that they will take care of Flint, Michigan, in separate legislation. So does the White House not believe Republicans when they say that that's how they'll take care of that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, based on -- as I have acknowledged on many occasions standing here, I am certainly no expert in the legislative procedure, but based on what I understand of the situation, there is some funding for Flint included in the Senate's version of the water resources bill. The House version does not include funding for -- the House version of the water resources bill does not include funding for Flint.\nNow, this is a little ironic because the Speaker of the House says he opposes adding funding for Flint to the continuing resolution and believes that it should be handled in the Water Resources bill. But it's not included in the Water Resources bill that advancing through the House. And then he has the nerve to suggest that it's Democrats who are the ones causing problems. So I guess a little clarity about Republicans' commitment to addressing this issue is needed. And after waiting for six or seven months for this funding to come through, that clarification would be eagerly welcomed by the White House, but most importantly, by the people in Flint.\nRoberta?\nQ: You talked about the economic case that Secretary Clinton laid out, but I'm wondering -- last night we saw her on the offensive on issues like race and the birther issue and temperament. And I'm wondering what the President said to you about what he thought about the tone of the debate, and some of the attacks that we saw.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, the President has made the observation on a number of occasions that there's a tradition in this country of a pretty confrontational brand of politics. And I think what the American people are looking for in their leaders are people who are tough enough to enter the arena and stand up for what they believe in, and to make a forceful case for what they believe in and to respond to even some tough criticism of the priorities and their agenda. And the President certainly engaged in that process over the last eight years or so, and he's got the scars to prove it.\nSo, look, I know that there was an expression from at least one candidate last night who was concerned that people weren't being nice to him. But, look, this is supposed to be a vigorous debate, and when you consider the stakes in this election, the President would anticipate and expect a tough debate on the issues. I think that's what we saw last night.\nQ: And out of curiosity, why did the White House -- or why did he choose to go on Ryan Seacrest to talk about the debate and give his response or reaction to it? What was sort of the decision behind that audience?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the reason that the President wanted to go on the Ryan Seacrest show today is that today is National Voter Registration Day, and the President devoted most of his appearance on that program to encouraging people to register to vote. The President also taped an interview with Steve Harvey that will air tomorrow where he made a similar case.\nSo that's why he did those radio shows. But it's not surprising -- or at least it wasn't a surprise to anybody at the White House -- that he was asked by both those hosts for a reaction to the debate last night.\nQ: And just quickly on the Yahoo hack. I'm wondering whether the White House has concerns or questions about whether the company waited too long to notify users about when it happened.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I will say that I cannot speak to the details in terms of what Yahoo has indicated occurred in the context of this hack. But I'd refer to my colleagues at the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security who have jurisdiction here and may be able to provide you with some greater clarity about what they've concluded.\nChris.\nQ: Josh, on the President's schedule today is a fundraiser in D.C. for the Hillary Victory Fund that's an LGBT and allies discussion. I'm sure the President has the goal of raising a lot of money at the event, but does he have any sort of achievement in mind in terms of the message he wants to convey to those in attendance.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Chris, this is a rather small event, so it's not open. The President will spend his time in discussion with those who are attending the event and talking about something you've heard the President talk about a lot before, which is, the stakes in this election; how important it is for Democrats to stand up for our values and fight in support of a candidate that's seeking to advance them. And the President's already spoken a lot publicly about his strong support for Secretary Clinton, and I would expect him to reiterate that pitch once again at the event this afternoon.\nQ: One of the things that we did not see during the Obama administration was the appointment of an openly-LGBT Cabinet member. If one of the attendance members brought that up or any other enhancement of LGBT rights that they wanted to have done, how do you imagine the President would respond?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Chris, I think the President's quite proud of his record of ensuring that there are senior officials in his administration -- let me say it this way. The President is quite proud of appointing senior officials in his administration that reflect the diversity of the country. And that's true when you consider the President's White House staff. It's true when you consider senior officials who serve at agencies across the government. It's also true when you consider the appointments that the President's made to the federal bench. And whether you evaluate that diversity based on race, or religion, or sexual orientation, the President's record surpasses that of his predecessors. And he is quite proud of that legacy.\nHe also believes that's a legacy that can be built on. And I'll let Secretary Clinton speak to what her plans are for the kinds of appointments that she would choose to make if she were elected President.\nApril.\nQ: Josh, last night, many people are hands-down saying that Hillary Clinton was the victor, who include people from the Republican Party. But at the same time, with this victory, does the White House still believe that there is still an open window for Donald Trump to still possibly become number 45?\nMR. EARNEST: The President believes it's important for people all across the country not to be complacent when the stakes are so high. And that's why the President was encouraging people to register to vote today on National Voter Registration Day. It's also why the President is going to spend a good portion of his October encouraging people all across the country to get out to the polls and make their voices heard on this Election Day. And the President believes that that's an important thing to do.\nQ: Vice President Biden used some very strong language today, talking about some of Donald Trump's comments from last night, particularly when it came to Donald Trump saying it was a good business deal when there was a housing crisis in America -- he was benefitting from people's problems. The Vice President used the word, h-e-double hockey sticks. So did the President feel -- well, I don't want to press it in the briefing room --\nMR. EARNEST: I appreciate your restraint. (Laughter.)\nQ: Thank you. Did the President feel as upset about that someone who potentially could be in the Oval Office has profited off of people's pain -- the American public's pain?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think the President believes that that is a worthy question for voters to ask themselves. President Obama's career in public life is different than that. President Obama had spent the early stages of his career as a community organizer, helping people in communities that were facing significant economic headwinds protect their community. And whether or not that is -- so that's what made the President an advocate for expanded health care access and affordable housing programs and stronger education programs. And the President worked closely with faith-based organizations, helped citizens organize and petition their government.\nSo when faced with these kinds of challenges in the past, President Obama wasn't seeking a profit, he was trying to help people. And he's pursued that same kind of approach even as the leader of the free world. And many of the policies that he's been focused on as President of the United States, particularly early in his presidency, were about ensuring that middle-class families would get a fair shake and a fair shot. That's why he fought so hard to create the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau -- the only financial regulator in Washington, D.C. that has a mission statement focused on consumers and middle-class families. That's why the President fought so hard to expand access to quality, affordable health insurance for every American. That's why the President's focus in improving the economy has been focused on growing the economy from the middle out. That's been his approach throughout his career, and he believes that's an approach worth building on.\nSecretary Clinton has got a similar story to tell when you consider her professional career. I'll let her talk about that. But I think it is certainly appropriate -- and I think the President made this clear in the context of his presidential -- when he was a candidate on the ballot, he made clear that he intended to pursue a different approach or pursue an approach different than the one that was advocated last night by the Republican nominee, but an approach that's consistent with President Obama's focus on middle-class families and those families that are trying to get into the middle class that he's demonstrated throughout his career.\nQ: Lastly, when both candidates were asked about how to heal the racial divide that has been quite evident in this election cycle, Donald Trump said it was about law and order, and then he goes into talking about stop-and-frisk. What does this administration feel about that -- particularly when you started not long ago having conversations on race and he's talking racial profiling and law and order -- what's the thought about that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, as was noted during the debate, there are a lot of constitutional questions that are raised by that policy, and there's even a federal judge who weighed in and made clear that that stop-and-frisk policy that was used in New York is one that was inconsistent with the Constitution. As I've observed before -- it's a little strange to hear somebody who claims to feel so passionately about protecting the constitutional right to bear arms treat the constitutional right protecting against illegal search and seizure so cavalierly.\nSo President Obama believes that both of those constitutional rights are worth protecting, and that certainly is consistent with his approach to these kinds of issues. I think what's also true is -- and I'll leave it to officials in New York to speak to this -- but since that stop-and-frisk policy was ended, they've seen an improvement in their crime rates. So can you draw real, firm conclusions about the impact of that policy based on just a year or two of data? I'll leave that to the experts. But those are the facts and I think they're worth considering as you evaluate the approach that's being advocated by at least one candidate for President.\nOlivier.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Is the President preparing to send more American troops to Iraq or Syria?\nMR. EARNEST: Olivier, I don't have any announcements at this point about additional commitment of resources to our efforts against ISIL in Iraq and in Syria, but you've heard the President speak many times about his approach to these issues, which is, every time the President gets his national security team together to discuss our ongoing strategy against ISIL, they have a discussion about which aspects of that strategy are making the most progress. And we've enjoyed some important progress in recent weeks. There is additional progress that's been made on the ground against ISIL, both in Iraq and in Syria. The noose around the ISIL leadership in Mosul and in Raqqa continues to tighten. That's a testament to the efforts of the forces on the ground that are supported by the United States and our coalition partners.\nWe've also made progress in applying pressure to the ISIL leadership. And earlier this month -- or over the last month, there were a couple of strikes that were taken by the United States that took two senior ISIL officials off the battlefield. These are two individuals who had a central role in plotting ISIL's external operations. That doesn't just enhance the national security of the United States; that also makes it harder for ISIL to carry out attacks in Europe and other places where the United States is invested in our allies' national security.\nBut as the President has these conversations with his national security team, they aren't just looking to see which aspects of that strategy are showing progress. The President regularly asks, could we make more progress if we devote additional resources to that effort? And when the answer to that question is yes, the President has worked very closely with his team to find those resources and to devote them to that effort in a timely fashion.\nSo, I don't have any announcements at this point, but we'll keep you posted if that changes.\nQ: One more. There's a Daily Beast report that the senior -- Special Envoy to Syria Michael Ratney was told two days before the latest airstrikes against the so-called White Helmets in Aleppo that an attack was coming. Can you confirm that the U.S. government at that level had advance warning?\nMR. EARNEST: Olivier, I have not seen that report, but why don't I check on it and we will follow up with you directly.\nCheryl.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Two quick topics. On the CR, if Congress can't get an agreement by the end of the week, will the President sign a two- or three-day extension if needed?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't heard that option be floated at this point. The President certainly is not interested in seeing the government funding lapse, but this is not an executive branch responsibility. This is a legislative branch responsibility. And Republicans have a substantial majority in both the House and the Senate. It is the responsibility of House and Senate Republican leaders to pass a bipartisan budget bill that arrives on the President's desk in time for him to sign it before funding runs out on September 30th.\nSo I recognize that right now Republicans in the Congress are scrambling to try to figure out how to get this done. Some of that may be attributable to the fact they took seven weeks off earlier this year. Maybe that's time that would have been better spent actually focusing on putting together a responsible bipartisan budget proposal.\nQ: And one other thing. Today, the D.C. Circuit is hearing oral arguments in the Clean Power Plan. Can you outline any of the administration's arguments?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'll leave it to my colleagues at the Department of Justice to make the legal case to the D.C. Circuit. Obviously, we've got a lot of confidence in the case that they will make. The administration was acting on a strong legal and technical foundation in issuing -- or putting forward the policy that the administration announced last year. And the President is convinced that this is a policy that is important to living up to the commitments that we've made in the context of cutting carbon pollution in a way that will be good for the long-term health of the planet.\nThe President is also convinced that this policy is actually going to end up being good for the U.S. economy. We know that investments in clean energy have created tens -- or supported tens of thousands of jobs all across the country, and we've had success in significantly expanding the amount of energy that is produced through wind and solar and other renewable forms.\nI'll also point out that there are significant public health consequences for this policy. And our scientists estimate that implementing this policy to reduce carbon pollution by 32 percent by 2030 would avoid 3,000 premature deaths, 90,000 childhood asthma attacks, and eliminate 300,000 missed work- and schooldays each year by 2030. So there are a lot of important reasons why the President has prioritized this approach to cutting carbon pollution, and the administration is quite confident in the legal power of the arguments that we'll make before the D.C. Circuit about why it's within the scope of the President's authority to make that kind of policy decision.\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, the Senate does appear poised to override that presidential veto of the 9/11 bill that would allow the families to sue Saudi Arabia. Why do you think that it's this particular issue that has allowed the first presidential veto override?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think there are a couple reasons for that. The first is, we have not seen the United States Congress be particularly effective at passing legislation. The President hasn't issued that many vetoes, period. And I made this observation on a number of occasions. Over the last couple of years, we haven't seen Speaker Boehner or Speaker Ryan work effectively with Leader McConnell to pass legislation that advances the conservative agenda.\nIt's not as if in the last year and a half you've seen Congress pass bills that would cut taxes for American businesses or cut spending -- cut government spending -- or increase funding for the military, or any of the other conservative priorities that they spend a lot of time talking about but not actually legislating. So the fact that the President hasn't vetoed that many bills I think is a pretty damning indictment of the effectiveness of Republicans in Congress. That's just a fact.\nI think that is why it's not just Democrats who are dissatisfied with the performance of the United States Congress. There are plenty of Republicans who are pretty unhappy. They cast votes. They elected a Republican majority to the United States Congress and what do they have to show for it? Not very much.\nSo that's part of it. I think the other part of it is that you have seen Democrats on Capitol Hill who work very effectively to try to champion ideas that the President supports as well, and having a lot of Democratic unity in fighting for some of the priorities that the President cares about has allowed us to make some progress in areas that are Democratic priorities. So one example of that would be the budget agreement that they reached last year, essentially a two-year budget agreement that, the hope had been that that would prevent any budget drama this year. We'll see if that remains to be true.\nBut the President has strong views about this legislations and the impact that it would have not just on the U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia, but with countries around the world. It would increase the risk that is facing our servicemembers and our diplomats and our intelligence professionals. And that is a view that President has stated on a number of occasions.\nIt is a view that has been -- it's an argument that was also made by -- in a letter -- by President George W. Bush's attorney general and his national security advisor. They also have significant concerns about impact that this bill would have on our servicemembers and our diplomats. And some of America's closest allies, including in Europe, have raised concerns about this bill entering into law.\nSo the President feels strongly about this. He's also aware of how challenging the politics are, and --\nQ: How challenging the politics are because some Democrats are helping to make this happen, and balking at what the White House is asking them to do. Don't you think there's something very emotional on this particular issue that is getting Democratic support to reject what the White House is asking them to do?\nMR. EARNEST: Oh, listen, I don't deny the political and emotional power of these arguments. But, look, the President has spoken powerfully on a number of occasions about the sacrifice that's been made by the families of those in the United States who lost loved ones on 9/11. And the resilience that they have shown has served as a continuing inspiration to the President personally.\nSo I think what's also true is the politics of this are tough, but, look, nobody questions the President's commitment to protecting the country and protecting the interest of America's 9/11 families, primarily because he's the President that ordered the mission against Osama Bin Laden. He's the President who fought hard to ensure that 9/11 first responders and the rescue workers at Ground Zero got the access to health care that they need when they risked their lives to try to save their fellow Americans but also to rebuild that site.\nSo, look, the President is able to take the political heat because he's got the strong track record on this issue. But again, I'll let individual members of Congress speak for themselves. We have heard from Democrats and Republicans who have indicated some openness to the position that we've articulated. They've expressed some concerns about the potential impact of this bill. We'll just have to see if those private concerns end up in the public votes that they cast.\nQ: Do you think that you might have enough votes to block this from happening?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not going to make any predictions about a congressional outcome here. I'm just giving you a sense of the kind of argument that the Obama administration is making to members of Congress. This is the same argument that was included in the letter from a bipartisan group of national security experts, including President George W. Bush's attorney general and his national security advisor. This is the argument that we heard from some of our closest allies. This is also, by the way, consistent with the argument that we saw in a letter today from Jeffrey Immelt, the chief executive at GE, who raised significant concerns about the further erosion of this concept of sovereign immunity and the impact it could have on American businesses.\nSo there are widespread, longstanding concerns that have been articulated, and the question remains whether or not members of Congress will demonstrate the courage of their convictions and vote their conscience.\nQ: Two administrations have now said that there is no link between senior Saudi officials and the terrorists who carried out these attacks. So given that, and you standing by those findings, why do you think it is such a risk that if these cases make it to court that they could find otherwise?\nMR. EARNEST: Our concern is not rooted in a prediction about the outcome of these individual court cases. I have no idea what judges will ultimately conclude, I haven't reviewed the evidence that the families or others may present. Our concern is rooted in the erosion of this foundational principle of international law.\nAnd the concern is rooted in the idea that the United States of America is more deeply engaged in more countries around the world than any other country in the world. So carving out additional exceptions to sovereign immunity puts the United States at greater risk than any other country in the world. By virtue of the fact that we are more engaged around the globe than any other country in the world. That's the concern that the President has. And, again, it's not just the President who's making this argument. It is national security experts in both parties, leaders in the private sector, and the leaders of some of our closest allies are expressing the same concerns.\nQ: What do you say to the families who, in their view, believe the White House is standing in the way of justice?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, the President is very sympathetic to the argument that the 9/11 families make. And the President is very interested in making sure that those families understand that this administration stands with them. This is an administration that sought justice for their loved ones. This is the administration that fought to ensure that our rescue workers got the health care that they deserve. And this is the President who, every year, has paid tribute to those who were lost on 9/11.\nSo the President understands the passion that's on both sides of this issue. It's the President's responsibility to consider the broader impact that this bill, as it's currently written, would have on our national security, and our standing around the world, and on our diplomats and our servicemembers who represent the United States around the world.\nQ: One final question, different topic -- Syria. Any update on any National Security Council meetings, White House meetings about the siege underway in Aleppo and whether there's going to be any intervention?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any update on any discussions. But, obviously, this is a situation that continues to be of deep concern by the President and his national security team and it's something that we're going to continue to closely monitor.\nJames.\nQ: Josh, thank you. I have three issues I think we can knock out fairly quickly before we return to a fourth that may take a bit longer, being the debate. First, just on JASTA, my understanding is that the Senate Republican leadership has indicated that action in that chamber on this measure will begin tomorrow or thereabouts.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes.\nQ: If that is your understanding as well, is that occasioning any intensification of the lobbying effort by the White House and/or by the President?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have any specific presidential conversations to talk about at this point, but the administration and the White House remain engaged in making our case to members of Congress and will continue to do that as long as we have the option to do so.\nQ: On the event today, concerning outreach to millennials, if one studied the attendee list, one saw that among those in attendance is an executive associated with the program Funny or Die. And I just wonder if you could provide for us a bit of the strategic communications thinking that goes into the invitation to a White House summit of somebody associated with a program whose name is Funny or Die?\nMR. EARNEST: This is an outlet that has had a lot of success in building a large audience among young people. And the President has gone to places like Buzzfeed and even Between Two Ferns to make a persuasive case the young people should consider signing up for health care through the marketplaces, so it makes sense to engage as many organizations as we can who have that kind of audience. And we certainly welcomed the constructive engagement that we got from Funny or Die.\nQ: Besides the simple practicality of seeking out such individuals and venues for outreach to millennials, does it say anything about the state of this younger generation that they may be getting their news through a place like Funny or Die or Between Two Ferns and so forth, and that an institution like the White House has to seek out the help of -- if you've been around a long time or if you have any sense of history, you would see the sort of -- it would jump out at you that somebody associated with a program like Funny Or Die as White House summit attendee, and what does it say about --\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, I think it's a commentary on the increasingly fragmented nature of our media environment, that people have an opportunity to get their news and to be informed based on the way they consume information from a wide variety of sources. And, look, the President is still interested in engaging with outlets like all of you to talk about the Affordable Care Act, and I'm confident that he'll do that in the four months that are remaining here while he's in office. But we would be remiss -- I guess to use another legal term, it would be malpractice to fail to engage those kinds of outlets that we also know have a substantial audience that we're trying to reach. So that's part of what we're doing today.\nQ: \"Malpractice\" is also a medical term, so it's very --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, that's what I was referring to there, rather clumsily.\nQ: Finally, before we tackle the debate again, DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson spoke today about the many resources that his agency is making available to state election officials and offices to protect the integrity of the elections at the state level in terms of cybersecurity and so forth. How confident is the administration about the integrity of the electoral process in this season of cyberattacks and so on?\nMR. EARNEST: James, we continue to be very confident for a variety of reasons. I think one of the most important reasons is that many of -- because state elections -- because elections are controlled at the state and local level, and they're administered by state and local officials, there's not one central repository that lends itself to easily corrupting or influencing a national election. So the fact that you essentially have administrators using a variety of systems in 50 different states and thousands of localities means that that poses a pretty unique challenge to hackers.\nNow, it also poses a pretty unique challenge to individuals who are interested in reforming and making the system more efficient, but it does come in handy when you consider potential vulnerabilities in cyberspace.\nThe second thing that I would note is that the Department of Homeland Security however does maintain significant resources and expertise that can be made available to state and local elections administrators who want to do everything they can to protect their systems. And we certainly would encourage them to consider availing themselves of those resources. And I know that Secretary Johnson has put together essentially a working group that includes people from all across the country that do have an expertise in this that can be helpful in trying to facilitate that delivery of that expertise and of those resources to administrators across the country.\nBut overall, the administration continues to have a high degree of confidence in the ability of election administrators all across the country to conduct a free and fair election consistent with the expectations of the American people. And I think the American people share that confidence.\nQ: All right. So the debate -- again, two separate topics here. At the beginning of the briefing, you commended Secretary Clinton for the case she made on behalf of the President's economic stewardship and how she would bring that forward in various respects. In explaining why she would seek to raise taxes on the wealthy, Mrs. Clinton said that the wealthy \"have made all the gains in the economy.\" Was that an accurate depiction of the economy that the President has stewarded in this recovery, where the wealthy have made all the gains?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the latest Census report indicates that we have actually seen income growth all across the income scale, but there's actually been more income growth among lower and middle-income families than there has been among families at the top of the income scale, at least in the year 2015. That is a reflection of the priority that the President has placed on focusing our strategy to support middle-class families and those families that are working hard to get into the middle class.\nQ: So her description was inaccurate; it's not the wealthy that made all the gains in the economy, correct?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think the latest Census data indicates that there has been important gains enjoyed by families at the low and middle-income level in 2015, and that's a --\nQ: That's not an accurate statement, correct?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, I didn't see the direct quote, so we'll take a look at it. But what I can tell you is that the numbers indicate that we've made important progress in helping families in the middle grow their incomes in a way that is consistent with a smart approach to growing our overall economy. And I know that's an approach that Secretary Clinton shares and is promising to build on.\nQ: Before we proceed to the final subject of the debate I want to pursue with you, again, one is compelled to ask you if the recovery has been so successful and if the stewardship of the economy has benefited so many different sectors of the economy and so many different classes in the economy, and all the various points you made, why is it that public opinion surveys -- not just one snapshot, but over time and repeatedly, and no matter who is doing the polling -- show that large majorities of the electorate regard the country as being on the wrong track? There's only two possibilities, Josh. Either they have it right -- the country is headed down the wrong track. Or they don't, and they're just misinformed or laboring under some misapprehension about the economy that's so wonderful. Why does three-quarters of the electorate regard the country as being on the wrong track?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think people are quite dissatisfied with the dysfunction they see in Congress and the fact that we are once again, three or four days before a deadline, and Congress has not acted to keep the government open and fulfill their basic functions might leave people more than a little dissatisfied with their representation in Washington, D.C. right now.\nI think the second thing is there has been a concerted effort on the part of Republicans -- not just one presidential candidate, but several of them -- to spend a lot of money and a lot of time on the stump tearing down the economy and tearing down the country and being sharply critical of the country. And that's unfortunate, but that's going to have impact and that's going to take a toll.\nI think the third thing is, what we did see is that the memory of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression is still very present in the minds of many people across the country, and while they have certainly benefited from the kinds of gains that I've described, I think people understand that those gains are fragile. And they're right. There is the prospect that our economy would be significantly weakened and undermined if we were to revert back to the kinds of policies that got us into this mess in the first place. And that's why the President has regularly made the case that the stakes in this election are rather high, the gains are fragile. And that's why he's so forcefully supporting a candidate who is vowing to build on the progress we've made as opposed to tearing it down.\nQ: Lastly, you said earlier in the briefing -- you described earlier in the briefing President Obama's reaction to watching the debate and I think provided some of your own sentiments about the debate as well. Your comments were focused on the two participants in the debate, but I wonder if either you or the President have any view of Lester Holt as the moderator and his performance.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, I think -- I've heard the analogy to the moderators to either umpires in a baseball game or referees in a basketball game. And if you're in a situation where in the immediate aftermath of a contest you're talking about the officiating, that usually means one of two things -- that the officials did a bad job or that you're on the losing end of the contest. So the fact that we've gone through a good 40 minutes or so of the briefing without mentioning Mr. Holt's name I think is a pretty good endorsement of his performance.\nQ: So it eluded the President's attention that Mr. Holt, who enjoys the respect of everyone in this room, this questioner included, nonetheless, last night, pressed Mr. Trump pointedly on just about every perceived area of vulnerability for him, including his early statements about the Iraq war, his refusal to release his tax returns, his role in the birther issue, his endorsement of stop-and-frisk, and his comments about whether or not Mrs. Clinton has a presidential look, but somehow failed to press Mrs. Clinton even a single time on any of her perceived points of vulnerability such as her conduct with her emails, the role of the Clinton Foundation in the Clinton State Department, her refusal to release her Goldman Sachs speeches, her deep trustworthy deficit with the American electorate, her role in the destruction of Libya or the Benghazi attacks. None of those things were pressed by Mr. Holt. Did that elude the President's attention, that sort of seeming imbalance in the questioning?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't think it's accurate to say that all of Mr. Trump's vulnerabilities were covered. I'll let other people be the judge of that. But I think what is true is that the debate lasted 90 minutes, and there's a reason that the Commission on Presidential Debate doesn't just schedule one -- they schedule three. And certainly in the two subsequent debates I would anticipate that there will be additional topics covered.\nRon.\nQ: Just one more thing about the debate and this trade -- the Trans-Pacific Partnership. How did the President feel about watching his former Secretary of State essentially trash this deal that is so important to his legacy while literally tens of millions of Americans are watching?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, the view that was expressed by both presidential candidates with regard to the Trans-Pacific Partnership is different than the view that's been advocated by the President. And that's why -- I mean, look, Ron, if anything, it strengthens the case that we make to Congress that this is something they need to act on before the end of the year, because either way, it is now crystal-clear that whoever is elected President is not going to be somebody who is enthusiastic about the kind of approach that President Obama has pursued.\nAnd look, when it comes to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, President Obama negotiated a good deal. This is a deal that will level the playing field for American workers. It will cut 18,000 taxes that other countries impose on American goods. And this is a deal that's been endorsed by the Chamber of Commerce, the American Farm Bureau, the Business Roundtable and the National Association of Manufacturers. Those are four organizations that are not typically strong advocates of policies put forward by the Obama administration, but in this case, they have strongly endorsed the Trans-Pacific Partnership and are encouraging Republicans in the United States Congress to support it.\nSo I think that it speaks well of the President's approach to this issue, but I also thinks it speaks to the urgency that members of Congress are going to need to feel if this kind of approach to protecting America's interest around the world is one they share.\nQ: Has the President ever spoken -- recently spoken to the Secretary about this particular thing?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not going to read out all the details of their conversations. They had an opportunity to see each other a couple of times when she was in D.C. a week and a half ago.\nQ: And how is he going to campaign on this issue out there in the world in the coming weeks -- not months, but weeks -- when he clearly feels so strongly about this and she clearly feels so negatively about it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, the President has not hesitated to put forward a persuasive case about why he believes the Trans-Pacific Partnership is something that Congress needs to ratify before the end of the year. And he's going to continue to make that forceful case. He believes it's in the clear national interest of the country when it comes to considering the strategic situation in Asia. He also believes it's important when you consider the impact that this policy would have on working people all across the country -- that there are communities across the country that are facing a challenge from globalization, and the question really is, what are we going to do about it?\nAnd President Obama has implemented a strategy that will confront those forces of globalization, level the playing field in some of those economies that have some of the fastest-growing economies in the world, and that ultimately is going to be good for our economy, good for America's businesses, and good for America's workers.\nThe President is not going to hesitate to make that argument. But when he's on the campaign trail encouraging people to support Secretary Clinton, he, I think understandably, is going to be quite focused on the --\nQ: Something else.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess I would say on the many, many things that they have in common. On the many, many priorities that they share.\nQ: It just seems like such a contradiction on such a huge issue that he feels so strongly about. And let's assume for a moment that somehow this does get passed. Then clearly the next President is opposed to this. What does that say to our allies? What does it say to -- I mean, how is this thing ever going to become -- take root and actually become a significant part of our country's policy if both future Presidents are against it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, first of all, I don't think it's a contradiction, I think it's just a difference of opinion.\nQ: So at some point does he expect Secretary Clinton to just flip on this?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I take her at her word, so I'll let her describe her opinion and her position on this issue. With regard to the policy, the other 11 countries that are party to this agreement are counting on the United States to be true to our word. Some of them have already started implementing the kinds of reforms that benefit the United States, but those reforms are contingent on the completion of the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- that our ability to raise labor standards, to raise human rights standards, to improve intellectual property protections, to raise environmental standards in these countries in the Asia Pacific -- those are all policies that benefit the United States, both in terms of being consistent with our values, but also in terms of leveling the playing field so that American workers and American businesses will have an opportunity to fairly compete.\nAnd other countries are interested in the United States following through on our commitment and implementing the agreement. And the President heard a whole lot about this when he was traveling in Asia earlier this month. And so this is something that the President sees as a priority. And we know that the U.S. business community that, as I mentioned, is typically aligned with the Republican Party, is typically not so supportive of an Obama administration policy, but in this instance, they are advocating to Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill that this is something that we need to get done.\nQ: Question on Syria. When you were talking about the national security meetings that the President has, you were very specific in saying that there's a lot of discussion about ISIS -- the counter-ISIS campaign, and so on and so forth. Is there discussion specifically about the Syrian regime and the civil war as well by that group? And have they gotten to the point where they have -- I think Mark kind of asked you this earlier -- where they have ruled out everything essentially?\nMR. EARNEST: No, they have not ruled out everything. What they have -- what's important for you to understand about these conversations is that there is broad recognition that the failed leadership of Bashar al-Assad has created the conditions on the ground inside of Syria that have allowed extremism to take root. His failure to lead that country, in fact his willingness to divide that country, by waging war against his own citizens have fueled extremism, and it's created enough chaos that organizations like ISIL and even al Qaeda have sought to establish a safe haven or a toe hold inside of Syria and use that as a base of operations to threaten the United States and our allies around the world.\nSo, yes, the administration and the President has implemented a policy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. But we also have been very focused on trying the address the root causes of this conflict that have allowed ISIL to flourish. And that is the failed leadership of Bashar al-Assad. That's why Secretary Kerry has devoted so many sleepless days and nights to trying to negotiate with the Russians and to try to advance political talks so that we can bring about the kind of political transition inside Syria that even the Russians acknowledge is necessary.\nQ: Is there any -- given what's happening in Aleppo in the last days since the ceasefires fell apart, is there any rethinking of what America perceives as its only -- as its national security interest in that theater, in that context, given what seems to be an impending humanitarian disaster there -- worse than what we've seen during the past -- or I mean, it's a very common-sense -- is the situation there so terrible that the President is rethinking what he might want to do there? Is he even considering it?\nMR. EARNEST: What I'd say about this, Ron, is a couple things. The situation in Syria has been terrible for years now, unfortunately, and there are too many countless innocent lives that have been lost, and millions of other lives that have been changed for the worse as a result of the chaos and violence that we've seen in that country. But, look, I would also acknowledge the situation there has gotten worse in recent days, that the bombing has been more intense, that the pace of the military attacks against innocent civilians has only increased, that the willingness on the part of the Assad regime, oftentimes with the support of the Russians, has been more egregious in terms of targeting civilians and civilian facilities.\nWe've seen that the Syrian regime has been willing to target first responders -- so-called White Helmets. We know that there was a military strike that was focused on the supply of drinking water that was available to the citizens of -- or the civilians in eastern Aleppo. So I would acknowledge that the situation in Aleppo has gotten worse.\nBut what's also true is that the President and his team are always looking carefully at the situation to determine if there's something different that we can do, if there's more that the United States should do to protect our interests in that region of the world.\nQ: And the disappointing answer to that question is no.\nMR. EARNEST: No, at this point, the approach is we're going to be squarely focused on ISIL and other extremists in Syria and Iraq that could pose a threat to the United States, and we're making important progress in backing opposition forces on the ground, carrying out airstrikes, and working closely with the Iraqi government to apply pressure both to ISIL leadership but also to retake territory that ISIL had previously held. We continue to be focused on trying to work closely with the U.N. to facilitate some kind of transition inside of Syria that would address the root causes of all of this chaos. That work continues.\nThere continues to be important work that's being done on the homeland security front to try to prevent ISIL from radicalizing or inspiring others to carry out acts of violence in their name. We're working all across the international community to try to shut down the flow of foreign fighters. I know that Director Comey had some comments earlier today that indicated that the flow of foreign fighters from the United States to Iraq and Syria has slowed significantly. That obviously is a welcome development and is an indication both that our efforts are bearing fruit, but also that ISIL is having a tougher time recruiting people to their cause.\nSo all of this is progress. All of this enhances the safety and security of the American people. But there is no downplaying the awfulness of the situation in Syria right now.\nMichelle.\nQ: Earlier in the briefing you talked about the powerful case that you thought Secretary Clinton made last night. You also called it a persuasive case. That's a case that we've also heard the President and others in the administration make over the last couple of months. A lot of strong words used to describe what is believed to be the reason why Donald Trump is not qualified to be President. We've heard the President say that a lot of times. But the fact is the poll numbers between these two candidates have only gotten closer and have not moved in the other direction. So is that an indication to you that the case that is being made is either not working, or needs to be made in some different way? Because when you say -- you use words like \"powerful\" and \"persuasive.\" I mean, maybe that's in the words chosen, but that's not clearly in the effect that it's having on the electorate.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, the case that the President is making is one that is focused on turning people out on Election Day. And this is a case that we'll build through the month of October in support of the candidate that he believes so strongly in. So I think we'll all evaluate the effectiveness of the President's case on Election Day.\nQ: What do you think it says that there's arguments that are made, arguments that you feel are powerful are not changing people's minds, at least not as reflected in the polls?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, there are plenty of people out there who can comment on the polls and offer up their own analysis, so I'll let them do that. But the President is going to be focused on an argument that he believes is most important, and hopefully people will hear it and be convinced by it.\nQ: So when are we going to see him out on the trail much more?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think through October the President will be increasing his involvement in this race. And that doesn't just mean through travel. That also means that the President will be more engaged in -- or I guess I would say feature more prominently in some of the advertising efforts of Secretary Clinton and other Democrats across the country.\nBut the President has made clear that he wants to do as much as he can to support Secretary Clinton and her campaign, and that's what we'll do. But largely, our cues for how to do that will be taken from the campaign and Secretary Clinton's advisors who are formulating a strategy.\nQ: Yeah, he's used the phrase, you have to be running scared when you're looking at this election in particular and those numbers. So when he sees those numbers only getting closer -- and it remains to be seen, of course, what happens after this debate in the next couple of days -- but when he sees those numbers, does he feel like the message needs to change or that he needs to do something that, I don't know, gets people's attention more or makes his case better?\nMR. EARNEST: I think you're going to hear the President continue to warn against complacency. And the President's remarks to the Congressional Black Caucus 10 days or so ago I think is a good example of that kind of message. I also think you're going to hear the President deliver a message similar to the one that he delivered on Ryan Seacrest's radio program earlier today in which he made a case to the American people that it's important to get involved in our democracy and that our democracy benefits from that regardless of who you choose to support.\nNow, the President has obviously got his own very strong view about who he believes people should support, and he'll make his case accordingly. But he believes that our democracy is improved when more people are engaged. And he'll continue to make that case as well. The President will have ample opportunity to make that case, and I think the President feels good about the current trajectory of the race.\nJC.\nQ: Putting your political hat back on, Josh, reflecting a couple of years ago when you were very much involved in the Obama campaign in the early stages, and addressing those people who are not quite committed, including the millennials, do you think after last night's debate -- and if you watched it -- do you think the folks are more interested or less interested in watching the second debate?\nMR. EARNEST: I think it's hard to generalize. I think there are probably some people who had the opportunity to watch the debate, and as James alluded, that there are some other issues that they'd like to see be discussed. So maybe that means some more people will tune in. I think there are some other people who watched the first debate and learned everything they need to know about the two candidates and what they stand for. And hopefully they'll turn out to vote and choose to be engaged in our democratic process.\nKenneth.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. Back to last night. Did President Obama call Hillary Clinton before to give her a pep talk, or did he speak with her afterwards to say what he thought of her performance?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware that the President has spoken to Secretary Clinton in the last 24 hours or so. But they have the opportunity to speak frequently, and sometimes we tell you about it and sometimes we don't.\nQ: You mentioned the President is going to be, in October, he's really going to ratchet up being on the campaign trail or helping Hillary Clinton. So the question is, how aggressive will it be? One a week, two a week? I know there will be some behind-the-scenes things. But as far as jumping on Air Force One and going to the battleground states, will we see an aggressive approach from the President on that?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the President will be making a very forceful case. I think that he'll be looking to maximize the time that he is able to make available to support Secretary Clinton, and looking to make the most of those opportunities that he has.\nLook, I think in early October the President will be spending one or two days per week on the road in support of her campaign. And as the election gets closer, he may look for more opportunities. But I would caution against you evaluating the President's engagement solely based on how often the President travels outside of Washington, D.C. to make a case for her. There are a variety of other ways for the President to get engaged. And certainly we would expect that the case that the President had the opportunity to make in the context of radio interviews would be something that would benefit her campaign. I would anticipate that the President will appear in television and online ads in support of her campaign. So I think the President will be visible, but that doesn't always include headlining a rally.\nQ: And finally, after watching last night's debate, is there one top rebuttal from the Obama administration around the White House that you want to get out there that Donald Trump put out? For instance, on the DNC hack, he says, \"We don't know who did it. We have no clue who was behind it.\" So does the White House have any clue who's behind it, even if you don't want to say? Is there an actor you believe is behind the DNC hack?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kenneth, of all the rebuttals that's probably not the one I would choose. But since you raise it, you deserve an answer. What we have said about this particularly situation is that the FBI and other experts within the national security apparatus of the United States are investigating that particular situation.\nI know that there are some private sector experts who have released reports based on their examination of the evidence that implicates the Russians in that hack. Government experts are still looking at it. And a decision has not been made to go public at this point with saying who may be responsible for this particular incident. But because of the focus that the President has had on this issue, there are a number of tools available to respond to it. And those responses may not necessarily be something that we announce in advance. Those responses may not be something that we ever announce or acknowledge. But the United States maintains significant capabilities and is prepared to use them to ensure the safety and security of the American people in cyberspace.\nQ: So if that one is not at the top of your list, which one is?\nMR. EARNEST: I guess I walked right into that one, huh?\nQ: Yeah. Which one is at the top?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, I think what I would do is I would say it this way, which is that there was a rather stark difference in the approach that's being advocated by the two candidates, and I think it's hard to minimize the significance of those differences. The stakes in this election are really high. So it's not just that the differences are stark; the consequences for the different approaches that are being advocated by the two candidates are also stark. There are long-term consequences for this decision that the American people have to make.\nAnd I think that's why, just to go back to your first question, I think that's why the President will be so engaged in this election, because he understands that the stakes are rather high.\nAnd, look, if the polls indicate that the race may be close maybe that has the effect of getting more people engaged and more prompting more people to pay attention in the race and the potential outcome. And if there are more people that are open to the case that President Obama has to make about who they should choose in the presidential election, then we would certainly welcome that opportunity.\nToluse.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Continuing on the theme of rebuttals from the debate. Donald Trump talked about Janet Yellen for a bit during the debate yesterday. He basically implicated -- or indicated that she was involved in sort of I guess rigging the Fed on behalf of the President, being very political, and sort of managing the Fed in a political way. What's your response to that charge?\nMR. EARNEST: I will acknowledge I chuckled when he said that she was more political than Hillary Clinton. I'm not really even sure what that means. But I thought it was funny.\nThe charge, of course, is preposterous. It is baseless, and there's been no evidence to marshal to support it. The President I think time and time again, in words and in deeds, has demonstrated his commitment to protecting the independence of the Fed. That's a principle that benefits our economy. It's a principle that is the bedrock of our financial relationship with countries all around the world. So I guess that's the reason that I would wade in and respond to a situation that I guess I might otherwise not choose to engage.\nQ: In another moment in the debate, Donald Trump referred to the President as \"your President,\" when he was speaking to Hillary Clinton. Did the President or the White House notice that? Is there any response to that labeling?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know if there was any offense intended in that remark or not. But I'll leave it to the candidate to explain what he might have meant.\nQ: And just one more, on the Department of Justice announcing some sanctions on some Chinese individuals and companies for more or less not abiding by the North Korean sanctions. I'm wondering sort of what the White House statement is on that, and whether or not that should portend future actions, stepping up of regulating these sanctions and making sure that the Chinese abide by them.\nMR. EARNEST: Look, there are a couple of things at play here. The first is, with regard to any sort of criminal investigation that is being conducted by the Department of Justice, I'll defer to my colleagues there for discussion about why those charges were brought. They can describe what evidence they have access to and the prosecutorial decisions that they've made in the context of this case.\nWith regard to sanctions, I think this is an indication of the President's commitment to further isolate the North Korean regime and to apply pressure to those entities and individuals and organizations that try to support them. This is something that the President takes quite seriously. And we certainly value the kind of cooperative working relationship that we've enjoyed not just with our allies in the region, but with our partners in the region that don't work with us on every issue. But I think that is an indication of how unified the international community is about confronting North Korea and their repeated violations of U.N. Security Council resolutions.\nAndrew.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I wanted to go back to Syria. A number of times from the podium you've remarked on the kind of (inaudible ) good options with regard to the Syria civil war. I don't think anybody would disagree with that. But I wanted to go through a couple of suggestions and to get an idea of why the White House thinks they wouldn't work.\nMR. EARNEST: I should take out my pen.\nQ: Do we need clearance for --\nQ: Not from me. (Laughter.) Airdropping aid to the residents of Aleppo.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there has been a -- you'll recall that our discussions with the Russians have been predicated on two things recently. The first is a reduction in violence. And while that is a worthy goal in and of itself, it is also a means to an end. Currently, the violence and the fighting is so intense that it's not possible for humanitarian aid workers to safely access those communities and provide humanitarian relief that's badly needed. So the United States has been strongly supportive of a variety of ideas for expediting the flow of humanitarian assistance to these communities that are plagued by violence and where there are so many innocent people that are caught in the crossfire.\nUnfortunately, just last week we got a vivid illustration of how dangerous it can be to try to provide humanitarian assistance to the people in need in Syria, and there were humanitarian aid workers that were victims of a military strike inside of Syria. That's a strike for which we hold Russia responsible, because it was either a strike that was carried out by Russian military forces or by Syrian military forces that Russia has agreed to use their influence to limit.\nSo the United States is very interested in looking for creative ways that we can expedite the delivery of humanitarian assistance to communities in Syria that need it the most. And, in fact, that is the prominent goal of so many of our diplomatic efforts there right now.\nQ: The second suggestion is supplying the people of Aleppo with a means to defend themselves.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, with regard to this situation, there are obviously forces on the ground, inside of Syria, that benefit from the support of the United States and our coalition partners because they are focused on going after ISIL. And there are a variety of ways in which we've offered assistance to those opposition groups. And they have proved, in many cases, to be a pretty effective fighting force against ISIL forces on the ground. And there's more than 20 percent of the territory that ISIL previously controlled in Syria that's been taken back because of the efforts of these forces.\nThese forces have also succeeded in reducing, if not outright eliminating, access that ISIL has to the Turkey-Syria border. That's significant because we know that ISIL was using their access to that border to get access to cash and other supplies, and even foreign fighters. That's much more difficult for them now than it was before, in part because of the effectiveness of the fighting force on the ground. But what we have indicated is that our counter-ISIL strategy depends on our ability to support those forces on the ground that have proven a willingness and a capability to go after ISIL.\nWith regard to the challenge that's facing the civilians in Aleppo, it's significant. And when you consider the military might of the Syrian regime and their Russian backers, and their willingness to target civilians and civilian facilities like hospitals and the water supply, it's clear that the best outcome is for the violence to come to an end. And the concern that we have expressed about providing that kind of armed assistance that you're referring to is that that only further militarizes the situation that doesn't have a military solution.\nQ: And sanctioning Russians involved in supporting the regime, and prosecution of the siege of Aleppo and mid-level Syrian military officers who have been involved in the same.\nMR. EARNEST: Andrew, we have not taken the prospect of additional financial sanctions off the table. Financial sanctions have proven to be a useful tool in advancing our interests around the globe. So we certainly haven't taken those sanctions off the table. What we have taken a dim view of, however, are unilateral sanctions. We have found the strategy of implementing sanctions in close coordination with our partners to be a much more effective way for us to maximize the impact of financial sanctions. And that's an option I would not take off the table in this instance.\nQ: I'll leave it there.\nMR. EARNEST: Jane.\nQ: Thank you very much, Josh. At last night's debate, Donald Trump said that we cannot protect the country (inaudible) alliance of Donald Trump. This is so confused because there's tensions in the Korean Peninsula with the North Korean threat. Do you think the U.S. and South Korea has an alliance?\nMR. EARNEST: President Obama has stated many times how important the U.S.-South Korea alliance is. And President Obama had an opportunity to meet with President Park earlier this month in Laos to discuss the ongoing U.S. commitment to the safety and security of our allies in South Korea. The President's commitment to that alliance has not diminished in any way. And that's why the United States has discussed the deployment of a THAAD battery to South Korea to protect the South Korean people from the ballistic missile threat emanating from North Korea. And the United States continues to work closely with South Korea, our allies in Japan, and other countries around the region to counter the rhetoric and threats of the North Korean regime.\nQ: So will the United States continue to protect South Korea from North Korean threat?\nMR. EARNEST: The United States is as committed as we've ever been to the health and strength of the U.S.-South Korea alliance.\nLalit, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. Over the weekend, Indian Prime Minister Modi said that India is going to ratify the climate change agreement on October 2, with 60 countries and 48 percent of emissions countries would be ratifying it. Do you think this will be coming to force in the Morocco conference on November 7th? And will the President think this is mission accomplished on the climate change part?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Lalit, we have not put a firm deadline for ratification of the climate agreement, other than to say we expect the agreement to enter into force by the end of this calendar year. I don't know if it will be done by the first week in November. We, of course, welcome the actions from the Indian government. It is just another example of the courageous leadership that Prime Minister Modi has shown on this issue. And that's to his credit. He recognizes how important it is for India to be a leader in the international community on this issue. And he's making good on that priority, and he deserves a lot of credit for that. And I know that the President, when he met with Prime Minister Modi earlier this month in Laos, had an opportunity to thank him for his leadership on this issue.\nHowever, as important as the Paris climate agreement is, and how significant it is that this agreement is going into effect within a year's time, it's only a starting point. And the President is hopeful that the significance of this agreement is not that it solves the problem of carbon pollution once and for all, but rather it serves as a template to mobilize the international community to take coordinated, substantial steps to addressing this problem.\nAnd it sets up a mechanism whereby every five years countries consider the commitments that they can make to further fight carbon pollution. And the impact of this agreement is one that is likely to be seen only after it's been in place for a substantial period of time. And we've been able to see the progress the country, that the world, that the planet makes in confronting this challenge, and as the world continues to more effectively cooperate to confront this shared threat.\nQ: I have one more question. After the Uri terrorist attack, India has said -- Prime Minister Modi has said talks -- they cannot work together, and as such, he's taking several steps -- like one, India has pulled out from SAARC Summit in Islamabad next month. How do you see the situation there?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the United States has continued to encourage India and Pakistan to find a way to resolve their differences peacefully and through diplomacy. And we have condemned violence, particularly terrorist attacks. And we continue to be hopeful and encouraging of both sides to try to find a way to resolve their differences and to reduce their tensions through diplomacy and without resorting to more violence.\nThanks, everybody.\nEND 2:10 P.M.

Walberg, R-MI, and 69 cosponsors)\nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 6094, which would delay implementation of the Department of Labor's overtime rule until the middle of next year, endangering a critical step toward promoting higher pay and undermining efforts to allow workers to better balance their work and family obligations.\nSince its creation, the 40-hour workweek has served as a cornerstone of the middle class. Yet over the past several decades, overtime protections have eroded as a result of inflation and lobbyists' efforts to weaken them. Today, only seven percent of full-time salaried workers qualify for overtime based on their pay, down sharply from 62 percent in 1975. This means that more and more low- and middle-income workers are being forced to work extra hours without being paid for them. Despite strong income growth in the last year, most American families have been squeezed by stagnant earnings during this period, and the lack of overtime protections only has put them at a further disadvantage.\nThe Department issued its new overtime regulation in May and the new rule is set to go into effect on December 1, 2016. The final rule raises the salary threshold, from $23,660 to $47,476 a year, under which most salaried workers are guaranteed overtime. In doing so, it will extend overtime protections to 4.2 million additional Americans who are not currently eligible for overtime under Federal law, boosting workers' wages by $12 billion over the next decade. The rule also will automatically update the salary threshold every three years, to ensure that it does not erode again and to make it harder for employers to misclassify workers to avoid paying the overtime pay they have earned.\nThe final rule reflects input from hundreds of thousands of public comments and extensive stakeholder meetings with employers, business associations, small businesses, workers, advocates, nonprofit organizations, educational institutions, and state and local governments. The rule provides more than six months for employers to prepare for implementation, more time than was allowed when the rule was last updated with a comparable increase in the salary threshold. Additionally, many employers, including nonprofits, institutions of higher education, and small businesses, are already taking steps to come into compliance. This bill would be disruptive to their efforts and create new uncertainty for employers.\nWhile this bill seeks to delay implementation, the real goal is clear—delay and then deny overtime pay to workers. With a strong economy and labor market, now is a good time for employers to provide these essential protections for workers, who cannot afford to wait.\nIf the President were presented with H.R. 6094, he would veto the bill.", "timestamp": "2016-09-27", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 6094 - Regulatory Relief for Small Businesses, Schools, and Nonprofits Act"}

He engages broadly with the Cuban people and expresses the United States' strong support for universal values and human rights in Cuba. Jeff also has extensive experience working with the United Nations. During his most recent service at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations he served for three years as Ambassador, Alternate Representative for Special Political Affairs. Having an ambassador will make it easier to advocate for our interests, and will deepen our understanding even when we know that we will continue to have differences with the Cuban government.

The President believes that our ability to respond to and recover from disasters is predicated on building resilience to the wide range of natural disasters, technological hazards, and acts of terrorism that may impact our Nation. And each time we rebuild, we can do so in a way that makes our communities stronger and more resilience, to limit the impact the next disaster may inflict.\nThe impacts of climate change – including hotter temperatures, more extreme weather, sea level rise, and more severe drought – pose significant challenges for communities not prepared to adapt to these extreme conditions. At the beginning of the month, the President declared September as National Preparedness Month. In doing so, he called on community leaders across the country to develop capabilities to tackle vulnerabilities identified in the 2016 National Preparedness Report.\nThe Federal government is doing its part to address the vulnerabilities and areas for national improvement identified in the  2016 National Preparedness Report. Today, Federal agencies are announcing new actions to help build the capacity of state, local, tribal, territorial, private sector, and nonprofit stakeholders to recover from future disasters.\nNew Federal actions announced today include:\n•      Federal Emergency Management Agency and U.S. Economic Development Administration: Economic Recovery Training For Emergency Management and Economic Development Practitioners\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), in collaboration with the U.S. Economic Development Administration announces the award of $1,506,000 training funds. These funds will provide training for state, local, tribal, and territorial emergency managers and economic development professionals to proactively seek and undertake economic recovery and resilience initiatives. More information may be found here.\n•      Federal Emergency Management Agency with the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Small Business Administration: Leaders in Business Community Resilience\nFEMA, with the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Small Business Administration, announces the Leaders in Business Community Resilience initiative which provides new guidance for state-level engagement with the private sector. The initiative also creates a platform for businesses of all sizes to be recognized for building community resilience. In addition, this effort equips businesses to take action in preparing their staff, mitigating risk for facilities and systems, building resilience into their supply chains, and serving their community through pre-disaster planning. FEMA, SBA, and Commerce will convene joint events across the country over the next year to support local efforts to create preparedness partnerships between the private and public sectors. More information may be found here.\n•      U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development: Support Homeless Persons in Pre-Disaster Planning, Response, and Recovery\nThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announces release of a toolkit focused on the needs of homeless populations before, during, and after disasters. The toolkit will help communities build resilience and capacity to more effectively support homeless persons in pre-disaster planning, response, and long-term recovery. In addition, HUD will use the toolkit to enhance the Federal government's coordination of program requirements to better align and improve disaster response planning and implementation focused on the needs and challenges of homeless populations post-disaster. More information may be found here.\n•      National Institute of Standards and Technology with the Community Resilience Panel: Establish a \"Built Environment\" Resilience Gateway in the U.S. Climate Resilience Toolkit\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)-sponsored Community Resilience Standards Panel with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Forest Service announce the creation of the Built Environment gateway in the U.S. Climate Resilience Toolkit which is the first dedicated to community resilience measures for urban communities and infrastructure. Areas of focus include buildings and structures, disaster planning, energy, water and wastewater, social equity, planning and land use, transportation, communications, and other related topics. The Built Environment gateway may be found here.\n•      U.S. Department of Energy: Enhance Situational Awareness of Energy System Status\nThe U.S. Department of Energy announces a new initiative to enhance the real-time monitoring and predictive capabilities of the Environment for Analysis of Geo-Located Energy Information (EAGLE-I) system. By transitioning its operation to Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in Tennessee, EAGLE-I will take advantage of ORNL's world class capabilities and expertise in energy infrastructure assurance, geospatial data and analysis, and scalable high performance computing environments. In doing so, EAGLE-I will become the authoritative source supporting state, local, tribal, and territorial stakeholders to track the status of energy systems throughout the Nation. These enhancements will help target and efficiently mobilize public and private sector resources in support of whole community partners during post-incident recovery. More information may be found here.\n•      U.S. Department of Homeland Security: Establish a National Network of Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Resources\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security is announcing the establishment of a cadre of trained infrastructure recovery and resilience subject matter experts who can provide assistance to communities in disaster-impacted areas. These subject matter experts will assist with the rebuilding following the historic August flooding in Louisiana. When requested in future incidents, they will work in partnership with state, local, tribal, territorial; and private sector partners to enhance the resilience of area infrastructure by conducting post-incident security and resilience assessments, assisting with the prioritization of infrastructure reconstitution and redevelopment efforts, and identifying opportunities for future investments that can mitigate current and future threats. For more information, please contact IDR@hq.dhs.gov.\n•      Federal Emergency Management Agency: Community Recovery Resource Portal\nFEMA announces its launch of a Community Recovery Resource Portal to assist community leaders in finding and accessing post-disaster recovery resources. Embedded in the existing disasterassistance.gov platform, the Community Recovery Resource Portal highlights ways in which community leaders can help lead, plan, and find resources for their recovery efforts. This action also implements one of the recommendations from the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force Report in establishing a \"No Wrong Door\" approach for assisting community leaders in their recovery efforts. More information may be found here.\n•      Heritage Emergency National Task Force and the National Endowment for the Humanities: New Training Opportunities to Aid Cultural Institutions in Disaster Preparedness\nThe Heritage Emergency National Task Force and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) announce a new webinar series which will provide practical training and guidance to emergency managers and cultural stewards on how to strengthen disaster preparedness in the cultural community.

My friend Shimon was one of those people.\nShimon Peres once said that, \"I learned that public service is a privilege that must be based on moral foundations.\" Tonight Michelle and I join people across Israel, the United States, and around the world in honoring the extraordinary life of our dear friend Shimon Peres, a founding father of the State of Israel and a statesman whose commitment to Israel's security and pursuit of peace was rooted in his own unshakeable moral foundation and unflagging optimism.\nI will always be grateful that I was able to call Shimon my friend. I first visited him in Jerusalem when I was a Senator, and when I asked for his advice, he told me that while people often say that the future belongs to the young, it's the present that really belongs to the young. \"Leave the future to me,\" he said, \"I have time.\" And he was right. Whether it was during our conversations in the Oval Office, walking together through Yad Vashem, or when I presented him with America's highest civilian honor, the Medal of Freedom, Shimon always looked to the future. He was guided by a vision of the human dignity and progress that he knew people of good will could advance together. He brought young people from around the world together because he knew they could carry us closer to our ideals of justice and equality.\nShimon was the essence of Israel itself: the courage of Israel's fight for independence, the optimism he shared with his wife Sonya as they helped make the desert bloom, and the perseverance that led him to serve his nation in virtually every position in Government across the entire life of the State of Israel. As Americans, we are in his debt because, having worked with every U.S. President since John F. Kennedy, no one did more over so many years as Shimon Peres to build the alliance between our two countries, an unbreakable alliance that today is closer and stronger than it has ever been.\nPerhaps because he had seen Israel surmount overwhelming odds, Shimon never gave up on the possibility of peace between Israelis, Palestinians, and Israel's neighbors, not even after the heartbreak of the night in Tel Aviv that took Yitzhak Rabin. \"Dear friends,\" he told us during my visit to Israel 3 years ago, \"after everything I have seen in my life, I earned the right to believe that peace is attainable.\" Tonight I can think of no greater tribute to his life than to renew our commitment to the peace that we know is possible. Our thoughts are with his children Tzvia, Yoni, and Chemi, their families, and all who loved and admired Shimon Peres, of blessed memory.\nA light has gone out, but the hope he gave us will burn forever. Shimon Peres was a soldier for Israel, for the Jewish people, for justice, for peace, and for the belief that we can be true to our best selves, to the very end of our time on Earth, and in the legacy that we leave to others. For the gift of his friendship and the example of his leadership, todah rabah, Shimon.", "timestamp": "2016-09-27", "title": "Statement on the Death of Former President Shimon Peres of Israel"}

A son of the shtetl who rose to become one of the world's most beloved and respected statesmen, President Peres' life was the life of the state of Israel—vibrant, courageous, determined.\nOver the course of a political career that spanned more than six decades, a dozen cabinets, and ten American presidents, President Peres inspired generations with his profound commitment to his country.  He was dreamer and a doer, working to make the desert bloom and build the state of Israel brick by brick.  He was a warrior who helped secure Israel against its adversaries and a peacemaker who knew, as he liked to say, that there are no hopeless situations, only hopeless people—falling ill 23 years to the day that he joined President Clinton, Prime Minister Rabin, and Yasir Arafat for that historic handshake on the White House lawn.  He was also, as he would happily remind you, an excellent cow-milker and shepherd in his kibbutznik days.\nThe unbreakable alliance between the United States and Israel stands as an enduring tribute to President Peres' years of diplomacy and eloquent advocacy on Israel's behalf.  I'm proud to have called him a cherished friend, a wise and steadying presence during difficult times.\nAs the inventor of the eminently quotable \"Peres-ism,\" President Peres once observed that \"Optimists and pessimists die the same way.  They just live differently.

{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "note": "Speech as delivered.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119164", "text": "\"Thank you. Thank you all so much. It is great being here on the stage at UNH with my friend Bernie Sanders, one of the most passionate champions for equality and justice that I have ever seen and someone who I am looking forward to working with to get [cheers] the kind of agenda through our Congress that will begin to make our country stronger by providing the kind of support that working families and middle class families so richly deserve.\nBernie's campaign energized so many young people, some of you in this crowd. And there is no group of Americans who have more at stake in this election than young Americans because so much of what will happen will affect your lives, your jobs, the kind of country we are, the kind of future we want to build together.\nI'm proud of the primary campaign that Bernie and I ran. We ran a campaign about issues, not insults. And when it was over, we began to work together to try to figure out how we could take the issues we agreed on and come together knowing we are stronger together to come up with specific policies in education, in health and so much else. Thank you, Bernie. Thank you for your leadership, and thank you for your support in this campaign.\nNow, we're going to need some help in Washington. And I hope New Hampshire will send your now Governor Maggie Hassan to Washington as your senator. And I sure hope you will send Carol Shea Porter back to Washington.\nIsn't this one of the strangest elections you've ever seen? I – I really sometimes don't know what to make of it. Standing on that debate stage the other night, I was especially thinking about that. And, look, I have been very clear about what I want to do if I'm fortunate enough to be elected president. And Americans increasingly are zeroing in on the fact that we're not only electing a president, we're electing a commander-in-chief. We're looking to see who can protect our country and provide steady and strong leadership around the world.\nI was very honored today to earn the endorsement of John Warner, a retired Republican senator, World War II veteran, former – former secretary of the Navy who served under two Republican presidents. I served with him on the Senate Armed Services Committee. And I have the deepest respect for his patriotism. And it's a great honor. He's never endorsed a Democrat for president before. And I'm also very grateful that a number of Republicans and Independents here in New Hampshire have announced their support for this campaign. In fact, it is really an extraordinary honor that 150 Republicans here in New Hampshire are supporting this campaign because they understand how high the stakes are.\nThe next – the next 40 days will determine the next 40 years. So I'm going to close my campaign the way I started my public service and my career: fighting for kids and families. That's been the cause of my life. And it will be the mission of my presidency. And when you go to vote in November or if you vote early, it's not just my name on the ballot. Every issue you care about, think about it because, in effect, it's on the ballot, too. It's whether or not we continue to fight climate change or we give in to denial. This is a big deal. I never thought when I gave my acceptance speech to the Democratic National Convention that I would have to put in the following sentence, 'I believe in science.' Climate change is real. It's serious. And we have to be united and committed in addressing it. I never thought I'd hear someone running for president, my opponent, who says he wants to appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn marriage equality and turn the clock back on LGBT Americans, overturn a woman's right to make her own healthcare decisions and reverse that fundamental right and so much more.\nSo there's a lot at stake. And that's why some of the analysts are saying more Americans will vote in this election than ever before. We had more people watching that debate than any presidential debate before. And that's why we have to focus on what we want to do because I want to make a difference in your lives.\nAnd one of the biggest issues that I heard about throughout the campaign that I hear about from every corner of our country is how much an education costs. Bernie is absolutely right. I remember when I went to college, my dad, who was a small business man – he had saved up money, but I had to work. I had to work through college, work during the school year, work during summers, but that was okay. We were able to put it together. It wasn't so much that it endangered me or my family's financial future.\nAnd then I decided to go to law school, and my dad said, 'Well, I can't help you. That – we're done. We can't help you.' So I kept working. I got a small scholarship, but then I took out loans. And I paid those loans back. But I was lucky because I signed up for a program that gave me the opportunity to pay my loans back as a percentage of my in-come, not a fixed interest rate. That's why I could go to work for the Children's Defense Fund. I think I made $14,000 a year, as I recall. I could never have done that if I had had the kind of interest rates that so many young people now are facing.\nIt's absolutely wrong, and it has undermined the fundamental right to pursue your dreams, to have that education, to get those opportunities that you so rightly deserve.\nNow, New Hampshire has the highest proportion of students with debt in the country and the second-highest average debt per student. As a student I met here in New Hampshire said, going to college should be hard, but paying for college shouldn't be so hard that it prevents you from getting your education.\nIndeed, here in New Hampshire, we've got so many young people graduating with debt who aren't able to get started in their careers, aren't able to do the jobs like I could do, because they have to get a job that pays as much as possible to begin paying their debt down. So we should, and we will, make public colleges tuition-free for families earning less than $125,000 a year.\nAnd if you already have student debt, like so many students have here in New Hamp-shire, we will help you refinance it. It is absolutely outrageous that you cannot refinance student debt, and it is even worse that you're being charged interest rates that are so much higher than anything that anybody else is paying to buy a house, to buy a car, to borrow money for a business. I don't know how we got to where we are, but we are going to fix it. This is wrong. It's wrong for students, it's wrong for families, and it's wrong for our country.\nI also have met a lot of young people who want to start a business. They want to be entrepreneurs. It's the classic American story; start that business in the garage or the basement; get going. But they can't get credit because they have student debt. Nobody will help them out, no matter how good the idea is. So we're going to put a moratorium, so you don't have to pay your student debt back for a couple of years while you try to get your business started, and you get the chance to get the credit you need.\nWe are also – we are also going to provide loan forgiveness for people willing to go into public service or national service. And in Florida on Friday I'll give a speech about why that is so important.\nNow, when you add it up, our plan will help millions of people save thousands of dollars. Our campaign has built a tool to help you see how our college plan will actually help you, not in general, but really specifically you, the situation you're in. To check it out, go to hillaryclinton.com/calculator.\nNow, we have an example right here, and this presentation is what you can see when you go to our website. You can say, 'I have student debt,' you can say, 'I am planning for college,' you can put in what your annual household income is, how much you will save, and we are trying to make it as specific as possible because I don't want anybody to miss out on what this plan can do for you. You can choose whether you have student debt.\nI met a young woman just yesterday in North Carolina who said, 'Nobody really ex-plained to me and my family what I was getting into.' I hear that so much. You know, these financial aid forms, one is called FAFSA, it takes forever to fill out, and at the end of it you really don't know what it means? Well, we're going to be really explicit. You know, we do have technology in America. And we ought to use it more to help people understand what they're getting into and to provide alternatives so that they don't make the wrong decisions for themselves.\nSo, please, use this, you know? You will save $60,640 if you're in one of these categories. But there is a way to understand the choices you have to make for everybody. So I hope you will go to hillaryclinton.com/calculator.\nBut I have to say this: none of this will happen if you all don't turn out and vote. None of it. You know, I see all the signs saying, 'I will vote.' There is also a website. Please go to iwillvote.com to make sure you're registered. All the information is there. You put in your name, you put in your address, and through the miracle of technology you can find out if you're registered, or maybe because you moved you were purged from the records and you have to register again. New Hampshire makes it easy. You can have same-day registration.\nSo both Bernie and I are excited about what we can do together. I am really looking forward to working with him and other strong Democrats and Republicans who want to help solve problems again in America. Bringing people together is what I'm going to spend a lot of my time doing as your president. And if you've had a chance to see or meet my running mate, Tim Kaine, you know how hard he'll work to get things done and make it a high priority to produce results.\nSo we're going to move now to the panel, and I'm very pleased to have Mary Jo Brown moderating, along with Doug Martin, who you heard from earlier. I know they have collected up questions from the crowd. But I will end by saying that I'm excited about what we can do to make college affordable, and especially as Bernie rightly said, open the doors to families and young people who have been left out. We also want to make Pell grants once again available year-round, and we want to make sure that we have – specific help for certain groups of students.\nI'll end with this story. I taught at the University of Arkansas Law School some years ago, and I met a lot of students, not only in the law school but students on campus. I'd go and eat with them and go to events with them, and I met a lot of students who scraped together the tuition money, but then something happened. You know, maybe they were already parents and their childcare fell apart. Maybe they had to drive to and from school; they lived out in the country and their old car finally broke down and there was no public transportation. Or maybe they had a health emergency. And they would come and they would say to me, 'What can I do? Where can I get the $300 to fix the car? Where can I find childcare? How can I pay the doctor's bills?'\nAnd I realized that we've got to take care of tuition, making sure that you can go and be able to start and finish school. We've got to make sure costs and expenses, Pell grants and other ways of helping. But we also have to fill the gaps that exist for a lot of students. So I helped to start something called the Arkansas Single-Parent Scholarship Fund, because the people who had the most unexpected expenses were young parents, mostly, but not always, single moms, young, divorced, pretty much on their own, trying to improve their lives and prospects.\nAnd we started a fund to help fill those gaps, and, you know, we did it over so many years now, about 35 years, and we've helped thousands of people, so they didn't have to drop out. They didn't have to cut back. That's what I want for our country again, where we're helping each other, where we're reaching out and giving everybody a chance, and, yes, sometimes a second or third chance, to make the most of their lives, to pursue their dreams. I think the American dream is big enough for everybody, and education is absolutely essential to it.\nSo please make sure you come out and vote in this election. Thank you, all.\"", "timestamp": "2016-09-28", "title": "Remarks at the University of New Hampshire in Durham"}

I always look forward to coming back to Iowa, a state where I have so many friends – including your incredible governor, Terry Branstad.\nWe are doing so well in Iowa, a recent Reuters poll had us up by 10 points.\nOn November 8, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.\nIt's going to be a victory for YOU, the American people.\nWe are going to take on the special interests, the lobbyists, and the corrupt corporate media that have rigged the system against everyday Americans.\nWe are going to create a new government that serves you, your family, and your country.\nLower taxes, less regulation, more affordable childcare, fair trade deals, secure borders, thriving family farms, and millions and millions of new jobs.\nWe are going to end the Clinton Corruption and restore dignity and honesty to government service.\nHillary Clinton is an insider fighting only for insiders.\nI am an outsider fighting for you.\nEverything you need to know about Hillary Clinton can be understood with this simple phrase: Follow The Money.\nIn her campaign for President, Hillary Clinton has received $100 million dollars in contributions from Wall Street and the hedge funds.\nShe received $4.1 million in speaking fees from financial firms.\nThe same groups paying Bill and Hillary for their speeches were lobbying the federal government.\nTwenty-two groups paying Bill Clinton for speeches lobbied the State Department while Hillary was Secretary of State.\nAnd don't forget the Clinton contributors were appointed to advisory boards by Secretary Clinton – or all the favors and access granted to those who wrote checks. She even gave up 20% of American Uranium to Russia.\nShe disgraced the office of Secretary of State by putting it up for sale - and if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too.\nWe can't let that happen. That's why you have to go out and vote on November 8th, and early voting in Iowa starts tomorrow.\nShe deleted and bleached 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena. 13 phones missing, several destroyed with a hammer. Her staffers taking the fifth amendment, and her ringleaders getting immunity deals. Foreign enemies with easy access to hack her server. Lies to Congress, under oath, about turning over her work-related emails.\nThe Clintons have perfected the politics of profit.\nThe large corporations who support terrible trade deals that offshore jobs – they are donating to Hillary Clinton.\nThe Wall Street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class – they are donating to Hillary Clinton.\nThe wealthy donors who want to shut down American energy – they are donating to Hillary Clinton.\nThe special interests who want open borders are donating to Hillary Clinton. That's why Hillary Clinton is pushing for a 550% increase in Syrian refugees.\nShe and her financial backers will say anything, do anything, lie about anything to keep their grip on power – to keep their control over this country.\nThe American people have had it with corrupt Clinton ways. They are tired of the lies, they are tired of the trivial politics, they are tired of being talked down to, looked down upon, and treated like second class citizens.\nHow many more Clinton scandals can this country take - one after another after another? They are the sordid past. We are the bright future.\nWhile our campaign outlines big changes and bold solutions to make your life better, the Clinton campaign focuses only on small and petty distractions.\nNever in American history have so many serious challenges been met with so unserious a campaign as the campaign of Hillary Clinton.\nThis will be the year the American people say: Enough is enough.\nIt's time for real change – a new foreign policy, a new economic policy, a new immigration policy, a new trade policy.\nHillary Clinton has been a disaster for so many communities, but especially for African-American communities. I don't think African-Americans are going to come out and vote for Clinton – they are too smart, and they know they are being used. They also know that she'll do nothing for them once the election is over – she never does, and that will never change. Many of them will never forget her calling young African-American men \"super-predators.\"\nSame thing goes for Hispanic voters – they are tired of being used by people like Hillary Clinton, that have no intention of doing anything for them once the election is over.\nHillary Clinton is a vessel for the special interests trying to strip this country of its wealth, its jobs, and its status as a sovereign nation. She is a globalist who has made a career taking jobs from our country and giving them to other countries.\nI am not running to be President of the World. I am running to be President of the United States of America.\nFrom now on, it's going to be America First.\nHave you ever wondered why it is that all things that the American people want never seem to happen?\nWhy can't we have the schools we want, and the borders we want, and the security we want? Why can't we have policies that support small business, or family farms, or the miners and the steelworkers?\nThe answer is simple. Because the financial interests who control our politics and our media don't want these changes to happen.\nThese special interests control Hillary Clinton. She is their chosen representative. You can disregard everything she says and just remember this phrase: Follow The Money. She's there for only one reason, to protect her donors.\nLook at her career. She's been there for 30 years, and has never done anything for you and your family. She's failed at everything. She failed in Iraq, in Libya, in Syria, in Iran, in Egypt. She failed on Russia, on China, on North Korea.\nShe failed upstate New York.\nShe failed the inner cities.\nShe's failed women and children. I've created thousands of jobs for women in this country, of incredible talent. Hillary Clinton has been in Washington for 30 years and now 70 million American women and children are in poverty or on the brink of poverty.\nAnd she has been a disaster on our borders.\nI'd like to invite on up here Michelle Root, the mother of Sarah Root, who was killed by an illegal immigrant released into the country under the Obama catch-and-release policies championed by Hillary Clinton.\nHillary Clinton supports Sanctuary Cities. Where was the Sanctuary for Sarah?\nThe only people Hillary Clinton has ever delivered for are her donors. Just Follow The Money.\nHer single greatest achievement may be getting away with her massive e-mail scandal and criminal cover-up.\nOur campaign is taking on big business, big media and big donors – we're taking them on for YOU. So you can have the future you want.\nThat includes keeping your family safe.\nNew FBI statistics shows that homicide rose 15% last year in America's large cities, and that it's the largest single-year increase in 45 years.\nMore than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January.\n60% of murder victims under the age of 22 in this country are African-American.\n45% of African-American children under the age of 6 are living in poverty.\nI will never back down from fighting to save American lives.\nI will never back down from fighting to create safety and wealth for our inner cities.\nMy economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.\nWe will cut your taxes, reduce regulations – including on our farmers – negotiate great trade deals, unleash American energy and we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.\nWe are also going to end common core and offer school choice to every disadvantaged child – including every poor Hispanic and African-American child in America.\nThe people getting rich off the rigged system are the people throwing their money at Hillary Clinton. Remember: Follow the Money.\nOur campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives.\nThey're all part of the same political establishment. They go to the same restaurants, they attend the same conferences, they have the same friends and connections. And they nod along when Hillary Clinton slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable.\nI call you hardworking American Patriots and together we are going to save this country.\nGovernment will start working again. Fixing things is what I do. Just look at my projects in New York, and around the world, where I revitalized neighborhoods and lifted up skylines.\nAn article in the New York Post was published recently called \"How Donald Trump helped save New York City.\"\nThe article said, quote: \"Trump waded into a landscape of empty Fifth Avenue storefronts, the dust-bowl mugging ground that was Central Park and a Wall Street area seemingly on its last legs as companies moved out… Trump — almost by force of will — rode to the rescue. Expressing rare faith in the future, he was instrumental in kick-starting the regeneration of neighborhoods and landmarks almost given up for dead.\"\nThat's what I want to do for our country – I want to go into the neglected neighborhoods, the failing schools, the forgotten stretches of this nation, and unlock their potential for all of our people.\nTogether, we can accomplish anything we want.\nBut that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th – and it means you need to start voting early. Early voting is so important.\nYou have to knock on doors. You have to pick up that phone. You have to campaign on the streets. Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country. To beat the system, you have to lift your voice, pound the pavement, and get out the vote. Visit our website to find out how you can help.\nYou have six weeks until the election. You have six weeks to make every dream you ever dreamed for your country come true.\nYou have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this nation.\nThe arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.\nThis November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back – Bigger and Better and Stronger than Ever Before.\nHere is just some of what will happen starting in January of 2017:\nI am going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace Obamacare; unleash American energy; end illegal immigration; keep Radical Islamic terrorists out of our country; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\nWe will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.\nAmerican cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.\nAmerican steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.\nAmerican hands will rebuild this nation – and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.\nWe will put new American steel into the spine of this country.\nI will fight for every neglected part of this nation – and I will fight to bring us all together as Americans.\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\nIt is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.\nOnce more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.\nWe Will Make America Wealthy Again.\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\nThank you, and God Bless!", "timestamp": "2016-09-28", "title": "Remarks at a Rally at the Mid-America Center in Council Bluffs, Iowa"}

There is another shooting in Chicago every 2 hours. 45% of African-American children under the age of six are living in poverty.\nThe inner cities have been left behind.\nCrime is through the roof, public education is a disaster, there are no jobs, it's dangerous to walk down the street with your child. To the African-American community, I say: what do you have to lose? Vote for Donald Trump, I will fix it.\nI will fight for you harder than anyone has ever fought for you before.\nEverything you need to know about Hillary Clinton can be understood with this simple phrase: Follow The Money.\nThe large corporations who support terrible trade deals that offshore jobs – they are donating to Hillary Clinton.\nFollow The Money.\nThe Wall Street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class – they are donating to Hillary Clinton.\nFollow The Money.\nThe wealthy donors who want to shut down American energy – they are donating to Hillary Clinton.\nFollow The Money.\nThe special interests who want open borders, for cheap labor, are donating to Hillary Clinton.\nFollow The Money.\nShe and her financial backers will say anything, do anything, lie about anything to keep their grip on power – to keep their control over this country.\nIn her campaign for President, Hillary Clinton has received $100 million dollars in contributions from Wall Street and the hedge funds.\nShe received $4.1 million in speaking fees from financial firms.\nShe and Bill received a total of $150 million in speaking fees from special interests since Bill left office. It's all part of the rigged system being run at your expense.\nThe same groups paying Bill and Hillary for their speeches were lobbying the federal government.\nTwenty-two groups paying Bill Clinton for speeches lobbied the State Department while Hillary was Secretary of State.\nAnd don't forget the Clinton contributors were appointed to advisory boards by Secretary Clinton – or all the favors and access granted to those who provided funds. She even gave up 20% of America's uranium supply to Russia.\nShe put the office of Secretary of State up for sale – and if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too.\nShe deleted and bleached 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena. 13 phones missing, several destroyed with a hammer. Her staffers taking the fifth amendment, and her ringleaders getting immunity deals. Foreign enemies with easy access to hack her server. Lies to Congress, under oath, about turning over her work-related emails.\nThe American people have had it with years, decades, of the Clintons' scandals and corruption.\nThis will be the year the American people said: Enough is enough.\nHillary Clinton is a vessel for the special interests trying to strip this country of its wealth, its jobs, and its status as a sovereign nation. She is a globalist who has made a career taking jobs from our country and giving them to other countries.\nI am not running to be President of the World. I am running to be President of the United States of America.\nFrom now on, it's going to be America First.\nThese special interests control Hillary Clinton. She is their chosen representative. You can disregard everything she says and just remember this phrase: Follow The Money. She's there for only one reason, to protect her donors and collect their money.\nLook at her career. She's been there for 30 years, and has never done anything for you and your family. She's failed at everything. She failed in Iraq, in Libya, in Syria, in Iran, in Egypt. She failed on ISIS – in fact, she unleashed ISIS onto the world.\nShe failed upstate New York – promising 200,000 jobs, but instead the jobs left. All she did was name a post office and a highway.\nShe failed the inner cities.\nShe's failed women and children.\nThe only people Hillary Clinton has ever delivered for are her donors.\nOur campaign is taking on big business, big media and big donors – we're taking them on for YOU. So you can have the future you want.\nI'm not owned or controlled by anyone – my loyalty is to you, and no one else. I WILL FIGHT FOR YOU.\nMy economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.\nWe will cut your taxes, reduce regulations, negotiate great trade deals, unleash American energy and we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.\nWe are also going to end common core and offer school choice to every disadvantaged child – including every poor Hispanic and African-American child in America. We will put every American kid on the ladder of American success: a great education, and a great job.\nThe people getting rich off the rigged system are the people throwing their money at Hillary Clinton.\nFollow the Money.\nOur campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives.\nThey're all part of the same rigged political establishment. They go to the same restaurants, they attend the same conferences, they have the same friends and connections. And they are all in for a big day of reckoning on November 8th.\nGovernment will start working for you again. Fixing things is what I do. Just look at my projects in New York, and around the world, where I revitalized neighborhoods and lifted up skylines.\nThat's what I want to do for our country – I want to go into every neighborhood and unlock their potential for all of our people.\nTogether, we can accomplish anything we want.\nBut that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th – and it means you need to start voting early. Early voting is already underway.\nYou have to knock on doors. You have to pick up that phone. You have to campaign on the streets. Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country. To beat the system, you have to lift your voice, pound the pavement, and get out the vote. Visit our website to find out how you can help.\nYou have six weeks until the election. You have six weeks to make every dream you ever dreamed for your country come true.\nYou have one last magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this nation.\nDon't let it slip away. Don't let this chance go. Stand up and be heard – for your family, for your city, for your country.\nThe arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.\nThis November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back – Bigger and Better and Stronger than Ever Before.\nHere is just some of what will happen starting in January of 2017:\nI am going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace Obamacare; unleash American energy; end illegal immigration; keep Radical Islamic terrorists out of our country; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\nWe will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.\nAmerican cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.\nAmerican steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.\nAmerican hands will rebuild this nation – and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.\nWe will put new American steel into the spine of this country.\nI will fight for every neglected part of this nation – and I will fight to bring us all together as Americans.\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\nIt is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.\nOnce more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.\nWe Will Make America Wealthy Again.\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\nThank you, and God Bless!", "timestamp": "2016-09-28", "title": "Remarks at a Rally at Waukesha County Expo Center in Waukesha, Wisconsin"}

Jr, one of America's most influential theologians and civil rights leaders, endorsed Hillary Clinton for President calling her a leader with, \"… wisdom, sound judgement, spiritual strength and moral courage.\"\nRev. Dr. Moss Jr. served as the Pastor of Olivet Institutional Baptist Church in Cleveland, Ohio before retiring after 33 years of service. He was also the co-pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in Atlanta, Georgia.\nWhy Secretary Hillary Clinton Should Be Our Next President\nBy The Reverend Dr. Otis Moss. Jr.\nMrs. Hillary Clinton is our best hope for moving the U.S. Supreme Court out of the hands of right wing, anti-civil rights, anti-voting rights, anti-human rights judges. The next president will shape the U.S. Supreme Court for perhaps the next 50 years! By that time, the millennials will be nearing (80) years old. Their children and grandchildren will be the living with the results of the 2016 election. The next president will nominate three or four U.S. Supreme Court justices plus score of federal district and appeals court judges.\nWe need Hillary Clinton to be our next president because she is qualified. She is prepared. She is dedicated. She is an activist in the struggles of the common life for the common good and has the record to prove it. She did not wait 70 years to \"think\" about civil rights and human rights. She is committed activist nationally and globally. She is the epitome of excellence.\nLet me repeat, Hillary Clinton will save the U.S. Supreme Court from political arsonists, obstructionists and destroyers of the civil rights, human rights and voting rights. All the right wing extremists know this. This is why they are endorsing and supporting Trump – including some who tend to despise him. Mrs. Clinton will fight for voting rights protection, health care for all and education for all without crippling debts.\nHillary Clinton will give extraordinary national and global leadership. Leadership anchored in reason, wisdom, sound judgement, spiritual strength and moral courage.\nShe has been and remains active in her faith commitment from her youth. She has embraced The Holy Scriptures from her youth and knows the names of the books of her Bible and the unsearchable riches contained therein. She knows the songs and hymns and music of her faith and does not scorn and demean other faith traditions. She believes in the total Constitution - not just one or two amendments such as states' rights and gun rights.\nShe does not bully her way through life. She has the courage of kindness, the endurance of long-suffering and the joys of Amazing Grace.\nShe loves children of all races, colors and ethnicities, rich and poor, rural, urban and suburban, healthy and ill, victorious and vulnerable, immigrant and Native American and those whose ancestors came in chains. This includes the well housed and the homeless. She does not seek votes from one group by hating and insulting other groups.\nMrs. Clinton deserves and needs our support and votes. If her opponent should win, we all lose; children, youth and adults. We can all win with Hillary Clinton.", "timestamp": "2016-09-28", "title": "Civil Rights Leader Rev.

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119575", "text": "Aboard Air Force One\nEn Route Fort Lee, Virginia\n1:12 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Welcome aboard Air Force One. I hope you've taken your Dramamine. (Laughter.) And I say that not because I'm prepared to spin you, but because it's going to be a bumpy flight. But I don't have anything at the top, so we can go straight to your questions.\nQ: Will the President be attending the funeral in Israel on Friday?\nMR. EARNEST: Obviously, the President was saddened to learn of the passing of Shimon Peres. President Peres is a giant. He is somebody who dedicated his life to advocating for peace and championing the cause of the people of Israel. The President would very much like to attend his funeral, and his staff back at the White House is working diligently to try to make the logistics work so that he can do that. And as soon as we have a plan in place, we'll let all of you know.\nQ: Josh, the Saudi bill -- the Senate override of the Saudi bill came back. It's the most overwhelming override vote of a presidential veto since 1983. I'm wondering both what your reaction is to that, but what the margin says about either the President's effectiveness at this point in his term or the effectiveness of your argument on this issue.\nMR. EARNEST: I would venture to say that this the single-most embarrassing thing that the United States Senate has done possibly since 1983.\nYou had at least one prominent Republican senator quoted today saying that the Senate -- the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee were not quite sure what the bill actually did. And to have members of the United States Senate only recently informed of the negative impact of this bill on our servicemembers and our diplomats is, in itself, embarrassing. For those senators then to move forward in overriding the President's veto that would prevent those negative consequences is an abdication of their basic responsibilities as elected representatives of the American people.\nSo, ultimately, these senators are going to have to answer their own conscience and their constituents as they account for their actions today. You've got to give some credit to Harry Reid. He showed some courage. The same can't be said for the other 96 members of the Senate who voted today.\nQ: What's the White House's understanding of how soon the 9/11 families would be able to sue the government of Saudi Arabia once the override is -- goes through the House?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know. I can't speak to any steps that individual plaintiffs may take if and when this bill becomes law.\nQ: Josh, what can you tell us about troop numbers for Iraq? How was that decision made? And what will the number be now?\nMR. EARNEST: I would anticipate that we'll have a more formal announcement on this today that includes some more specifics about the troop levels. But the President has approved a request from the Department of Defense to increase the number of U.S. military personnel that will be deployed to Iraq by about 600. These are military forces that will be deployed to intensify the strategy that is in place to support Iraqi Security Forces as they prepare for an offensive against ISIL's -- against Mosul.\nAnd we have previously announced, in the context of previous troop announcements, that the United States military has an important role to play with our coalition partners in both helping to organize the logistics of an effort to retake that city, but also to offer advice and assistance to Iraqi forces on the ground that will be leading that fight. The 600 or so U.S. military personnel that will be added to the U.S. military presence in Iraq will be engaged in those same kinds of activities.\nQ: How does the President feel about increasing levels of military personnel in Iraq when he campaigned at the end of his term, when at the beginning of his term he campaigned against -- for drawing down the number of people in Iraq?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President made good on his promise to responsibly reduce significantly the U.S. military footprint in Iraq. I looked this up just yesterday -- when President Obama took office in 2009, there were 144,000 U.S. military servicemembers in Iraq. The number we're talking about now is around 5,000 or 6,000 U.S. military personnel in Iraq. They also -- and it's not just that the number is so much smaller; the mission is markedly different.\nWhen President Obama took office, U.S. servicemembers in Iraq were responsible for taking the fight to the enemy. Current servicemembers are now in a position where they are offering training and advice and assistance to Iraqi Security Forces that are leading the fight against ISIL.\nThere are some Special Operations Forces that do have discreet missions that in some situations have led to them engaging the enemy directly. But it's the Iraqi Security Forces that are on the front lines by and large. They are the ones who are responsible for taking the fight to ISIL. And the President believes that that has important consequences for the safety and security of our men and women in uniform. It also has important consequences for the long-term success of our efforts to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\nLet me just -- it's important for us to remember that I'm not going to be in a position of downplaying the significant risk that our men and women in uniform are assuming to protect our national security.\nOur men and women in uniform, while they have a different mission than the one that was given to them by President George W. Bush, still are putting themselves in harm's way. They're going to a dangerous part of the world. They're undertaking dangerous missions to protect the American people. And we owe them a deep debt of gratitude. And I would anticipate that the Commander-in-Chief will have the opportunity to talk about that with some of the servicemembers at Fort Lee later today.\nQ: Can I ask, in terms of the timing of the Mosul operation, does this signal that it's likely to start relatively soon? And will the additional troops allow American forces to move a little bit closer to the front lines in terms of their advisory role as Iraqi forces move on Mosul?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware that this is going to tangibly change the operational responsibilities that our men and women in uniform will have on the ground in Iraq. Their mission is to offer their advice and support and assistance to Iraqi Security Forces that are leading this effort. This will just be more U.S. servicemembers who are doing that.\nAs for timing, we have said all along that because it's Iraqi Security Forces under the command and control of the Iraqi central government who will be leading this fight, the decision about timing will be made by the Iraqi central government. They'll be closely coordinating with U.S. military advisors, but ultimately, that decision will be made by the Iraqi central government.\nI wouldn't speculate at this point about when exactly that will take place, but obviously we've been preparing for some time now to put Iraqi Security Forces in a position where they can undertake that mission. So we've made a lot of important progress, but I don't have any update in terms of timing to share at this point.\nQ: What is the President's view of the Gulf members of the anti-ISIS coalition potentially selling shoulder-fired missiles to moderate rebels in Syria?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't -- I haven't seen those reports, Kevin, so I don't know that we've taken a specific position on this. But we can look into that and get back to you.\nQ: CR -- whether the deal that seems to be worked out in the House last night to put the Flint money into the water bill kind of satisfies your concerns and if you expect at this -- well, if you support kind of that compromise. And if you expect at this point a CR to pass by the end of the week?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we certainly are hopeful that members of Congress will fulfill their responsibility to pass a budget and ensure that the government doesn't have to shut down at the end of the week. The President has been deeply concerned about how Republicans in Congress have failed to act promptly to provide resources to the people of Flint that have been dealing with some rather significant problems to their water supply. And the President urged Congress to consider the need to provide those funds in the context of these budget negotiations.\nObviously, in the last 36 hours or so, we've seen both Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan offer their own personal commitment to acting to provide those funds before the end of the year. That's later than we would have preferred but we certainly welcome that personal commitment from the two Republican leaders in the House and the Senate. That was a commitment that had been missing, and so we obviously welcome that change in position.\nLook, I think you also at this point have to give some credit to the Democratic members of the House and Senate who represent the people of Michigan. They have been dogged in their determination to see Congress appropriate these funds. The President has had their back all along, and the President was pleased to see this new commitment from Republicans looking out for those people in Flint that have had to suffer the consequences of the problems with the water supply there.\nQ: But no kind of updated odds on whether you think the government shutdown is likely? Or if you're doing anything to prepare -- kind of pumping the brakes on preparations for --\nMR. EARNEST: No, I'm not aware of any changes to our preparations, but obviously the commitment from Leader McConnell is a good development and hopefully they'll get that done this week.\nQ: One last thing, Secretary Kerry said today that they might suspend the agreement over recent Russian actions in Aleppo -- the Syrian agreement. At this point, I guess are things getting even worse somehow and at what point does the U.S. just walk away from this entire enterprise and say, they're not being serious here?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think there have been serious doubts that have been raised about Russia's credibility, and Secretary Kerry's statement today indicated that it's difficult to engage diplomatically with the Russians when they're not living up the commitments that they have made in the context of previous diplomatic discussions. That's a rather obvious observation, but when you see the actions that they have undertaken or supported over the last couple of weeks, it raises serious doubts about whether Russia has a strategy that serves their national interest.\nRight now, they appear to be pursuing a set of tactics that worsens the situation in Syria, that deepens the humanitarian tragedy that's taking place in Syria, but also that increases the risk that Russia is exposed to. Russia is deepening their involvement in a sectarian conflict. Deepening their involvement in that quagmire is not going to be in the interests of their national security.\nAnd our hope was that, through diplomacy, we would be able to help Russia chart a path out of that quandary and in the direction of working effectively with the United States and our coalition partners to confront challenges in a way that would benefit the broader international community. But we haven't seen that kind of cooperation from the Russians, and it's taken a significant toll on their international credibility.\nThank you, guys.\nEND 1:25 P.M.

Cochran, R-MS)\nThe Administration supports passage of Senate Amendment to H.R. 5325, making: 1) continuing appropriations for fiscal year (FY) 2017; 2) appropriations for military construction, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and related agencies for the FY ending September 30, 2017; 3) additional resources available to combat the Zika virus; and 4) for other purposes.\nBy providing a short-term funding bridge, the bill would allow critical Government functions to operate without interruption. To minimize the negative impacts of a short-term funding measure on Federal agencies, the Congress should act quickly to enact full-year appropriations legislation for the remainder of FY 2017. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to support investments equally balanced between defense and non-defense spending that will create jobs, support middle-class families, contribute to long-term growth, and safeguard national security.\nThe Administration is disappointed the legislation continues a provision that would bar the Securities and Exchange Commission from taking action to increase transparency in public companies' political spending. The Administration strongly objects to the inclusion of problematic provisions that are beyond the scope of funding legislation.\nThe Administration is also disappointed that—despite overwhelming bipartisan, bicameral support—the Congress failed to ensure that the Export-Import Bank is able to fully assist American businesses and workers by restoring a board quorum to the Bank.\nThe Administration appreciates that the Congress is finally taking bipartisan action to address the Zika virus. The funding provided in the bill supports the Administration's efforts to reduce the risk of the Zika virus, particularly in pregnant women, by better controlling the mosquitoes that spread the Zika virus, develop new tools, including vaccines and better diagnostics to protect the Nation from the Zika virus, and to conduct crucial research projects needed to better understand the impacts of the Zika virus on infants and children. The Administration appreciates that the bill is free of provisions that would inhibit the Administration's ability to target resources to best protect the American people from the Zika virus. However, the Administration continues to believe that funding to fight the Zika virus should be treated as an emergency, the same as past public health emergencies, and is disappointed that the funding is partially offset.\nThe Administration is pleased that there appears to be a path forward to provide targeted funding to support people in communities impacted by natural disasters and catastrophic events, including in Louisiana, Flint, Michigan, and other areas. The Administration welcomes the bill's investments in communities ravaged by natural disasters, but notes that the funding provided is insufficient to fully address needed recovery efforts in these and other communities. Upon its return in November, the Administration urges the Congress to take immediate action to provide funding, whether in an appropriations bill or another vehicle, that supports those who have been most impacted by natural disasters and other catastrophic events.\nIn addition, the Administration welcomes the bill's investments in military infrastructure, housing, and services for men and women in our Armed Forces and their families. The Administration also appreciates the Congress' commitment to fund the benefits and services our veterans have earned.", "timestamp": "2016-09-28", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: Senate Amendment to H.R. 5325 - Continuing Appropriations and Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017 and Zika Response and Preparedness Act, 2016"}

His loss will be felt not only in Israel but all over the world—in every heart he touched, including mine.\nIt was my great privilege over the past 40 years to benefit from his friendship and his counsel. And each time I met with him, I was struck anew by his incredible compassion, his boundless energy, and his ceaseless curiosity. Even at 93, Shimon was still looking for the next big idea—the next dream to bring to life.\nHe was part of that exceptional generation of founders—the men and women who recognized the necessity for a Jewish State of Israel and then willed it into existence, despite overwhelming odds.\nThere was never any inevitability to the success of Israel. Only the iron-clad determination of those who made it so. Ben-Gurion. Meir. Begin. Rabin.

There is some excitement up in here, huh? (Applause.) I'm excited too! Oh, my goodness. Well, let's get started, because we're going to talk about some things. (Laughter.)\nBut first of all, I am thrilled to be here today to support the next President and Vice President of the United States, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine! (Applause.) Yes! But I'm going to start with a few thank-yous.\nFirst of all, I want to than Ludmille. I mean, are all you students like her? She is amazing, and I know you all are too. Let's give her a round of applause. Yes! (Applause.)\nI also want to recognize your U.S. State -- U.S. Senate candidate, Katie McGinty. Katie is here. (Applause.) Your U.S. House of Representatives candidate, Dwight Evans. (Applause.) Your candidate for Attorney General, Josh Shapiro. (Applause.) Your State Senator, Art Haywood. (Applause.) And City Councilwoman, Cindy Bass. (Applause.) I know you all heard from them earlier today, so let's thank them for being here and let's wish them luck on the future. We're going to get a lot of things done.\nBut most of all, I want to thank all of you here at LaSalle University. (Applause.) Yeah! (Applause.) Well, I have heard some great things about this school and about the students and staff, so I am so proud and honored to be here.\nNow, it's hard to believe -- (applause) -- hey! (Applause.) I see you all over there. I love you all too. But we've got work to do here today. Because it is almost one month to Election Day, and I cannot believe it. And it's about time for my family to end our time in the White House.\nAUDIENCE: No!\nMRS. OBAMA: It's all right. It's all right. Two terms -- it's a reason. It's a good thing, it's a good thing. But I have to tell you, even though we've had a great -- this is a bittersweet time for me. I mean, because we're engaged in a time of great transition -- for me, for Barack, for Malia and Sasha, even Bo and Sunny. (Laughter.) I mean, what are they going to do when we leave? My husband has got to find a new job. I have to find a new job. (Laughter.) We've got to move to a new home, we're going to need to pack. We've got to pack up the old house, get it cleaned up so we can get our security deposit back. (Laughter.)\nBut of course, this isn't just a time of transition for my family, but for our entire country, as we decide who our next President will be. And transitions like these can be difficult. They can involve a lot of uncertainty. We saw that back in 2008 when Barack was first elected.\nI don't know if you all remember, especially that little one there -- you weren't even born -- (laughter) -- but back then, people had all kinds of questions about what kind of President Barack would be. Things like: Does he really understand us? Will he protect us?\nAnd then, of course, there are those who questioned –- and continued to question for the past eight years –- whether my husband was even born in this country -- and let me say, hurtful, deceitful questions deliberately designed to undermine his presidency. Questions that cannot be blamed on others or swept under the rug by an insincere sentence uttered at a press conference.\nLet me take a moment. (Laughter.)\nBut during his time in office, I think Barack has answered these questions with the example he's set and the dignity he's shown –- by going high when they go low. (Applause.) And he's answered those questions with the progress we've achieved together. Progress like health reform, passing health care. Creating millions of jobs. Slashing the unemployment rate. Lifting millions of people out of poverty. Expanding LGBT rights so marriage equality is now the law of the land. (Applause.) I could go on.\nBut even after all this progress, it's understandable that folks are feeling a little uncertain as we face this next transition. So the question is: How do we sort through all the negativity, all the name-calling in this election and choose the right person to lead our country forward?\nWell, as someone who has seen the presidency up close and personal, let me share with you what I've learned about this job -- lessons that seem even more relevant, even more critically important after watching Monday's debate.\nFirst and foremost, this job is hard. It is the highest-stakes, most 24/7 job you can possibly imagine. The issues that cross a President's desk are never easy. And solutions to persistent, systemic challenges are never black and white. I mean, just think about the crises this President has faced these last eight years.\nIn his first term alone, Barack had to rescue our economy from the worst crisis since the Great Depression. (Applause.) He had to make the call to take out Osama bin Laden. (Applause.) Respond to devastating natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy. (Applause.) And so much more. So, when it comes to the qualifications we should demand in a President, to start with, we need someone who will take the job seriously, someone who will study and prepare so that they understand the issues better than anyone else on their team.\nAnd we need someone with superb judgment in their own right. Because a President can hire the best advisors on Earth, but I guarantee you that five advisors will give five different opinions, and it is the President -- and the President alone -- who always has to make the final call. We also need someone who is steady and measured. Because when making life-or-death, war-or-peace decisions, a President just can't pop off or lash out irrationally. (Applause.) No, we need an adult in the White House, I guarantee you.\nAnd finally, we need someone who is compassionate. Someone who will be a role model for our kids. Someone who's not just in this for themselves but for the good of this entire country -- all of us. (Applause.) See, at the end of the day, as I've said before, the presidency doesn't change who you are, it reveals who you are. (Applause.) And the same is true of a presidential campaign.\nU.S. presidential campaigns are very long -- nearly two and a half years, or half of one presidential term. Just think about that. So if a candidate is erratic and threatening; if a candidate traffics in prejudice, fears and lies on the campaign trail; if a candidate thinks that not paying taxes makes you smart, or that it's good business when people lose their homes; if a candidate regularly and flippantly makes cruel and insulting comments about women, about how we look, how we act -- well, sadly, that's who that candidate really is. That is the kind of President they will be.\nAnd trust me, a candidate is not going to suddenly change once they're in office -- just the opposite, in fact. Because the minute that individual takes that oath, they are under the hottest, harshest light there is, and there's no way to hide who they really are. But see, at that point, it's too late. They are the leader of the world's largest economy, Commander-in-Chief of the most powerful military force on Earth. With every word they utter, they can start wars, crash markets, fundamentally change the course of this planet.\nSo who in this election is truly ready for that job? Who do we pick? Well, for me -- and I hope there are some who are still deciding here -- but for me, it's very clear that there is only one person in this race who we can trust with those responsibilities, only one person with the qualifications and temperament for this job, and that person is our friend, Hillary Clinton. (Applause.)\nSo let me tell you why. We know that Hillary's the right person because we have seen her character and commitment not just during this campaign but over the course of her entire life. We've seen her dedication to public service -– how after law school, she became an advocate for kids with disabilities. She fought for children's health care as First Lady and for quality childcare as a Senator. And when she didn't become President in 2008, Hillary didn't throw in the towel. No, she once again answered the call to serve and earned sky-high approval ratings for the outstanding job she did for us as our Secretary of State. (Applause.)\nAnd for those who question her stamina to be President, Hillary's resilience is more than proven. As she said on Monday night, she's the only candidate in this race who has traveled to 112 countries; who has negotiated a cease fire, a peace agreement, a release of dissidents; who's spent 11 hours testifying before a congressional committee. Hillary is tough. (Applause.) And when she gets knocked down, she doesn't complain. She doesn't cry foul. No, she gets back up. She comes back stronger for the people who need her most.\nAnd here is what's also true: Hillary is one of the few people on this entire planet -– and clearly the only person in this race –- who actually has any idea what this job entails, who's seen it from every angle -- the staggering stakes, the brutal hours, the overwhelming stresses. And here's the thing --she still wants to do this job. (Laughter.) Because she believes that she has an obligation to use her talents. What do we teach you all? To use your talents to help as many people as possible. That's why Hillary Clinton is running.\nSee, now that's dedication. That's what love of country looks like. So when I hear folks saying that they don't feel inspired in this election, I have to disagree. See, because for eight years, I have seen what it takes to actually do this job. And here's what I know for sure: Right now, we have an opportunity to elect one of the most qualified people who has ever endeavored to become President. (Applause.) Hillary has been a lawyer, a law professor, First Lady of Arkansas, First Lady of the United States, a U.S. Senator, Secretary of State. That's why I'm inspired by Hillary. (Applause.)\nI'm inspired by her persistence, her consistency; by her heart and by her guts. And I'm inspired by her lifelong record of public service. No one in our lifetime has ever had as much experience and exposure to the presidency -- not Barack, not Bill, nobody -- and, yes, she happens to be a woman. (Applause.)\nSo, trust me, Pennsylvania, experience matters. Preparation matters. Temperament matters. And Hillary Clinton has it all. She's the real deal. I have come to know her very well over the years, and I know that she is more than ready, more than able to be an outstanding President for all of us.\nSo we cannot afford to squander this opportunity, particularly given the alternative. Because we know that being President isn't anything like reality TV. It is not an apprenticeship. (Applause.) And it is not just about fiery speeches or insulting tweets. It's about whether someone can handle the awesome responsibility of leading this country.\nSo as you prepare to make this decision, I urge you to ignore the chatter and the noise and ask yourselves which candidate really has the experience, the maturity, the temperament to handle this job. Which candidate's words and actions speak to the values we share –- values like inclusion, opportunity, sacrifice for others. Because your answers to these questions on Election Day will determine who sits in the Oval Office after Barack Obama.\nAnd let's be clear: Elections aren't just about who votes, but who doesn't vote. (Applause.) And that is especially true for young people like all of you. In fact, in 2012, voters under the age of 30 -- yay for you all -- (applause) -- that is not me -- (laughter) -- you provided the margin of victory for Barack in four key battleground states: Florida, Ohio, Virginia, and right here in Pennsylvania. You all did it. (Applause.) But hear this: Without those votes, Barack would have lost those states. He would have lost that election, period, end of story.\nAnd for any of you who might be thinking that your one vote doesn't really matter, or that one person can't really make a difference, consider this: Back in 2012, Barack won Pennsylvania by about 300,000 votes -- which sounds like a lot. But see, when you break that number down, the difference between winning and losing this state was only 17 votes per precinct. Take that in. Seventeen votes. That's how presidential elections are won and lost -- on five votes, 17 votes per precinct.\nSo the fact is that each of you here in this auditorium, in this special place -- we're in a gym, right? (Laughter.) Got confused. (Laughter.) But each of you could swing an entire precinct and win this election for Hillary just by getting yourselves, your family, your classmates out to vote. That's all you have to do. (Applause.) That's it. You can do it. You have the power. (Applause.)\nBut you could also help swing an entire precinct for Hillary's opponent with a protest vote or by staying home out of frustration. Because here's the truth: Either Hillary Clinton or her opponent will be elected President this year. And if you vote for someone other than Hillary, or if you don't vote at all, then you are helping to elect Hillary's opponent. And the stakes are far too high to take that chance, too high. (Applause.) Remember, it's not about voting for the perfect candidate -- there is no such person. In this election, it's about making a choice between two very different candidates with very different visions for our nation.\nSo the question is: Do you want Hillary Clinton to be your President, or do you want her opponent to be your President? That is the choice in this election. And if you choose Hillary, like I am and have and will, then we have to get to work. And it is not enough to come to a rally and post some selfies -- and that's all cute and all that. (Laughter.) My kids do that all the time. It's not enough to get angry and just speak out about the need for change. We all must take action to elect folks who will stand with us to make that change. That's your job.\nSo you need to get yourself and everyone you know registered to vote today. (Applause.) And we have volunteers here who will help. When this is all over, if you're feeling fired up -- and even if you're not -- go find them and get registered before you leave.\nAnd then we need you to roll up your sleeves. Because voting is just part of it. We need you to make calls, knock on doors, get folks out to vote on Election Day. (Applause.) Again, you can sign up with one of the Hillary campaign folks who are here today. I want to see the numbers here go up when I leave. And as you start working your hearts out for Hillary, if you start to feel tired or discouraged by all the negativity in this election, if you just want to hide under the bed and come out when it's all over, I just want you to remember what's at stake, particularly for our young people. Because the choice you make on November 8th will determine whether you can afford your college tuition. It will determine whether you can keep your health care when you graduate.\nOn November 8th, you all will decide whether we have a President who believes in science and will combat climate change or not. (Applause.) A President who will honor our proud history as a nation of immigrants or not. (Applause.) A President who thinks that women deserve the right to make our own choices about our heath or not. (Applause.) That's just a taste of what's at stake.\nSo we can't afford to be tired or turned off. Not now. Because while this might feel like a time of uncertainty and division, let me tell you, I have never felt more hopeful about the future of this great nation. And it's because I know you all, our young people. I feel that way because for the past eight years, I've had the great honor of traveling from one end of this country to the other. I've met people from every conceivable background and walk of life. And time and again, I have seen proof of what Barack and I have always believed in our hearts -- that we as Americans are fundamentally decent, good people, and we all truly want the same things.\nTime and again, Barack and I have met people who disagree with just about everything we have ever said -- (laughter) -- but who welcome us into their communities –- folks who are open-hearted and willing to listen respectfully. And while we might not change each other's minds, we always walk away reminded that we're not all that different.\nSee, millions of folks in this country are working long hours to send their kids to college just like my mom and dad did for me. They're helping to raise their grandkids just like Barack's grandparents did for him. They're teaching their kids the exact same values that Barack and I are trying to teach our girls -- that you work hard for what you want in life and you don't take shortcuts. That you treat people with respect, even if they don't look or think like you. That when someone is struggling, you don't turn away from them, you certainly don't take advantage of them -- no, you imagine walking a mile in their shoes and you do what you can to help. That's what we're trying to teach our kids.\nBecause that's what we do in America -- a country where a girl like me from the South Side of Chicago, whose great-great grandfather was a slave, can graduate from some of the finest universities on Earth. (Applause.) We live in a country where a biracial kid from Hawaii who was the son of a single mother can become President. (Applause.) We live in a country that has always been a beacon for people who have come to our shores and poured their hopes, and their prayers, and their backbreaking hard work into making us who we are today.\nSo let me tell you, especially our young people, don't let anyone ever take away your hope. Don't let them do it. That's what makes America great. (Applause.) And we deserve a President who can see those truths in us. A President who believes that each of us is part of the American story and we're always stronger together. A President who can bring out the best in us -- our kindness, our decency, our courage, our determination, so that we can keep perfecting our union and passing those blessings of liberty down to our children.\nHillary Clinton will be that President. (Applause.) And from now until November, I am going to work as hard as I can to get her and Tim Kaine elected. We need you to do the same thing. We need you to do everything you can to close the door on this election and make it happen so we can keep moving this country forward.\nSo my question to you is: Are you with me? (Applause.) I can't hear you. Are we going to do this? (Applause.) We're going to need your help. We're going to need you fired up. This is on you. You all can make the difference. Can we make it happen? (Applause.)\nThank you all. God bless.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122638", "text": "Washington, DC – On his first full day in office, President Obama issued the \"Transparency and Open Government\" memorandum, making clear that his Administration was \"committed to creating an unprecedented level of openness,\" and fostering a sense of transparency, public participation, and collaboration amongst the government and the American people.\nSince 2009, the Administration has made significant progress opening up data sets that have never before been public, and creating new pathways to civic engagement. Today, students are able to compare the cost of college with other significant data points, such as graduation rates and average salaries of graduates to determine where to get the most bang for their buck. Communities can map demographic, income, and school data to promote Fair Housing. Patients can find information on the safety and cost of hospitals, nursing homes, and physicians, empowering them to make smarter health care choices. These diverse tools benefit different groups of people, industries, and communities, yet all rely on one thing: open data.\nManaging data as an asset and making it available, discoverable, and usable — in a word, \"open\" — has served to strengthen our democracy, promote government efficiencies, and improve citizens' quality of life. With open data, we identify gaps and look for solutions to the most pressing challenges we face as a Nation. Open data has the power to make our economy grow and our local communities thrive.\nToday, the Administration is releasing a fact sheet of key accomplishments over the past eight years in opening government data to spur innovation, opportunity, and economic growth. The release of this list comes in conjunction with today's White House Open Data Innovation Summit, which will bring together government trailblazers, entrepreneurs, companies, advocates, and civic innovators to celebrate the accomplishments and to discuss the path forward on this progress.\nTimeline of Key Open Government Actions\nSince 2009, the President has taken action to ensure that government remains effective and innovative for the American public in an increasingly digital world. Notable examples include:\nØ      January 2009: Released Presidential Memorandum: \"Transparency and Open Government\"\nØ      March 2009: Hired the first U.S. Chief Information Officer\nØ      April 2009: Hired the first U.S. Chief Technology Officer\nØ      December 2009: Released Open Government Directive\nØ      August 2012: Launched the Presidential Innovation Fellows program\nØ      May 2013: Released Executive Order 13642: \"Making Open and Machine Readable the New Default for Government Information\"\nØ      May 2013: Released OMB Memorandum M-13-13: \"Open Data Policy—Managing Information as an Asset\"\nØ      January 2014: Re-launched Data.gov, improving searchability of federal datasets\nØ      March 2014: Established Open Data Cross Agency Priority Goal to evaluate federal efforts to open data\nØ      May 2014: Published the US Open Data Action Plan\nØ      February 2015: Hired the first U.S. Chief Data Scientist\nØ      August 2015: Signed an Executive Order to make permanent the Presidential Innovation Fellows program\nØ      Spring 2016: Hosted four United States Open Data Roundtables\nØ      September 2016: Created the first White House Open Data Summit\nOpening Data to Spark Economic Growth, Innovation, and Opportunity\nThe U.S. Government is creating more data today than at any point in history. Under President Obama's leadership, Federal agencies are making more of that data freely available to the public for use – unleashing nearly 200,000 datasets to date. At the state and local level, governments are finding ways to release data and create platforms to better inform citizens. The private sector is also working on public-private partnerships to release data. And today, open data has given us access to information that can make our lives better and our economy stronger.\nKey examples of how open data has fueled economic growth, innovation and opportunity for Americans all over the United States include:\nØ      Police Data Initiative (PDI) increases transparency and accountability to improve policing outcomes. The Administration  launched the White House Police Data Initiative to enable law enforcement agencies to better use data and technology to increase transparency and accountability, and ultimately improve policing outcomes and reduce unnecessary uses of force. More than 50 police departments from across the country have joined the Police Data Initiative, and have released over 150 open data sets on police-citizen interactions (e.g., use of force, traffic and pedestrian stops, and calls for service) in order to build trust with citizens. Additionally, through research partnerships, several of the departments are helping spur innovation in the use of data from body-worn cameras and advanced data analytics to improve police early intervention systems. Read more:  Fact Sheet: Creating Opportunity for All Through Stronger, Safer Communities.\nØ      The Opportunity Project aims to improve economic mobility for all Americans. The Administration launched The Opportunity Project (TOP) in March 2016 to catalyze the creation of digital tools that use Federal and local open data to help communities navigate information about resources we all need to thrive, such as quality housing, schools, jobs, and transportation. Through Opportunity.Census.gov, TOP provides infrastructure for government - tech sector engagement through the creation of cohorts of tech companies and non-profits, Federal agencies and local communities that collaborate to create tools that address local challenges like connecting unemployed Americans with skills and jobs, helping low income families identify affordable homes near transportation and jobs, and exposing equity gaps between schools. Read more:  Fact Sheet: The White House Launches \"The Opportunity Project,\" Utilizing Open Data to Build Stronger Ladders of Opportunity for All\nØ      City SDK and the U.S. Department of Commerce Data Service bridges the gap between federal, state, and local data. CitySDK (software development kit) by the U.S. Census Bureau is an open data platform that cities across the Nation are using to deliver innovation solutions for social good. It bridges the data gap between federal, state, and local data. This ecosystem-based approach is empowering citizens to deliver technical solutions that will benefit their local communities through the interaction of academia, industry, entrepreneurs, and government. For apps that require open data, case studies using the CitySDK have shown a reduction in developer time by 10x. For example, developers can use data available through the CitySDK to understand commuting habits, socioeconomic patterns on housing and employment, and where to target and anticipate community services and resources.\nØ      The College Scorecard helps Americans compare college costs and outcomes. In September 2015, the Administration launched the new College Scorecard tool to provide students and families with information on college performance that can help them identify colleges that are serving students of all backgrounds well and providing a quality and affordable education. The Scorecard is designed to increase transparency, aggregating data from institutions on federal financial aid and tax information and providing insights into the performance of institutions that receive federal financial aid dollars and the outcomes of the students of those institutions. Further, millions of parents use MyStudentData to view their child's school records per year. Parents can view demographics, schedules, grades, assignments, tests, attendance, discipline, and transcript data.\nØ      U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Open Data Portal and PatentsView improve access to patent and trademark data. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) open data portal improves the discoverability, accessibility, and usability of public patent and trademark data to harness the power of data. The Developer Hub establishes a shareable and \"social\" platform for anyone in this community to showcase unique ways they're using our data, combining it with other data sets such as economic and geographic data. Through this forum, users can unlock the data to answer questions about trends in technology and innovation but also to provide input on other types of data sets the USPTO should release. This portal includes Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for innovators to further mine this data, helping to inform our customers where to spend their limited research and development resources, and providing a much more detailed view of the competitive landscape than previously available. The PatentsView search tool allows audiences to interact with nearly 40 years of data on patenting activity in the U.S. This tool can be used to explore technological, regional, and individual-level trends through several search filters and multiple view options.\nOpening Data to Improve the Efficiency and Effectiveness of the Federal Government\nOver the last eight years, the Administration has launched a number of open data initiatives aimed at making the Federal Government more effective and efficient. Key examples include:\nØ      Data.gov is the home of all Federal Government data for the open data community. At the home of the U.S. Government's open data, Data.gov, are tools and resources to conduct research, develop web and mobile applications, design data visualizations, and more for the open data community. Data.gov, owned and managed by the General Services Administration (GSA), has catalogued nearly 200,000 datasets, many produced by the Federal Government to enable transparency and innovation and to foster a return on our Nation's investment in data. With the Federal open data policy, Data.gov has led the implementation of the Project Open Data Metadata standard with federal agencies, but has also worked with state and local governments to implement the same standard, enabling common metadata and data discoverability on a national scale. Data.gov is now working to help highlight and facilitate other cross-government data federation efforts with the U.S. Data Federation.\nØ      Making open and machine readable data the standard. On May 9, 2013, President Obama signed an  Executive Order making open and machine-readable data the new default for government information, taking historic steps to make government-held data more accessible to the public and to entrepreneurs while appropriately safeguarding sensitive information and rigorously protecting privacy. Making information about government operations more readily available and useful is core to the promise of a more efficient and transparent government.\nThe White House has also launched  Project Open Data, designed to share best practices and software code to assist federal agencies with opening data. These efforts have helped unlock troves of valuable data— that taxpayers have already paid for—and are making these resources more open and accessible to innovators and the public.\nØ      Federal IT Dashboards give insight into how the U.S. government spends its information technology investments. In June 2009, the Administration launched the IT Dashboard, a first-of-its-kind website to enable Federal agencies, industry, the general public, and other stakeholders to view details of more than $70 billion in Federal information technology (IT) investments. The IT Dashboard displays data received from agency IT Portfolio and Business Case reports, including general information on over 7,000 Federal IT investments and detailed data for over 700 of those investments that agencies classify as \"major.\" Agency Chief Information Officers (CIOs) are responsible for evaluating and updating select data on a regular basis, which is accomplished through interfaces provided by the IT Dashboard.\nØ      eRegulations makes regulations easier to read and navigate. The Administration launched eRegulations to make regulations easier to read and navigate for the American public. Created by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and 18F, eRegulations clarifies regulations by bringing related information and regulatory history to the forefront, and allows the public to more easily and contextually voice their opinions on the proposed regulations before they become the law of the land. Further, it also saves agencies time in sorting and organizing comments on proposed regulations using a more granular data structure for them to analyze, organize and respond. All of it is open source and agencies and the public can review the history, documentation and dive into the code at: https://eregs.github.io.\nØ      ForeignAssistance.gov improves transparency in U.S. foreign assistance spending. The Administration launched ForeignAssistance.gov to serve as the U.S. Government's main tool for improving transparency in U.S. foreign assistance spending. Transparency and open data enable stakeholders and the general public to better understand U.S. foreign assistance investments around the world, make foreign aid more useful for development, and help hold ourselves more accountable. Since its launch, ForeignAssistance.gov has been working to establish standard data requirements across the U.S. Government, support agencies in quarterly data reporting, and develop a dynamic and user-friendly website. Its mission is to serve as a central repository where stakeholders can easily access and use U.S. Government foreign assistance budget, financial, and award information in a standardized and easy-to-understand format.\nØ      Increasing federal spending transparency. On May 9, 2014, President Obama signed the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act (DATA Act), setting forth a new commitment to expand Federal spending transparency. When fully implemented, taxpayers will be able to access, search, and download Federal spending data on a publicly available website. This data includes obligations, outlays, unobligated balances, and other budgetary resources for each appropriations account. Taxpayers will also have access to more information about Federal awards as they will be linked with financial data for the first time. With increased access to this data, the public will see where, how, and on what their Government spends their tax dollars.\nOpen Data to Improve the Health and Wellness of the American Public\nThe policies of this Administration in the healthcare industry--ranging from digitizing health records to expanding coverage, to putting data to work for science--have spurred an arc of transformation in healthcare, creating new opportunities and attracting new innovators and entrepreneurs. Making health data more open and accessible increases choice, empowerment and accountability on all sides of the healthcare spectrum.\nA decade ago, only ten percent of hospitals used an electronic health record (EHR) with basic functions. Now, 97 percent of hospitals and 75 percent of doctors are using a certified EHR, spurred by the HITECH Act. Electronic health records allow physicians, pharmacists and patients to access information quickly and securely— putting individuals at the center of their care and enhancing collaboration, improving decision-making and reducing the risk of errors. Studies show that giving patients access to their records may increase healthy behavior and improve decision-making. Research is accelerated when researchers have access to de-identified research data. And now, the public can access nationwide data on hospital performance and charges, rates of procedures and medication patterns, giving them critical information to make healthcare decisions.\nKey examples of the Administration's open data efforts to improve the health and wellness of citizens include:\nØ      Precision Medicine enables individualized treatments. The President's Precision Medicine Initiative is enabling a new era of medicine through research, technology, and policies that empower patients, researchers, and providers to work together toward development of individualized treatments. Key principles of the initiative include making it easier for patients to access, understand and share their own digital health data, including donating it for research, and opening data and technology tools to invite citizen participation, unleash new discoveries and bring together diverse collaborators to share their unique skills.\nIn February 2016, at the  Precision Medicine Initiative Summit hosted by the President at the White House, six of the major  electronic health record vendors announced they will pilot use of open, standardized APIs and other methods to give individuals the ability to contribute their data to research, including for the Precision Medicine Initiative Cohort, when it is launched. These \"Sync for Science\" pilots will demonstrate a new model of patient-enabled research, leveraging industry-led progress to give patients access to their own electronic health records through APIs, and breaking down the research data silos that too often slow scientific progress.

In his final State of the Union address, President Obama asked Vice President Biden to head up a new national effort with the ambitious charge to make a decade worth of progress in cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, in five years. This goal cannot be achieved without all parts of the cancer community and beyond contributing what they can. Toward that end, the Vice President and Cancer Moonshot team have met with cancer researchers, oncologists, nurses, patients, advocates, technologists, designers, engineers, and data scientists to spur new actions and collaborations, including addressing a key Moonshot objective: to unleash the power of data. Read more: whitehouse.gov/cancermoonshot\nØ      The Health Data Initiative partnership forges the way for open data sharing. The Health Data Initiative (HDI) was launched in 2010 in partnership with the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to release health data from HHS' vaults and make it easily available and accessible to the public and to innovators across the country. This information includes clinical care provider quality information, nationwide health service provider directories, databases of the latest medical and scientific knowledge, consumer product data, community health performance information, government spending data and much more. In addition to publishing new data sets, this Initiative also focused on making existing data much easier for developers to use -- i.e., by making it machine-readable, downloadable and accessible via application programming interfaces -- while rigorously protecting privacy and confidentiality. The growing inventory of publicly available data resources is easily findable and accessible at a central location through the  HealthData.gov website. The initiative promoted the use of data by innovators across the country through grassroots \"meetups,\" public competitions, \"code-a-thons\", and more.\nØ      Blue Button: My Data for Health, patients and consumers of health care have a right to their data. In 2010, the Administration launched Blue Button to allow individuals to view, download, send, and, in the future, connect health data to applications and services they trust. More than 750 organizations have taken the Blue Button Pledge to put patients and families at the center of their care. More than three million Veterans, service members, and Medicare beneficiaries have now accessed their personal health data more than 46 million times from their government.\nToday, an estimated 150 million Americans now have the ability to access their health records online from health professionals, medical laboratories, retail pharmacy chains, and state immunization registries. In fact, a majority of healthcare providers are now  providing access to health information online. More than 16,000 health care organizations and providers are now listed on the Blue Button Connector, a tool to help patients and consumers access their health records online. The Administration has also worked to clarify an individual's legal right to access their health information and transmit it to where they choose.\nØ      Envisioning data-driven innovations for mental health, invisible illness, and suicide prevention. In 2015, President Obama proclaimed September 10 asWorld Suicide Prevention Day, reaffirming that mental health is an essential part of overall health. With renewed commitment to supporting and empowering all Americans to seek the care they need, the White House proposed a $500 million investment to increase access to mental health care and inspire new audiences fromall sectors to collaboratively address suicide prevention. In response, clinicians, researchers, data scientists, and innovators are utilizingData.gov open datasets and unlocking millions of new records/datasets from non-government sources for new insights and improved treatments for mental health, invisible illness, and suicide prevention through a series of hackathons including: the Mental Health Hackathon (December 2015), Veterans Affairs Brain Trust (April 2016), Lyme Innovation (April/June 2016), and Veterans Affairs Suicide Prevention Innovations (September 2016).\nØ      Lyme Innovation helps solve challenges in prevention and treatment of Lyme disease. Lyme Innovation aims to solve critical prevention, diagnostic, and treatment and rehabilitation challenges facing the Lyme disease field by bringing together diverse researchers and scientists at a series of hackathons in April and June 2016. This effort is led by theU.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Center for Innovation (VACI), Dean Center for Tick Borne Illness at Spaulding Rehabilitation Network/Harvard Medical School Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, MIT Hacking Medicine, and the Open Medicine Institute with sponsorship from the Bay Area Lyme Foundation. Lyme Innovation contributed to the National Day of Civic Hacking. The foundational principles of Lyme Innovation include: open data, open science, open innovation, and collaboration with all sectors including patients and those with lived experience.\nOpening Data to Make Federally-Funded Scientific and Medical Research More Accessible\nOpen Science extends the concept of open data to the science realm by making the results of Federally-funded scientific and medical research more accessible. Scientific research results include digital data, scholarly publications, and software. Key examples of the Administration's efforts include:\nØ      Increasing public access to digital scientific data. In February 2013, the Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy instructed all Federal agencies that spend more than $100 million per year on R&D to develop plans for increasing public access to digital data and scholarly publications resulting from research that they conduct or fund. Only about one-fifth of the Federal Government's investment in research—and one-quarter of its investment in research and development (R&D)—is conducted by Federal agencies. The vast majority of the research the Federal Government funds is conducted by industry, universities, and other private, non-profit organizations. Agencies with completed public access plans are moving toward implementation. This means that researchers need to prepare data management plans for their new research projects, describing the data to be generated by the research and provisions being made for long-term preservation and access to the data. Agency policies expect that, at the minimum, the data underlying published research papers will be made available. Eight agencies currently require data management plans for all new research projects, and seven additional agencies have begun phasing-in such requirements across their research portfolios. Agencies are providing researchers with additional instructions for proper data management and information about suitable data repositories for preserving and providing access to research data.\nØ      National Cancer Institute creates a community resource for sharing cancer data via the Genomic Data Commons. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Genomic Data Commons (GDC) promotes cancer data sharing by encouraging cancer data submissions, making diverse data compatible for cross-study analysis, and providing easy access to the data for researchers worldwide. At its launch in June 2016, the GDC shared data from more than 14,000 patients, along with associated clinical data (e.g. clinical diagnosis, treatment history, survival data), and the number of patients with data in the GDC will exceed 32,000 with the submission of data from Foundation Medicine. With each new addition, the GDC will grow into a more comprehensive knowledge base that will foster important discoveries in cancer research and increase the success of cancer treatment for patients.\nØ      The Open Science Prize increases international collaboration to help solve pressing public health and biomedical research challenges. The Open Science Prize is a unique collaboration between the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the UK-based Welcome Trust, and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI). It was designed to encourage, recognize the development of new tools, products, and services that use open digital content to help solve pressing public health and biomedical research challenges. As a first of its kind international challenge competition between these organizations, it is an example of an innovative two-phase funding method that is successfully stimulating international collaborations around open data. In  Phase I of this competition, there were 96 entries representing 450 innovators from 45 countries. Of these submissions, 6 were selected as semi-finalists and were provided with 80K to develop prototypes.\nØ      NIH Data Sharing Repositories. In an effort to increase access to biomedical data for discovery and reuse, NIH recently made 64 data sharing repositories viewable to the public on  HealthData.gov. These NIH-supported repositories represent a wide variety of publicly accessible repositories covering data from international neuroimaging to clinical eye exam data. Exposing these publically-accessible NIH-supported data sharing repositories on  HealthData.gov will not only bring further attention to their existence, but also increase opportunities for the discoverability and reuse of biomedical data supported through NIH funding.\nØ      Clinical trial registration and results reporting at ClinicalTrials.gov. ClinicalTrials.gov is a registry and results database of publicly- and privately-supported clinical studies of human participants conducted around the world. This site contains information from more than 220,000 registered clinical trials conducted with private and public funding in this country and around the world, plus summary results for more than 18,700 trials. Data is available to all requesters, both within and outside the United States, at no charge. Summary results information reporting is extended to applicable clinical trials of drugs (including biological products) and devices, regardless of whether or not they are approved, licensed, or cleared by the FDA. A new NIH policy will help ensure that all NIH-funded clinical trials are registered and their results information shared on ClinicalTrials.gov.\nOpen Geospatial and Earth Sciences\nThe U.S. Government invests in Earth observations, many of which are geo-referenced, and are critical to the protection of lives and property, national security, economic growth, and scientific inquiry. A core principle of the U.S. Government is that these Federal geospatial data are public goods, paid for by the American people, and that free, full, and open access to these data significantly enhances their value to society. Value comes from the use of these data to inform decisions. In March 2016, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) released the Common Framework for Earth-Observation Data to assist Federal agencies and the data management community in making geospatial data more discoverable, accessible, and usable. This will, in turn, facilitate the greatest benefit to the United States and international community from our vast collective investment in Earth observations.\nØ      The Climate Data Initiative identifies and opens relevant climate-related datasets. In 2014, the Administration launched the Climate Data Initiative where U.S. agencies worked to identify relevant datasets within the U.S. government and catalogue them on the open-data site climate.data.gov. Building on this effort, this month, the Administration launched the Partnership for Resilience and Preparedness (PREP), a public-private collaboration among Federal agencies, non-governmental organizations, private-sector companies, and civil-society organizations. The partnership will identify priority-information needs, reduce barriers to data access and usability, and develop an open-source platform to enable sharing and learning on the availability and use of data and information for climate resilience. Since the Initiative's announcement, more than 500 Federal datasets have been made available.\nØ      Arctic open data aims to meet critical data needs to inform scientific understanding of the Arctic. The United States seeks to fill data gaps in the Arctic. The Administration is forging international collaborations and public-private partnerships to meet critical data needs to inform scientific understanding of the Arctic as well as informing smart policies. For example, the United States is creating the first-ever open, publicly available, high-resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the Arctic to support informed land management, sustainable development, safe recreation, and scientific studies, as well as domain-specific challenges. These Arctic DEMs can also serve as benchmarks against which future landscape changes (due to, for instance, erosion, sea level rise, extreme events, or climate change) can be measured. Moving forward, the United States will explore creating similarly valuable resources for parts of the world where publicly available, reliable, and high-resolution data are not currently open and publicly available.\nØ      The Global Open Data for Agriculture and Nutrition (GODAN) initiative makes agricultural and nutrition data available for worldwide use. Launched in 2013, now with more than 360 partners, the GODAN initiative works to support global efforts to make agricultural and nutritionally relevant data available, accessible, and usable for unrestricted use worldwide. GODAN is the largest sector-focused open data partnership, and is comprised of public and private institutions, non-profit organizations, industry partners, and governments. Collectively, GODAN partners aim to redefine and promote adoption of open data policies with a focus on opening agriculture and nutrition data, critical to achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) #2 of ending hunger, achieving food security and improved nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture.\nOpening Data to Spur Investments and Innovation in the Energy, Environment, and Climate Sectors\nAccess to information is transforming the United States to a clean energy economy. Open access to energy data allows researchers to collaborate more effectively, advancing innovation in the private sector, and serves as a foundation for new ideas for energy and grid modernization. By exposing federally-funded energy data in open, machine-readable formats, the Department of Energy has enabled innovators to use this data in new and exciting ways to move the needle on solving global energy concerns, and to bring new solutions to the energy market, creating new industries, and jobs.\nØ      The Energy Information Administration features supply and demand data for the U.S. electric grid. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) makes free and open data available through an Application Programming Interface (API) and open data tools to better serve the American public. The EIA API hosts 1.6 million energy-related datasets, publicly available for free, and EIA released a U.S. Electric System Operating Data tool in August 2016 to provide hourly electricity operating data. The tool features near-real-time demand data, plus analysis and visualizations of hourly, daily, and weekly electricity supply and demand on a national and regional level for all 66 electric system balancing authorities that make up the U.S. electric grid. EIA open data continues to facilitate more informed analysis and policy decisions on a national and regional level.\nØ      Open PV Project: The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) were early government adopters of open data. In 2009, the Open PV Project – real-time status of solar photovoltaic market in the U.S. – was launched and has responded to the call-to-action for open data. Data for the project is voluntarily contributed from a variety of sources including utilities, installers, and the general public. The data collected is actively maintained by the contributors and always changing to provide an evolving, up-to-date snapshot of the U.S. solar power market.\nØ      Open Energy Information (OpenEI): In 2009, the Administration launched OpenEI, a community wiki where users can view, edit, add, download, as well as rate and provide comments on energy datasets. The community contributes to the most up-to-date information needed to make informed decisions on energy, market investment, and technology development. The data provided on OpenEI data will also help create new businesses, build innovative tools and inspire new analyses.\nØ      City Energy Profile Tool: In 2016, the DOE and NREL developed the City Energy Profile tool that displays and allows users to download sector-specific electricity, natural gas, and fuel consumption estimates, electricity generation data, utility rates, renewable energy potentials, transportation data, and policies/incentives for more than 23,450 U.S. cities. City decision-makers use this tool to better understand their energy landscape and make more strategic energy decisions.\nWithin the year, DOE and NREL will add a public API to the City Energy Profile tool that will enable city decision makers, other federal agencies, academics, and private researchers to easily access the City Energy Profile tool data and conduct their own city level analyses. An initial analysis showed that if all the cities included in the data set implemented six types of clean energy policies, the cities in aggregate could reduce the U.S.' annual greenhouse gas emissions by 3-8 percent.\nIn 2016, NREL also launched  Data.nrel.gov--a laboratory data platform that catalogs data and associated metadata in an effort to connect researchers, entrepreneurs, and analysts with data that can transform the energy economy and lead to new businesses and U.S. jobs.\nOpen data enhances public participation and civic engagement\nPublic participation in government isn't just a cornerstone of democracy—it's how the U.S. government ensures that policies and practices reflect the ideas and expertise of the American people. President Obama continually emphasizes the importance of more inclusive and open government, directing federal agencies to \"find new ways of tapping the knowledge and experience of ordinary Americans.\" Government is more effective when it gathers input from the public as it makes decisions. By harnessing input and expertise from a wide array of voices, we can continue to strengthen our government.\nThese efforts are just a sampling of how the U.S. government is using incentive prizes, crowdsourcing, and citizen science to advance national priorities, collaborating with civil societies, including companies, universities, foundations, non-profits, and the public:\nØ      Challenge.gov taps into the collective wisdom of the crowd. Drawing on the talents and interests of thousands of Americans, the Federal Government has helped solve some of the Nation's most challenging and pressing problems. More than 50,000 Americans have participated in more than 300 competitions with $35 million in prizes through Challenge.gov. Recently, $2 million was awarded to the winners of Rebuild by Design, the Department of Housing and Urban Development's competition to create redevelopment projects for the region affected by Hurricane Sandy.\nØ      Hackathons, data jams, and conferences paves the way for a new kind of civic engagement. The open data movement has opened the door to a new kind of civic engagement: civic hacking. Civic hackers are developers, designers, data scientists, communicators, civic organizers, entrepreneurs, government employees and anyone willing to get his or her hands dirty solving problems. Some civic hackers are employed by nonprofits, while others belong to private companies. Some are civic hackers by night. Many cities across the United States have caught onto this trend, working hand-in-hand with local, volunteer developers to build new and interesting civic applications. For example, New York City launched its Big Apps competition; Chicago began its Hack Nights; and Datapoloozas were created to challenge developers and entrepreneurs to show a return on investment from their data, and build new apps and businesses. Federal agencies featured open data efforts at dozens of hackathons, data jams, and conferences including the 2015 Health Datapalooza,  Transportation Datapalooza,  Third Annual Safety Datapalooza,  Mental Health Hackathons, an Accessibility Hackathon, a White House Mapathon, and eight Open Data Roundtables led by Federal agencies. In 2016, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) co-led a four-part Open Data Roundtables series to increase two-way public engagement, which have inform National Open Data Guidelines to be publicly announced at the 2016 Open Datapalooza.\nØ      National Day of Civic Hacking widens participation in civic participation. Each year in June, the National Day of Civic Hacking gives members of the public an opportunity to do what is most quintessentially American: roll up our sleeves, get involved and work together to improve our society. On June 4, 2016, hundreds of empowered citizens worked collaboratively to build technology solutions to local challenges using publicly-released data. One of 2016's civic hacking challenges was focused on using data visualization to help tell the story of Promise Zones, high poverty communities where the government partners with local leaders to drive economic growth. The #HackForChange hashtag saw more than 11,000 original posts reaching 24 million between May 7 - June 6, 2016.\nØ      The Data Science Bowl engages data scientists to amplify their impact to affect change. The  Data Science Bowl is a yearly competition for data scientists to harness their passion, unleash their curiosity, and amplify their impact to affect change on a global scale. The 2015-2016 Data Science Bowl asks participants to use data science to transform how we diagnose heart disease. Participants will use data provided by the National Institutes of Health and Children's National Medical Center to create an algorithm that automates a heart function assessment process, effectively acting as a thermometer for the heart. With faster, more accurate insight into the heart's performance in hand, we are giving doctors an opportunity to create robust treatment plans for stopping and treating this disease.", "timestamp": "2016-09-28", "title": "Fact Sheet: Data by the People, for the People — Eight Years of Progress Opening Government Data to Spur Innovation, Opportunity, & Economic Growth"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122670", "text": "Science Ministers from 25 governments and the European Union gathered at the White House to discuss Arctic research priorities and sign a Joint Statement on increased international collaboration on Arctic science and inclusion of Indigenous peoples in understanding and responding to changes in the Arctic\nThe Arctic environment is changing at an unprecedented pace, posing threats to livelihoods and ecosystems. One year after President Obama's visit to Alaska, and building on his unwavering commitment to advance understanding of changes occurring in the Arctic and their global consequences, today the White House hosted the first-ever Arctic Science Ministerial (ASM).\nScience Ministers, or their representatives, from 25 governments—Canada, the People's Republic of China, the Kingdom of Denmark, the Faroe Islands, Finland, France, Germany, Greenland, Iceland, India, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, the Russian Federation, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America—and the European Union and representatives from Arctic Indigenous peoples' organizations gathered to discuss collective efforts to increase the pace of international scientific collaboration in the Arctic.\nA capstone of the ASM was the signing and release of a  Joint Statement by the delegations gathered today. The Joint Statement recognizes that international collaboration and the inclusion of Arctic Indigenous peoples in science and decision-making are essential to advancing research in the Arctic. The Joint Statement and the ASM help chart a new collective approach in Arctic science that will inform national policies concerning climate-change mitigation and resilience, Arctic development, stewardship, and the needs of the region's Indigenous peoples.\nThe Ministers used the occasion of the ASM to highlight several new initiatives. They include:\n* Today, the United States released the first ever Arctic-wide digital elevation model (DEM). The result of a collaboration between the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency and the National Science Foundation, this digital representation of the Arctic land surface has an unprecedented high resolution of 8 m. A 2 m resolution Arctic DEM is to be created during the next 12 months and will be an important baseline for assessing future land surface changes.\n* The European Union will initiate a new 5-year project (2016-2021) coordinated by Norway to develop an Integrated Arctic Observing System (INTAROS). The project, with a Ђ15.5 million budget, will involve scientists in 14 European countries (Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greenland, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom), as well as in a number of countries elsewhere in the world (Canada, the Peoples' Republic of China, the Russian Federation, and the United States, with other countries expected to join).\n* The United States is among the countries that will work with the INTAROS scientists. In 2017, the U.S. Office of Naval Research will initiate a 5-year project—Arctic Mobile Observing System (AMOS)—that will develop new sensors, platforms, and techniques for mobile-observing systems that drift with the moving sea-ice cover, or operate autonomously in the ocean below the ice.\n* The European Union will also initiate two new projects to understand the impact of the changing Arctic on the weather and climate of the Northern Hemisphere. The projects APPLICATE (Advanced Prediction in Polar regions and beyond: modelling, observing system design and LInkages associated with a Changing Arctic climate) (2016-2020, Ђ8 million budget) and Blue-Action (2016-2021, Ђ7.5 million budget) will involve scientists in 13 European countries (Belgium, Denmark, the Faroe Islands, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom), as well as in a number of countries elsewhere in the world (Canada, the Peoples' Republic of China, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, and the United States).\n* In 2017, the United Kingdom will begin fieldwork for the \"Changing Arctic Ocean Programme\", a five-year research effort to explore the effects of changes to the physical environment (ice and ocean) on the marine ecosystem and the associated biogeochemical functioning of the Arctic Ocean.\n* The United States will support \"EyesNorth,\" a U.S. National Science Foundation research-coordination network of community-based observing initiatives in the Arctic and beyond. Involving scientists and northern residents in Finland, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, the Russian Federation, Sweden, the United States, and elsewhere, EyesNorth will expand the science of community-based observing, including the use of Indigenous knowledge and local place-based knowledge, and provide a critical connection between observing environmental change and community preparedness and response. \"EyesNorth\" will contribute to the work of SAON—Sustaining Arctic Observing Networks—a joint effort of the Arctic Council (through its Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme) and the International Arctic Science Committee.\n* In a further contribution to SAON, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will open a U.S. SAON Office. It will foster interagency and international collaboration in the development of Arctic observing and data systems, as well as the delivery of higher-level data and information to the scientific community and policymakers.\n* The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will advance STEM education and empower citizens through Arctic STEM cooperative partnerships with the Local Environmental Observer (LEO) Network—a network of local environmental observers and topic experts who apply traditional knowledge, science and technology to document significant, unusual environmental events in Alaska.\n* The U.S. Department of Energy will develop a design-support tool for remote off-grid microgrids in the Arctic; and the Office of Naval Research will support the Alaska Network of Energy Education and Employment (ANEEE).\n* In 2017, the U.S. National Science Foundation will announce new awards for projects that promote public participation in Arctic research.\n* The Smithsonian Institution, in collaboration with the embassies of Denmark and the Russian Federation, will open a new exhibit—Narwhal: Revealing an Arctic Legend—in spring 2017 at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, DC.\n* Finland and the United States will collaborate to organize an international Arctic STEM Education Summit during the Finnish Chairmanship of the Arctic Council (2017–2019). The summit will bring together senior government officials, students, educators, researchers, technologists, and other experts to share best practices and develop new educational partnerships that enhance STEM education. It will facilitate information and resource sharing, foster new education networks, and promote a legacy of formal and informal STEM education and lifelong learning both inside and outside the Arctic.\nThe ASM seeks to deepen international collaborations that enable nations to address large-scale research questions and increase the pace of discovery. Existing national and international observing and research efforts are impressive, but they are not able to meet the demand for comprehensive and integrated information in the Arctic. People in the Arctic are already experiencing significant impacts from climate change. The scale and pace of research must increase to move beyond documenting changes to increasing knowledge and understanding, developing predictive capabilities that inform decision and policy making, and increasing the resilience of Arctic communities and ecosystems.\nThe White House organized the ASM around four themes that reach across national boundaries and provide opportunities to advance understanding of and ability to respond to rapid environmental change in the Arctic.\nThe four themes of the Ministerial and the Joint Statement are:\n* Arctic-Science Challenges and Their Regional and Global Implications\n* Strengthening and Integrating Arctic Observations and Data-Sharing\n* Applying Expanded Scientific Understanding of the Arctic to Build Regional Resilience and to Shape Global Responses\n* Empowering Citizens through Science Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Education Leveraging Arctic Science\nToday's Arctic Science Ministerial will facilitate progress on each of these themes, described in more detail below. A broad call for deliverables that support the four themes realized more than 150 contributions describing some of the many Arctic science activities of foreign governments and U.S. departments and agencies. Many contributions, described below by theme, are continuing investments that support research efforts critical to long-term and sustained measurements essential to understanding the Arctic. Other contributions, highlighted today at the ASM and summarized above, are new efforts that build on existing work, and address gaps in information critical to advancing new understanding of the Arctic.\nTheme I: Arctic Science Challenges and Their Regional and Global Consequences\nThe annual average air temperature in the Arctic is rising at more than twice the rate of the annual average global air temperature. This rapid transition in the atmosphere is reflected in rapid transitions on land and in the ocean. The dramatic changes are having a profound impact on Arctic cultures, communities, and ecosystems, and they also have global consequences.\nSome of the most dramatic changes are occurring in the cryosphere: sea ice, freshwater ice, snow cover, land ice sheets, glaciers, and permafrost. Permafrost is warming and thawing, changing landscape, drainage patterns, and habitats, and increasing the potential for the release of potent greenhouse gases that will amplify Arctic and global warming. Glaciers, mountain ice caps, and the Greenland ice sheet are shrinking and contributing to worldwide sea-level rise. Sea-ice extent, thickness, and volume are decreasing, resulting in larger ocean surface waves and greater coastal erosion, compounding the challenges of Indigenous communities that hunt ice-dependent marine mammals. There is also growing evidence that the diminishing sea ice is contributing to changing atmospheric circulation patterns that are affecting weather—including some kinds of extremes—in lower-latitude regions.\nThere is therefore an urgent need for increased monitoring and research to better understand the causes and consequences of the rapidly changing Arctic environmental system. There is also a need for increased effort to incorporate the growing data and knowledge base into improved computer models for enhanced forecasting of weather, water, and ice on hourly to weekly time scales, as well as improved projections of the state of the Arctic System and global climate over yearly to decadal time scales.\nIn recognition of these needs, the tempo of research sponsored by Arctic and non-Arctic countries has already been increasing for some time, with impetus from the eight-nation Arctic Council, the International Arctic Science Committee, the World Meteorological Organization, and a growing number of national centers for polar research. The existing national research efforts and collaborations among them will be the building blocks for expanded international cooperation going forward, facilitated by the information exchanges and networking at the Ministerial and future such meetings expected to follow. Among the existing efforts highlighted at the Ministerial under the \"Arctic Science Challenges\" theme were:\n•      The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is working with scientists in Canada, and with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), to carry out a large, multi-year combined fieldwork and remote-sensing campaign to investigate ecosystem vulnerability and greenhouse gas emissions from boreal forests and tundra in the Arctic region.\n•      Italy and the Netherlands are using advanced synthetic aperture radar remote sensing techniques to measure land-surface elevation changes occurring in response to permafrost degradation.\n•      Iceland, India, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, and Switzerland are each studying different aspects of how Arctic glaciers, ice caps, and the Greenland ice sheet are losing mass to the ocean and contributing to sea-level rise.\n•      The \"Ice sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise 2 (IMBIE-2),\" a collaboration between scientists supported by the European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA, provides a framework for assessing recent changes in the mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet, and has an explicit aim to widen participation to enable the entire scientific community to become involved.\n•      The U.S. Office of Naval Research \"Stratified Ocean Dynamics of the Arctic\" is a 5-year (2016-2021) project that supports scientists in the United States, Republic of Korea, and the United Kingdom to study changes in ocean circulation, stratification, and the flow of heat and their collective impact on sea ice in the Pacific sector of the Arctic Ocean.\nTheme II: Strengthening and Integrating Arctic Observations and Data-Sharing\nOn September 10, Arctic sea-ice reached its annual minimum extent, which tied with 2007 as the second-lowest in the period of satellite observations that began in 1979. All ten of the lowest minimum sea-ice extent values in that period have occurred during the last ten summers (2007–2016) exemplifying the dramatic changes that are occurring throughout the Arctic environmental system.\nObservations and observation platforms, systems, and networks confirm that the sea ice and other components of the Arctic environmental system—permafrost; snow cover; glaciers, ice caps, and the Greenland ice sheet; terrestrial and marine ecosystems—are all changing at unprecedented rates. Nonetheless, the Arctic remains under-observed and data-sparse. The current observing capabilities need to be sustained and new capabilities need to be added to deliver a comprehensive view of the Arctic environmental system. To maximize the benefits of enhanced Arctic-observing capabilities there needs to be full and open access to data and the value-added information and products derived from the data. Data sharing is essential.\nObservations are vital for the research described in Theme I. They are also needed for improving weather, water, and sea-ice forecasting, and for projecting how changes in the Arctic will affect conditions around the world and how the Arctic will evolve under different global-emissions scenarios. The current inadequacy of Arctic observing is one of the main reasons for the uncertainties in sea-ice and climate predictions and in projections of climate-change impacts on people, communities, and ecosystems.\nSince the last International Polar Year began in 2007 there has been a growing awareness of the urgent need to improve Arctic observing capabilities and develop data policies that promote sharing through full and open access. This recognition is reflected in a number of ongoing projects and collaborations that were reviewed at the meeting, including:\n•      Canada, the Peoples' Republic of China, the Republic of Korea, Japan, and the United States, working together through the Pacific Arctic Group of the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC), share responsibility for the Distributed Biological Observatory (DBO), a biophysical change detection array in the northernmost Bering Sea and the Chukchi and Beaufort seas.\n•      Germany is working with multiple countries to carry out the Multidisciplinary Drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) between October 2019 and October 2020. The centerpiece of MOSAiC is the icebreaker \"Polarstern\", operated by the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany, which will support year-round observations of the physics of the atmosphere, sea ice, and ocean and the biogeochemistry of the ice and ocean as the ship drifts with the moving sea ice.\n•      The Russian Federation is developing and improving methods, models, and technologies for hydrometeorological prediction.\n•      The World Meteorological Organization has launched the Year of Polar Prediction (YOPP), which is actually a two-year project running from mid-2017 to mid-2019, aimed at achieving a significant improvement in environmental-prediction capabilities for the polar region and beyond. The Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany hosts the YOPP international coordination office.\n•      As contributions to YOPP, Canada is developing a high-resolution coupled environmental prediction system that will enhance the accuracy of high-impact weather event predictions in the North, and the European Space Agency Arctic Earth Observation Impact Assessment is addressing the combination of Earth Observation data streams with a numerical model of the Arctic Ocean sea-ice system using advanced data-assimilation techniques to construct a highly flexible system for Arctic Mission Benefit Analysis (ArcMBA).\n•      With support from Norway, the Sustaining Arctic Observing Networks (SAON) initiative promotes the vision of well-defined, long-lived observing networks that provide users with full and open access to high-quality data that can realize pan-Arctic and global value-added services and societal benefits.\n•      As a contribution to SAON, Norway is establishing SIOS (Svalbard Integrated Arctic Earth Observing System), a research infrastructure coordination organization of 26 partners from Europe and Asia. SIOS promotes more openness, better access, data sharing and knowledge management for the international research community.\n•      Canada and the United States continue to collaborate in mapping the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean.\n•      The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Department of the Interior, Department of State, Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the U.S. Geological Survey are working with Canada and Finland to expand the Local Environmental Observer (LEO) Network into a pan-Arctic network.\nTheme III: Applying Expanded Scientific Understanding of the Arctic to Build Regional Resilience and to Shape Global Responses\nArctic peoples and communities face long-standing challenges that are compounded by environmental, social, and economic changes that are occurring in the Arctic, driven above all by global climate change and its accentuation in the Arctic region. These changes are testing the resilience and sustainability of people and communities.\nRapid environmental change, such as degrading permafrost and increasing coastal erosion, is affecting critical infrastructure—buildings; roads, railways and bridges; airports, harbors and ports; and energy-supply chains—and the health and well-being of Arctic residents. It is also exposing the shortcomings of existing capabilities to forecast environmental conditions that affect economic activities and the daily lives of Arctic residents—maritime and air transportation, energy and mines, fisheries, and tourism. In some cases, growing economic activity is challenging the traditional ways of life of Indigenous society. It will be essential to apply the improved scientific understanding and forecasting capabilities sought under Themes 1 and 2 to the development of integrated strategies to meet the basic needs of Arctic people and increase regional resilience and adaptation capacity.\nAt the same time, improved understanding of how the effects of rapid climate change in the Arctic are affecting both the pace of global climate change and its impacts, including weather patterns and extremes across the Northern Hemisphere, will be important both to motivating increased ambition around climate-change mitigation and to shaping resilience strategies in countries around the globe.\nEfforts reviewed at the Ministerial under Theme 3 include:\n•      Canada will address the topic of coping with a changing environment at local and regional levels by examining case studies of capacity building and partnership development with \"Big Science\".\n•      Nordforsk—an intergovernmental organization under the Nordic Council of Ministers—supports a Nordic Centre of Excellence that is investigating climate-change effects on the epidemiology of infectious diseases and impacts on northern societies. NordForsk also supports three additional Nordic Centres of Excellence to collectively focus research on resilience, adaptation, and sustainability as they relate to communities, reindeer husbandry, and resource extraction.\n•      In 2015, Japan initiated the 5-year \"Arctic Challenges for Sustainability (ArCS)\" project. The Netherlands and the Russian Federation are also investing in Arctic sustainable development research.\n•      The U.S. Geological Survey is assessing historical shoreline change and Arctic coastal vulnerability, and mapping coastal flooding to develop a database of historical and future wave and storm-surge conditions across the Arctic Ocean for use in development and mitigation planning of infrastructure, communities, and natural-resource management.\n•      The Russian Federation is undertaking a comprehensive assessment of the sustainability of its Arctic coastal systems and infrastructure for spatial planning of maritime activities and socio-economic development.\n•      Norway is studying climate change and its impacts on the Arctic environment and human activities in order to improve the existing integrated management of northern waters.\n•      The U.S. Department of Transportation is conducting climate-change vulnerability-assessments and developing adaptation options for Alaska transportation infrastructure.\n•      Japan is investigating the predictability of Arctic weather and sea ice in consultation with forecast users such as shipping companies.\n•      India is studying the role of the Arctic in modulating the Indian Monsoon over seasonal to millennial time scales.\n•      The Republic of Korea is investigating the relationship between Arctic warming and sub-Arctic winter weather in order to enhance prediction capability;\n•      Singapore is interested in identifying sensitivities and feedbacks between Arctic change and vulnerable regions of southeast Asia, and is assessing the viability of trans-Arctic shipping routes and analyzing their impact on maritime transportation.\n•      Spain is improving process understanding of the large-scale atmospheric response to changing sea ice and assessing the impact of the rapidly changing Arctic on non-Arctic countries, and conducting research into the sustainability of fisheries in the Barents Sea region.\n•      China is studying Arctic amplification of warming and the global consequences of sea-ice retreat.\n•      Canada, Denmark, the United States and other countries are collaborating to refine, develop and implement the World Meteorological Organization Arctic Polar Regional Climate Center (PRCC) Network concept. It will develop and deliver improved climate products and services in response to the defined needs of Arctic clients and stakeholders for climate information in support of decision-making.\nTheme IV: Empowering Citizens through Science Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Education Leveraging Arctic Science\nSTEM education is essential for sustainable development in the Arctic and vital for preparing young people in the Arctic to face challenges arising from continuing environmental, social, and economic change. Engagement with Arctic science, combined with Arctic Indigenous and local knowledge, will enhance the delivery of education to students in the region, and inclusion of more Arctic science in STEM education in the region will inspire a new generation of locally educated experts to solve Arctic and global-science challenges and empower the citizens of the Arctic to enjoy full participation in decision-making that improves the quality of their lives.\nArctic science can also be a catalyst for enhancing STEM education outside of the Arctic. The Arctic can serve as a real-world laboratory to train the next generation of scientists and engineers in a variety of Arctic-relevant disciplines. Activities such as virtual participation in field projects, development of high-impact multimedia educational web content, and student engagement in competitions and summer schools in Arctic locations are all known to be effective tools for education and learning.\nActivities undertaken as part of the International Polar Year demonstrated that student and public engagement in science can strengthen learning through observations and research about the changing Arctic and how it affects the rest of the world.\nEfforts reviewed at the Ministerial under this theme include:\n•      Norway is supporting the development of a \"One Stop Shop for Arctic Knowledge\" by the University of the Arctic (UArctic). It unites more than 170 research-focused universities, colleges, and institutes around the circumpolar North of the eight Arctic states, as well as Arctic Council observer states. UARctic will create four new \"mini MOOCs\" (Massive Open Online Courses) that will provide a basic introduction to the Arctic for a broad audience, and a catalogue of Arctic courses and study programs, and research infrastructure. UArctic will also use web-based, big-data analytics to create an online directory of Arctic-wide research institutions, researchers and research projects, publications, and research trends and gaps to foster international research and education collaboration.\n•      The European Union EDU-ARCTIC project supports researchers and educators in the Faroe Islands, France, Iceland, Norway, and Poland to develop an innovative educational program to attract young people to natural sciences and polar research.\n•      The Arctic Warrior project in Spain uses educational transmedia and game-design elements to promote Arctic environmental protection.\n•      Singapore is working to increase awareness in the Tropics of the changes in the Arctic by convening seminars and conferences.\n•      The \"Japan-Russia Expert Education Project\" will continue to nurture professionals to play leading roles in creating a sustainable future in the Russian Far East and the Arctic.\n•      The U.S. Department of the Interior will continue its support for the Alaska Native Science and Engineering Program (ANSEP) at the University of Alaska Anchorage, which is effecting systemic change in STEM education and capacity-building among Alaska Native students.", "timestamp": "2016-09-28", "title": "Fact Sheet: United States Hosts First-Ever Arctic Science Ministerial to Advance International Research Efforts"}

In February of this year, the President issued his  Cybersecurity National Action Plan (CNAP). The CNAP directed the Federal Government to take new action now while fostering the conditions required for long-term improvements in our approach to cybersecurity across the Federal Government, the private sector, and our personal lives.\nOne critical component of the CNAP is the goal of empowering Americans to better secure their online accounts by moving beyond just usernames and passwords and adding an extra layer of security. To accomplish this goal, the  National Cyber Security Alliance (NCSA), together with non-profit membership organizations and private sector companies, today launched the \"Lock Down Your Login\" campaign.\nLaunching \"Lock Down Your Login\"\nThe NCSA's \"Lock Down Your Login\" is a public-private campaign designed to enable every American to better secure their online accounts through the use of strong authentication. Strong authentication, such as the use of a fingerprint or the confirmation of a one-time code, for your online accounts could have prevented as many as 62 percent of successful data breaches last year.\nMany Americans are concerned about online security. But we all have work to do to improve the security of our online accounts. 72 percent of Americans believe their accounts are secure with only a username and password. Unfortunately, this simple method for protecting ourselves online is not as effective as it once was. But there is some good news. A confluence of emerging technologies, under the banner of strong authentication, is making it easier for everyone to better secure their online accounts.\n\"Lock Down Your Login\" aims to close this gap by focusing on simple and widely available solutions that can and should be adopted by every American online. That's why industry, government, and like-minded organizations that understand the importance of cybersecurity awareness and education are coming together through this harmonized campaign to make the case to consumers directly.\n\"Lock Down Your Login\" builds upon years of the STOP. THINK. CONNECT.TM campaign's public-private partnerships to help more Americans stay safe online through public awareness. This new campaign is timed with the launch of National Cyber Security Awareness Month in October. During October, the National Cyber Security Alliance and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, co-founders and co-leaders of the month, call on all Americans and businesses to share the responsibility and take steps to be safer and more secure online.\n\"Lock Down Your Login\" Partners\nIn order to launch this public-private partnership, the NCSA has engaged a broad range of \"Lock Down Your Login\" partners, including technology companies, banks, non-profits, and civil society. \"Lock Down Your Login\" partners will support the campaign in a number a ways including but not limited to:\n•      Collaborating closely with the National Cyber Security Alliance to promote the \"Lock Down Your Login\" messaging and content by using the brand and logo with their own. This includes utilizing media space online and on television as well as other platforms to spread the word about \"Lock Down Your Login.\"\n•      Encouraging customers to use strong authentication technology. By making new technologies available and generating awareness of those currently offered, partners will empower their customers to better secure their accounts.\n•      Creating original content for their audience and promoting it through their own platforms and spokespeople. \"Lock Down Your Login\" encourages campaign partners generate awareness and inspire action by creating their own content designed to reach their specific target audience.\nExamples of commitments announced by companies today in support of the \"Lock Down Your Login\" campaign include:\n•      Facebook is conducting a broadcast and radio media tour to share security tools and advice to keep accounts safe, including strong authentication and password advice. People using Facebook will see promotional videos for tools like Security Checkup, which encourages unique passwords and the use of login alerts to receive a notification when a new computer or phone attempts to access your account. A blog post series on Facebooks' Security Page will highlight the \"Lock Down Your Login\" campaign and share other security features, including login approvals, which is Facebook's two-factor authentication feature involving a code generated from the Facebook app or sent via text message.\n•      The FIDO Alliance, the Electronic Transactions Association (ETA) and the National Cyber Security Alliance (NCSA) will jointly host a \"Future of Authentication Policy Day\" to highlight the importance of strong authentication, explore the evolution of the authentication market, and discuss its impact on the policy and regulatory landscape. This event will take place on October 27th, in recognition of National Cyber Security Awareness Month.\n•      Google will help promote the goals of the \"Lock Down Your Login\" campaign through a blog post, social media, and a home page promotion in October that will urge users to take an account \"Security Checkup\" which includes managing any two-step verification protections users have set up. This is in addition to Google's existing security investments, including ongoing Safe Browsing protection, which shields desktops and Android users from malware, phishing, and unwanted software on the web.\n•      Intel is committed to working with the National Cyber Security Alliance and its partners to bring easy and actionable digital security education to consumers through engaging content. Intel will support the call for stronger authentication by reaching users on social media and motivating them to take action by making digital security understandable and user-friendly. In product offerings that support this initiative, True Key™ by Intel Security is a multifactor password manager. It secures passwords, ensures only users can access them with unique factors like their face and fingerprint, and logs users in across the web.\n•      Mastercard continues to be committed to developing consumer solutions that eliminate static passwords, utilize biometrics and make payments both safe and simple. As part of its efforts, Mastercard, with its partner BMO-Harris Bank in the United States, will announce the upcoming commercial launch of the Mastercard Identity Check Mobile solution for BMO Harris Bank's commercial cards. Mastercard Identity Check Mobile allows a user to authenticate a digital payment transaction with his or her fingerprint or selfie.\n•      SANS Institute is offering organizations access to an interactive National Cybersecurity Awareness Month Planning Kit, which will include everything organizations need to promote cybersecurity during the month of October. The kit includes resources, materials and templates for every day of the month, including an entire day dedicated just to the Lock Down Your Login campaign.\n•      Square will continue to implement simple and easy-to-use multi-factor authentication (MFA) tools for all of the businesses that they serve. For user log-in, they have provided customers with the option to enable an MFA feature that sends a text with a verification code. Square will encourage users to enable this tool through a variety of channels with clear instructions on how to do so. Their MFA solution also enables the business to require a second layer of verification for sensitive account actions like changing a linked bank account or password.\n•      USAA is committing to make it easier for its members to secure their accounts using multi-factor authentication. They support a variety of authentication methods including touch, voice, face, text and token. White these methods have been available to all members since 2011, USAA will now automatically enroll new members in multi-factor authentication. This is part of a multi-year commitment to strengthen account security.\nNSCA's full list of partners on the \"Lock Down Your Login\" partners are: CompTIA, Consumer Action, Consumer Federation of America, Council of Better Business Bureaus, Decoded, ESET North America, Facebook, Family Online Safety Institute (FOSI), FIDO Alliance, Financial Services Roundtable, Google, Intercede, Intel Corp., Javelin Strategy & Research, Logical Operations – Get IT Certified, MasterCard, mcgarrybowen, Mozilla, Multi-State Information Sharing Analysis Center (MS-ISAC), National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace (NSTIC) National Program Office (NPO), NXP Semiconductor, PayPal, Salesforce, SANS Institute, Square, TeleSign, TrueKeyTM by Intel Security, Twitter Inc., Visa Inc., Wells Fargo & Company, and Yubico.\nCampaign Development\nLed by the NSCA and in coordination with the Administration, the campaign was developed through an active collaboration of partners and consumer research to identify a message that would resonate with Americans and encourage them to take actions to secure their accounts.\nWorking together since this past spring, partners have provided input and guidance about the best ways to communicate the value of adding stronger authentication to online accounts. Several messages and logos were tested through surveys. Americans responded the most positively to the \"Lock Down Your Login\" messaging as it is easy to understand, encourages adoption of stronger account security and motivates internet users to take action to prevent identity theft and secure their digital lives.\nFor more information about how to lock down your login or to become a campaign partner visit https://www.lockdownyourlogin.com", "timestamp": "2016-09-28", "title": "Fact Sheet: Launch of the \"Lock Down Your Login\" Public Awareness Campaign"}

John E. \"Jeb\" Bush of Florida, in his former capacity as a 2016 Presidential candidate.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119047", "text": "The President. Please have a seat. It's not that formal around here. [Laughter] How you doing? Well, welcome to the White House, everybody. And give it up for NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Champion, Kyle Busch. [Applause] Hey!\nWe also are happy to welcome here Kyle's wonderful wife Samantha, who I just learned is from the Chicago area, so she and I, we've got a little bond going here. [Laughter] We've got some Members of Congress here who are big NASCAR fans. We've got NASCAR CEO Brian France and his beautiful family, who—they keep on growing. [Laughter] And Dave Alpern, president of Joe Gibbs Racing; and Crew Chief Adam Stevens. Give them all a big round of applause.\nNow, as you may be aware, I host a lot of teams from other sports; they all call themselves national champions or world champions. But I've got to hand it to the Number 18 team, who have given themselves the title of \"Galaxy Champs.\" [Laughter] That's a first. And I've put in a call to NASA to check to see whether this is, in fact, accurate. [Laughter]\nKyle, I hear your ride is outside. Most years, when NASCAR comes to town, I make a joke about looking at the car full of longing and feeling kind of wistful and trying to get Secret Service to let me take a spin. [Laughter] But this year's different. In a few months, I can actually do anything I want. [Laughter] So, Kyle, we're going to talk. [Laughter]\nNASCAR Sprint Cup Series Champion Kyle T. Busch. You got it.\nThe President. I'm not sure, though, Michelle is going to let me drive with a car with a whole bunch of M&M's on them. [Laughter] She may want carrots or something. [Laughter] Actually, we have White House M&M's here, so those of you who have sampled them, they are good old-fashioned M&M's. [Laughter]\nNow, it's 2016. I think there were some people who thought we were going to see a Bush back here in the White House this year. [Laughter] But they didn't know it was going to be Kyle—[laughter]—especially after he broke his leg and his foot at Daytona and missed the first three months of the season.\nBut he hunkered down, displaying the same determination in rehab that he's known for on the track. He'll be the first to say he could not have done it alone. Obviously, from Samantha's support, to everyone on the Number 18 team who held things down while he got better, the people in Kyle's life kept him driving forward.\nIt helps, by the way, being young. I just want to point out. [Laughter] You know? You heal a little faster. When you're 55, things don't happen that quick. [Laughter]\nSo he ended up being able to return a week early, just a few days before their beautiful, young son Brexton was born. But he still only had a fraction of the season to qualify for the Chase, and that's something to do in a full season.\nLuckily, as most folks will attest, Kyle does not lack confidence, apparently. So while he has said that rehabbing was one of the hardest things he's ever done, winning on the racetrack wasn't. And together, he and the Number 18 team won five times on their way to the Cup, including at the Homestead-Miami Speedway, where Kyle took the lead with just seven laps to go and brought home the championship.\nSo it was another great season: Kyle's first career Sprint Cup title. But for Kyle, it's not just about what he does on the track, it's what he does off the track. Kyle and Samantha are working hard to make a difference for folks all across the country, from donating wedding gowns to military brides to helping couples afford fertility treatment, to covering expenses for women who are battling breast cancer.\nAnd that goes with the kind of service that we're seeing from the entire NASCAR family. Just a few weeks ago, NASCAR lost its matriarch, Betty Jane France. And she was the guiding light of the sport's community's efforts, including creating the Speediatrics program, which has given more than half a million kids the opportunity to access state-of-the-art medical equipment.\nIn all, over the past decade, NASCAR has given $25 million dollars to charitable causes that have helped more than a million kids. And last year, through a tremendous partnership with the VA, they helped more than 5,300 veterans, servicemembers, and their families access the benefits that they have earned.\nSo all together, it's a legacy of service that honors Betty Jane and stays true to the belief that in serving each other, we make the country better, and we help every member of the American family. And I know that Kyle, Samantha, and others want to continue that legacy.\nSo, for one last time, let's give a big round of applause for Kyle, his family, Joe Gibbs Racing, and the entire Number 18 team. What do we got here? Here, come on. You get to——\nMr. Busch. I appreciate that. This here is a helmet, one of the few that I have during the season and I raced with in order to bring to you and give a gift on behalf of all of us at Joe Gibbs Racing.\nThe President. That's a good looking helmet.\nMr. Busch. So that's a real one there.\nThe President. I really like that helmet now.\nMr. Busch. Yes? See, when you go on your adventure, you could use that one.\nThe President. I'm going to use this one. Tell me the truth, what are you pumping in through here, though? [Laughter]\nMr. Busch. Some really good stuff. [Laughter] Yes, sir.\nThe President. All right. Come on, let's knock the podium, and let's take a good picture. Come on, everybody.\nMr. Busch. You got it. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2016-09-28", "title": "Remarks Honoring the 2015 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Champion"}

Hello, everybody! Hello, Fort Lee! Well, it is wonderful to see all of you. Thank you.\nAudience member. Thank you!\nThe President. Thank you! Thank you! I want to thank your outstanding leadership team for welcoming me, including Major General Darrell Williams, Lieutenant General Wendy Masiello, Colonel Adam Butler, and Command Sergeant Major Nathaniel Bartee.\nI know this is the proud home of the Army Combined Arms Support Command. But I know we've got other services represented here. Navy. [Applause] Marines. [Applause] Air Force. [Applause] We've got our outstanding DOD civilians in the house. And then, of course, we've got a whole lot of Army. [Applause]\nNow, I'm not here to give a big speech.\nAudience member. [Inaudible]\nThe President. No, no. [Laughter] The main thing I wanted to do was just come by, shake some hands. As you know, I had a town hall with CNN and some of our extraordinary troops, our veterans, our military families. We had an important discussion about how our Nation has to uphold its obligations to you and your families. You serve us with such distinction every single day, I want to make sure we're doing right by you. And so you can watch it tonight on CNN or you can watch whatever else is on. [Laughter]\nBut you guys showed extraordinary hospitality and made our visit a success, so I just want to say thank you.\nAudience member. Thank you!\nThe President. You know, here at this post, you are part of a tradition of service that stretches back nearly a hundred years. Doughboys marched off to World War I from this facility. You trained our soldiers for World War II, Korea, Vietnam, every conflict since. So as you prepare to celebrate your centennial next year, I'm just going to jump the gun and go ahead and say, Fort Lee, happy 100th birthday.\nAnd this is also a chance for me to pay tribute to the vital work that you're doing every single day. You don't always get the glory, but the fact is, America's Army and America's military could not project around the world, would not be the very best in the world if it were not for the best sustainment personnel in the world. There's an old saying, \"Amateurs talk about tactics, professionals talk about logistics.\"\nSo today we salute all the logistics personnel. You make sure our troops get what they need: the right amount and the right place at the right time. We salute the Transportation Corps, keeping our supply lines open and, at times, risking your lives doing it. We salute the folks who handle the ordnance, a line of work where you need some steady hands—don't drop nothing. [Laughter] We salute all the quartermasters, including our Army cooks. I know sometimes military food gets a bad rap, but here at Fort Lee, the cooks train to be world class. Some are so good—like Army Staff Sergeant Justin Gonzalez and Navy Master Chief Derrick Davenport—that we made them part of the Presidential Food Service. And you know we've got good food in the White House. [Laughter] And that's because we've got outstanding talent that's been trained here.\nAnd this brings me to the main message I want to deliver. I've now served as your President for almost 8 years. And it gets me and Michelle reflecting on some of the unforgettable moments that we've experienced. And we've done a lot of amazing stuff, but I will tell you that of all the privileges of this office, there's been no greater privilege, no greater honor than serving as the Commander in Chief of the finest military in the history of the world.\nAnd what makes you best, it's not just the incredible platforms that give us our military superiority, although we've got some pretty impressive equipment on display right here. It's not the sophisticated technologies that make us the most advanced military. We have the strongest military because we've got the best people. Because of your spirit, because of your character, because of your patriotism. So you inspire me and Michelle and the American people. And not just as Commander in Chief, but as an American citizen, I just want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart. Thank you for the great work you do.\nThanks for your patriotism. Many of you had a lot of options, and you chose a career that's not always the most comfortable, certainly is not always the most lucrative. But you've dedicated yourself to something bigger than yourself. You chose a life of service. You stepped forward. You volunteered, and most of you volunteered in a time of war. You raised your hand, and you took an oath to defend and protect the country that you love.\nAnd so I want to thank you for your devotion. In these 15 years since 9/11, our Nation has asked a lot of this generation. Among you are proud veterans of Afghanistan and Iraq. Many of you have served multiple tours. You've done your duty, again and again. You've helped deal deadly blows to those who would threaten us. You've helped prevent attacks and threats to our homeland. You're helping us to destroy ISIL, and we will destroy them. You're keeping us safe. You've earned your place among the greatest of generations.\nNow, I believe that America's commitment now to our troops and our veterans is a sacred covenant that we have to keep. There's no more solemn request than to ask somebody to risk their lives on your behalf. And if they do that, that's a covenant. Both sides have responsibilities. You took an oath to defend us; the rest of us need to fulfill our oath to take care of you and your families—especially our Gold Star families—and that means using our military wisely. It means not rushing into war, but doing what's necessary to keep us safe. It means not playing politics with war. It means giving you the resources and the support that you need to succeed. It means when you come home, you and your families are getting the education and the benefits that you have earned.\nSo we've got obligations to you. And this is not just a job for government. As you know, Michelle and Dr. Jill Biden have done a great job with Joining Forces to make sure that everybody is doing something to support our veterans and our military families. And that's something that Michelle and I, we've pledged we're going to continue even after we leave office.\nAnd finally, I want to thank you for setting a good example for everybody else. Sometimes, especially during election season, the country seems divided. But the truth of the matter is, when you look out at this group of members of our military, but it's true on every base around the world, you're unified in your mission. You do your job. You look out for each other. You lift each other up. You leave nobody behind. And you remind us, we're one team, and we're one people, and we're one Nation, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. That's what you stand for. So thank you for your sacrifice, but also thank you for reminding the rest of the country what patriotism really means.\nGod bless you. God bless the United States of America. Thank you, everybody.", "timestamp": "2016-09-28", "title": "Remarks to United States Troops at Fort Lee, Virginia"}

During National Arts and Humanities Month, we celebrate the important role the arts and humanities have played in shaping the American narrative.\nOur achievements as a society and a culture go hand-in-hand. The arts embody who we are as a people and have long helped drive the success of our country. They provoke thought and encourage our citizenry to reach new heights in creativity and innovation; they lift up our identities, connecting what is most profound within us to our collective human experiences.\nIn seeking to break down barriers and challenge our assumptions, we must continue promoting and prioritizing the arts and humanities, especially for our young people. In many ways, the arts and humanities reflect our national soul. They are central to who we are as Americans—as dreamers and storytellers, creators and visionaries. By investing in the arts, we can chart a course for the future in which the threads of our common humanity are bound together with creative empathy and openness. When we engage with the arts, we instill principles that, at their core, make us truer to ourselves.\nThis month, we acknowledge all those who have proudly and passionately dedicated their lives to these diverse, beautiful, and often challenging forms of expression. In our increasingly global economy, we recognize the power of the arts and humanities to connect people around the world. Be it through the pen of a poet, the voice of a singer, or the canvas of a painter, let us continue to harness the unparalleled ways the arts and humanities bring people together.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2016 as National Arts and Humanities Month. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs to celebrate the arts and the humanities in America.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-09-28", "title": "Proclamation 9505—National Arts and Humanities Month, 2016"}

The armed conflict ended in 2003, and TPS ended effective October 1, 2007. President Bush then deferred the enforced departure of those Liberians originally granted TPS. I extended that grant of Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) to September 30, 2016. I have determined that there are compelling foreign policy reasons to again extend DED to those Liberians presently residing in the United States under the existing grant of DED.\nPursuant to my constitutional authority to conduct the foreign relations of the United States, I have determined that it is in the foreign policy interest of the United States to defer for 18 months the removal of any Liberian national, or person without nationality who last habitually resided in Liberia, who is present in the United States and who is under a grant of DED as of September 30, 2011. The grant of DED only applies to an individual who has continuously resided in the United States since October 1, 2002, except for Liberian nationals, or persons without nationality who last habitually resided in Liberia:\n(1) who are ineligible for TPS for the reasons provided in section 244(c)(2)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1254a(c)(2)(B);\n(2) whose removal you determine is in the interest of the United States;\n(3) whose presence or activities in the United States the Secretary of State has reasonable grounds to believe would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States;\n(4) who have voluntarily returned to Liberia or their country of last habitual residence outside the United States;\n(5) who were deported, excluded, or removed prior to the date of this memorandum; or\n(6) who are subject to extradition.\nAccordingly, I direct you to take the necessary steps to implement for eligible Liberians:\n(1) a deferral of enforced departure from the United States for 18 months from October 1, 2016; and\n(2) authorization for employment for 18 months from October 1, 2016.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-09-28", "title": "Memorandum on Deferred Enforced Departure for Liberians"}

Secretary Clinton was introduced by Windsor Heights resident, Janelle Turner.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119149", "text": "\"Thank you! Thank you all so much. Wow! I am so happy to be back here in Iowa on a beautiful fall day to see all of you. And I especially want to thank Janelle for her intro-duction. And I so appreciate that Janelle and Nora and her husband Stu are here today. I remember so well when I met her back in 2015, and I saw that sign. And my best friend from sixth grade was also going through breast cancer and being treated. And when I saw Janelle's sign, it just made me think about my friend, and I wanted to go over and meet this woman who had been through 13 chemo treatments already. And we just clicked. And I have been so grateful to be able to get to know her better and spend time with her when I see her. And I got to introduce her to my best friend when my best friend came to Iowa. So the circle is completed, and more people are reaching out and finding ways to help each other.\nNow, before I came out, I had the great, great privilege of saying hello to someone, Ruline Steininger, who is – is Ruline still here? I know she was going to try to stay. There she is. Hello, Ruline! Hello, Ruline! Ruline is a 103-year-old resident of Pleasant Hill who was born in 1913. I am so grateful for her support, and I don't know if any of you have seen the videos, both about Janelle and about Ruline. But I really do recommend that you see them both. Ruline talks about this long, active life that she's had and everything she has seen happen in America and the world. And I think it's important to have that perspective. So it's a great honor to have Ruline supporting me. I am so pleased. And she's going to go vote early today to make sure her vote counts.\nI want to thank Dr. Andy McGuire for chairing the Iowa Democratic Party, fighting so hard to elect Democrats. And I want to lift up and thank our Democratic Senate candidate, Patty Judge. Where's Patty? Patty's out there fighting hard every single day, and she can use your help to make a strong case for her to go to the Senate. And Jim Mowrer, the 3rd District congressional candidate. Jim is running a great campaign, and we are really looking forward to having him in Washington. But that really depends upon everybody here and everybody across the great state of Iowa.\nNow, while we're meeting on this beautiful day here in Des Moines, I know our friends in Cedar Rapids and the region are once again facing the potential of flooding. I talked with the mayor. I talked with city council members and other leaders over the last day or so. They hope that they will not have the flooding. They took a lot of good precautionary measures. Our campaign, along with thousands of people, came out and helped to put the sandbags in to try to prevent flooding. And I told them that if I'm so fortunate enough as to be president, we're going to have a big infrastructure program, and we're going to help prevent flooding in places like Cedar Rapids.\nNow, I also just want to say on a personal note I was terribly upset this morning to learn about a train crash in New Jersey. That's very personal to me. I live in New York. People commute into New York from New Jersey. We had about a hundred commuters injured and one died. I just want to send our thoughts and prayers to them because it's a horrible accident that ran into the depot and caused all kinds of damage. So I want to lift up the people of New Jersey and New York today.\nNow, we are starting to vote in Iowa today! And I saw my good friend Ruth Harkin, and she told me she was the first person in line to vote today. And we have, what, 40 days, 39 days, left. And each and every one of you have the chance to make sure that we keep our country on the right path. We have 40 days to win an election that's going to affect the next 40 years of our country. And you, every one of you, can make the difference in this election.\nNow, how many of you participated in the caucuses? Well, we've got a bunch of active Iowans here. Are you ready to go to the polls? Well, luckily, in Iowa you can start today. Lots of folks don't have that opportunity across the country. And a lot of our campaign volunteers are going to direct people right from this rally to early voting sites. We've got one right down the street. So when you finish here, you can go vote. And we can be on the path to victory here in Iowa.\nAny of you see that debate on Monday night? Well, one down, two to go. Well, I have to tell you, it was an extraordinary experience because I did get to say a few things about the positive agenda that we want to have for our country because I want this election to be about something, not just against somebody. And so I am going to close this campaign the way I started decades ago, fighting for kids and families because it's been the cause of my life. It will be the mission of my presidency because I know from my own experience that strong families are the base of a strong America. And I know from personal experience how important it is to give people the tools they need to make sure that they can go as far as their hard work, their talent, will take them.\nNow, you may have heard me say this. I started talking about this way back in the be-ginning of the campaign here in Iowa. But I was very fortunate. None of us picks our parents. But I really was fortunate. My dad was a Navy veteran, a small businessman, and he worked hard every single day to build a good life to provide financial security, a good, solid, middle class life. And I know how hard he worked because occasionally I'd go down to his print plant where he printed fabrics for draperies. And it was not a very big building. It didn't have any natural life. There were no windows in it. It's what he could afford.\nAnd there were two long tables. And he'd roll out the fabric, and then he would take a silkscreen. Any of you ever seen a silkscreen, an old-fashioned silkscreen? Not far from here there's a wonderful t-shirt store. Right? And they still use silkscreens for some of their printing. So he would take that silkscreen, and he'd put it down, and he would pour the paint in. Then he'd take a squeegee and he'd go across it. And then he'd lift it up, and he'd go all the way down the table. And if there was going to be more than one color, he'd do it all over again. And then when he finished, he would gather it up and put it in his car and he'd go deliver it to the customer who had ordered it.\nThat's how I was raised to think about doing business. You do your best. You enter into a contract or an agreement. Somebody orders your goods or your services. And then they pay you for it. Right? And as I said the other night, one of the things that we have found out is that as his own campaign manager said about him, Donald Trump has built a lot of businesses on the backs of the little guy. Her words. And I have met people who have been the victims of his refusal to honor contracts, to pay what had been bargained for. I just am grateful that my dad never did business with him or somebody like him because we couldn't have survived all that.\nAll that work, and then to be told we're not going to pay you, or maybe we'll pay you 10 cents on the dollar, or 20 cents? That's just wrong. What kind of person does that, takes advantage of dishwashers and painters and architects and glass installers and so many people? We've been looking into the records, and there's a long list of people who have been mistreated. I just don't believe that's the way we're supposed to treat each other in America. And that sure is not the way our president should be treating our citizens in our country.\nNow, my mom had a very different story. My dad's father was a factory worker, but they had a strong family. My mom was abandoned by her parents and then sent to live with grandparents, and they didn't want her. So she was out on her own by the age of 14. She was working as a housemaid and a babysitter. And it may sound harsh, but I will quickly tell you that it was the first time in her young life that she ever was in a family that showed love and respect for each other. So for her, it was a gift.\nAnd then she got another gift. The woman she worked for knew that my mom wanted to go to high school. And so the woman said, 'If you can get up really early and you can get your chores done and get the little kids off to school, you can go to high school. But you'll have to come right back.' That may sound harsh for a 14-year-old, but for my mother it made all the difference. And that's exactly what she did for four years, and most days she had to run – run – to get there. But she didn't care because she wanted to get an education.\nSo when I learned more about my mom's life, I knew that what I wanted to do was to stand up for kids and families, and especially for kids who've been left out or left behind in some way. That's why I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund and learned quickly that kids with disabilities were not in our public schools back then, and we worked to put together a coalition and convince Congress to pass the law, and boy, every day I am so thankful for your former Senator Tom Harkin, who made the rights and opportunities of people with disabilities the centerpiece of his distinguished career.\nSo that's been my mission: How are we going to do more to help kids and families? And so when I talk about the economy – because I think we have three big issues facing us. Number one, we need an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top, right? We need to keep our country safe and we need to lead the world with strong and steady leadership, in accordance with our values. And we need to bring our country together. We have to heal these divides.\nBut when I think about the economy, yes, I want more new, good jobs with rising in-comes. I see my friends from the laborers here. We need to do work that builds our roads, our bridges, our ports, our airports, our tunnels, our water systems, our sewer systems. This is good, honorable work, and boy, do we have a lot of it in America. We are living off the investments that our parents and our grandparents – and sometimes even great-grandparents – made. If we're going to have a competitive economy, we need to be building America again. And we also need to do more advanced manufacturing. And some of the most exciting developments I saw throughout this whole campaign were right here in Iowa. I saw in your community colleges some of the most advanced training that I've seen anywhere in the country. And I met young men and women who were getting credentialed to be able to leave high school to get good jobs as machinists and tool and die makers, and as designers using 3-D printing. I was so impressed. And I think we need to do that across America. And we need to bring technical education back to our high schools. It was a mistake when we took vocational education out of our high schools.\nAnother way that Iowa has influenced and inspired me is what you've done with clean renewable energy. Now, it wasn't a partisan issue in Iowa. It really got a big boost from your wonderful former governor, Tom Vilsack. But it's been continued over the years. And look at the results. Look how much energy you are getting here in Iowa from clean renewable sources, most particularly wind. Right? And look at the number of jobs – it's nearly 10,000 jobs now that are related to that. Plus the renewable fuel standard, which has motivated people to be creative about using biological material and experimenting with cellulosic material. I was in the forefront of moving toward a clean renewable energy future, and I'm excited by that.\nI'm running against someone who thinks climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I know it's real. I believe in science. But I'll tell you what else is real. What's real are the economic opportunities, the new jobs and businesses we're going to create by assuming the responsibility to combat climate change, and the young people of our country are going to lead the way to doing that. Now, we also need to help small businesses. Iowa is filled with small businesses. It should be easier to start one, it shouldn't be so cumbersome to deal with all the multitude of regulations. We're going to try to streamline that process. Being the daughter of a small businessperson, I believe in giving people the chance to have their destinies in their own hands. And we're going to work hard. I want to be a first-class small business president, in honor of my dad, and I'm going to do everything I can to help you get started, and grow small businesses.\nBut while we're growing the economy, we need to make it fairer. And here are a couple of things I want to do. Let's raise the national minimum wage, so people who work full-time are not still in poverty. I've met – you know, two thirds of the people on minimum wage are women – and I've met a lot of minimum-wage workers right here in Iowa and across America. Sometimes they have to take two minimum-wage jobs, because a full-time minimum wage job will earn you $15,000 at the end of a full-time year of work. We also could give the biggest boost to incomes, and particularly family incomes, if we finally guaranteed equal pay for women's work.\nAnd the other thing I want to do is make sure more companies adopt profit-sharing, so if you helped to create the profits, all of you, not just the top executives, will be able to share in those profits. You know, at the debate the other night, one of my well-known supporters, Mark Cuban, was there in the front row. And he really, I think, unsettled my opponent. But I'll tell you, Mark Cuban's a real billionaire who actually uses profit-sharing, and not only while the business is ongoing, but one thing I really appreciate: first business he sold, he shared the profits with all of his employees. 300 employees became millionaires, because they had a boss who rewarded them for the hard work they did to make it a successful company, all together.\nAnd the final point I want to make about this is about family economics. You know, let's tackle the cost of childcare. Between 2000 and 2012, childcare costs went up 25 percent. Incomes barely budged, right? So we're going to increase federal investment, and provide more tax relief to working families, so no parent has to pay more than 10 percent of their income for quality childcare. Now, if you don't have small children or grandchildren right now, you might not realize the cost of childcare in a lot of states is more expensive than tuition at public colleges and universities. A lot of families are just so stressed out.\nThe other thing I want to do is to finally have our country join the rest of the advanced economies, and provide paid family leave, so you can take care of your family members. Now, a lot of people think this is primarily about newborn babies, adopted babies, and of course that's a big part of it. Last year, in Newton, a mom said to me, I'm counting on you to know what it's like trying to take care of a newborn and having to go right back to work. Right?\nThat's a lot of you. There you are. Okay. And I've got to tell you, I hear that all over. When my granddaughter was born and I was in the hospital with my daughter, I was talking to one of the nurses, and I said, so what is your biggest worry? She said, well, my biggest worry is that so many of these new moms have to go right back to work. Right back to work. But it's not just for babies. It's for sick children, sick spouses, elderly members of your family who are having health problems. There is nothing more important than caring for each other. And I will tell you, it is wrong to make it so difficult for American families.\nThe other big expense for family economics is education. Every one of our children deserve good teachers and good schools, no matter what zip code they live in, right? And we also have to make college affordable. Yesterday in New Hampshire, I was with my friend and my former opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders. I am very proud of the campaign that Bernie and I ran. It was a campaign about issues, not insults. And we shared a lot of the same goals, even though we have different ways of getting there. And so after it was over, he and I sat down and we began to hammer out some ideas about what we could do together. And one of them was to make college tuition free for any family whose income is $125,000 or less. And to make it debt-free for everybody else, so that you only pay what you can afford to pay, without going into debt.\nNow, right now, Iowans hold more than $12 billion in outstanding federal student loans. An education should give you a boost, not hold you back. And we're going to offer relief to those of you who already have debt. We have 40 million people who already have student debt in America, 300,000 of them right here in Iowa. We're going to help you refinance. It is outrageous that you can get a home mortgage at 3 percent, a car payment at 2 percent, and I met people in Iowa who were paying 8, 10, 12 percent interest on their student loans. I'll tell you what. I am not going to let the federal government make a profit off of lending money to young people to get their educations.\nAnd college is crucial, but this is not said often enough. Four-year college is not, and should not, be the only path to a good job that supports a middle-class life. So we're going to have real apprenticeships, not the kind where you're told, 'you're fired,' but the kind where you're told, 'you're hired.' We're going to help more people in high school and community college on the job learn a skill.\nSo I'm excited about what we can do together. I know so much of this campaign has been about, you know, whatever my opponent says, and who he attacks, and who he derides and denigrates. And the list is long. But it's not about that. It's about you. It's about your families and your futures, and each of us should be telling you what we intend to do in the job. Now, I have this old-fashioned idea. I'm asking for your vote. I should tell you what I'm going to do, what my plans are. So Tim Kane and I have actually put out this little paperback book. And I see somebody holding one in the front row. It's called, not surprisingly, 'Stronger Together.' You can pick it up at a bookstore or an airport, wherever they sell paperbacks. And you can see what we're trying to do, and where we're going to get the money to pay for it. And the simple answer to that is, we're going to make the wealthy and corporations finally pay their fair share to support America.\nNow, my friends, my opponent has a very different vision for America. He actually bragged about gaming the system to get out of paying his fair share in taxes, maybe not paying any taxes at all. And what I really find so disturbing about this is he spends all of his time just dumping on America. Calling us a third world country. Saying our military is a disaster. That everything about America is in bad shape. But then it's probably true, he hasn't paid a penny in federal taxes to actually support our military, or our vets, or our schools, or our roads, or our education systems. He actually is proud of the fact that he lets everybody else pay taxes. He says that makes him smart.\nWell, I'll tell you what, if not paying taxes makes him smart, what does that make the rest of us? My husband and I have put 40 years of our tax returns out into the public. You can go and look at them, and you can see that we've been blessed, and we're grateful for that. But we have paid the highest marginal tax rates, and we are glad we could, because we have both benefited from this great country of ours, and we want to pass that on to the next generation and the one after that.\nDonald Trump is also proud that he rooted for the housing crisis back in 2008 and -9. Think about that. Five million families lost their homes. And he rooted for it because he said he could make money off of it. He even said that it is just business. Well, what kind of person believes that – that throwing people out of their homes, foreclosing on them, destroying the dreams of hardworking people is just business? Well, I'll tell you, that's a person who should never be president because they don't understand the American dream and how hard it is for people to make it.\nSo look, I think after – Thank you. I think after what we saw Monday night, we'll have two more debates to be able to contrast and compare. I have no idea what he's going to say the next time. But you know, I will spend some time preparing for it.\nBut we can't do any of the things that I just talked about or anything that you see in our book without your help. The future of our country, the future of our economy and the future of our society will be on the ballot. It breaks my heart to see all the mean-spirited, divisive, bigoted things that are being said in our country. We can have our differences, for heaven sakes. We're Americans; that's in our DNA. But we should respect one another. We should listen to one another. That's the way we're going to get things done together.\nAnd so I want you to join this campaign. The election will be close, but we can win Iowa and we're going to win on November 8th. So if you can, text 'Join,' J-o-i-n, to 47246, or go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to volunteer. If you're not sure if you're registered, see these signs, 'I Will Vote?' Iwillvote.com. You can go to iwillvote.com, put in your name and your address, to make sure you're registered. Because sometimes people get dropped off the registration lists and they are surprised when they show up to vote that they're not on it. So check that out. And then, vote, and get everybody you know to vote. And I hope that a lot of you will go to vote after today, after this beautiful rally we're having. Because we will prove that we are stronger together. And you know what else we'll prove? We will prove that love trumps hate.\nThank you all very much.\"", "timestamp": "2016-09-29", "title": "Remarks at Cowles Commons in Des Moines, Iowa"}

Her staffers taking the fifth amendment, and her ringleaders getting immunity deals. We're going to call them the FBI Immunity 5. Foreign enemies with easy access to hack her server. Lies to Congress, under oath, about turning over her work-related emails.\nShe and her financial backers will say anything, do anything, lie about anything to keep their grip on power – to keep their control over this country.\nThe American people have had it with years, decades, of Clinton Corruption and scandals. They are tired of the lies, they are tired of the trivial politics, they are tired of being talked down to, looked down upon, and treated like second class citizens.\nThe Clintons are the sordid past.\nWe are the bright future.\nWhile our campaign outlines big changes and bold solutions to make your life better, the Clinton campaign focuses only on small and petty distractions.\nThis will be the year the American people say: Enough is enough.\nHillary Clinton has been a disaster for so many communities, but especially for African-American communities. I don't think African-Americans are going to come out and vote for Clinton – they are too smart, and they know they are being used. They also know that she'll do nothing for them once the election is over – she never does, and that will never change. Many of them will never forget her calling young African-American men \"super-predators.\"\nSame thing goes for Hispanic voters – they are tired of being used by people like Hillary Clinton, that have no intention of doing anything for them once the election is over.\nA Trump Administration will bring prosperity to all of our people.\nMy economic agenda can be summed up with three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.\nWe are going to pass the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan, and we are going to lower the business rate from 35% to 15% -- making America into a magnet for new jobs.\nEvery wasteful and unnecessary regulation will be eliminated, along with every illegal executive order.\nWe will unleash the power of American energy – we are sitting on $50 trillion dollars in untapped energy reserves, and we are going to put that wealth into the pockets of the American people.\nCommon core will be ended, and disadvantaged children will be allowed to attend the school of their choice.\nThe catastrophe known as Obamacare will be repealed and replaced.\nAnd the disastrous trade deals, like NAFTA, that have caused so much pain in New Hampshire, will be renegotiated.\nNAFTA was signed by Bill Clinton, and supported by Hillary Clinton – and your state has lost 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since it was approved. You've lost 1 in 4 since China entered the World Trade Organization – another Bill and Hillary-backed deal.\nHillary Clinton has been on the wrong side of every major trade deal in her career and, if she gets the chance, she would approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership – which would destroy manufacturing in this state.\nHillary Clinton is merely a vessel for the special interests trying to strip this country of its wealth, its jobs, and its status as a sovereign nation. She is a globalist who has made a career taking jobs from our country and giving them to other countries.\nI am not running to be President of the World. I am running to be President of the United States of America.\nFrom now on, it's going to be America First.\nHave you ever wondered why it is that all things that the American people want never seem to happen?\nThink about it. For how many years have the American people asked for our tax code to be fixed? Or for our infrastructure to be repaired? Or for the waste to be removed from the budget? For how many years have voters pleaded for secure borders, fair trade deals, and quality schools that serve parents and students?\nAll the things you've ever wanted for your country have been denied.\nThe reason for this is simple. It's because the financial interests who control our politics and our media don't want these changes to happen.\nThese special interests control Hillary Clinton. She is their chosen representative.\nShe's been there for 30 years, and has never done anything for you and your family.\nShe's there for only one reason, to protect her donors and collect their money.\nOur campaign is taking on big business, big media and big donors – we're taking them on for YOU. So you can have the future you want.\nThat includes keeping your family safe.\nNew FBI statistics shows that homicide rose 15% last year in America's large cities, and that it's the largest single-year increase in 45 years.\nMore than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January.\nThe failed politicians and the arrogant media don't want me to talk about the crime and the violence that is happening in our country. They just want me to go along with the status quo.\nWell, I have news for the people trying to silence me, and trying to silence all of us.\nWe will never back down from fighting to save American lives.\nThat also means keeping our nation safe from Radical Islamic Terrorism. Hillary Clinton can't even say the words.\nWe are also going to keep our country safe from drugs. New Hampshire has suffered so greatly from the heroin crisis and the drugs pouring across our border. The rate of heroin overdoses has nearly quadrupled – once again, our politicians have tragically failed this country and its people.\nI am going to stop the drugs from pouring across our border – that is a promise.\nThe people getting rich off the rigged system are the people throwing their money at Hillary Clinton.\nOur campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives.\nThey're all part of the same corrupt political establishment. And they nod along when Hillary Clinton slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable.\nI call you hardworking American Patriots and together we are going to save this country.\nTogether, we can accomplish anything we want.\nBut that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th.\nYou have to knock on doors. You have to pick up that phone. You have to campaign on the streets. Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country. To beat the system, you have to lift your voice, pound the pavement, and get out the vote. Visit our website to find out how you can help.\nYou have 40 days until the election. You have 40 days to make every dream you ever dreamed for your country come true.\nDo Not Let This Chance Slip Away.\nYou have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this nation.\nThe arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.\nOn November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back – Bigger and Better and Stronger than ever before.\nHere is just some of the great things that will happen for your country:\nWe are going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare more affordable; bring back our manufacturing jobs; keep Radical Islamic terrorists out of our country; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\nWe will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.\nAmerican cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.\nAmerican steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.\nAmerican hands will rebuild this nation – and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.\nWe will put new American steel into the spine of this country.\nI will fight for every neglected part of this nation – and I will fight to bring us all together as Americans.\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\nIt is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.\nOnce more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.\nWe Will Make America Wealthy Again.\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\nThank you, and God Bless!", "timestamp": "2016-09-29", "title": "Remarks at a Rally at the New Hampshire Sportsplex in Bedford, New Hampshire"}

But the company did not spend the money directly. Instead, with Trump's knowledge, executives funneled the cash for the Cuba trip through an American consulting firm called Seven Arrows Investment and Development Corp. Once the business consultants traveled to the island and incurred the expenses for the venture, Seven Arrows instructed senior officers with Trump's company—then called Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts—how to make it appear legal by linking it after the fact to a charitable effort.\nThe payment by Trump Hotels came just before the New York business mogul launched his first bid for the White House, seeking the nomination of the Reform Party. On his first day of the campaign, he traveled to Miami, where he spoke to a group of Cuban-Americans, a critical voting bloc in the swing state. Trump vowed to maintain the embargo and never spend his or his companies' money in Cuba until Fidel Castro was removed from power.\nHe did not disclose that, seven months earlier, Trump Hotels already had reimbursed its consultants for the money they spent on their secret business trip to Havana.\nAt the time, Americans traveling to Cuba had to receive specific U.S. government permission, which was granted only for an extremely limited number of purposes, such as humanitarian efforts. Neither an American nor a company based in the United States could spend any cash in Cuba; instead, a foreign charity or similar sponsoring entity needed to pay all expenses, including travel. Without obtaining a license from the federal Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) before the consultants went to Cuba, the undertaking by Trump Hotels would have been in violation of federal law, trade experts say.\nOfficials with the Trump campaign and the Trump Organization did not respond to emails seeking comment on the Cuba trip, further documentation about the endeavor or an interview with Trump. Richard Fields, who was then the principal in charge of Seven Arrows, did not return calls seeking comment.\nBut a former Trump executive who spoke on condition of anonymity says the company did not obtain a government license prior to the trip. Internal documents show that executives involved in the Cuba project were still discussing the need for federal approval after the trip had taken place.\nOFAC officials say there is no record that the agency granted any such license to the companies or individuals involved, although they cautioned that some documents from that time have been destroyed. Yet one OFAC official, who agreed to discuss approval procedures if granted anonymity, says the probability that the office would grant a license for work on behalf of an American casino is \"essentially zero.\"\n'He's a Murderer'\nPrior to the Cuban trip, several European companies reached out to Trump about potentially investing together on the island through Trump Hotels, according to the former Trump executive. At the time, a bipartisan group of senators, three former secretaries of state and other former officials were urging then-President Bill Clinton to review America's Cuba policy, in hopes of eventually ending the decades-long embargo.\nThe goal of the Cuba trip, the former Trump executive says, was to give Trump's company a foothold should Washington loosen or lift the trade restrictions. While in Cuba, the Trump representatives met with government officials, bankers and other business leaders to explore possible opportunities for the casino company. The former executive says Trump had participated in discussions about the Cuba trip and knew it had taken place.\nThe fact that Seven Arrows spent the money and then received reimbursement from Trump Hotels does not mitigate any potential corporate liability for violating the Cuban embargo. \"The money that the Trump company paid to the consultant is money that a Cuban national has an interest in and was spent on an understanding it would be reimbursed,'' says Richard Matheny, chair of Goodwin's national security and foreign trade regulation group, based on a description of the events byNewsweek. \"That would be illegal. If OFAC discovered this and found there was evidence of willful misconduct, they could have made a referral to the Department of Justice.\"\nShortly after Trump Hotels reimbursed Seven Arrows, the two companies parted ways. Within months, Trump formed a presidential exploratory committee. He soon decided to seek the nomination of the Reform Party, which was founded by billionaire Ross Perot after his unsuccessful 1992 bid for the White House.\nTrump launched his presidential campaign in Miami in November 1999. There, at a luncheon hosted by the Cuban American National Foundation, an organization of Cuban exiles, he proclaimed he wanted to maintain the American embargo and would not spend any money in Cuba so long as Fidel Castro remained in power. At the time, disclosing that his company had just spent money on the Cuba trip, or even acknowledging an interest in loosening the embargo, would have ruined Trump's chances in Florida, a critical electoral state where large numbers of Cuban-Americans remain virulently opposed to the regime.\n\"As you know—and the people in this room know better than anyone—putting money and investing money in Cuba right now doesn't go to the people of Cuba,'' Trump told the crowd. \"It goes to Fidel Castro. He's a murderer. He's a killer. He's a bad guy in every respect, and, frankly, the embargo must stand if for no other reason than, if it does stand, he will come down.\"\n'Its Stock Price Had Collapsed'By the time Trump gave that speech, 36 years had passed since the Treasury Department in the Kennedy administration imposed the embargo. The rules prohibited any American person or company—even those with operations in other foreign countries—from engaging in financial transactions with any person or entity in Cuba. The lone exceptions: humanitarian efforts and telecommunications exports.\nThe impact of the embargo intensified in 1991, when the collapse of the Soviet Union ended its oil subsidies to the island and triggered a broad economic collapse. By 1993, Cuba faced extreme shortages, and Castro was forced to start printing money solely to cover government deficits. Three years later, the U.S. Congress passed the Helms-Burton Act, which codified the embargo into law and worsened Cuba's economic decline. With many financial options closed off, Cuba attempted to find overseas investment to modernize its tourism industry and other businesses.\nThe first signs that American policy might be shifting came in March 1998, when President Bill Clinton announced several major changes. Among them: resuming charter flights between the United States and Cuba for authorized Americans, streamlining procedures for exporting medical equipment and allowing Cubans in the U.S. to send small amounts of cash to their relatives on the island. However, Americans and American companies still could not legally spend their own money in Cuba.\nThat fall, as critics pressured Clinton to further loosen the embargo, Trump Hotels saw an opportunity. Like the Communist regime, the company was struggling, having piled up losses for years. In 1998 alone, Trump Hotels lost $39.7 million, according to the company's financial filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Its stock price had collapsed, falling almost 80 percent from a high that year of $12 a share to a low of just $2.75. (After multiple bankruptcies, Trump severed his ties with the company; it is now called Trump Entertainment Resorts and is a subsidiary of Icahn Enterprises, run by renowned financier Carl Icahn.)\nThe company was desperate to find partners for new business that offered the chance to increase profits, according to another former Trump executive who spoke on condition of anonymity. The hotel and casino company assigned Seven Arrows, which had been working with Trump for several years, to develop such opportunities, including the one in Cuba.\nOn February 8, 1999, months after the consultants traveled to the island, Seven Arrows submitted a bill to Trump Hotels for the $68,551.88 it had \"incurred prior to and including a trip to Cuba on behalf of Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts Inc.\"\nThe 1999 document also makes clear that executives were still discussing the legal requirements for such a trip after the consultants had already returned from Cuba. The government does not provide after-the-fact licenses.\n\"Under current law trips of the sort Mr. Fields took to Cuba must be sanctioned not only by the White House but are technically on behalf of a charity,'' the bill submitted to Trump Hotels says. \"The one most commonly used is Carinas Cuba.\"\nThe instructions contain two errors. First, while OFAC is part of the executive branch, the White House itself does not provide licenses for business dealings in Cuba. Second, the correct name of the charity is Caritas Cuba, a group formed in 1991 by the Catholic Church, which provides services for the elderly, children and other vulnerable populations in the Caribbean nation. Caritas Cuba did not respond to emails about contacts it may have had with Trump Hotels, Seven Arrows or any individuals associated with them.\nThe invoice from Seven Arrows was submitted to John Burke, who was then the corporate treasurer of Trump Hotels. In a lawsuit on a different legal issue, Burke testified that Trump Hotels paid the bill in full, although he denied recognizing the document.\n'Totally False'The Cuba venture was one of two assignments given to Seven Arrows at that time, and the second has already emerged as an issue in the GOP nominee's bid for the presidency. Trump Hotels also paid the consulting firm to help develop a deal with the Seminole tribe of Florida to partner in a casino there. Knowing that the Florida Legislature and governor opposed casino gambling in the state, Trump authorized developing a strategy to win over politicians to get the laws changed in an effort named \"Gambling Project.\" The law firm of Greenberg Traurig was retained to assemble the strategy. A copy of the plan prepared by the lawyers showed the strategy involved hiring multiple consultants, lobbyists and media relations firms to persuade the governor and the legislature to allow casino gambling in the state. The key to possible success? Campaign contributions.\nThe plan states \"the executive and legislative branches of Florida government are driven by many influences, the most meaningful of which lies in campaign giving.\" For the legislature, it recommends giving to \"leadership accounts\" maintained by state political parties, rather than to individual lawmakers, because \"this is where the big bucks go and the real influence is negotiated.\" Records show Seven Arrows also incurred $38,996.32 on its work on the Gaming Project, far less than it spent for the Cuba endeavor.\nAside from deceiving Cuban-Americans, records of the 1998 initiatives show that Trump lied to voters about his efforts in Florida during that period. At the second Republican presidential debate in September 2015, one of Trump's rivals, Jeb Bush, said the billionaire had tried to buy him off with favors and contributions when he was Florida's governor in an effort to legalize casino gaming in the state. \"Totally false,'' Trump responded. \"I would have gotten it.\"\nThe documents obtained by Newsweek give no indication why the $39,000 spent on Seven Arrows' primary assignment—arranging for a casino deal with the Seminole tribe—was so much less than the $68,000 expended on the Cuba effort. The former Trump executive could not offer any explanation for the disparity.\nThough it has long been illegal for corporations to spend money in Cuba without proper authorization, there is no chance that Trump, the company or any of its executives will be prosecuted for wrongdoing. The statute of limitations ran out long ago, and legal analysts say OFAC's enforcement division is understaffed, so the chances for an investigation were slim even at the time.\nAnd perhaps that was the calculation behind the company's decision to flout the law: the low risk of getting caught versus the high reward of lining up Cuban allies if the U.S. loosened or dropped the embargo. The only catch: What would happen if Trump's Cuban-American supporters ever found out?", "timestamp": "2016-09-29", "title": "Statement from Jake Sullivan on Trump's Reported Violation of the U.S. Embargo Against Cuba"}

I trust you all had an opportunity to hear the President talk about the remarkable accomplishments of our Olympic and Paralympic teams this summer. The President obviously enjoyed the event. Hopefully all of you did, too.\nBefore we get started today, I'm going to turn the podium over to the United States Secretary of Education, John King. Secretary King is here to talk about a couple of important initiatives that are being advanced by the Obama administration, including some steps that his agency is taking to streamline the process of middle-class families and students who are applying for financial aid for college.\nThose of you who are close watchers of the President's schedule know that he had planned to speak at a local high school to discuss some of these efforts. We have obviously had to pull down those events because the President is traveling to Israel and departing here shortly. But we are obviously moving forward with the implementation of some of this policy, so we brought Secretary King here to talk about it.\nSo he'll make some opening remarks here for a few minutes, and then he'll take whatever questions you may have. Then we'll let him go and we'll get on to the regularly scheduled program here.\nSecretary King.\nSECRETARY KING: Thanks, Josh. And thank you all for letting me join you today. Saturday, October 1st, is a big day for America's students. Last year, the President announced that for the first time ever, the free application for federal student aid -- or FAFSA -- will be available on October 1st. Together with the College Scorecard, these changes to the FAFSA will help provide better information to families earlier to inform their decisions about where to go to college and also how they'll be able to afford college.\nThese changes also mean accessing financial aid for a good-value school will be easier and faster because students will be able to populate the FAFSA with information directly from their 2015 tax return, information that the IRS has already verified.\nSaturday's launch is the latest in a series of steps the administration has taken to make filling out the FAFSA faster and easier than ever before. Since the President took office there have been more than 160 million FAFSAs completed, most by first-generation and low-income students, students for whom financial aid can be the difference between earning a college degree or not. And we've slashed the average FAFSA completion time nearly in half.\nWe're continue to build on these efforts. Next year it will be easier to sign up for the FSA ID student's financial aid account, and the FAFSA will direct students to information in the College Scorecard. We're also pleased that third parties around the country continue to use Scorecard data to create their own products to help students and families navigate the college choice process. Just today, Google announced that it would put information like graduation rates and future earnings front and center in their search results.\nThese critical steps have helped open the door to a college education for millions of Americans. But they're just one piece of the administration's long track record of fighting to expand educational opportunity for Americans of all ages. When President Obama took office, at the depth of the Great Recession, he recognized the need to not only stop the bleeding and rebuild the economy for the short term, but to invest in the long term through education. He started by saving hundreds of thousands of teacher and educator jobs. But he also knew that preserving America's dream -- the American Dream -- and ensuring our nation's future success depends on having educational opportunity for all.\nThat's why the Recovery Act also included programs like Investing in Innovation, Race to the Top, and strengthening Pell grants to spur innovation, raise expectations and improve access to world-class education for students of all ages.\nNearly eight years later, opportunity has expanded at every level of our education system, starting with our youngest learners. Since the President called for preschool for all in 2013, states have invested more than $1.5 billion in increasing access to high-quality early learning. And more than 30 states across the country have increased the percentage of their four-year-olds in preschool since the President took office.\nWhen you look across the country, it's clear that this issue of early learning is an issue that has bipartisan momentum, at least outside the Beltway.\nAt the K-12 level, nearly every state in the country has raised its standards to prepare students for success in college and careers. And thanks to the President's ConnectED initiative, 20 million more students have access to high-speed Internet in school. High school graduation rates are at an all-time high. Dropout rates have hit a record low. We've nearly halved the number of dropout factories -- high schools where less than 60 percent of students graduate on time. And the dropout rate among Hispanic students is nearly half what it was when President Obama took office, and we've cut the African American dropout rate by a third.\nAnd after years of working to fix No Child Left Behind, the administration's priorities were enshrined in law when the President signed the Every Student Succeeds Act last winter. That new law includes a commitment to high-quality preschool, college and career-ready standards, support for struggling schools and high schools with high dropout rates, competitive programs like Investing in Innovation and Promise Neighborhoods, and various other core administration priorities that will now live on for years to come.\nThe administration has also made historic investments to keep college affordable for hardworking students and families, ending wasteful subsidies for banks and giving tens of millions back -- tens of billions back to students. Pell grants are more generous and are helping more students. The American Opportunity Tax Credit is cutting taxes for millions of families who are trying to afford college each year.\nAnd since President Obama unveiled America's College Promise last year, more than a few dozen free community college programs have launched in states, cities and schools across the country -- from Oregon and Minnesota to Texas and Kentucky.\nThe President has also made a number of proposals focused on college completion -- because we know even as we grapple with issues of access and affordability, ensuring that students who start college actually finish is critical to ensuring that they are able to manage their debt. The President has proposed expanding Pell grants into the summer, through year-round Pell, which would help students stay on track to graduation. The President has proposed incentives for students to take at least 15 credits per semester so they stay on track to on-time graduation. And the President has proposed institutional incentives, a bonus for higher ed institutions if they enroll significant numbers of Pell students and get them through to graduation.\nThere's no question that much work remains. For too many of our students, especially our students of color, our low-income students, our English learners, our students with disabilities -- we've not yet fulfilled the promise of equal opportunity for all. But as you look across the country and look at the past eight years of work, there's no question that we're closer today than when we began eight years ago.\nSo with that, happy to take questions.\nQ: Just looking at reports that have been done in the last eight years, what do you think the next administration does have to address? Is it going to be college cost, double down on that? Is it going to be graduation rates? What's the primary focus?\nSECRETARY KING: Well, the President has some proposals that I think reflect where the country needs to head next in terms of educational improvement. Certainly preschool for all and the vision of trying to ensure that all low-income and middle-income families have access to high-quality preschool is the right investment. We know there's an 8-1, 9-1 return on investment for every dollar invested in early learning.\nThe President's proposal around America's College Promise, the idea that we can today make two years -- at least two years of community college or the first two years at an HBCU or minority serving institution tuition free for all hardworking students I think is a step in the right direction towards expanding access to quality higher education.\nSo those are two places where we should begin. And certainly the next administration will need to be vigilant to ensure that states implement the Every Student Succeeds Act well, with careful attention to issues of equity.\nQ: College student loan debt is still fairly high out there, and the college costs are still -- continue to go up. What can be done to continue to try to -- I mean, increased student financial aid wouldn't be as necessary if college costs could remain more stable.\nSECRETARY KING: Well, one of the biggest drivers of the increasing cost for students and families has been this investment by states in public higher education. If you look across the last 20 years, you see many states where investment levels in public higher education are flat or even going down, and then those costs, of course, are passed along to students and families.\nOne of the things we've tried to do to ensure college affordability and to help people manage their debt is the President's REPAYE effort, where we use income-driven repayment, so that your payment on student debt are capped at about 10 percent of your income. We are seeing that have an effect on the number of folks who are defaulting. It's helping us to bring down the rate of increase in defaults. So we're making progress there. Certainly improving college completion is a part of solving the affordability puzzle. We know that folks that don't finish are dramatically more likely to default on their debt.\nQ: Weeks ago, a federal judge in Texas issued an injunction against the administration's guidance prohibiting discrimination against transgender students in schools. There's going to be a hearing tomorrow in that court clarifying the scope of the injunction, but to what extent has it hampered the Department of Education's ability Title IX as of now?\nSECRETARY KING: Well, at the end of the day, all schools have a responsibility to make sure that school environments are safe and supportive for all students, and all schools have a responsibility to follow the law. Ultimately, we know that Title IX protects both sex and gender identity, and we look forward to moving this issue forward across the country and continuing to support school districts and states in putting in place smart policies to protect the safety of all of their students, and to make school a place where kids feel comfortable.\nUltimately, what led us to issue the guidance in the first place was a request from educators across the country for guidance to help them help their students -- help their students feel safe and comfortable in schools and on higher education campuses.\nQ: But has there been any problems as a result of that injunction thus far?\nSECRETARY KING: Well, again -- I don't want to get into the specifics of the issues that will be argued in court shortly. But I will say, if you look across the country, there are states and districts that are continuing to do the right thing for students and an increasing number of states and districts that are putting in place systems that help keep students safe and make school a place where they feel comfortable.\nQ: Are you confident that the administration's view will prevail in the legal system and the court system?\nSECRETARY KING: Yes.\nQ: On this goal of preschool for all -- what percentage of students now do not get preschool? And do you have a metric for where the Obama administration has moved that number either up or down? And similarly, on this issue of college aid, maybe there's not a number for it, but what typically is an income level where a family can expect to get a significant amount of aid or a full ride, or however you measure it, and has that number gone up or down in terms of income during the last seven years?\nSECRETARY KING: Yes -- on the first question, about 40 percent of low-and-middle-income students across the country are enrolled in public preschool programs. We would certainly like to see that number increase.\nThe most specific thing we've done around the number of seats -- quality seats in preschool is the President's Preschool Development Grants program, which is about $250 million that goes each year to 18 states to add seats. And that's added, I think roughly 35,000 seats this schoolyear in preschool. So we are moving forward. There are about 30 states that increased their state investment in preschool. That's also helping to add seats. But the President's Preschool For All proposal is really about making sure that there's universal access for low-and-middle-income families.\nOn the question of college aid, for a family with a dependent child, I think the typical level at which they're eligible for Pell grants, which is the federal grants around college aid, is about $60,000 in income. I think the average Pell recipient family is probably around $30,000, and the Pell grant is just under $6,000, about $5,800 this year.\nQ: Has the administration, do you think, lowered that number, in other words, increased access by -- what?\nSECRETARY KING: We can get you a more specific number, but we've increased access in two ways. One, by increasing the amount of Pell dollars, the amount of the Pell grant, by about $1,000 since the beginning of the administration. So folks who are eligible are getting more funding. But then the American Opportunity Tax Credit is also helping thousands of families across the country -- millions of families across the country to better afford college.\nQ: I wanted to ask you about a statement from Senator Warren today. She says -- it has to do with students who attended the Corinthian Colleges. Her staff did an investigation and found that the department is still intentionally trying to collect student loan debt from these students, and she's asking that you stop that, even though the debt that these students have is eligible to be forgiven.\nSECRETARY KING: So, first, I appreciate Senator Warren's leadership on behalf of students and borrowers, and she's been a good partner to the administration on many efforts to try to help our borrowers.\nWe, of course, are committed to making sure that we get good information to Corinthian borrowers about their options. Folks who were Corinthian students have the option to seek closed-school discharge, where they give up their credits but they receive funding if they went to a Corinthian campus that closed. Or they have the option to pursue borrower defense, where they attest that they specifically were taken advantage of by one of the campuses where we have evidence of fraud.\nWe're going to continue to make every effort to reach out to Corinthian borrowers, and we're going to continue to make every effort to ensure that we take aggressive action where there are higher ed institutions that are engaged in predatory behavior. And I think the administration has been clear from the beginning that we're committed to holding higher education institutions accountable for providing a good education to students and protecting taxpayer interests. We're going to keep doing that.\nWithin the 80,000 borrowers that Senator Warren refers to, folks are in different situations. Some are eligible if they seek to apply for closed-school discharge or borrower defense; others would not be. We're going to keep making sure that borrowers know what their options are.\nQ: So the numbers that Senator Warren mentioned in her letter, did those suggest to the department that the system of borrowing (inaudible) on an individual basis isn't working?\nSECRETARY KING: Well, I'd point out again, there are different categories of borrowers. So in terms of closed-school discharge, that is when a school closes, a student can say, I'm not going to use my credits at another institution and I want to discharge my loans.\nUnder the proposed regulations for borrower defense, which we took public comment on and which are being finalized, under those proposed rules, students who are eligible for closed-school discharge and don't apply those credits in another institution for three years then become eligible for automatic discharge.\nThen there's another set of students who would be seeking borrower defense, and that's really about demonstrating that you have have been a victim of fraudulent activity by one of the schools. And there, we believe part of what's required is for students to attest that they actually were defrauded by the institution.\nAnd again, with respect to the 80,000, it's worth pointing out that some of those students attended programs where there were findings of fraud; others did not.\nQ: Are there lessons that the department has taken from the situations with Corinthian and ITT that it can use to avoid something like this in the future?\nSECRETARY KING: Yes, two things I'd point out. One is, we've been very aggressive about reaching out to ITT students to make sure they understand what their options are. We already have nearly 1,000 closed-school discharge applications from ITT students. We've got a partnership with an organization called Beyond12 and the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators that are providing counseling to ITT students about their options to transfer to other schools.\nWe've seen community colleges and state higher education system reach out very aggressively to ITT students to let them know what their options are to help them figure out the next steps in their education.\nSo I think we've learned some lessons about outreach to students quickly when a school closes -- from the Corinthian experience that we're now applying in ITT. The other lesson I think that you see in ITT is that when there are bad-actor institutions, it's important for the department to take clear enforcement actions early. And with ITT, as their behavior did not change, as they made the same bad choices, we took early enforcement action and ultimately decided this summer not to allow them to enroll new students. And the key with federal financial aid -- and the key driver in that decision was knowing that when you have a sinking ship, you shouldn't have other folks come on board that sinking ship. And so then the responsibility was on ITT to determine their appropriate next steps.\nQ: Warren's letter also pointed out that a majority of the 80,000 students hadn't applied for debt relief. So does there need to be more aggressive outreach for the Corinthian students?\nSECRETARY KING: We're certainly going to continue to do outreach, and we'll have an update, actually, later in October on the number of students who have sought either closed-school discharge or borrower defense. The last update we put out I think was in June, and so there will be an update shortly.\nWe've seen a significant uptick in the number of folks applying for borrower defense as we've continued our outreach to students.\nQ: My question is referring to -- about student loan forgiveness, and about students who are graduating more immediately after college. Is there anything being done as far as students who are graduating from college immediately but were already in school before certain programs as far as financial aid, but they might be negatively affected still, although after graduating? Is there anything being done about that?\nSECRETARY KING: You mean generally across campuses, or specifically about ITT?\nQ: Generally across campuses.\nSECRETARY KING: So generally across campuses -- so what we're trying to do is make sure that college students know about their options for how to manage their debt. And I mentioned our income-based repayment approach. There, students can cap how much they pay at 10 percent of their income. And so we're doing a lot of work to make sure students know about that, and we've seen actually a very significant increase in the number of folks who are taking advantage of income-driven repayment over the last few years. So we're now well over I think 5 million folks who are taking advantage of income-driven repayment. We're going to keep doing that work to make sure people know about that options.\nThere is also public service loan forgiveness for students who are in public service careers. And again, we want to make sure that students, as they graduate, and recent graduates know about that option. And so we're working with a number of partners and with other federal agencies to make sure that students have information about both of those options -- income-driven repayment and the public service loan forgiveness.\nQ: Can you speak to the education programs inside of our nation's prisons? Is there a similar trajectory or path in terms of those who are earning their GED or those who are completing transition programs into society after they get out?\nSECRETARY KING: This is a place where we should be doing a lot more as a country. I really appreciate you're asking about it. The evidence is overwhelming that folks who are incarcerated who get access to educational programs while incarcerated are much less likely to return. Actually, RAND did a study that showed a 43 percent reduction in recidivism for folks who participated in any kind of educational program, whether it led to a certificate or not, while in prison.\nWe've launched an initiative called Second Chance Pell, where we're using our flexibility under the Higher Education Act to allow universities to use Pell dollars for folks who are incarcerated. And so, actually on my bus tour a couple weeks ago, I visited one of those programs -- the Limestone Correctional Facility in Harvest, Alabama -- where they're going to use Second Chance Pell dollars to support an expansion of their higher education program with Calhoun College. And what the inmates talked about was the difference they know education will make for their life chances when they leave, but also the difference it will make for their families, for their kids, and ultimately for the community.\nWe've got 69 universities participating in Second Chance Pell. It's going to serve 12,000 students across 28 states.\nUltimately, we think Congress should undo the mistake that was made in the mid '90s. In the mid-'90s, Congress banned access to Pell grants for folks who are incarcerated. That was a mistake. It is consistent with other errors that were made in the mid '90s around mass incarceration. Our Second Chance Pell initiative is a way to use our legal authority under the Higher Education Act to try and reverse some of that. The President has proposed full restoration of Pell for folks who are incarcerated in his 2017 budget. We hope Congress will act on that and see that education is a central part of criminal justice reform, making sure that when folks are incarcerated they have a meaningful chance to gain skills so they can come out of prison and be successful when they return.\nQ: So is it fair to say it's too soon to see results yet regarding that initiative?\nSECRETARY KING: So that just launched this year. We announced it last summer. We had universities apply from all over the country. We saw a lot of demand. We selected 69 universities to participate, and they're just launching now.\nBut we're confident that the evidence will be very clear that those students will be much less likely to return to prison as a result.\nMR. EARNEST: Mr. Secretary, thank you for your time today.\nSECRETARY KING: Thank you. Thanks.\nMR. EARNEST: All right. Certainly satisfying to see somebody with so much passion and expertise be able to apply their skills to benefit the American people. So, appreciate him spending some time with us today.\nBut we can get back to our regularly scheduled programming here. So, Darlene, do you want to get us started?\nQ: Thanks. So a day after overriding the President, Leader McConnell said that the 9/11 may have unintended ramifications, lawmakers will have to discuss fixes. He says the White House was too slow to warn about the \"potential consequences.\" Do you feel like he's trying to shift blame here onto the White House perhaps?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I had a little bit of that impression myself I think. Listen, it's hard to know where to start. I think what we've seen in the United States Congress is a pretty classic case of rapid-onset buyer's remorse. Within minutes of casting their vote to put that bill into law, you had members of the United States Senate -- some 28 of them -- write a letter expressing deep concern about the potential impact of the bill they just passed. The suggestion on the part of some members of the Senate was that they didn't know what they were voting for, that they didn't understand the negative consequences of the bill.\nThat's a hard suggestion to take seriously when you had letters from President Bush's attorney general and national security advisor warning about the consequences of the bill. You had attorneys from our closest allies in Europe expressing their concerns about the impact of the bill. You had a letter from some of America's business leaders, including Chief Executive of GE, Jeffrey Immelt, warning about the potential economic consequences of the bill. You had letters from the Director of the CIA, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Secretary of Defense and the Commander-in-Chief all warning about the potential impact of the bill.\nAll of that communication was made public before Congress cast the first vote to put this bill into law yesterday. So it's hard to take at face value the suggestion that somehow they were unaware of the consequences of their vote. But even if they were, what's true in elementary school is true in the United States Congress -- ignorance is not an excuse, particularly when it comes to our national security, and the safety and security of our diplomats and our servicemembers.\nI'll also say that it's a little hard to take that suggestion seriously when the arguments that are being made in this letter and in the public statements from some members of Congress are precisely the same arguments that senior administration officials have been making for months. We first discussed it in this room back in April. The President was asked about it in a nationally televised interview in April. And the argument that he made in the context of that interview is exactly the same argument that members of Congress are making now. Is that a coincidence? It's a remarkable one if that's what it is.\nWhat it mostly is, is an abject embarrassment. Because I think the American people, and certainly our men and women in uniform -- some of whom the President had the opportunity to meet with yesterday -- expect better service and leadership from the men and women that they elected to represent them in the United States Congress.\nI'll stop there. But I've got more if we want to discuss it further. (Laughter.)\nQ: Do you see the action around this bill -- the voice votes, the override, lawmakers now coming out and saying they didn't know what was in it -- as another example of what people don't like about Washington?\nMR. EARNEST: I think you describe it faithfully as exhibit A in the kind of dysfunction that very poorly serves the country and leaves people very dissatisfied with the United States Congress. It's not a coincidence that the standing of the United States Congress among members of the voting public are at or near historic lows. And an episode like this is not going to improve it.\nQ: Two questions quickly on the President's trip to Jerusalem. Does he have a speaking role at the funeral tomorrow? And then, do you also have names of some of the members of the delegation that are traveling with the President?\nMR. EARNEST: The President has been invited to speak at the service. Those remarks are being written as we speak, so I can't give you much of a detailed preview. But I think the personal nature of the presidential statement that we issued on the night of President Peres's death I think should give you a good indication of the President's thinking as he considers his remarks at this historic moment.\nWith regard to the delegation, we'll have the specific names out shortly. But it includes a number of senior White House officials, a number of members of Congress in both parties, and even some national security officials who don't serve in this administration but served in the previous administration. I think it's a testament to the bipartisan commitment that exists in this country for the strong relationship that the United States enjoys with Israel -- strong alliance, I should say. And I think it's clear that leaders in both parties here in the United States worked closely with President Peres to strengthen that relationship and to strengthen that alliance.\nAnd I think that's evident in the individuals who, on short notice, are rearranging their schedules so that they can be present and pay tribute in person to the life and legacy of Shimon Peres.\nRoberta.\nQ: Back to the 9/11 bill. Senator Corker said that he had tried to find a compromise and wanted to meet with White House officials the weekend -- last weekend before the vote, but that that meeting was declined or turned down by people at the White House. I'm just wondering if you can speak to that at all. Did that happen? Why was it declined or turned down? And what can be done now if there is this remorse, as you describe it? What's the path forward for dealing with some of the concerns that are being expressed?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not going to get into private conversations, but I will make a suggestion to Senator Corker that he get his story straight, because he spent most of the last week suggesting that he hadn't heard from anybody in the administration and now he's suggesting that his repeated request to members of the administration were not given their due attention. I think it's also curious that a number of members of the United States Senate -- including Senator Corker -- would suggest that they voted for a bill that they knew had negative consequences for America's national security because they felt snubbed by the White House. I think our men and women in uniform can expect a lot more than that from the United States Senate.\nQ: I don't know if that's what you're suggesting, or not. I didn't mean to imply that in my question.\nMR. EARNEST: I didn't see his comments today, but --\nQ: Did he reach out for a meeting and was one denied?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what I can tell you is that -- I'm not going to get into that individual conversation, but for a number of days, Senator Corker was suggesting that he had never heard from anybody in the administration. That clearly is not true, I guess now by his own admission. So --\nQ: He's just saying that no one replied to his request, that he wanted to --\nMR. EARNEST: Oh. He's suggesting --\nQ: He reached out, he wanted a meeting, but the people here said no or didn't reply to him -- I'm not sure.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I'm not going to get into the nature of the conversations. What I can tell you is that senior White House officials and senior officials in the administration were in touch directly with Senator Corker and his office about this specific legislation. That much is true. I'm not going to get into the nature of those conversations. But again, I think he's going to have to explain to his constituents why he supported a piece of legislation that he claims to harbor significant concerns about.\nQ: So what can be done now for people who have concerns, or to address some of the concerns the President expressed yesterday? Do you see a path forward?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't know what the path forward is. I know that there are some members of Congress who are interested in trying to clean up the terrible mess that they have made. The President has taken a principled position on this issue from the very beginning, and if there are members of Congress in either party, frankly, that want to join him in that principled position, the President would welcome them to that kind of discussion. But it's awfully late. I'm sure there's a colorful expression that could be used here, but I'll leave that to others who may be more colorful.\nQ: Just a quick follow-up on this -- two things. One, related to what you said on the plane yesterday, can you really not think of anything more embarrassing that the Congress has done in 30 years? And two --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, why don't we start with that, and then we'll get to number two.\nQ: Okay.\nMR. EARNEST: In the last 24 hours I've been reminded of a variety of very embarrassing things that Congress has engaged in in the last couple of years even. We can go through a few of them if you'd like. It's kind of a nice stroll down Memory Lane. We've got the Tortilla Coast gambit --\nQ: -- go through all of them.\nMR. EARNEST: I won't go through all of them. But we've got the Tortilla Coast gambit, which is a real highlight. You've got the leading investigator in the House of Representatives into Secretary Clinton's private email system passing out business cards with a private email address on it. You've got the all-but-anointed House Speaker disclosing on live national television that the Benghazi investigation is motivated to drive down Secretary Clinton's poll ratings. You've got Republicans bringing the United States to the brink of default for the first time in our history, so close to default, in fact, that the credit of the United States was downgraded for the first time.\nSeparate from that, you have one Republican in the United States Senate engineering a government shutdown that lasted for two and a half weeks that didn't actually result in any change in government policy. You've got Republicans who are foursquare against even considering the nomination that the President has put forward of a candidate that they have described as a consensus nominee to the Supreme Court. You've got an individual who is a financial expert who served in Democratic and Republican administrations alike who has been waiting for more than a year to be confirmed by the Senate to serve at the Treasury Department and administer the tough financial sanctions that the United States imposes on countries around the world.\nI could go on, but I'll stop there. All of these are also embarrassing. But you've got to admit that the situation that took place yesterday on the floor of the United States Senate stands out -- to vote for a bill that members of the Senate know would have a negative impact on our national security, and before they even left the well of the United States Senate they've circulated a letter to their colleagues urging them to figure out a way to fix the problem they've just made. That's deeply embarrassing, too.\nQ: Clearly, you were ready for that one. The second is sort of a follow-up to that, which is there might be people that would understand the desire or the impulse to gloat and to call members of Congress kindergarteners and the like, and all of the stuff that you've done in the last 24 hours. But given that you've had them express a desire to fix this in a direction that you guys would like to go, do you think that the kinds of rhetoric that you've offered in the last day has been helpful in some future period of time actually getting these people together and fix it the way you wanted it to be fixed? In other words, that seems like the language you've been using is counterproductive to the extent that you actually would like to take then up on this offer, to say, okay, maybe you're having second thoughts and let's sit down and try to fix it.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I don't think it's fair to say I've been gloating in this situation, and I don't think that would be evident -- typically, you gloat after a win.\nQ: \"Gloating\" may be the wrong word. But --\nMR. EARNEST: But, look, the American people have been dealt a setback by the United States Congress, despite the President's principled position to try to prevent that from happening. That is deeply disappointing to the President of the United States. I think it's deeply disappointing to the American people. And based on the reaction in the last 24 hours from members of Congress, I think they find their own conduct deeply embarrassing. They should.\nQ: But you don't want to offer any sort of outreach to them, say, okay, fine, let's come and talk about it and maybe we can kind of undo it?\nMR. EARNEST: We've been trying to persuade them to do that since April.\nQ: Do you think the language that you used in the last day is going to help that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Mike, I think it is hard to persuade a member of Congress who isn't willing to vote their conscience. Members of Congress say, and now publicly admit, that they're deeply concerned about the impact that this bill will have on our national security, but yet they voted for it. I don't really know what sort of legislative strategy or set of negotiations is going to persuade a member of Congress who's not willing to put the national security interests of the United States first. And that's unfortunate.\nIf there are members of Congress -- to be clear, if there are members of Congress that have had a change of heart, are now prepared to take a principled position, we would welcome a conversation about that. We would welcome action to solve the problem that they have created.\nI guess this is the other perspective. There are plenty of problems that we believe that Congress should be taking up right now. Secretary King was here talking about how additional funding for college and financial aid, or for early childhood education would address a problem that we see in our education system. There are a variety of things that we could do to strengthen our national security, or strengthen our economy, invest in our infrastructure, make our tax code more fair. There are plenty of problems to solve without Congress going around and creating more. But yesterday, that's exactly what they did. And for a Republican Congress that has refused to do its job, it's ironic that they're only adding to their to-do list.\nJustin.\nQ: At the risk of misrepresenting Senator Corker, I think I'm going to try to refine what his plan was, look at it and try to get your reaction to it. I think the way Republicans on Capitol Hill have described this is they wanted to take action on behalf of 9/11 families. The bill that was sort of championed by Senator Schumer had broader implications than they would have liked, which is why they wanted to sit down with Senator Schumer, the Democratic leadership, the White House and hammer out some sort of compromise that could have attended to the 9/11 families and also satisfy at least some of the foreign policy concerns that you or others raised. And so I think when you say, well, I'm not going to read out our conversations, the question here, getting to the core of it is, why wasn't the White House negotiating in a way that the Senate seemed open to on a version of this bill? I think they're depicting you as saying this is a bad idea, we're putting our hands up, don't do it --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, that's wrong. And again, there were extensive negotiations and extensive consultations from senior administration officials at the White House and throughout the President's national security team with members of Congress in both houses and both parties. And that's a fact. Those conversations were substantive. And we were trying to prevent Congress from creating a significant problem. By their own assessment, they've acknowledged that this is a significant problem. We were interested in having that conversation.\nSo, again, Senator Corker started out this week by saying that he hadn't heard from anybody at the White House, and that's just not true. It wasn't true then; it's not true now. But let me give you one other example. We also had a conversation here back in the spring -- I will acknowledge I didn't remember this, so -- there was a conversation about one tweak that had been made to the bill at the request of the administration, and the request -- or the tweak to the bill was one that we welcomed, that was based on conversations with the administration, but was not sufficient to satisfy the significant concerns that had been raised by White House lawyers, that had been raised by Republican national security experts, that have been raised by European officials, that have been raised by American business leaders about the potential unintended consequences of this bill.\nSo the fact that there were some changes that were made early on is evidence of the kind of ongoing consultation that's been taking place. But the changes that were made -- as I said back in the spring -- were insufficient. So I think that is pretty good evidence that there was a good-faith effort on the part of the administration to bring about these changes. But they were insufficient to address the concerns that were raised by experts in both parties and some of the closest allies of the United States.\nQ: I mean, I think maybe that's the crux of it, which is you guys have said maybe your sense of negotiations with Congress -- and it's hard to say if you're not going to sort of show your work -- were to say there's no version of this bill that's going to satisfy these requirements. And the reason that I think, or at least I'm particularly skeptical of the notion that there were these extensive negotiations is it's not just Republican leadership that's saying this. Sherrod Brown, a close ally of the White House, says he didn't hear from you guys the entire week. There's a number of other Democrats who have been really frustrated and vocal about the White House outreach on this.\nMR. EARNEST: And so the response to that is to vote for a bill they don't support or they believe is harmful to --\nQ: Well, the argument that they're making is they want to do something for the 9/11 families. You guys, at a certain point, became unwilling to negotiate, and so this was the bill that was in front of them.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, we've talked at great length -- and I'm happy to do it again -- about what the President has done to show his strong support for 9/11 families -- right? The President is somebody who got justice for the 9/11 families by ordering the mission to take Osama bin Laden off the battlefield. And the President is enormously proud of our men and women in uniform and our men and women in the intelligence community who accomplished that mission and demonstrated tremendous bravery and courage in getting it done.\nThe President is also somebody who is a champion of ensuring that our first responders and the others who were working at Ground Zero got the health care benefits that they deserved. The President is also somebody who has spoken eloquently and powerfully about how 9/11 families serve as a personal inspiration to him. So when it comes to doing something for the 9/11 families, the President has already done a lot for our 9/11 families, and the President believes that we should continue to show support for them.\nSo I think the other factor that has gone unmentioned so far is we're six weeks before an election. I suspect that that's what had a lot more influence over members of Congress than anything else. And I guess, Mike, to go back to your question, maybe after the election passes, maybe we will see some more principle on display in the United States Congress.\nQ: Last one on this. I mean, this is a campaign that you've been undertaking, as you said, since April. And this is actually how we got into the 1983 question yesterday. What does it say either about your Legislative Affairs office or the power that the President holds at this point, that members of Congress were unwilling or unable or just didn't see the long litany of certain consequences that you've been laying out all of the briefing?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, first of all, Justin, they feigned ignorance, so that's on them. Ignorance is not an excuse. The concerns that they have now cited after passing the bill are exactly the same ones that we've cited. So, again, I think that's a real tough argument for them to make. They can either say they were ignorant of the consequences of the bill because they didn't read it, that they were essentially unaware of what they were voting on, or they can say they carefully considered the opinions of Mike Mukasey and Steve Hadley and our closest allies in Europe, and Jeffrey Immelt and John Brennan, and Joe Dunford and Ash Carter and Barack Obama, and overruled them, and relied more on their own judgment than they did on all those -- that bipartisan group of national security experts. But they have to get their story straight.\nAnd I think when you see this kind of thrashing around that we've seen in Congress, I think it's an indication that they're pretty uncomfortable with the position that they're in. And I don't blame them. If I were them, I would be deeply embarrassed.\nQ: I got a quick one on Deutsche Bank -- this is on Bloomberg. And then we can get back to this. I just wanted to ask -- I mean, their shares have spiraled over the last couple days, largely because the Justice Department has requested $14 billion to settle a case linked to mortgage-backed securities. That's almost the entire market value of the bank and is creating ripples through the financial markets, but also kind of a political headache for Angela Merkel back in Germany, a close ally of the President. Have there been conversations between the White House and the Germans about this? And is there anything the U.S. can do to, I guess, help shore up that situation and provide greater clarity to investors?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Justin, I don't have much that I'm going to be in a position to say about any sort of Justice Department actions or conversations that they've been having with one entity or another. What I can tell you is that the President did have an opportunity to talk with Chancellor Merkel today, and their conversation was actually focused on the situation inside of Syria and the shared deep concern about the increase in violence there. He also had an opportunity to discuss the situation in Ukraine, as well, and the continued violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity by the Russians.\nBut I don't have a more detailed readout of their conversation to share beyond that.\nKaren.\nQ: Josh, thanks. Has the President been briefed on the train crash in Hoboken? And do you have anything to add on the investigation? I know it's early, but any potential cause? And has he reached out to Governor Christie?\nMR. EARNEST: The President is aware of the crash in Hoboken. He has not received a detailed briefing at this point. The investigation is still in its early stages. That investigation is being led by the National Transportation Safety Board. I know that the Federal Railroad Administration is involved, as well, and has personnel on site. They're collecting as much information about what happened as they can. And the President will be updated on that situation as they learn more.\nI'm not aware of any conversations with Governor Christie's office at this point. I know that White House officials -- not the President, but White House officials -- have been in touch with the mayor of Hoboken, and I would expect that open line of\n-- that line of communication to remain open. And we'll do our best to keep you apprised of any conversations with Governor Christie's office.\nQ: After the train derailment in Philadelphia last year, there was a lot of focus on the positive train control and getting that installed, especially in the parts of the Northeast here. None of New Jersey transit trains are fully equipped with this. The deadline for this keeps getting pushed; it's now 2018 to get this all installed. Is that a mistake? Should this deadline be sped up? What's your opinion on that?\nMR. EARNEST: I think at this point it's too early to tell what impact the deployment of the positive train control system would have had in this situation. I actually don't even know as we're standing here whether or not there is positive train control in that part of the system. So we'll collect some more facts to determine what exactly happened. And my colleagues at the NTSB will keep you apprised of that.\nSuzanne.\nQ: Josh, what do you make of the libertarian candidate, Gary Johnson's inability, what he calls a brain freeze, when asked if he could identify a foreign leader from any country or any continent that he admires? And what do you think that says about the level of preparedness or discussion in this presidential race?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, in the same way that I don't regularly put myself in a position of responding to claims or reactions from the Republican nominee for President, the same thing would apply to the libertarian nominee. What I think I can add to this conversation is that one of the things you've heard the President say on many occasions is that one of the reasons that he's a strong advocate of Secretary Clinton is she is somebody who is as experienced as any other non-incumbent to seek this office. And part of that is based on her extensive experience ineffectively representing the United States of America around the globe.\nSo the President believes that that kind of experience, that kind of track record is relevant as people consider and make a decision about whom to support in the upcoming election.\nQ: Do you think there's this dumbing down of the issues or the level of discussion in this presidential race?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'll let others comment on that. The President believes that a vigorous debate and discussion around the issues is important, and that certainly is going to improve the ability of voters across the country to make an informed decision if the candidates are talking about important issues. The President certainly hopes that what people do.\nMark.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Has the CR arrived at the White House? And will President Obama sign it before leaving for Israel?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm told, Mark, that it has arrived at the White House, and our intent is to have the President sign it before he departs. We'll keep you posted on that.\nQ: Okay. On the override, has there been or will there be any outreach to Saudi Arabia to discuss the veto override, explain what happened to them, if explanation is warranted?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know if there is explanation that's needed. But obviously my colleagues at the State Department are in regular touch with their counterparts in Saudi Arabia and obviously they have been, in recent weeks, given the consequences for this bill. So I can't speak to any specific conversations. You might check with the State Department if they have anything to read out.\nQ: Was the phone call with Chancellor Merkel the reason the President was late to the Olympic event?\nMR. EARNEST: My understanding the reason that he was late to the Olympic event is because, before the event started, the President had an opportunity to shake hands with all the Olympians, and the President and First Lady really enjoyed that opportunity. And it took a little longer than was allotted on the schedule, I think, primarily because the President and First Lady enjoyed the opportunity to visit with the Olympians one-on-one.\nQ: Do you know if he met with John Carlos and Tommy Smith?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I don't know. We can check on that for you.\nQ: That's it.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay.\nNadia.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. I have three questions. Let's start with Syria. The situation in Aleppo has been described as a living hell. The Obama administration came under immense criticism from former U.S. diplomats like (inaudible) and Robert Ford that you rely too much on the Russian intentions. And everybody know that their intention was to prop up the regime. What real options do you have now to stop the carnage in Aleppo, apart from threatening just to stop talking with the Russians?\nMR. EARNEST: Nadia, we're obviously deeply disappointed at the refusal of the Russians to use their influence with the Assad regime to reduce the violence and around Syria for a sustained period of time. The goal of reducing the violence was, essentially, twofold. The first is to allow for more and more regular deliveries of humanitarian assistance, and to kick-start discussions about a political transition inside of Syria. It's difficult for either of those things to take place when innocent Syrians are under fire. And there has been a shameful strategy implemented by the Assad regime and aided and abetted by the Russians to try to bomb civilians into submission by targeting hospitals and refugee camps and even underground playgrounds. It's appalling. And the situation in Syria does continue to worsen and it's deeply concerning.\nOur focus has been on trying to bring an end to that violence, and we've engaged diplomatically with the Russians, who have significant influence with the Assad regime, to try to bring that about. But thus far, that has not worked nearly as well as we would have liked.\nQ: How can a superpower like the United States -- it seems to be in a position of being completely impotent of even delivering aid to sieged people, mainly children and women, in a city like Aleppo, where Ban Ki-Moon described the act now as a war crime. Do you support that President Assad should be indicted as a war criminal and taken to The Hague instead of being invited to Geneva?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the United States has been supportive of efforts at the United Nations Security to refer cases to the ICC. Unfortunately, Russia has used their veto on the Security Council to block those referrals. That's been deeply disappointing. As I mentioned, what the Assad regime has done inside of Syria, and in Aleppo in particular, is shameful. It's deeply immoral and it's caused the kind of widespread bloodshed that's difficult to even read about. It's tragic. And it's one that the President's deeply concerned about.\nQ: Tony Blinken said, or quoted as saying that he's asked the President and his security team to come up with new options that we have not heard before. Can you just elaborate on that, share some these options?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, the President is regularly urging his national security team to evaluate the situation in Syria, to consider our strategy and look for ways to refine it and improve it and lead to more positive results. Much of that strategy and much of the strategic discussion has been focused on degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL. We've got some substantial progress to show for the effort that has been directed against ISIL. We haven't made as much progress in trying to address the political situation inside of Syria, and we certainly haven't made as much progress as we would like in sustaining a cessation of hostilities. That's been deeply disappointing.\nQ: Can you admit that your Syria policy has failed so far?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Nadia, as long as there are innocent people being targeted by their government and killed in attacks by barrel bombs and chemical weapons, that's going to be a problem that's in need of more attention. And the President's been distressed by the reports, in the same way that I think everybody in this room has been, based on the news coverage of the situation there. And the President is going to continue to push his team to look for and evaluate additional options that we can undertake to try to reduce the violence, increase the flow of humanitarian assistance, and kick-start the kind of political transition talks that everybody acknowledges are necessary to address the root cause of the situation in Syria.\nQ: I have one more on Israel. While President Peres has been advocating for the two-state solution, many believe that he didn't do enough to advance the cause of peace, including respected Israeli writers like Gideon Levy. He said that Mr. Peres supported the building of Israeli settlements, the occupation. He never believed the Israeli and Palestinians are equal. Since the President described him or his achievement in historical terms, can you just tell us exactly, practically, what did he do to advance the cause of peace?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, there are people that know a whole lot more about the history of the situation that are in a better position to offer their own commentary about the legacy of Shimon Peres. President Obama deeply admires Shimon Peres, not because he's a perfect person, but because he is somebody who dedicated his life to championing the Israeli people and advocating for peace. And that won President Peres President Obama's enduring respect and admiration. A,nd President Obama will have an opportunity to talk about that at the memorial service of course, but I'll leave it to others to do the careful detailed evaluation of President Peres's legacy.\nQ: Josh, thank you. Just a couple on Syria, and we'll move back to JASTA, and one sort of random subject, if you don't mind. President Obama stated at the presidential town hall last night that he brings in critics of his Syria policy for consultations with him. Can you identify any of those critics?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President has consulted with a wide variety of individuals, some of whom used to serve in this administration -- and Nadia cited in her question. But, listen, I'm not going to -- I think the point that the President is making is that he's open to a wide variety of views -- that includes members of Congress. Some of them have better-informed views that others, but many of them have not hesitated to be critical of the situation inside of Syria. And the President is open to the point of view of people with a variety of perspectives in part because -- James, I know that you've spent some time looking at this too -- it's not as if there's anybody sitting out there that we're aware of that has the magic key to solving the situation inside of Syria.\nQ: I was asking if you could identify as the people he was referencing. And if not, that's fine.\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not going to go through individual names. But when you consider people who have written about this but don't serve in government, or individuals that used to serve in the administration, or members of Congress who have strongly held views, the President has had an opportunity to talk to people who fit those kinds of broader descriptions, and that's who the President was referring to.\nQ: Secretary Kerry worked very hard with Foreign Minister Lavrov to set the terms and conditions for a potential ceasefire that would be followed by other measures. And as we've seen, the ceasefire didn't hold. And Russia is now engaged in actions that Secretary Kerry, this very morning, described as inexcusable. In response to all of this, the administration, both from the White House and the State Department, has threatened to sever all communications with the Russians related to Syria. And I just wonder if there wasn't a lack of planning on the part of the administration for the prospect of a complete breakdown of the ceasefire and the kinds of actions we have seen from Russia, because as a response, you're left threatening to do something. And I just wonder, why the administration didn't have in place a plan for how to go about its business in the event we saw this kind of default.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, James, the President's National Security team is always thoroughly evaluating contingency plans. And that's work that often goes -- that often takes place behind the scenes, and is often something that we don't talk about publicly, in some cases, because we don't want to undermine the ongoing efforts by discussing what the alternative would be. In some cases, those efforts are classified and not something we can talk about publicly anyway.\nI also think, James, that in talking about this over the last several weeks, even this new effort that in the first few hours showed some promise, was something we were deeply skeptical of. There was never a sense that this was a guaranteed solution. In fact, there was skepticism about whether or not it would work. But the President made the case, I think rather persuasively, that it would be irresponsible to not even try.\nQ: So the default setting on the part of the administration was if this thing collapses, let's move to a threat to sever communications -- that was your plan B, if this fell apart?\nMR. EARNEST: No. I think what I tried to convey is that there are a variety of contingencies plans that the President's national security team is always considering and, in some cases, we won't discuss those contingency plans because we're invested in trying to make the original plan work. In some cases, we're limited in discussing those contingency plans because they haven't been cleared for a public discussion.\nQ: On JASTA, given the historic nature of the outcome yesterday, can you tell us how the President learned of the outcome and what instant reaction he --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there was no surprise. In terms of describing it as historic -- the reason it was obviously the first time that the Congress had voted to override President Obama's veto. President Obama, I would point out, went deeper into his presidency than any President since Lyndon Johnson before his vote was overridden. And the President's success rate at sustaining vetoes is over 90 percent, and that's a percentage that's higher than President George W. Bush, President Reagan, President Ford, and President Nixon.\nQ: There's a scale there, probably, but --\nMR. EARNEST: There is a scale there. But, again, I think that would speak to the effectiveness of the President and his team.\nQ: How did the President learn about it is what I asked.\nMR. EARNEST: The President learned about it from public reports.\nQ: Was he watching the vote take place?\nMR. EARNEST: No, the President was on the road yesterday. So he was updated on the road.\nQ: So who told him about it?\nMR. EARNEST: I think that he read it himself in his reports.\nQ: You've mentioned in your discussion of JASTA earlier in this briefing that ignorance is not an excuse for lawmakers. Does that same maxim, ignorance is not an excuse, apply to Secretary Clinton professing to have been unaware of the classification markings on her private email?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, I'll let Secretary Clinton and her team talk about what she was thinking about and what she was aware of in the use of her email.\nQ: Last question, different subject. During the presidential town hall last night, a woman rose from the audience to ask the President a question. She described herself as a widow of somebody who, she said, had been misdiagnosed by a particular doctor in the VA system. The President at the end of that exchange, vowed to learn more information about that case. Number one, did he learn more information about that case?\nMR. EARNEST: The President has asked his team to collect more information about that case. I don't know that he's been updated on it today.\nQ: And given that this was a nationally, perhaps internationally televised forum in which this exchange was held, it seemed to me that, not knowing the specifics of the case, it was quite possible that this doctor who was referenced by the woman and who is now the subject of presidential focus, may or may not have been guilty of misdiagnosing the individual in question. And I just wonder if we can use this venue to establish that the White House takes no particular view on that subject as of now, doesn't seem to prejudice the case, as it were.\nMR. EARNEST: Of course, we're not seeking to prejudice the case. But the President and everybody who works at the VA holds themselves to an extraordinarily high standard. Accountability is important. And I think this administration has demonstrated that, including at the VA, on a number of occasions.\nQ: But even this physician has a right to innocence until proven guilty of malpractice or misdiagnosing, correct?\nMR. EARNEST: Of course, which is why we're -- again, the President was not familiar with the details of this case but asked his team to try to learn more about it.\nQ: Thank you.\nMR. EARNEST: Ron.\nQ: The train incident -- is there any suggestion or any sign that this might be terrorism?\nMR. EARNEST: At this point, I'm not aware of any evidence that has been uncovered that would draw that kind of linkage. But this is something that the National Transportation Safety Board is continuing to look at, so I think it's too soon to rule that out. But at this point, I'm not aware of any evidence that would raise those kinds of concerns about this point.\nQ: And on the veto override, the bill and so forth, you keep talking about potential unintended consequences. Are there any specific cases, statements, actions by any foreign government or entity anywhere that are evidence of these unintended consequences actually happening now? Because again, it's such a vague -- well, it's not -- it's a vague notion that these things -- these awful things could happen. Are they happening anywhere?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me answer your question in two ways. The first is that our lawyers at the State Department will tell you that the concept -- the principle of sovereign immunity is something that is routinely invoked by the United States to protect our country and to protect our servicemembers and diplomats. So this is not some esoteric, rarely used part of international law. This is actually one of the central principles of international law that does more to protect the United States than any other country in the world based on U.S. involvement around the globe.\nSo this is a critically important principle, and one that the President, again, and national security experts in both parties, believe is worth protecting.\nQ: I understand it conceptually, but again, is there a specific example, as much as this happens routinely, where this concern of yours, the administration's, as a practical matter, you can tell us exactly where this is happening or where you fear it's going to happen in the coming days?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the concern is that -- the bill went into law just yesterday, and our concern is that other countries around the world will see that change and begin to initiate --\nQ: Is there any place where that has happened? Because again, this was not a surprise. Is there a legislature or a parliament somewhere where you see this happening?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, this is something that the EU warned about, so we've got our European allies who are suggesting that this is a cause of deep concern. I'm not aware of any specific legislative actions that have been taken by another country as of today, but that risk now exists today in a way that it didn't yesterday. And that does expose our diplomats and our servicemembers to enhanced risk.\nQ: And given the 9/11 families' apparent intention to pursue lawsuits now, does the administration anticipate -- do you feel so strongly about what's at stake that the administration could see itself potentially intervening in those cases legally to try and stop them from proceeding because you're so concerned about the unintended consequences of these legal cases proceeding?\nMR. EARNEST: A decision like that -- I'd actually refer you to the Department of Justice. It may be a little hard for them to comment on a court case that doesn't exist yet, but they may be able to discuss what potential role the federal government could play in a legal proceeding like that.\nQ: I'm talking about principles and ideas. Is that a -- do you think it's an idea, a principle that would be -- that's so crucial that it would be worth defending or fighting for in that context? Actually intervening?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I don't know if it's possible for the federal government to play that kind of role in a private lawsuit, but I'm also not an attorney. So the Department of Justice may be able to give you a better sense of what potential role the federal government could have in a potential lawsuit down the road.\nQ: Lastly, with the passing of former President Peres in Israel, and the President's deep concern about Middle East peace, the process and how it's broken down -- and there were some questions to you the other day about the possibility of him, before he leaves office, essentially laying out his view of how things should happen there -- after a respectful period of time passes, given what's happened and the passing of the former President, do you think it is more likely or possible that the President may now see that this is a moment where he should, given the fact that he's leaving office and his concern about this issue, explain more or lay out a plan that he sees as viable and what should happen there, and what his predecessor should -- a path they should pursue?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen --\nQ: His successor, I'm sorry.\nMR. EARNEST: The President obviously earlier in his presidency, expended a lot of energy, as did Secretary Kerry, in trying to bring the Palestinians and Israelis together to the negotiating table to facilitate an agreement that would bring peace. And those efforts were ultimately unsuccessful because the kinds of difficult decisions that must be made in the context of those negotiations can't be imposed by the United States or even by the international community. Ultimately, it's the leaders of the parties themselves that have to make those kinds of decisions.\nQ: Yes, but given this moment and given where we are in his time in office, does he feel like this is a moment where he feels like he should do more than he would have not previously?\nMR. EARNEST: I can't speak to any sort of potential future actions. What I can speak to is a principle that we have -- a reality that we have acknowledged from the beginning, which is that the United States or the international community or other outside forces cannot impose a solution. And a solution will only come when leaders on both sides demonstrate a willingness to make very difficult decisions to find a compromise. And that's difficult work. It certainly is tricky when you consider the politics involved. But it's also tricky when you just consider the deeply held principles involved.\nSo I think that's why it's -- when President Peres pursued this kind of peace through negotiations in his career, that effort was so difficult that his efforts were recognized with the Nobel Prize.\nSo the President would be the first to acknowledge that the kinds of questions that are facing Israeli and Palestinian leaders are extraordinary, and they're difficult, and they're complicated, and they are filled with emotion and questions that go to very basic principles related to identity and religion.\nSo this is complicated stuff. But at the end of the day, it's precisely because of the nature of these questions that ultimately it will be the leaders of the Israeli and Palestinian people to decide how to move forward and how to pursue this peace. And the United States is going to continue to play the historic role that we have played in encouraging both sides to come to the table.\nJohn.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. Two brief questions. First, on Friday, you issued a very strong endorsement from the podium of the role of the consumer fraud protection bureau in the investigation of Wells Fargo and the phantom accounts that were there. Now, Jeb Hensarling, Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said, and it's been widely quoted now, that the CFPB did not go far enough in its investigation, was completely uncooperative with his committee, and was stonewalling. And he wants to bring officials of it before his committee for further investigation. There's obviously a different interpretation of the role of the CFPB here.\nMR. EARNEST: Obviously. Chairman Hensarling is somebody who has repeatedly tried to undermine the effectiveness of the CFPB, questioning their independence, trying to cut their budget, otherwise questioning the reason for their existence. And so hearing this criticism from him is not particularly surprising.\nBut it's hard for me to speak in a lot of detail about the work that the CFPB has undertaken in the context of the Wells Fargo investigation because they're independent. So I'd refer you to the CFPB for an explanation about what kinds of things were considered in the context of their investigation of Wells Fargo.\nQ: Another question about Libya. The President himself has expressed his sorrow about the inability to form a government. In recent weeks, we've seen Field Marshal Haftar increasingly gain control over key areas of oil. He is charged with his mission by the parliament (inaudible.) Does the administration feel this is a good sign? And is Marshal Haftar someone that we feel comfortable with in a future Libyan government?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the United States has indicated our unequivocal support for the government that was formed under the auspices of this U.N. process. And the situation in Libya continues to be complicated, and the security situation there in particular continues to be challenging. And that has challenged this newly formed, newly created government to succeed in unifying the country. But they certainly undertake that work with the strong support of the United States and the rest of the international community.\nAnd the United States has, at the invitation of the government, taken some steps to help them counter the terror threat that they face. I think that's an indication of the United States' investment in the success of that independent government in Libya.\nQ: So the U.S. considers Marshal Haftar part of that independent government?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't think the independent government considers him part of that government. But we'll see if we can get somebody to give you a more detailed accounting of the situation there.\nLalit.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. Yesterday, the Indian government said that it carried out some preemptive strike against terrorist groups coming from Pakistan who are trying to sneak inside India and carry out a terrorist attack. What do you have to say on it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what I can tell you is that we've seen some reports from the region. Those reports include that Indian and Pakistani militaries have been in communication with one another. And we encourage continued discussions between India and Pakistan to avoid escalation. Ambassador Rice yesterday had an opportunity to speak with her Indian counterpart, National Security Advisor Doval. And in that call, Ambassador Rice made clear that the United States continues to be concerned by the danger that cross-border terrorism poses to the region.\nAnd the United States fully expects that Pakistan will take effective action to combat and delegitimize U.N.-designated terrorist individuals and entities. The United States is firmly committed to our partnership with India and to our joint efforts to combat terrorism, and we're prepared to deepen collaboration on U.N. terrorist designations. At the same time, we continue to be in close contact with Pakistan, and we continue to value the important partnership that we have formed with them on a range of issues, including security issues.\nQ: Given that there has been close strong cooperation between India and U.S. on counterterrorism things, was any coordination between India and U.S. on this strike by India?\nMR. EARNEST: I can tell you that Ambassador Rice yesterday had an opportunity to be in touch with her counterpart, but I can't speak to any specific coordination on this issue.\nQ: U.S. Ambassador to India, Richard Verma, was here. And he rushed back to Delhi, cancelling his other public engagements. Is he carrying a message from this building, from the White House?\nMR. EARNEST: Not that I'm aware of. But you can check with him to see if -- to explain why he rushed back.\nChris, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Today is the deadline to file amicus brief in the case before the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, alleging anti-gay discrimination in the workplace. The lawsuit is based on the premise that the prohibition on gender discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 also prohibits sexual orientation discrimination. It's the position of the administration that that law (inaudible) against discrimination against transgender people, but you haven't said anything about whether it also applies to lesbian, gay and bisexual people. I don't expect you to know from the podium about the brief in this case --\nMR. EARNEST: Thank you.\nQ: -- but as a constitutional lawyer, has President Obama ever expressed to you that anti-gay discrimination is prohibited under federal law, current federal law?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know that I've heard him express a view even in private on that precise topic. What I can tell you in general is the principle you've heard me give voice to on a number of occasions, and that simply is that the Obama administration is opposed to laws that are focused on trying to take freedom away from people. And we've been concerned about laws that, in some cases, seem focused mostly on legitimizing one form of discrimination or another. And that's why you have seen the Justice Department take some of the actions that they've had to try to protect those freedoms.\nAnd I can't speak to any specific action at the Department of Justice, but as it relates to the specific question you've raised, I'm sure they can talk to you about it.\nThanks, everybody.\nEND 2:30 P.M.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122567", "text": "Students [like you] want to take that next step and have big dreams. We want you to know that we're there to help you achieve those dreams. We want to make sure that we're giving every student who's willing to put in the effort all the tools that they need in order to succeed.\n—President Barack Obama, 2015\nAmerica built a strong middle class over the past several generations through a commitment to keeping a high-quality education within reach of all who are willing to work for it. In keeping this promise alive, President Obama has made the largest investment in student aid since the G.I. Bill, and implemented reforms to ensure every student can earn a good-value college degree or credential. Today, many historically underserved students are enrolling in college for the first time; more students are graduating from college than ever; and new student loan defaults, delinquencies, and forbearances are on the decline.\nThis week, the White House and U.S. Department of Education are launching this year's Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)—available October 1st for the first time, three months earlier than the traditional January 1st date—so that more students can access the historic investment in financial aid and better information when they need it. The Administration will also announce new efforts to further streamline the FAFSA and connect students and families with the College Scorecard and other resources to support them to and through college.\nLater today, in collaboration with the First Lady's Better Make Room campaign, CollegeHumor will release a video to raise awareness about the importance of completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The video features \"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire's\" Chris Harrison as host of an easy game show that gives students free money to go to college, and the First Lady serves as a \"lifeline\" to the contestant.\nTomorrow, the White House will honor eleven individuals from across the country will also be honored at the White House on Friday as \"Champions of Change for College Opportunity\" who have done important work in their own communities to strengthen access and completion to high-quality post-secondary education, especially for first-generation and low-income students. More information on the honorees is available HERE.\nBreaking Down Barriers to College Access with Historic Aid Investments:\n•      President Obama has doubled investments in financial aid, between increasing the maximum Pell Grant by over $1,000 and establishing the American Opportunity Tax Credit which provides a maximum credit of $2,500 per year—or up to $10,000 over four years. During this Administration, an average of 2.5 million additional students received a Pell Grant each year. On average, these investments cut college costs by an average of $3,700 for 8 million families last year, and cut $18 billion in taxes for families supporting a college student.\n•      New analysis by the Council of Economic Advisers suggests that the Obama Administration's increase in the average Pell Award between 2008-2009 and 2014-2015 will lead to an additional $20 billion in aggregate earnings, a nearly 2:1 return on the investment. Today's Council of Economic Advisers report documents the impacts of the Administration's evidence-based strategies for improving college access and success.\nMaking it Easier and Faster to Access these Historic Investments in Financial Aid:\n•      Altogether, the federal government provides nearly $180 billion in financial aid. The first step to accessing any of this aid is the FAFSA. Since the President took office, over 160 million FAFSA forms have been completed. The majority of FAFSA filers were first-generation and Pell-eligible students, for whom a scholarship can mean the difference between earning a degree or not. Building on a history of streamlining and simplifying the FAFSA to provide filers with the most relevant questions online, this year, the FAFSA will allow students and families to automatically populate the form with last year's tax information from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) — an easier, more accurate process. With this change, about 4 million more students and families can use this IRS Data Retrieval Tool from the start, eliminating the need to send tax information to the government twice. This enhancement can ensure that hundreds of thousands more families receive the aid for which they are eligible, that students and families save well over half a million hours in paperwork, and that schools can transfer 3 million hours from verifying information to advising students and making financial aid awards.\n•      We're not stopping there. Next year, the FAFSA will have a streamlined sign-up and password recovery process for an FSA ID, which establishes a student's financial aid account and is the first step to accessing federal financial aid. With enhanced FSA ID usability, students and families can complete the FAFSA securely, in even less time.\nGiving More Time and Better Information for Students to Apply Their Aid to Attend Good-Value Schools:\n•      The College Scorecard—which was announced by the President in 2015 and redesignedwith direct input from students, families, and their advisers — provides the clearest, most accessible, and most reliable national data on cost, graduation rates, debt, and post-college earnings. Together with the earlier FAFSA, the College Scorecard ensures that students and families have the best information available to choose a good-value school. Because students and families can learn about their financial aid eligibility within a few days of completing the FAFSA, they will have better information to compare costs and student outcomes at different schools sooner, while they are searching for and applying to schools. These policies and resources can ensure that more students consider and submit their FAFSAs to more than one school, which can expand the scope of their college opportunities. Already, the share of freshmen submitting their FAFSAs to more than one school has increased by 10 percentage points since 2008-2009.\n•      Next year, the FAFSA will direct students to the College Scorecard, so that students can make a more informed choice about their most consequential investment to date—by weighing their personalized financial aid estimates against a school's student outcomes, comparing schools, and considering the full scope of their college options.\nThe President will also highlight additional work underway to ensure that students and families have access to better information at the time that they are making college decisions.\nAligned Timelines for Earlier Awards:\n•      Federal-level: The Department is publishing Pell Grant payment schedules earlier than ever before, to assist states and schools in planning and giving families their financial aid awards earlier. This year, the maximum Pell Grant is increasing to $5,920.\n•      State-level: The National Association of State Student Grant and Aid Programs (NASSGAP), a network of state grant agencies awarding over $12 billion in state aid to 4.5 million students, is working with all of its states to implement the earlier FAFSA using a prior year's tax information. NASSGAP is announcing that the significant majority of states have created plans to conduct statewide outreach to ensure that their students are aware of the earlier timeline and resources available.\n•      School-level: The National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators (NASFAA), whose member institutions serve 90 percent of undergraduates, is announcing that all of its members nationwide will be ready for the earlier FAFSA using a prior year's income. NASFAA is bringing financial aid professionals across campuses together and is ensuring that all of its members have the resources and support needed for the transition.\nBetter Information at Students' and Families' Fingertips:\nIn addition, because the underlying data that powers the Scorecard is published through an open application programming interface (API), anyone—researchers, policymakers, counselors, organizations—can customize their own tools and analysis of college performance more quickly and easily.\n•      Federal programs providing a pathway to the middle class:  Agencies like the Department of Veterans Affairs, and Department of Defense are integrating College Scorecard data to ensure that students have the information they need to apply their service member and veterans' benefits at high-quality schools. Through a government-wide effort to ensure that millions of low-income families can access a college opportunity as a pathway to the middle class, the FAFSA and College Scorecard will also be shared through volunteer income tax assistance sites and with participants of programs for temporary assistance for needy families, subsidized housing and housing vouchers, Medicaid, food stamps, child care, free and reduced price lunch, and unemployment insurance.\n•      More informed application processes: Organizations—like Google, College Board, and the Common Application —are building the College Scorecard tool and data into their products in order to ensure that students and families have the best information available at critical decision-making-periods. The College Scorecard data on college costs, graduation rates, and earnings will be clearly featured in the hundreds of millions of Google searches related to colleges and universities taking place in the US each year. As part of on-going research on the impact of information on student decision-making, the College Board is proactively sharing College Scorecard data with approximately 100,000 low-income students that receive customized college planning information and support through its Access to Opportunity Program. This effort is informed by their research that shows that College Scorecard earnings information prompted students to consider colleges and universities with better student outcomes after college (Hurwitz and Smith, 2016). ACT and College Board will also partner with First Lady Michelle Obama's Reach Higher Initiative and Better Make Room Campaign to share Scorecard and FAFSA information with millions of students so they can access support to apply for college through Up Next.\n•      Data-driven college advising: Organizations like the  College Advising Corps, National College Access Network, and American School Counselor Association will integrate Scorecard data into their advising and FAFSA completion work, to ensure that students can access the right information at the right time.\nMore Good Schools to Choose from in the Future:\n•      Ranking colleges based on student and community needs: By shining light on the value that institutions provide to their students, the College Scorecard aligns incentives for institutions with the goals of their students and community. Although college rankings have traditionally rewarded schools for rejecting students and amassing wealth instead of giving every student a fair chance to succeed in college, more are incorporating information on whether students graduate, find good-paying jobs, and repay their loans. Over half a dozen rankings systems – including Forbes, Money, the Brookings Institution The Economist, Wall Street Journal, and Washington Monthly – have incorporated College Scorecard data to create some of the first rankings that use earnings data.\n•      Better insights and analysis to inform policy: Organizations like the  Center for American Progress, New America, Education Trust, and The Century Foundation have used the College Scorecard data to introduce new insights about college performance that can inform policymakers' and school leaders' work to strengthen the quality of colleges and universities.\n•      Greater transparency and accountability to strengthen college performance: The Department of Education has increased the focus on student outcomes in accreditation processes by using the College Scorecard data to promote greater transparency and accountability in higher education. The recently published accreditor dashboards show college outcomes for every accrediting agency, orienting accreditors' and policymakers' attention towards using outcomes data to maintain a high standard for quality.\nComprehensive Step-by-Step Advising:\n•      This FAFSA season, all 50 states will be able to participate in the FAFSA Completion Initiative that the President and First Lady announced in 2014. Through the FAFSA Completion Initiative, states partner with districts and schools to provide student-level FAFSA completion data so that advisors and teachers can track exactly which students have filled out the FAFSA, allowing districts and schools to tailor their outreach and advising to students to ensure all students can complete the FAFSA.\n•      The Department of Education is providing ready-made materials, videos, and webinar information through their Financial Aid Toolkitand additional information on the financial aid process and step-by-step assistance on the FAFSA, college preparation, and student loan repayment through StudentAid.gov.\n•      This year, the Obama Administration is announcing new commitments from over 170 organizations that will share information about the FAFSA and the College Scorecard. Altogether, they report reaching 20 million additional students this year. Using vehicles like the  Up Next texting tool, students can access step-by-step advice and personalized support from College Advising Corps, College Forward, College Possible, and Inside Track counselors in completing the FAFSA and using College Scorecard, and repaying their loans after graduation. The Common Application is also sharing these texts directly to their students, which include 300,000 first-generation students, by sharing Up Next texts about Scorecard and FAFSA.

She deserves to have a baby without sacrificing her job. A mother deserves a day off to care for a sick child or sick parent without running into hardship – and you know what, a father does, too.\"\n— President Barack Obama, 2014 State of the Union Address\nToday the White House is highlighting two new actions to further support working Americans. First, the Department of Labor is finalizing a rule to require employees of businesses doing work on federal contracts to earn up to seven paid sick days a year. Second, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) is publishing its final and approved collection of summary pay data by gender, race, and ethnicity from businesses with 100 or more employees to improve enforcement of our nation's equal pay laws.\nSince taking office, President Obama has promoted policies to grow and strengthen the middle class by supporting working families. Despite tremendous changes that have transformed America and its families over the past 50 years, our workplaces have not kept pace. In most families today, both parents work and share in the responsibilities of caring for children or other family members. Recently released data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that these efforts have resulted in strong progress for America's working families.  Today, a record share of private sector workers now have access to paid sick leave, increasing from 61 to 64 percent over the past year. Furthermore, this increase was driven almost entirely by increased access in low-wage jobs: in just one year, the share of workers in the lowest-paid quarter of occupations that had access to paid sick leave jumped from 31 to 39 percent. Since the President took office, the number of private sector workers with paid sick leave has grown by 10.6 million.\nDespite this progress, millions of Americans still do not have access to even a single day of paid sick leave, so when workers get sick they may have to choose between caring for themselves or paying their bills. Too many parents must make the painful choice between staying home to take care of a sick child—and losing out on a day's pay—or sending their child to school sick. For that reason, President Obama has repeatedly called on Congress to pass the Healthy Families Act—which would guarantee most Americans the chance to earn up to seven days of paid sick leave each year—and urging states, cities, and businesses to act where Congress has not.\nSimilarly, despite a woman's pay being just as critical for a family to make ends meet, women make less than their male peers. The President has fought to close that gap, and the first legislation he signed into law was the  Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, an important step in ensuring that Americans can effectively challenge unequal pay in the courts. Since then, he has taken numerous other  steps to advance equal pay, including issuing a 2014 Executive Order prohibiting federal contractors from discriminating against employees who discuss their pay, and announcing a  White House Equal Pay Pledge that has now been signed by more than 50 of America's leading businesses.\nSimilar to the expansion of paid sick leave, progress has been made on the gender pay gap. In 2008, a typical woman working full-time earned only 77 cents for every dollar earned by a typical man; today, that has risen to 80 cents. That means that for a woman working full-time, the pay gap has shrunk by more than 10 percent, or about $1200, since the President took office.\nYet much work remains. Too many women and workers of color are still not paid equally for equal work, with African-American women earning 63 cents and Latina women earning 54 cents for every dollar earned by a white non-Hispanic man. And 41 million private sector workers do not have access to even a single day of paid sick leave. Today's actions mark critical progress to support the needs of working Americans and their families.\nEXPANDING SICK LEAVE\nLast September, President Obama signed an  Executive Order requiring federal contractors (and subcontractors) to allow their employees working on federal contracts to earn up to seven paid sick days each year. Today, the Department of Labor is finalizing its rule implementing the order. It takes into account extensive public comments from employers, business associations, small businesses, workers, unions, and worker advocates. The final rule, which goes into effect for new solicitations issued on or after January 1, 2017, will:\n•      Give additional paid sick leave to 1.15 million people working on federal contracts, including nearly 600,000 employees who do not currently have even a single day of paid sick leave. Workers will earn one hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked on (or in connection with) a covered federal contract, up to 56 hours in a year or at any point in time.\n•      Allow workers to use paid sick leave for their own illnesses, preventive care, or other health care needs; to care for a family member or loved one who is ill, seeking preventive care, or otherwise in need of care; and for absences resulting from domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking. Employers may not retaliate against employees for using paid sick leave or require them to find replacements in order to take it.\n•      Improve the health and performance of employees of federal contractors and bring benefits packages offered by federal contractors in line with leading firms, ensuring they remain competitive in the search for dedicated and talented employees.\n•      Protect public health by reducing the transmission of illnesses in the workplace from sick employees to coworkers or their customers.\n•      Respond to employers' concerns by ensuring coordination with existing \"paid time off\" policies that give workers a flexible bank of leave; existing collective bargaining agreements; and multiemployer plans.\nThis action reflects leading practices by major employers, states, and localities throughout the country. Since the President's call to action in 2014, four states and more than 25 cities and counties have taken action to expand paid sick leave in their community, and many businesses small and large have adopted similar policies. For example:\n•      Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota passed ordinances in May and September, respectively, requiring businesses to offer their workers an hour of paid sick time for every 30 hours worked. Both ordinances go into effect on July 1, 2017 with phased implementation periods. The Twin Cities have a joint population of nearly 700,000 residents, though the ordinances cover anyone who does work within the respective city limits.\n•      Vermont Energy Investment Corporation (VEIC), a nonprofit clean energy consulting company and federal contractor in Vermont, testified in support of Vermont's new paid sick leave law, passed earlier this year. VEIC's founder pointed to the monetary, physical, and cultural value of paid sick leave to employers.\n•      Cava Grill, a fast-casual national restaurant brand headquartered in Washington, DC, announced in July that it began offering paid sick and parental leave to its hourly workers, for whom it also raised its starting wage to $13 an hour. Employees will now receive up to six days a year of paid sick leave, up to four days of paid parental leave, and one day for community service.\n•      Microsoft, a federal contractor, took a similar step last year by announcing it would require suppliers with at least 50 employees doing business with the company to provide employees who handle its work with 15 days of paid leave annually (including 5 paid sick days). In announcing this change, Microsoft pointed to research showing that paid leave contributes to the health and well-being of workers and their families, strengthens family ties, increases productivity, improves retention, lowers health-care costs, and contributes to the health of colleagues.\nADVANCING EQUAL PAY\nToday, the EEOC, in cooperation with the Department of Labor, is publishing its finalized revisions to its EEO-1 form, which for the first time will collect summary pay data, broken down by gender, race, and ethnicity, from all businesses with 100 or more employees. This data collection, which stems from a recommendation by the President's Equal Pay Task Force and a  Presidential Memorandum issued in 2014, is expected to cover roughly 63 million employees and 60,000 employers.\nToday's action will promote improved voluntary compliance by employers with existing equal pay laws. It will also help EEOC and the Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) better focus investigations on employers who are illegally shortchanging workers' pay based on their gender, race, or ethnicity.\nThe data will be a tool not only for the federal government, but for employers as well. It will help employers evaluate their own pay practices to prevent pay discrimination in their workplaces. The EEOC will also compile and publish aggregate data that will help employers in assessing their pay practices relative to others in the same industry and geographic area.\nBusinesses have long used the EEO-1 form to report demographic information on their workforces. With the revised EEO-1, businesses also will report summary data on the range of compensation paid to employees of each demographic group. Businesses will not be required to disclose individual employees' salaries.\nEmployers will first be required to submit pay data for 2017 by March 31, 2018, giving them 18 months to prepare for the change. This revision does not impact the 2016 EEO-1 report, which is due on September 30, 2016 and is unchanged. EEOC will be offering webinars and technical assistance to employers, payroll and human resource information system providers, and other stakeholders in preparation for the new submission requirements.\nToday's publication of the revised form comes after the EEOC approved this action by a vote of the Commission, and follows final approval by the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act. The EEOC is an independent government agency that enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, and genetic information.\nBUILDING ON A RECORD OF SUPPORTING WORKING FAMILIES\nSince taking office, President Obama and his Administration have taken a number of actions to support working families and combat the pay gap, including:\n•      Publishing a final regulation by the Department of Health and Human Services to implement the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 2014. The program provides subsidies to working families and last year provided services for roughly 1.4 million children aged 0-13, most of whom are younger than 5. The rule, which has not been comprehensively revised since 1998, will provide a roadmap to states on how to implement the new law and clarify ambiguities around provisions that deal with eligibility for services; health and safety requirements; and how best to support the needs of parents and providers as they transition to the new law. It also clarifies that worker organizations can provide professional development to child care workers and contribute to discussions around the rates states set for subsidies.\n•      Signing his first piece of legislation as President, the  Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pair Act, in January 2009 making it easier for employees to challenge unfair pay practices.\n•      Creating the  National Equal Pay Task Force in January 2010 to implement his pledge to crack down on violations of equal pay laws, which included representatives from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Department of Justice, the Department of Labor, and the Office of Personnel Management. The Task Force has issued reports on its progress, including  Fighting for Equal Pay in the Workforce, Keeping America's Women Moving Forward, and  Fifty Years After the Equal Pay Act. In addition, since the creation of the Equal Pay Task Force in 2010, the EEOC has received over 18,000 charges of sex-based pay discrimination, and through its independent enforcement efforts, the EEOC has obtained over $140 million in monetary relief for victims of pay discrimination on the basis of sex.\n•      Calling on Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, commonsense legislation that would strengthen the Equal Pay Act of 1963 by closing loopholes in the defenses for equal pay violations, providing stronger remedies, and expanding protections against discrimination for employees who share or inquire about information about their compensation at work.\n•      Signing a Presidential Memorandum in May 2013 directing the Office of Personnel Management to  develop a government-wide strategy to address the gender pay gap in the federal workforce, leading to a  report in April 2014 and new  guidance in July 2015—which cautioned against reliance on a candidate's existing salary to set pay, as it can potentially adversely affect women who may have taken time off from their careers or propagate gaps due to discriminatory pay practices by previous employers.\n•      Issuing an Executive Order in April 2014 and publishing a Department of Labor rule in September 2015 prohibiting federal contractors from discriminating against employees who  discuss or inquire about their compensation.\n•      Announcing a White House Equal Pay Pledge, with more than 50 leading businesses signing on to take action to advance equal pay.

Hello, everybody! Welcome to the White House! Let's first give it up for the inspiring U.S. Paralympic Team! And give it up for the winners of the most medals by far, the 2016 Rio Olympics Team U.S.A.!\nNow, first of all, I want you to know that I was going to do, like, a floor routine on the way out with Simone. [Laughter] But we decided it was a little too crowded and it would be——\nThe First Lady. And he can't touch his toes.\nThe President. And I can't touch my toes. [Laughter] So we scrapped that idea. You are the last team of Olympians and Paralympians that we will have the honor of welcoming to the White House.\nThe First Lady. We, us.\nThe President. But the story of this year's Team U.S.A. is all about firsts. Our Olympians came in first so many times more than anybody else. It wasn't even close: 46 golds. Not to brag, but 46 golds. You made the U.S. the first country in 40 years to top the medal chart in every category. And it was a feat built one unprecedented accomplishment at a time.\nSo, for example, only one American woman has ever won gold on the vault. Only one American has won four golds in gymnastics in a single Game. That would be this young lady, Simone Biles. Only one American woman has ever won gold in the shot put. That's Michelle Carter. Only one African American woman has ever won a swimming gold. That would be Simone Manuel. Only one American boxer, male or female, has ever won back-to-back Olympic golds: Claressa Shields. Only one cyclist has ever won three golds in the same event, America's Kristin Armstrong, who did it in the driving rain one day before her 43d birthday. Only one female Olympian has ever medaled at six straight Games. That would be America's Kim Rhode. Only one female track-and-field athlete has ever won six golds, and that would be America's Allyson Felix.\nThere's only one country ever to sweep every medal in the women's 100-meter hurdles, and that would be the United States of America. Give it up for Brianna and Nia and Kristi for the great work they did.\nAnd then, there's this young woman named Katie Ledecky. Katie's back there somewhere. There she is. [Laughter] I was nervous that she was going to ask me to, like, hold all her medals while I was speaking or something because—[laughter]. So she obliterates her own records in the 400 and the 800 freestyle, lapped the field in the 800. When you were watching on TV—you all see it on TV? Like there's nobody else in the pool? [Laughter] Crazy.\nAnd then, there are some firsts that show the world America's greatness doesn't come only from high scores or fast times, but from our diversity and our tolerance and our open hearts. This summer's fencer, Ibtihaj Muhammad, became the first American female athlete to compete in the Olympic Games in a hijab. And that's important too, because one of the wonderful things we love when we see our Olympians is, everybody is from all kinds of different backgrounds and shapes and sizes, although all very good looking. [Laughter] The First Lady. Yes!\nThe President. Just exuding health. You know, they're—like, everybody's teeth is really white and their eyes are really shiny. [Laughter]\nThe First Lady. Fruits and vegetables! [Laughter]\nThe President. Fruits and vegetables.\nSo all this applies to the entire team, but I—but you will notice that there was a preponderance of women that I was mentioning here.\nAudience member. Yes!\nThe President. One of the reasons our country is so proud of this year's Team U.S.A. is, 2016 belonged to America's women Olympians. I mean, you all crushed it.\nWe had more women competing in these Games than any nation ever. Our women alone won more golds than most countries did. Our women's 61 medals—most ever by any women's team—breaking the record set by, of course, Team U.S.A. 4 years ago. [Laughter] And as the father of two young women, for them to have that example of health and drive and competition and persistence and strength, it makes me really proud.\nThe First Lady. Yes!\nThe President. So thank you, all the great jobs that you guys did.\nNow, this year's summer Olympians gave us enough milestones and moments to last the next 4 years. Michael Phelps became the greatest Olympian of all time, broke a 2,000-year record for the most individual Olympic titles. If you're breaking, like, a 2,000-year record, that's pretty impressive. [Laughter] You know what I mean? If they've got to go back to the Greeks, that's an impressive record. [Laughter]\nOur men and women's basketball teams continue to dominate the world. Sam Kendricks, a U.S. Army reservist and pole vaulter, somehow stopped himself midsprint and stood at attention when he heard the national anthem playing on the other side of the stadium. Thank you, Sam. And then, right after Will Claye won a silver in the triple jump, he jumped right into the stands to ask his girlfriend, fellow Olympian Queen Harrison, to marry him. [Laughter] So there was all kinds of stuff going on here. [Laughter]\nOf course, we continue to be inspired by our Paralympians like Allysa Seely. Her doctors once said she might not walk again. Then she went out and won a triathlon. Sorry, doctors. Brad Snyder, Navy veteran, lost his eyesight to an IED in Afghanistan, went out and won three golds in the pool. Sergeant Elizabeth Marks, wounded in Iraq, still serves on Active Duty in our Army, does not hide her scars, just goes out and wins gold in the 100-meter breaststroke. That's what she does.\nAnd then, we're in awe of American athletes like Abbey D'Agostino who have showed that the Olympics are about more than just setting records. It's about sportsmanship and character. Some of you saw, when Abbey collided on the track with another running—runner, tearing her ACL. Abbey popped up, reached out her hands to her competitor and said, \"Get up, we have to finish this race.\" We have to finish this race. And that's a remarkable sentiment in the middle of an individual event. But that's exactly what the Olympic spirit and the American spirit should be all about. Now—so I could talk about this forever, but if I keep on going longer, I'm going to get, like, \"Phelps Face\" from you guys. You're going to be, like—[laughter]—you're going to be hungry. You want to get this—get out of here. [Laughter] So let me just say how proud all of you made, not just Michelle and me, but every American. And it inspires us to do what we do that much harder.\nWe admire your athleticism, but we also admire your character and your stick-to-it-ness. We know you don't do this for the money or the fame. [Laughter] You know. So many of you, you're holding down a full-time job, or you're going to school at the same time, and then you're trying to find time for your families, contribute to causes. Many of you have been involved on—in things like \"It's On Us\" and \"Let's Move!\" And you're doing this just with endless hours of training, and somehow, you make it look easy.\nSo remember that you know, when somebody is watching you for the first time and they see how hard you work and what you accomplish, and they feel inspired. They feel like they can take any challenge on. What you do has ripples all across the country. Imagine what it means for a young girl or a young boy who sees somebody who looks like them doing something and being the best at what they do.\nAnd that's one of the most extraordinary things about our Olympic team. There's no kid in America who can't look at our Olympic team and see themselves somewhere. That's part of the reason why we're successful, because we gather talent from every corner of the globe. And through the years of people arriving—whether it's in Ellis Island or Angel Island or coming over the Rio Grande; some cases, coming not of their own accord—we've become something more than just the sum of our parts. We've become Americans together. And there's something special about that: all races, all faiths, all traditions, all orientations, all marching together under that same proud flag. Not bound by a creed or a color, but by our devotion to an enduring set of ideals: That we're all created equal, that we can think and worship and love as we please, and that we can pursue our own version of happiness.\nThat's a great gift. That's what makes us strong. And I want to, as a consequence, take a minute to thank some people who paved the way to create that sense that we're in this together. We're honored to have here the legendary Tommie Smith and John Carlos here today. Where are they? [Applause] Proud of them. Their powerful silent protest in the 1968 Games was controversial, but it woke folks up and created greater opportunity for those that followed. And they're now in the brand new Museum of African American History and Culture. You can see their cleats. And near their statue hangs the cleats of the great Jesse Owens, what he wore in the 1936 Games, so that every American can have a sense of the courage that he displayed.\nBut it wasn't just Jesse. It was other African American athletes in the middle of Nazi Germany under the gaze of Adolf Hitler that put a lie to notions of racial superiority—whupped them—[laughter]—and taught them a thing or two about democracy and taught them a thing or two about the American character. So we're honored to have many of their families here today. We want to acknowledge them as well.\nIn fact, Jesse Owens once said, \"The purpose of the Olympics is to do your best.\" And Michelle, Joe, and I want to thank all of you for not just doing your best but inspiring our best. Thanks for leading by example, not just every 4 years or when the cameras are on, but every single day.\nSo congratulations. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.

Securing a bright future for America's daughters and sons requires us to continue expanding access to quality health care and working to foster cleaner, safer, and more supportive environments. On Child Health Day, we renew our strong commitment to protecting and empowering our children by giving them the tools, resources, and knowledge they need to grow into healthy and productive adults.\nMy Administration has made children's health a top priority throughout the past 8 years. Through First Lady Michelle Obama's Let's Move! initiative, we have worked to bring parents, schools, and communities together to reduce childhood obesity by increasing access to affordable and nutritious food, and by encouraging physical activity early on in life. Parents and guardians serve as role models when it comes to forming healthy habits, and they can help their children learn to make smart choices that will shape their lifestyles for years to come.\nThanks to the Affordable Care Act, no child can be denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition, and millions of young people are able to remain on a parent's insurance plan until age 26. Cancer touches the lives of millions of Americans, and pediatric cancer remains the leading cause of death by disease among children. Earlier this year, I called on Vice President Joe Biden to lead the White House Cancer Moonshot Task Force—a collaborative effort that is striving to make a decade's worth of progress in preventing, diagnosing, and treating cancer in just 5 years and is dedicated to ending cancer as we know it.\nSupporting our children's emotional and mental health is just as critical as protecting their physical health. Bullying touches the lives of young people across our country and can affect their mental health, and we are committed to providing parents and schools with the support they need to address harassment—because no child should be hurt, and no child should feel ashamed because of who they are.\nAs we face growing environmental threats, it is our responsibility to combat climate change and protect our planet for future generations. That is why we have taken concrete steps to address carbon pollution and advocate for cleaner energy options. Through the Paris Climate Agreement, we are joining with nearly 200 countries to adopt ambitious measures that will reduce carbon pollution across the globe. By taking unprecedented action to protect the air we breathe and the water we drink, we are striving to reduce the harmful effects that climate change can have on our children, including the potential for higher incidence of asthma attacks, and other health problems exacerbated by dirty air.\nThis Child Health Day, we are reminded that the well-being of America's children is in our hands and that it is our responsibility to keep building a society that will allow them to thrive. Let us reaffirm our belief in the notion that all children should be able to live a healthy and happy life—no matter where they come from or what they look like—and let us continue reaching for a future where all our children are limited by nothing but the size of their dreams. The Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 18, 1928, as amended (36 U.S.C. 105), has called for the designation of the first Monday in October as Child Health Day and has requested that the President issue a proclamation in observance of this day.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Monday, October 3, 2016, as Child Health Day. I call upon families, educators, health professionals, faith-based and community organizations, and all levels of government to help ensure America's children are healthy.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-09-29", "title": "Proclamation 9506—Child Health Day, 2016"}

Since then, we have brought under one roof law enforcement, intelligence, and military experts at the Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell, where they work side-by-side to develop and pursue recovery strategies.  Moreover, the President designated a Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, who coordinates our diplomatic efforts abroad.  The interagency Hostage Response Group is ensuring that all of the elements put into place last year are working together as a team and receiving any guidance and oversight that they need.\nTo ensure that the U.S. Government implemented these important reforms effectively and continued to identify areas for improvement, the Executive Order required that a status report be completed one year after it was signed. That report was produced this summer by the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) and after discussions with key stakeholders on how best to incorporate their feedback the report is being made public today. The report concludes that last year's institutional and policy changes have had a positive impact on hostage recovery efforts. Where the report identifies work yet to be done or improvements still to be made, departments and agencies have already begun work to implement the recommendations and will continue to seek ways to improve our hostage recovery efforts.\nWhile we know that we cannot prevent every hostage situation, we are fully committed to the safe recovery of our fellow citizens and the provision of unfailing support to their families. With the reforms we have made over the last year, the U.S. Government is now well postured to ensure that hostage recovery activities will remain an enduring priority from administration to administration.", "timestamp": "2016-09-30", "title": "Press Release - Statement by NSC Spokesperson Ned Price on the Status Report on the Implementation of Executive Order 13698 Hostage Recovery Activities"}

{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "note": "Speech as delivered.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119150", "text": "\"Thank you! Whoa! Thank you so much. And I am so happy to be here in Coral Springs, in Broward County, in the great state of Florida! And I know there's a big overflow crowd in the next building over. I think they can see and hear us, but I wanted to thank them for being part of today's event.\nAnd I've got to recognize Joshua Simmons, who just introduced me. He is a civics teacher at Pompano Beach Middle School, and boy, are his students lucky to have him and his enthusiasm. And I want to also commend him for talking about his mother and how hard she worked, and his sister who he helped to raise. We really are stronger together, and that starts in families and neighborhoods and communities.\nWell, you heard from a lot of my friends who represent you, starting with my great friend and former colleague, your Senator Bill Nelson. And I am looking forward to working with Bill as we make sure to continue the progress that will move us all forward together. And I sure hope Florida sends some reinforcements to the Senate and elect Congressman Patrick Murphy. I think Florida deserves a full-time senator, don't you? And I want to thank my friend, someone who has just worked her heart out not just for her constituents but for Democrats across America – Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. And another great friend of mine going back more years than we care to remember – I'm so pleased he's here with us – Congressman Alcee Hastings. And I know that Congressman Ted Deutch, who represents this district – is over in Israel for the funeral of a great, great man, Shimon Peres, and I want to thank Ted for all of his support and his hard work.\nBefore I get started and really talk about everything that's at stake and what we have to do the next 39 days to make sure we win this election, I wanted to say a few words about the tragic passing of Jose Fernandez. When he left Cuba, he did not speak a word of English. He didn't let that stop him. He pursued his dreams. He wanted to and he became one of the best baseball players that Miami has ever seen. And he never forgot where he came from. He worked hard to give back to the community that had given so much to him. Jose's life really embodied the American dream, and at 24 years of age, he was just getting started. I'm sure you join me in saying that our thoughts and our prayers are with his family, with his fans, and everyone whose life he touched during his extraordinary career.\nI also want to mention another resident of Coral Springs, and that's a man named Bob Levinson. My heart goes out to Bob's family. He disappeared in Iran more than nine years ago, and it is long past time for the Iranian regime to provide us information about his whereabouts and let him return home to his family.\nNow, did any of you see the debate the other night? Well, I think it was pretty clear there are two very different choices for our country based on two very different visions of the kind of America that we want to have. My view is we are already great, and if we work together, we will become even greater in the years ahead. I believe America is an exceptional nation. My opponent believes America is in decline. I've never heard such a dark and divisive, terrible image of our country coming from someone running to be president of the United States. When he talks, I lots of times don't even recognize the country he's talking about. And why are we already great? Well, it is not just because of the size of our economy or the size of our military. It is because of our generosity; it is because of our ingenuity; it is because of the diversity of our country. I think our diversity is one of our strongest assets.\nThis morning, I laid out my plan for more national service so that more people of all ages can serve America, serve their communities. Because America is great, when you really strip it all down, because America is good. And we can't ever forget that.\nI have laid out specific plans about how we're going to make our country even greater. I've actually got a book here with Tim Kaine, my running mate. I have this old-fashioned idea: if I'm asking you for your vote for president, I should tell you what I'm going to do. I shouldn't just talk in generalities and use rhetoric and never answer questions about what we can do, but to lay out how we're going to make the economy work for everyone, not just those at the top.\nThat means new jobs – new jobs with rising incomes, jobs in infrastructure, jobs in advanced manufacturing, in innovation and technology, and yes, clean, renewable energy jobs.\nMy opponent's only infrastructure plan is to build a wall. I love that he went down to Mexico and he choked. He didn't even raise it. He's been going around telling people for months, 'We're going to build a wall and we're going to make Mexico pay for it.' So he's sitting with the president of Mexico and he doesn't even bring it up. He finds it a lot easier to insult women than to talk to the president of Mexico about building a wall. I mean, really, who gets up at 3 o'clock in the morning to engage in a Twitter attack against a former Miss Universe? I mean, he hurled as many insults as he could. Really, why does he do things like that? I mean, his latest Twitter meltdown is unhinged, even for him. It proves yet again that he is temperamentally unfit to be president and commander-in-chief. I have said it before and I'll say it again: A man who can be provoked by a tweet should not be anywhere near the nuclear codes.\nSo I'm going to keep talking about what we can do together after this election. Getting those new jobs. And I'll tell you, another area I want to emphasize is small business. As I said the other night, my dad was a small businessman. He made a lot of sacrifice and he worked really hard to give us a good, solid, middle-class life. I'm really proud of that. And I'm sure glad he never got a contract from Donald Trump, who stiffs small businesses, doesn't pay his bills to people like my dad. But we need to do more to get small business started and growing – here in Broward County, throughout South Florida, across the state, and beyond.\nSo as we grow the economy, we also have to make it fairer. I want prosperity to reach everyone, not just the privileged few. So we are going to raise the minimum wage be-cause if you work full-time, you should not still be in poverty. And you know, two-thirds of all minimum wage workers are women, most of them supporting kids. And if you work full-time on a minimum wage job, at the end of the year you've made $15,000. I think we can do better. And I think we should because we want everybody to have a chance to get ahead and stay ahead and go as far as their hard work and talent will take them.\nSomething else we're going to do is we are finally going to guarantee equal pay for women's work. Now, this is not, my friends, just a women's issue. If you have a mother, a wife, a daughter, a sister, who is working, it's your issue, too, to make sure she is paid fairly. That will raise family incomes.\nAnd then the third thing I want to do is to make sure – to make sure – more companies share profits with the workers who helped to create those profits in the first place. The other night at the debate, one of my guests was Mark Cuban. He was sitting in the front row. And one of the reasons I was proud to have him there is he believes in profit-sharing. He's always, in his companies, shared profits. And by the way, he is a real billionaire. And when he sold his first company, he shared the profits from the sale and 300 people who worked for him, who helped to make him a success, became millionaires. I want to lift up and use as examples business leaders like that, not somebody who stiffs contractors, who doesn't pay dishwashers and painters and plumbers and glass installers and architects and marble installers and so many else, but somebody who has the right attitude, that we're stronger together in business just like we are in government and America.\nAnd the other thing we have to do more of is to make sure that we help deal with some of the stresses that American families are facing. It is hard to balance family and work, isn't it? I think we can do better. I want to see us have paid family leave, earned sick days, affordable childcare, and affordable college that includes tuition-free and debt-free college.\nNow, after the primary was over – and Senator Sanders and I ran a tough primary, but you know what? I was really proud. We ran a campaign based on issues, not insults. He and I got together and we said, okay, what are we going to do to make sure that more young people can actually get a college education? Because right now, it's way beyond what a lot of families can afford. And if you go into debt, you come out of it with so much debt that remains a burden on you.\nSo the other day Senator Sanders and I were up in New Hampshire together, and we were rolling out our plan. And it's pretty simple. You can go to my website, but let me just tell you briefly. If you are in a family that makes less than $125,000, you will not pay tuition to go to a public college or university. And if you make more than that, you will pay what you can afford, but you will not have to borrow money because it will be debt-free for you to go. And we put together a calculator on my website. You can go to hillaryclinton.com/ calculator and you can see how much you will save, how much your child or your grandchild would save under this plan.\nBut I also believe a four-year college degree, which is an important part of getting an education to get ahead, should not leave you mired in debt. So we are going to help you refinance your debt, get the interest rates down, and if you're willing to do public service, national service, we're going to forgive your debt over time.\nBut not everyone has to go for a four-year degree. I want every person, not just young people but people who are looking for a different opportunity or may have to retrain – I want to everybody to have a chance for a good, solid job. I think we made a mistake when we took vocational education out of high school. We need to put technical education back into high school.\nAnd we need to make sure that community colleges are free so that young people starting in high school can take courses at community college to get the training they need for a good job. And I want to see business and labor unions working together for real apprenticeship programs – not the kind that lead to being told, 'You're fired,' the kind that lead to being told, 'You're hired.'\nNow, I'm excited about this. I really am. I am confident and optimistic about our country. We never get anything done if all we do is get down in the mouth and feel bad and complain and try to blame somebody for something else. That's not who we are as Americans. We need to lift ourselves up, and we need to roll up our sleeves to get to work to make sure that future is what it should be for our country.\nAnd while we're doing that, we're going to make sure that our country's safe and that America provides strong and steady leadership around the world. Sometimes, when I listen to my opponent, it kind of seems he doesn't know who our friends are versus our adversaries. He has this weird fascination with dictators. He's kind of signed up for the Vladimir Putin wish list. He doesn't care whether NATO falls apart, and he is really cavalier about other countries getting nuclear weapons. He said he doesn't care. Let Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia, get a nuclear weapon. Whoa! That's the kind of dangerous, reckless talk that people around the world pay attention to.\nAs I told him in the debate – he actually said, 'Well, we may or may not defend our allies in Asia.' Words matter. And America's word matters. We have to be reliable and trustworthy. People have to count on us. And we've got a lot of work to do around the world. We need to work hard for peace and prosperity. We need to tackle climate change together.\nClimate change is real. Florida knows that. My opponent thinks it's a hoax created by the Chinese. And what that means is he would not be able to take advantage of the economic opportunities that climate change presents. You see, some country's going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st Century. I think it's going to be either China, Germany, or us. I want it to be us, and it can be us if we make up our minds for that to happen. Let's deploy a half a billion more solar panels. Let's produce enough clean energy so that every home in America can be powered by it. There's so much we can do together. And that means we've got to work with other countries and we've got to demonstrate that we support our allies, whether they're in Europe, the Middle East with Israel, or Asia, that we stand with those who stand with us.\nAnd then, finally, one of the next priorities that I have if I am so fortunate enough as to be your president is to bring our country together. I've got to tell you, look, disagreements, political disagreements, that's fine. That's who we are. I don't know any two people in America who agree on everything politically with each other. And I've known, been fortunate enough to know, a number of our more recent presidents. I didn't always agree with them either, including my husband. But I'll tell you this: Republicans and Democrats alike, I never doubt they were trying to put the country's interests first. They were trying to bring people together, not pit us against each other. And one of the things I will do from the very beginning, the very first day of my administration...\"\nAudience Member: \"Day one.\"\nClinton: \"...is to make them day one – you're right – is to make sure everybody in the country knows I'm the president of every American, every single per-son.\nNow – so in order for me to do any of this, anything that's in this book and making sure that it's paid for by the wealthy and corporations who have to pay their fair share finally, all of that, depends upon whether we win in November. The stakes could not be higher. So here is what I am asking all of you. How many of you know you are registered to vote? So we need to get everybody to be registered at your current address by October 11th. If you've moved, you may need to reregister. Here's how you can find out if you are registered. You can go to iwillvote.com, iwillvote.com. You put in your name. You put in your address and make sure you're registered. If you need to get registered, we have volunteers here. Right? And they will – they have – they have clipboards. We're kind of low-tech about it. They have clipboards. They can help you get registered right here and now or, as I say, you can go to iwillvote.com and check your registration. And, remember, you can vote by mail starting October 24th here in Broward. And the other thing you can do is convince everybody you know to make sure they're registered and to help them know how to vote by mail so they could get their vote in without making any fuss or inconvenience.\nSo make no mistake. This election is going to be close. They always are. So every call you make, every door you knock on, every person you register could make the difference. So I'm asking you to go ahead and text JOIN, text JOIN, J?O?I?N, to 47246 to get involved or go to hillaryclinton.com. And you can volunteer and become involved. If we win Broward County by as big a margin as we should win it, we win Florida.\nAnd, like I say, I'm not just excited about winning an election. I'm excited about doing the work. I'm excited about listening to Americans. I'll continue to travel our country. I'll be here in Florida so much you'll get sick of me because I want to be a good partner for Florida. I mean, Florida is already suffering from climate change, and you have a governor who ordered the state government never to say the word or write the phrase. That's kind of hard to believe. So there's a lot we're going to do together: jobs, rising incomes, opportunities. And that's what gets me excited.\nSo here's what I hope you will do. When you leave here, if somebody says, 'Where were you this afternoon?' you say, 'Oh, I went to a rally for Hillary Clinton.' If they say, 'Oh, that's great,\" get them registered. If they say, 'Oh, my gosh. How can you do that?' if they're seriously thinking about voting for my opponent, stage an intervention, really, because, remember, remember, friends don't let friends vote for Trump. And what we believe and what we're going to prove on November 8th is love trumps hate. Thank you all so much.\"", "timestamp": "2016-09-30", "title": "Remarks at Coral Springs Gymnasium in Coral Springs, Florida"}

Secretary Clinton was introduced by Eileen Clark, a retired nurse.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119151", "text": "\"Hello! Thank you! Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you so very much. Wow, what – what a wonderful welcome. It is great to be here in Fort Pierce in this beautiful theater. I love being in the Sunshine State. I really want to recognize a few people: U.S. Congresswoman Lois Frankel is here as you saw, Randy Perkins, a candidate for Congress, Kim Johnson, chair of the St. Lucie County Commission, Larry Lee Jr., state representative. Everyone, all of the elected officials, all of the students and young people, it is wonderful to be with you.\nAnd I want to thank Eileen for her introduction. We know how hard that nurses like Eileen work, and now that she is retired, she is volunteering for our campaign. This woman never quit, and Eileen, we are so glad you are on our team.\nI am grateful to all of the elected officials, all of the commissioners, the county commissioners, Martin County, St. Lucie, for all you do for the community, but especially for all you did this summer to clean up the algae that polluted the water, that threatened wildlife and made life hard for local residents and businesses. This is a serious and complicated problem, isn't it, for the entire Treasure Coast. And it is a reminder, if we needed it, how important good leadership is. So, I thank all the leaders for their commitment.\nNow, there are just 39 days between now and November 8th. Just 39 days left in the most important election in our lifetimes.\nWe've got to make every single day count. We have to get more people registered to vote, get more people committed to turn out to vote. We have to drive home the stakes in this election: stronger families, safer communities and an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. And underneath all of the rhetoric and the coverage and the back and forth, this campaign really comes down to two questions. What kind of future we want for ourselves, our kids and our grandkids, and how do we make it a reality?\nNow, as I said it the other night – how many of you saw the debate?\nWell as I said, I now have two grandchildren, and no offense to anybody, the two most wonderful, amazing, extraordinary. A little girl and a little boy. So I think a lot about the future. And you may have noticed that my opponent and I have different views about – well, nearly everything when it gets right down to it – not just about what makes America great, because I think America already is great – but about what we should do to make it even greater, and about that basic question about how progress happens at all.\nMy opponent believes in what I call a 'strongman approach.' He stood on that stage at his convention and described a hopeless, broken nation. I am sorry, I am looking at you. I don't see that. That in no way resembles the strong, vibrant America I know. And here's what he said. He said, 'I alone can fix it.' I alone?\nWell, we have learned that that's his way. One person getting supreme power and exercising it ruthlessly. That's why he admires dictators like Vladimir Putin so much. But that's not how change happens in America. It's never just one person, not even someone as powerful as the president. Every good our country has ever achieved has always happened because people have worked together to make it a reality. Not just the wealthy or the powerful – all of us.\nWe see that every day across America, and I bet many of you have been a part of it. Maybe you taught kids to read, right? Or cleaned up your local park, or the beach, maybe you have organized a cancer walk, or you have run a food drive. Whatever it is, chances are you have done something to serve your community. And by extension, your country.\nHow many of you – just think back over your lives – how many of you have performed some kind of service of some sort for your community, for other people. The reason I know you have is because tens and tens of millions of Americans do some kind of volunteering in your hometowns every single year. It's one of the best things about the American people. We are doers. We don't just shrug our shoulders when we see something that needs fixing, we don't get resigned or pathetic, or blame other people and turn on each other to find scapegoats. We roll up our sleeves, we get to work to try to make things better in our neighborhood, our community, our city, our state, our country.\nThis has been our story, the American story, since the beginning of our nation, and it is still going strong today. Now, for many Americans, including a lot of you here, serving our country has included serving in our Armed Forces.\nPeople are starting to call out their services!\nThere is no greater service or sacrifice, and we are grateful to our men and women in uniform, to their families and our veterans every single day. But what's so great is that national service can take many different forms, and it's something that I believe in so deeply, that every stage of our lives gives us the chance, from grade school through grandparenthood, to find a way to give back.\nWe've got folks here today from AmeriCorps, which my husband created back in 1993, and I'll tell you, to this day, it is one of his proudest achievements. Because very day, AmeriCorps volunteers are out there. They're building houses, responding to natural disasters, helping people with disabilities find jobs, find safe places to live, and next week, on October 7th, AmeriCorps will celebrate a major milestone: their one-millionth member. I'll tell you, Bill is really excited about this and so am I. And by the way, AmeriCorps has one of the best swearing in pledges I have ever heard. Here's how it starts: 'I will get things done for America.' Isn't that great? I think we should make that a national slogan.\nNow we also have folks here today from City Year, which is part of AmeriCorps. And every day, they're working with students who are risk of dropping out of school. They're tutoring and mentoring and running after school clubs – all to help young people really discover how capable they really are and to be empowered and to stay in school. I'm really grateful to them.\nWe also have people here today from the Peace Corps, which represents the best of America to the world. Peace Corps volunteers are teaching English in Kosovo, staffing health centers in Nicaragua, supporting farmers in Nepal, distributing malaria nets in Uganda. Both as First Lady and as Secretary of State, I got to see the results of their work first hand. They are making the world a healthier, more prosperous and more peaceful place. Now, maybe not all of you have been a part of one of these programs, but I know you serve in different ways.\nMaybe you volunteer through your school, or with your church or synagogue. Maybe you find through faith-based opportunities, as I did when I was a teenager, service opportunities. Because for many Americans, service is part of our faith. My running mate, Tim Kaine, volunteered in Honduras with Jesuits as a young man, and it changed his life. Or maybe your whole family volunteers together, Bill and Chelsea and I, every holiday season, would work at a food bank back in Arkansas. However you serve, it feels good, doesn't it? To be part of something bigger than ourselves. To take our time and labor, and put it towards something good that can happen in our country and the world.\nAnd you know something very interesting? Service makes us happier, it makes us healthier, and there are studies proving that. It's not just how we feel, they've actually followed people. It can also help us find our next job, or our true calling in life. It's a smart way to use our greatest asset in life, our people. And service does something important for us as a society. Too often, we Americans can become separated from each other, and I think a lot of people are feeling this way during this election.\nIt's easy to surround ourselves with only those that think like us, talk like us, look like us, read the same news as us, that's understandable to an extent. But it comes with a cost because it magnifies our differences, which then makes it harder to put those differences aside when our community or country needs us. There aren't many places where people of all ages, all races, all backgrounds, all beliefs come together in common cause. But service is one of them, and that's one of the reasons I think it's so valuable, because in addition to the good work it does, it helps us reconnect with each other to feel more a part of our shared American life.\nI believe that one of the jobs of President is to encourage more service, to help more Americans answer President Kennedy's call. You know it: Ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country.'\nBut sometimes it's hard to figure out. How do you make a difference, especially with everything else going on in our lives? And too often volunteering becomes something only people with lots of time and financial security can do. But that's not how it should be. Everyone should be able to contribute.\nSo what if we, as a country, made it easier for everybody to do that, for everybody to give back? What if we created more service opportunities for Americans of all ages, invested in programs that work and encouraged entrepreneurs to add a social component to their businesses? What if we strengthened the culture of service in America so it wasn't just something that we did one day a year, but it became a regular part of our lives. I think that would reflect our values and would tap into something so great about America.\nI talk a lot about how America is an exceptional nation. We're not exceptional just be-cause of the size of our military or the size of our economy. We're exceptional because of the generosity and ingenuity of our people.\nWay back, nearly 200 years ago, a Frenchman came to the United States, his name was Alexis de Tocqueville. He was travelling around, trying to figure out, 'What is this new place called America? They fought a revolution. Who are they?' And he saw how we had set up our government, and we had three branches, and everything that our founders really put into place. But the thing that made the biggest impression on him was our spirit of volunteerism that made a democracy as diverse and ambitious as ours possible. If I'm elected president this fall, I want to build on that strength by making a major push in support of more national service. So here's what I plan to do.\nFirst, let's triple AmeriCorps. That was the goal of my friend and the great Senator Ted Kennedy. It was laid out in a law named in his honor, the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act. It's finally time we get it done. Every year there are hundreds of thousands of more applications for AmeriCorps than there are spots in the program, so if we grow the program from 75,000 annual members to 250,000, we're going to give more people who already want to serve the chance to do so.\nThen I want to double the college scholarships that AmeriCorps members earn through their service, and I want to find ways for more students to get college credit for service because I know too many talented, committed young people who pass up serving with AmeriCorps because, with their student loans, they can't afford it. So let's lighten that burden. If you do national service, we will begin a program to forgive your loans, because you are giving back to your country. And let's keep working to the ultimate goal of making it possible for any American to serve full time if they want to.\nNow second, let's grow the Peace Corps. Since President Kennedy launched it 55 years ago, it's given nearly a quarter of a million Americans the experience of a lifetime, and it's fostered friendship and cooperation between Americans and people in more than 100 nations. We've got to do more of that in the world today. We need more Americans of all ages around the world showing our values, serving people. So let's make it possible for more Americans to be a part of this extraordinary program.\nThird, let's expand service opportunities for people of all ages. Right? Now, let's be fair, the younger generation is way ahead on this. I've talked to so many young people who are deeply thoughtful about how your lives impact others and the world. Service isn't just something to do to check a box before graduation, it really is woven into your lives. And many who are just getting started in your careers, say that having a social impact is more important to you than getting a job that yes, may pay a salary but doesn't give you any meaning or purpose in your lives.\nNow I also want to get older Americans more involved. Service isn't something only students and young people do. I know that. So I intend to make sure that 10 percent of AmeriCorps slots go to Americans over the age of 55. Let's give people an encore opportunity after they've ended their formal careers so they can apply a lifetime of knowledge and experience to a stronger community.\nAnd finally, I want to create a new means for people to serve in serious, meaningful ways without a full time commitment. AmeriCorps is a full time commitment. The Peace Corps is a full time commitment. The Armed Forces are a full time commitment. But the Armed Forces has another model. The Reserves – right? It gives people the chance to make a high impact contribution while still building careers and pursuing their dreams in other ways. So let's do something like that in the civilian space. Let's call it the National Service Reserve.\nAnd here's the idea. If you join the National Service Reserve, you will receive some basic training, just like you would in the military reserves, and then when your city or state needs you, you'll get the call. Say a natural disaster strikes and the Red Cross needs all hands on deck. Or maybe, like the crisis in Flint, and clean water has to be distributed every day to a lot of families. Or maybe your city launches a major public health campaign to reduce drug abuse or promote mental health. You will then be sent into action. Now some of these assignments maybe just be for a few days, a month, some might be longer term. But they will directly address a vital need in your own community.\nAnd one of the other advantages is you can help meet that need while still being a full-time student, having a job, taking care of your family. You won't have to make service your only priority. Our goal is 5 million people spread across all 50 states, and we will have an open door to people of all ages, but we want to put a special focus on people under 30 who've said again and again they want to have a bigger impact in their communities, but they can't leave their jobs, understandably. We'll work with governors and mayors, Republicans and Democrats, because I want this to be a true bipartisan, public-private partnership.\nI also want to include businesses, colleges and universities who have unique resources to offer. And because we want workers and students to know that as they make this contribution, their schools and their employers will have their backs. I really think a National Service Reserve could make a difference for cities and states. There's so much work to be done and so many people who want to help do it. So let's bridge that divide, get people working together in ways that can help communities.\nNow, I don't think you'll hear anything about this from my opponent. And you know what? I think that's a shame, because national service has always been a bipartisan goal. Of course, President Kennedy started the Peace Corps and my husband started AmeriCorps – but President Nixon signed the Domestic Volunteer Service Act. President George H.W. Bush created the White House Office of National Service. And both President George W. Bush and President Obama have been huge champions of service. This should be something that we all can get behind. And when you listen to what's being said in this campaign, it can be discouraging, right? It can seem hard to find any common ground so it makes it even more important that we come together where, whenever we can. Now, I am well aware that candidates don't usually focus on national service in the final stretch of a hotly fought presidential election. Some might say, 'Well hey, my gosh, you've only got 39 days to go. Why aren't you just out there beating up on your opponent and doing everything to get the vote out and all the rest of it? Well, I'll do that, but – I've been thinking about this for a long time, and I did not want this campaign to end without talking about it because it means a lot to me. I'm trying to end the campaign focusing on issues that are really close to my heart – and this is one of them.\nThank you!\nFor me, service is really all about fulfilling the instruction of my Methodist faith, and you can see part of the creed I like to follow behind me: 'Do all the good you can, in all the ways you can, in all the places you can, at all the times you can, to all the people you can, as long as ever you can.' Now, I've carried those words with me ever since I heard them as a little girl, and it's an idea that really got into my head and my heart. But you know what's kept me going are the people that I've met. And in a country founded on liberty and equality, I can't think of a more important notion than every one of us is valuable. We all deserve respect. We all should listen to each other. We all can make our mark on the world. And when we come together in common purpose, we can do so much more than we could ever do on our own.\nThat's why 'Stronger Together' is more than just a slogan. It's a course of action. So here's what I want to do. I want you to hear me pledge that this will be a vital aspect of my presidency. And I want you to help me bring our nation together – to solve our problems, strengthen our communities. To join with people across America who care about service, because this speaks to both what is great and good about the United States. America is great because we are good. There are lots of examples. We are going to be putting examples up on my website of people who have served and who are inspirations. But I want everybody here to know that it can be done. We can do more, and we can provide the opportunities to enlist more people.\nThere are so many examples in this community and communities across America – 39 days left. This is the choice: do we lift each other up, or do we tear each other down? Do we listen and respect each other, or do we scapegoat, point fingers, and insult each other? Well, I'll tell you what side I'm going to be on, and with your help, we're going to demonstrate on November 8th, what kind of country we really are.\nThank you and God bless you!\"", "timestamp": "2016-09-30", "title": "Remarks at Sunrise Theatre in Fort Pierce, Florida"}

It is time to rebuild Michigan. It is time to rebuild the United States of America.\nHillary Clinton has made a living raking in donations from special interests that have ripped the jobs right out of Michigan. These are the people whose policies raided the jobs from Detroit. That's how she gets rich – by taking your jobs and your money away from you.\nThat's why Hillary Clinton, if she ever got the chance, would 100% approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The deal she called the \"Gold Standard.\" The TPP will economically devastate Michigan, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and so many other states across this country.\nHillary Clinton's donors want the TPP – and their wish is her command.\nThese special interests pay her for speeches. They pay her Foundation. They pay her husband. In return, they GET YOUR JOBS. Like I've been saying all week, when it comes to Hillary Clinton, all you have to do is remember these words: FOLLOW THE MONEY.\nHillary Clinton praised or pushed TPP on 45 separate occasions. Her close associate and confidant, Terry McAuliffe, said she'd pass it. Her husband has talked it up. Everyone knows she's for it, because she doesn't believe in protecting American Sovereignty.\nHillary Clinton only believes in protecting one thing: her donors.\nOf the 262 companies that lobbied for the passage of TPP, 82 or nearly 1 in 3 donated between $21 and $67 million to the Clinton Foundation.\n9 companies that lobbied for the passage of TPP paid Hillary Clinton $2.7 million for paid speeches.\nOf the 12 signatory countries that are parties to TPP, 3 gave between $6 and $15 million to the Clinton Foundation.\nAt least 4 lobbyists who are actively lobbying for TPP passage have raised more than $800,000 for her campaign.\nOn November 8th, We are going to end the Clinton Corruption and we are going to do something that has been a long, long time coming: WE ARE GOING TO PUT AMERICA FIRST.\nHillary Clinton is an insider fighting only for herself and for her donors.\nI am an outsider fighting for you.\nHillary Clinton is the one who rigged the system.\nWe are the ones who are going to change the system so it's fair and just for every American.\nWe have a movement. The corrupt establishment is panicking because they know how hard it is to stop us. The news anchors and the donors and the lobbyists who are used to getting their way are trying to do everything they can to help Hillary Clinton and to cling to their power and prestige.\nThe arrogant political class doesn't believe in protecting jobs and wages for Americans.\nThey don't believe in secure borders and strong walls.\nThese Washington and Wall Street insiders don't believe in hiring more police, producing more American energy, or giving school choice to poor children trapped in failing schools.\nFor decades, we've talked about the corruption, incompetence, and failures of our leaders. 2016 is our long-awaited chance to fix the problem – and to hold our politicians accountable. If you do this one simple thing, you can deliver justice for every single person who has been wronged by the system: show up and vote.\nWhen you cast that ballot, just picture a Wall Street boardroom filled with the special interests who have been bleeding this county dry, and imagine the look on their faces when you tell all of them: you're fired.\nIn their place, will be a new government. We are the Party of Abraham Lincoln, and once again, we will have a government of, by and for the people.\nWe are going to do it together. In 39 days, everything is going to change.\nNow, the media doesn't want to talk about Hillary Clinton and her corruption. So we are going to spell it out for them today.\nThe large corporations who support terrible trade deals that ship your jobs overseas – they are donating to Hillary Clinton.\nFollow the money.\nThe Wall Street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class – they are donating to Hillary Clinton.\nFollow the money.\nThe wealthy donors who want to shut down American energy – they are donating to Hillary Clinton.\nFollow the money.\nThe special interests who want open borders are donating to Hillary Clinton.\nFollow the money.\nIn her campaign for President, Hillary Clinton has received $100 million dollars in contributions from Wall Street and the hedge funds.\nShe and Bill were paid $150 million for speeches since Bill left the Oval Office.\nThe same groups paying Bill and Hillary for their speeches were lobbying the federal government.\nTwenty-two groups paying Bill Clinton for speeches lobbied the State Department while Hillary was Secretary of State.\nFavors and access were granted to those who wrote checks.\nShe put the office of Secretary of State up for sale – and if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too.\nShe deleted and bleached 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena. 13 phones missing, several destroyed with a hammer. Her staffers taking the fifth amendment, and her ringleaders getting immunity deals. Foreign enemies with easy access to hack her server. Lies to Congress, under oath, about turning over her work-related emails.\nWe are going to call them the FBI Immunity Five. So here's my question for Hillary Clinton: can you promise that not one of the five people who were granted criminal immunity will ever be allowed to serve in a Clinton Administration?\nAnd here is the demand I am making today to President Obama: will you pledge, here and now, not to issue a pardon to Hillary Clinton and her co-conspirators for their many crimes against our country and society itself?\nNo one is above the law. Not even Hillary Clinton.\nClinton and her cronies will say anything, do anything, lie about anything to keep their grip on\npower – to keep their control over this country.\nRemember the Clinton pardon of fugitive Marc Rich, in exchange for unknown and undisclosed amounts of money?\nThe American people have had it with years, decades, of Clinton Corruption and scandals. They are tired of the lies, they are tired of the trivial politics, they are tired of being talked down to, looked down upon, and treated like second class citizens.\nThis will be the year the American people say: Enough is enough.\nHillary Clinton has been a disaster for so many communities, but especially for African-American communities. I don't think African-Americans are going to come out and vote for Clinton – they are too smart, and they know they are being used. They also know that she'll do nothing for them once the election is over – she never does, and that will never change. Many of them will never forget her calling young African-American men \"super-predators.\"\nTo the African-American community, let me ask you this question: are you better off than you were eight years ago? If not, vote for Donald Trump. I will bring jobs, great education, and safe neighborhoods.\nIf you keep voting for the same people, you will keep getting the same results.\nLook at what the Democrats have done to Detroit. Half of Detroit residents do not work. Nearly 40% of the city lives in poverty. It's the second most dangerous city in America, according to the FBI.\nThis is the legacy of the policies embraced by Hillary Clinton.\nA Trump Administration will bring prosperity to all of our people.\nMy economic agenda can be summed up with three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.\nWe are going to pass the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan.\nEvery wasteful and unnecessary regulation will be eliminated.\nWe will unleash the power of American energy.\nThe catastrophe known as Obamacare will be repealed and replaced.\nAnd the disastrous trade deals, like NAFTA, that have caused so much pain in Michigan, will be renegotiated – and we will bring back your auto-manufacturing.\nMichigan has lost more than 1 in 3 of its manufacturing jobs since the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance into the WTO – both deals pushed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton.\nBefore NAFTA went into effect, there were 280,000 auto workers in Michigan. Today, that number is only 160,000.\nFord is moving its small car production to Mexico.\nIt used to be that the cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Today, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint.\nHillary Clinton also gave us the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, which has cost this country another 100,000 jobs.\nHillary opposed the Korea deal when she was running for President in 2007. She campaigned right here in Michigan and said the Korea deal \"will hurt the us auto industry, increase our trade deficit, cost us good middle-class jobs and make America less competitive.\" She pledged to reject the deal.\nBut she lied to all of you, just like she lied about her emails.\nOnce installed as Secretary of State, she supported it and called it a \"cutting-edge deal.\" She rammed it through to adoption – she always does whatever the donors tell her to do, no matter how it impacts our families, schools and communities.\nThe U.S. trade deficit with Korea in the top ten products that Michigan exports to Korea grew 54 percent as exports fell and imports rose. This is what Hillary Clinton did to your state.\nAccording to the Economic Policy Institute, Michigan ranks first for jobs lost as a share of workforce due to the trade deficit with TPP members, and the country lost 740,000 manufacturing jobs as a result of that deficit last year. Just imagine how many more automobile jobs will be lost if the TPP is actually approved, as Hillary Clinton is planning to do.\nHillary Clinton is merely a vessel for the special interests trying to strip this country of its wealth, its jobs, and its status as a sovereign nation.\nShe even supports the disastrous surrender of America's control of the internet, which is happening tomorrow. Hillary Clinton's website says she supports the decision to give away the internet to a \"global community of stakeholders.\"\nSomeone needs to inform Hillary Clinton it's not the job of our leaders to represent a \"global community.\" It's the job of our leaders to represent American citizens. Losing control of the internet to other foreign entities is just one more way Obama-Clinton have sold out the citizens of this country.\nHillary Clinton is a globalist who will never protect the freedom and jobs of the American people.\nI am not running to be President of the World. I am running to be President of the United States of America.\nHave you ever wondered why it is that all the things that the American people want never seem to happen?\nThe reason for this is simple. It's because the financial interests who control our politics and our media don't want these changes to happen.\nHillary Clinton has been there for 30 years, and has never done anything for you and your\nfamily.\nJust look at how badly she messed up on the Iran deal. And, just today, we learned that on the same day as the hostages were released, the United States signed an agreement lifting sanctions on two Iranian banks involved in financing Iran's missile programs.\nHillary Clinton is there for only one reason, to protect her donors and collect their money.\nOur campaign is taking on big business, big media and big donors – we're taking them on for YOU. So you can have the future you want.\nOur campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives.\nThey're all part of the same corrupt political establishment. And they nod along when Hillary Clinton slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable.\nI call you hardworking American Patriots and together we are going to save this country.\nTogether, we can accomplish anything we want.\nBut that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th.\nYou have 39 days until the election. You have 39 days to make every dream you ever dreamed\nfor your country come true.\nDo Not Let This Chance Slip Away.\nYou have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this nation.\nThe arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the\nAmerican voter.\nOn November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back – Bigger and Better and Stronger than ever before.\nHere are just some of the great things that will happen for your country:\nWe are going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare more affordable; bring our manufacturing jobs back to Michigan; end illegal immigration; keep Radical Islamic terrorists out of our country; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\nWe will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.\nAmerican cars – made in Michigan – will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.\nAmerican steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.\nAmerican hands will rebuild this nation – and American energy, mined from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.\nWe will put new American steel into the spine of this country.\nI will fight for every neglected part of this nation – and I will fight to bring us all together as Americans.\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\nTo the people of Michigan, I promise you this –\nWe will make America wealthy again.\nWe will make America strong again.\nWe will make America safe again.\nAnd we will make America great again.\nThank you, and God Bless!", "timestamp": "2016-09-30", "title": "Remarks at the Suburban Collection Showplace in Novi, Michigan"}

Bush\n\"This plan proves Hillary Clinton knows–as I do–that picking up a soup spoon to feed the less fortunate or a hammer to rebuild homes for those devastated by natural disasters is another important way to serve our nation, just as so many do in uniform. We must honor and support all kinds of American service, whether it is in the military or civilian capacity. I look forward to working with our next President to enact policies like my 21st Century American Service Act that expand service opportunities to all those willing to serve, promote a culture of service and help make higher education more affordable for countless young people.\" – Congresswoman Tammy Duckworth, Iraq War Combat Veteran\n\"Every day, volunteers in programs like AmeriCorps are making a difference by serving in communities across America. Secretary Clinton's plan builds on national service success, meeting an unmet demand for service opportunities, expanding AmeriCorps and creating a National Service Reserve. Her proposals call on 5 million Americans to give back to their country and be a part of something bigger than themselves. These volunteers will tutor teens, start neighborhood crime watches, and help towns rebuild after disasters. Hillary knows that service is the very spirit of our country. She is committed to giving a new generation of Americans the opportunity to the answer the call to transform communities and transform lives.\" – Senator Barbara Mikulski\n\"I applaud Secretary Clinton's bold proposal to expand national service opportunities for young Americans through the creation of a National Service Reserve and the expansion of the AmeriCorps program. As someone who has launched and run both a national and a local AmeriCorps program, I've seen firsthand the transformative power that national service can play in communities and the lives of young people. This is the kind of plan that harnesses the passion and innovative thinking of young people through public service to address many of the challenges we face across our country.\" – Senator Chris Coons\n\"A republic cannot long survive if it defers to the few what is the responsibility of us all. It is a sad fact that less than 1% of the nation currently serves in the military, AmeriCorps, and other service organizations combined--though not for lack of interest. AmeriCorps alone regularly turns aside the vast majority of its applicants. I applaud Secretary Clinton's bold initiative to expand opportunities for these eager young Americans to give back to their country. In the wake of natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy, the flooding in Louisiana, or crises like that in Flint, Michigan, our volunteers are often the first boots on the ground. They are a vital part of our communities' efforts to rebuild and recover, and Secretary Clinton's plan is a clear win for both our country and our citizens.\" – Congressman John Larson\n\"Hillary Clinton's plan for a National Service Reserve demonstrates her commitment to our next generation of leaders. Since the creation of AmeriCorps 20 years ago...I have seen how it has positively shaped communities. Hillary's plan to significantly expand AmeriCorps will give more young people the opportunity to serve and carry on the spirit of service.\" – Congresswoman Doris Matsui\"It is no exaggeration to say that my life and career have been shaped by public service. While I have been recognized for this commitment, these experiences have given as much to me as I have to them. I attended college as a single mother and depended on welfare and TRIO to complete my education. After I graduated college, I wanted to do my part for the country that had given me so much. I became an AmeriCorps VISTA volunteer, working to start a community credit union. The confidence and community I gained from VISTA led me to run for Wisconsin State Assembly, which led me to the State Senate, and eventually the United States House of Representatives. Service begets service, and I am proud to see Hillary Clinton's efforts to not only expand the opportunity for all Americans to serve, but work so that service is economically viable for all -- through living allowances and college scholarships. This proposal will not only benefit our country for generations, but underscores Hillary's belief that we are stronger together.\" – Congresswoman Gwen Moore\"The National Service Reserve will not only enable young men and women to give back to their country, but also equip them with invaluable experiences and training that will enrich their lives. Whether in the military or in the communities, an entire generation can share the sacrifice needed to secure America's future. Indeed, I wholeheartedly endorse Hillary Clinton's plan to make us stronger--together.\" – Congressman Charles Rangel\n\"The Millennial Generation wants to serve. They are on the front lines fighting poverty, educating children, reclaiming our environment and restoring neighborhoods after natural disasters, while developing an ethic of common purpose. We need more and bolder ways to tap their energy and idealism. Secretary Clinton's plan to create a National Service Reserve to enlist millions in service, combined with her commitment to grow AmeriCorps to 250,000 participants and make a service year possible for anyone willing to serve is a powerful way to channel young people's desire to make a difference and solve pressing problems in communities across our country.\" – Alan Khazei, Founder and CEO, Be The Change and Co-Founder and Former CEO, City Year\"It's time to say to America's young people -- invest in your communities and we will invest in you.

From helping students succeed in school, to protecting our environment, to helping communities recover from disasters, there is so much to be done to strengthen our nation. Through their service in AmeriCorps, young people develop as citizen leaders and earn scholarships to help them pay back student loans. Every dollar invested has a fourfold return. National service is a winning idea and a smart investment of taxpayer dollars.\" – AnnMaura Connolly, President, Voices for National Service\n\"After the attacks of September 11th, having just graduated from college, I enlisted in the US Army.

In his remarks, he referred to Tzvia Walden and Yoni and Nehemia \"Chemi\" Peres, children of President Peres; President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority; and Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119061", "text": "Tzvia, Yoni, Chemi, and generations of the Peres family; President Rivlin; Prime Minister Netanyahu; members of the Israeli Government and the Knesset; heads of state and government; and guests from around the world, including President Abbas, whose presence here is a gesture and a reminder of the unfinished business of peace; to the people of Israel: I could not be more honored to be in Jerusalem to say farewell to my friend Shimon Peres, who showed us that justice and hope are at the heart of the Zionist idea.\nA free life, in a homeland regained. A secure life, in a nation that can defend itself, by itself. A full life, in friendship with nations who can be counted on as allies, always. A bountiful life, driven by the simple pleasures of family and by big dreams. This was Shimon Peres's life. This is the State of Israel. This is the story of the Jewish people over the last century, and it was made possible by a founding generation that counts Shimon as one of its own.\nShimon once said that, \"The message of the Jewish people to mankind is that faith and moral vision can triumph over all adversity.\" For Shimon, that moral vision was rooted in an honest reckoning of the world as it is. Born in the shtetl, he said he felt \"surrounded by a sea of thick and threatening forests.\" When his family got the chance to go to Palestine, his beloved grandfather's parting words were simple: \"Shimon, stay a Jew.\" Propelled with that faith, he found his home. He found his purpose. He found his life's work. But he was still a teenager when his grandfather was burned alive by the Nazis in the town where Shimon was born. The synagogue in which he prayed became an inferno. The railroad tracks that had carried him toward the Promised Land also delivered so many of his people to death camps.\nAnd so from an early age, Shimon bore witness to the cruelty that human beings could inflict on each other, the ways that one group of people could dehumanize another; the particular madness of anti-Semitism, which has run like a stain through history. That understanding of man's ever-present sinfulness would steel him against hardship and make him vigilant against threats to Jewry around the world.\nBut that understanding would never harden his heart. It would never extinguish his faith. Instead, it broadened his moral imagination, and gave him the capacity to see all people as deserving of dignity and respect. It helped him see not just the world as it is, but the world as it should be.\nWhat Shimon did to shape the story of Israel is well chronicled. Starting on the kibbutz he founded with his love Sonya, he began the work of building a model community. Ben-Gurion called him to serve the Haganah at headquarters to make sure that the Jewish people had the armaments and the organization to secure their freedom. After independence, surrounded by enemies who denied Israel's existence and sought to drive it into the sea, the child who had wanted to be a \"poet of stars\" became a man who built Israel's defense industry, who laid the foundation for the formidable armed forces that won Israel's wars. His skill secured Israel's strategic position. His boldness sent Israeli commandos to Entebbe and rescued Jews from Ethiopia. His statesmanship built an unbreakable bond with the United States of America and so many other countries. His contributions didn't end there. Shimon also showed what people can do when they harness reason and science to a common cause. He understood that a country without many natural resources could more than make up for it with the talents of its people. He made hard choices to roll back inflation and climb out from a terrible economic crisis. He championed the promise of science and technology to make the desert bloom and turned this tiny country into a central hub of the digital age, making life better not just for people here, but for people around the world.\nIndeed, Shimon's contribution to this nation is so fundamental, so pervasive, that perhaps sometimes they can be overlooked. For a younger generation, Shimon was probably remembered more for a peace process that never reached its endpoint. They would listen to critics on the left who might argue that Shimon did not fully acknowledge the failings of his nation or perhaps more numerous critics on the right who argued that he refused to see the true wickedness of the world, and called him naive.\nBut whatever he shared with his family or his closest friends, to the world he brushed off the critics. And I know from my conversations with him that his pursuit of peace was never naive. Every Yom HaShoah, he read the names of the family that he lost. As a young man, he had fed his village by working in the fields during the day, but then defending it by carrying a rifle at night. He understood, in this war-torn region, where too often Arab youth are taught to hate Israel from an early age, he understood just how hard peace would be. I'm sure he was alternatively angry and bemused to hear the same critics, who called him hopelessly naive, depend on the defense architecture that he himself had helped to build.\nI don't believe he was naive. But he understood from hard-earned experience that true security comes through making peace with your neighbors. \"We won them all,\" he said of Israel's wars. \"But we did not win the greatest victory that we aspired to: release from the need to win victories.\"\nAnd just as he understood the practical necessity of peace, Shimon believed that Israel's exceptionalism was rooted not only in fidelity to the Jewish people, but to the moral and ethical vision, the precepts of his Jewish faith. \"The Jewish people weren't born to rule another people,\" he would say. \"From the very first day we are against slaves and masters.\"\nOut of the hardships of the diaspora, he found room in his heart for others who suffered. He came to hate prejudice with the passion of one who knows how it feels to be its target. Even in the face of terrorist attacks, even after repeated disappointments at the negotiation table, he insisted that as human beings, Palestinians must be seen as equal in dignity to Jews, and must therefore be equal in self-determination. Because of his sense of justice, his analysis of Israel's security, his understanding of Israel's meaning, he believed that the Zionist idea would be best protected when Palestinians, too, had a state of their own.\nOf course, we gather here in the knowledge that Shimon never saw his dream of peace fulfilled. The region is going through a chaotic time. Threats are ever present. And yet he did not stop dreaming, and he did not stop working. By the time that I came to work with Shimon, he was in the twilight of his years, although he might not admit it. I would be the 10th U.S. President since John F. Kennedy to sit down with Shimon; the 10th to fall prey to his charms. I think of him sitting in the Oval Office, this final member of Israel's founding generation, under the portrait of George Washington, telling me stories from the past, but more often talking with enthusiasm of the present: his most recent lecture, his next project, his plans for the future, the wonders of his grandchildren. In many ways, he reminded me of some other giants of the 20th century that I've had the honor to meet—men like Nelson Mandela; women like Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth—leaders who have seen so much, whose lives span such momentous epochs, that they find no need to posture or traffic in what's popular in the moment; people who speak with depth and knowledge, not in sound bites. They find no interest in polls or fads.\nAnd like these leaders, Shimon could be true to his convictions even if they cut against the grain of current opinion. He knew, better than the cynic, that if you look out over the arc of history, human beings should be filled not with fear but with hope. I'm sure that's why he was so excited about technology because for him, it symbolized the march of human progress. And it's why he loved so much to talk about young people, because he saw young people unburdened by the prejudices of the past. It's why he believed in miracles because in Israel, he saw a miracle come true.\nAs Americans and Israelis, we often talk about the unbreakable bonds between our nations. And, yes, these bonds encompass common interests—vital cooperation that makes both our nations more secure. But today, we are reminded that the bonds which matter most run deeper. Anchored in a Judeo-Christian tradition, we believe in the irreducible value of every human being. Our nations were built on that idea. They were built in large part by stubborn idealists and striving immigrants, including those who had fled war and fled oppression. Both our nations have flaws that we have not always fixed, corners of our history which date back to our founding that we do not always squarely address. But because our founders planted not just flags in the eternal soil, but also planted the seeds of democracy, we have the ability to always pursue a better world. We have the capacity to do what is right.\nAs an American, as a Christian, a person partly of African descent, born in Hawaii—a place that could not be further than where Shimon spent his youth—I took great pleasure in my friendship with this older, wiser man. We shared a love of words and books and history. And perhaps, like most politicians, we shared too great a joy in hearing ourselves talk. [Laughter] But beyond that, I think our friendship was rooted in the fact that I could somehow see myself in his story, and maybe he could see himself in mine. Because for all of our differences, both of us had lived such unlikely lives. It was so surprising to see the two of us where we had started, talking together in the White House, meeting here in Israel. And I think both of us understood that we were here only because in some way we reflected the magnificent story of our nations.\nShimon's story, the story of Israel, the experience of the Jewish people, I believe it is universal. It's the story of a people who, over so many centuries in the wilderness, never gave up on that basic human longing to return home. It's the story of a people who suffered the boot of oppression and the shutting of the gas chamber's door, and yet never gave up on a belief in goodness. And it's the story of a man who was counted on, and then often counted out, again and again, and who never lost hope.\nShimon Peres reminds us that the State of Israel, like the United States of America, was not built by cynics. We exist because people before us refused to be constrained by the past or the difficulties of the present. And Shimon Peres was never cynical. It is that faith, that optimism, that belief—even when all the evidence is to the contrary—that tomorrow can be better, that makes us not just honor Shimon Peres, but love him.\nThe last of the founding generation is now gone. Shimon accomplished enough things in his life for a thousand men. But he understood that it is better to live to the very end of his time on Earth with a longing not for the past, but for the dreams that have not yet come true: an Israel that is secure in a just and lasting peace with its neighbors. And so now this work is in the hand of Israel's next generation, in the hands of Israel's next generation and its friends.\nLike Joshua, we feel the weight of responsibility that Shimon seemed to wear so lightly. But we draw strength from his example and the fact that he believed in us, even when we doubted ourselves.\nScripture tells us that before his death, Moses said, \"I call upon heaven and earth to bear witness this day that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse; therefore choose life, that you and your offspring may live.\"\nUvacharta Bachayim. Choose life. For Shimon, let us choose life, as he always did. Let us make his work our own. May God bless his memory. And may God bless this country, and this world, that he loved so dearly.\nShimon: Todah Rabah Chaver Yakar.", "timestamp": "2016-09-30", "title": "Remarks at a Memorial Service for Former President Shimon Peres of Israel in Jerusalem"}

During National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, we honor all those who lost their lives to breast cancer, and we recognize the courageous survivors who are still fighting it. For these individuals, and for their loved ones who give their unwavering support during the most trying times, we recommit ourselves to the essential and necessary work of forging a future free from cancer in all its forms.\nHundreds of thousands of Americans will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year, and tens of thousands will lose their battle with this disease. Although both women and men can have breast cancer, women are at higher risk. Women with a family history of breast cancer, or those who are older or obese, are also more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer. I encourage all women to find out if they are at increased risk and to learn more about recommended screenings by speaking with their health care providers and by visiting www.Cancer.gov/Breast.\nEarly detection and treatment can save lives. Since I took office, I have worked to make quality, affordable health care a reality for more Americans. The Affordable Care Act has given millions of women expanded access to preventive services, including screening tests such as mammograms, with no out-of-pocket costs. Women can no longer be denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition, including a family history of breast cancer, and lifetime and annual limits on essential health benefits have been eliminated.\nCritical research efforts over time have yielded great progress in how we diagnose and treat breast cancer, which has produced a steady increase in survival rates for those suffering from this disease—and it is crucial that we keep building on these successes. This year, the National Cancer Institute launched the largest study of its kind to investigate the role of genetic and biological factors in breast cancer risk among African American women, who have a higher risk of dying from breast cancer. The White House Cancer Moonshot Task Force, also launched this year, is a new national effort striving to make a decade's worth of progress in preventing, diagnosing, and treating cancer in just 5 years. And through the Precision Medicine Initiative—a bold research effort aimed at delivering disease prevention and treatment based on an individual's unique traits and genetic information—we are pursuing new oncology-focused efforts to advance personalized care through targeted cancer therapies.\nThis month, with bold pink ribbons displayed proudly across America, we stand in solidarity with breast cancer survivors and reaffirm our commitment to raising awareness of this disease and to advancing research efforts. Let us thank the countless advocates, medical professionals, researchers, and caregivers who dedicate their lives to fighting for a world without breast cancer, and together, let us carry out our mission to cure cancer once and for all. Now, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2016 as National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. I encourage citizens, government agencies, private businesses, nonprofit organizations, and all other interested groups to join in activities that will increase awareness of what Americans can do to prevent breast cancer.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-09-30", "title": "Proclamation 9507—National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, 2016"}

The rise of the Internet has brought incredible opportunity and new ways of innovating and enhancing our way of life—but with great potential also comes heightened risk to our data. Keeping cyberspace secure is a matter of national security, and in order to ensure we can reap the benefits and utility of technology while minimizing the dangers and threats it presents, we must continue to make cybersecurity a top priority. Throughout National Cybersecurity Awareness Month, we recognize the role that individuals can play in enhancing cybersecurity, and we join to raise awareness of the importance of securing our information against cyber threats.\nTo build on the cybersecurity efforts already underway, my Administration introduced the Cybersecurity National Action Plan earlier this year to address short-term and long-term challenges when it comes to cybersecurity. We have proposed increasing the budget for cybersecurity by more than one-third and establishing an Information Technology Modernization Fund to help retire, replace, and modernize our costly information technology legacy systems. We are also striving to invest in cybersecurity education, reform the way Government manages and responds to large-scale cyber threats, and update obsolete Federal IT systems that are vulnerable to attack.\nTo meet these goals, we created the position of the first-ever Federal Chief Information Security Officer to help drive cybersecurity policy, planning, and implementation across the Federal Government. We also established the Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity to recommend actions that can be taken over the next decade to strengthen cybersecurity in both the public and private sectors while protecting privacy. This Commission will maintain public safety and economic and national security, foster discovery and development of new technical solutions, and bolster partnerships between governments and the private sector in an effort to promote best cybersecurity practices.\nCyber threats not only pose a danger to our national security, but also have the potential to harm our financial security and undermine the privacy of millions of Americans. An important part of enhancing cybersecurity involves empowering more Americans to help themselves take proper precautions online and in their financial transactions; cybersecurity is a shared responsibility, and everyone can do their part to make smart, safe choices. The Federal Government is also doing our part through the BuySecure Initiative, which has issued more than three million more secure credit cards for Government purchases. We are also working to help give Americans earlier warning of identity crimes with free access to credit scores through their existing consumer accounts.\nThrough the Department of Homeland Security's \"Stop.Think.Connect.\" campaign, we are aiming to increase awareness of the simple steps people can take to strengthen their cybersecurity. The National Cyber Security Alliance, in partnership with the private sector and non-profit organizations, recently launched the \"Lock Down Your Login\" campaign to empower Americans to take control of their online accounts and add an extra layer of security beyond just using passwords. I encourage every American to take this important step and to visit www.LockDownYourLogin.com to learn more.\nKeeping America safe requires us to bolster our security online. This month, we renew our commitment to ensuring our information is more secure, our data is safer, and our families and businesses are more protected than ever before. If we work toward this goal—as individuals and as a Nation—together we can realize our full potential in the digital age.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2016 as National Cybersecurity Awareness Month. I call upon the people of the United States to recognize the importance of cybersecurity and to observe this month with activities, events, and training that will enhance our national security and resilience.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-09-30", "title": "Proclamation 9508—National Cybersecurity Awareness Month, 2016"}

Too often in our Nation's history, individuals with disabilities have been eager to work but could not find a job, facing red tape, discrimination, or employers who assumed that disabled meant unable and refused to hire them. This month, we recognize the significant progress our country has made for those living with disabilities, and we honor the lasting contributions and diverse skills they bring to our workforce.\nAs a country, we must acknowledge that despite the great strides we have made in the 26 years since the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act—a groundbreaking civil rights law aimed at eliminating discrimination and assuring equality for people with disabilities—we still have far to go to raise awareness of discriminatory obstacles that individuals with disabilities encounter in employment. Today, the labor force participation rate for Americans with disabilities is less than one-third the rate of those without a disability, and the unemployment rate is more than twice as high for individuals with disabilities. To break down more of these barriers, we must expand access to the resources and training necessary for Americans with disabilities to succeed in the workplace.\nMy Administration is dedicated to upholding our Nation's promise of equal opportunity for all and advancing employment for people with disabilities in every community. I am proud that the Federal Government is leading by example as a model employer, now employing more Americans with disabilities than at any time in the last 30 years. Last year, the White House hosted a Summit on Disability and Employment to share resources for employers to hire more individuals with disabilities and effective strategies for recruitment, retention, hiring, and promotion of these employees. Two years ago, through updates to Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act, we took action to increase the representation of workers with disabilities in the Federal contractor workforce. In 2014, I signed the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act to help the Departments of Labor and Education build initiatives that advance employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities—and earlier this summer, we issued new regulations to provide greater and more inclusive career development and training opportunities for anyone facing barriers to employment.\nThis year's National Disability Employment Awareness Month theme focuses on the importance of inclusion, especially when it comes to business, opportunity, and innovation. When we diversify our workforce we create opportunities for growth and improvement—not just for those with disabilities, but for everyone. This month, let us continue striving to forge a future where workplaces are more inclusive and where employees are more accepted for who they are. And because we know that our country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, let us keep working to ensure no one is left behind or unable to pursue their dreams because of a disability. Now, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2016 as National Disability Employment Awareness Month. I urge all Americans to embrace the talents and skills that individuals with disabilities bring to our workplaces and communities and to promote the right to equal employment opportunity for all people.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-09-30", "title": "Proclamation 9509—National Disability Employment Awareness Month, 2016"}

Too many individuals, regardless of age, ability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, circumstance, or race, face the pain and fear of domestic violence. During National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, we shine a light on this violation of the basic human right to be free from violence and abuse, pledge to ensure every victim of domestic violence knows they are not alone, and foster supportive communities that help survivors seek justice and enjoy full and healthy lives.\nOver the past two decades, rates of domestic violence against females have dropped by nearly three-quarters—but there is still much work to do to build on the progress we have made. Nearly 1 in 4 women and 1 in 7 men have suffered from domestic violence by an intimate partner. All people deserve to feel safe with loved ones, and my Administration is committed to eliminating this scourge and supporting survivors' healing—and we must ensure that survivors and their families have access to the resources, care, and support they need to do so.\nMy Administration is dedicated to ensuring that all people feel safe in all aspects of their lives, which is why I proposed significant funding for responding to domestic violence in my most recent budget proposal. We have also championed legislative action like the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act, and the Affordable Care Act—which ensures that most health plans cover domestic violence screening and counseling services at no additional cost. And the Violence Against Women Act, which was reauthorized in 2013, has enhanced and expanded protections to Native Americans, immigrants, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals, and victims who reside in public housing.\nThis is progress we must continue to invest in and carry forward. Earlier this year, I announced a series of commonsense steps my Administration is taking to reduce gun violence, including work to renew our domestic violence outreach efforts. Building on the work of our Police Data Initiative, the White House is promoting smart approaches to collecting data on domestic violence offenses that balance transparency and accountability with victim safety and privacy. And victim safety should also be a priority in the workplace—a truth that extends to the Federal Government. That is why I directed all Federal agencies to adopt domestic violence workplace policies and encouraged employers to do the same.\nOur agencies have taken many critical actions to advance this cause. For example, the Department of Justice has invested millions of dollars in new initiatives to prevent domestic violence homicides, urge law enforcement agencies to identify and prevent gender bias when responding to domestic violence and sexual assault, and expand services to underserved victims. And the Department of Housing and Urban Development recently issued guidance to prevent housing discrimination against survivors of domestic violence.\nVice President Joe Biden's leadership has helped guide our progress and worked to change our national culture—which too often tolerates and condones domestic violence. We are challenging harmful stereotypes associated with victims of domestic violence and striving to bring the practice of victim-blaming to an end. We must continue to recognize survivors who experience disproportionate rates of domestic violence, and who have been placed at the margins for generations, including women of color, Native Americans, individuals with disabilities, members of the LGBT community, immigrants, and older adults. Along these lines, we also joined with Canada and Mexico to create the North American Working Group on Violence against Indigenous Women and Girls, working together to enhance responses to violent crimes against indigenous women and girls in North America.\nOur Nation's character is tested whenever this injustice is tolerated. When anyone is targeted by someone they place their trust in, we have a responsibility to speak up. We all have a role to play in building a bright and safe future for each other and for future generations. This month, we recommit to standing with survivors of domestic violence and to doing our utmost to extend hope and healing to all who need it. If you or someone you know needs assistance, I encourage you to reach out to the National Domestic Violence Hotline, which recently engaged in its 4 millionth conversation with victims and survivors of domestic violence, by calling 1-800-799-SAFE, or visiting www.TheHotline.org.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2016 as National Domestic Violence Awareness Month. I call on all Americans to speak out against domestic violence and support local efforts to assist victims of these crimes in finding the help and healing they need.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-09-30", "title": "Proclamation 9510—National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, 2016"}

During National Energy Action Month, we rededicate ourselves to securing a more prosperous and energy-independent future. As climate change continues to threaten our planet, we must join together to reduce our carbon emissions, protect our environment, and leave behind a cleaner and more resilient world for generations to come.\nToday, America is less reliant on foreign oil than at any point in the previous four decades. To build on this progress, we are implementing new fuel efficiency standards for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles that are projected to significantly reduce diesel consumption. We are also increasing the energy efficiency of our buildings and appliances and modernizing our energy infrastructure as we experience a rapid transformation in the way power is generated and used across our country.\nTo ensure our energy security for generations, the United States is partnering with Canada and Mexico to pursue regional energy security and combat climate change. Earlier this year at the North American Leaders Summit, we set an historic goal of achieving 50 percent clean power generation across our continent by 2025. These efforts will bolster a transition to clean energy sources that increase economic competitiveness and strengthen growing industries while supporting hundreds of thousands of new jobs. Our solar industry is creating jobs 12 times faster than the rest of the economy, and wind generation now supports tens of thousands of American jobs. Additionally, we are working to diversify our energy portfolio to include sources of zero emissions power like nuclear and hydropower; expand our supply of affordable, reliable, and efficient energy sources; and make it easier for every American to access cleaner forms of energy.\nIn response to the devastating consequences of our changing climate, we are embracing our responsibility to achieve a low-carbon future. To do our part, we are on track to reach the 2020 emissions reductions goals I set when I first took office, and we are pursuing even greater cuts for 2025. Last year, we joined nearly 200 countries for the announcement of the most ambitious climate agreement in history, and in September we formally joined the Paris Agreement with China. As we embolden the world to take steps that will dramatically reduce global carbon pollution, we are leading by example—our levels of carbon pollution remain at historic lows. We must continue demonstrating that a country can simultaneously strive for a cleaner environment and a stronger economy.\nDespite this progress, there is much work to do to realize the clean energy economy of tomorrow. Last year, in partnership with 19 other countries, we launched Mission Innovation to accelerate clean energy innovation around the world. Through this initiative, 20 countries and the European Union committed to seeking to double public funding for clean energy research and development to $30 billion over 5 years. By doubling our proposed Federal investment in clean energy, we will enable our brightest scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs to create and advance clean energy technologies that will protect our environment, increase our energy security, and create more jobs across our country.\nAlthough the difficulties that lie ahead are large, the stakes are too great for inaction. Our children and grandchildren are relying on our ability to rise to these challenges and accomplish what is required of us—including advancing clean, renewable, and independent sources of energy. Throughout National Energy Action Month, let us pledge to reduce our carbon footprint and minimize our energy consumption. Let us strive to continue fighting for a cleaner, stronger, and more secure future for our fellow Americans and for all of humanity.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2016 as National Energy Action Month.

It is our shared responsibility to ensure all children are given a fair shot at life, including a quality education and equal opportunities to pursue their dreams. Too often in America, young people are not afforded a second chance after having made a mistake or poor decision—the kind of chance some of their peers receive under more forgiving environments. Many of these young people lack institutional or family support and live in distressed communities. Others may have experienced trauma and violence or may struggle with disabilities, mental health issues, or substance use disorders. As a society, we must strive to reach these children earlier in life and modernize our juvenile and criminal justice systems to hold youth accountable for their actions without consigning them to a life on the margins. During National Youth Justice Awareness Month, we reaffirm our commitment to helping children of every background become successful and engaged citizens.\nWhile the number of juvenile arrests have fallen sharply over the past decade, roughly 1 million juvenile arrests were made in 2014. An overwhelming majority of these arrests were for non-violent crimes, and nearly three-quarters of those arrested were male. Children of color, particularly black and Hispanic males and Native American youth, continue to be overrepresented across all levels of the juvenile justice system. Unfortunately, far too many youth become involved with the adult criminal justice system each year—including in several States where 17-year-olds are prosecuted as adults regardless of their crime, and two where 16-year-olds are as well. Children in the adult system have less access to rehabilitative services and often face higher recidivism and suicide rates. Some States have recently raised the age so that 16- and 17-year-olds are not unnecessarily tried in adult courts, and many are reforming sentencing laws and expanding access to age-appropriate transition services upon reentry.\nEven for those youth who were never convicted or otherwise found guilty, simply having had contact with our justice system can lead to lifelong barriers and an increased likelihood of ending up in a cycle of incarceration. To help break this cycle, my Administration increased funding for expunging juvenile records and took steps to ensure young people in juvenile and adult justice facilities can receive Pell Grants to pursue a quality education. The White House launched the Fair Chance Pledge to highlight employers and institutions of higher education that have committed to reducing barriers that justice-involved youth often face in accessing employment, training, and education. To build on these efforts, the Congress must reauthorize the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (JJDPA) to increase protections for youth and limit the number of minors held in adult jails and prisons. Reauthorizing the JJDPA will promote evidence-based practices, quality education, and trauma-informed care for incarcerated youth, while reducing punishments for things such as breaking curfew and truancy.\nWe have also seen too many of our youth held in solitary confinement while incarcerated, which can lead to devastating, long-term psychological consequences. Earlier this year, my Administration took steps to implement reforms that include banning this harmful practice for juveniles under the custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons. We must ensure that young people have quality legal representation throughout every stage of the legal process as well as age-appropriate and rehabilitative sentencing and placements. The financial costs of the juvenile court system can be debilitating and can unfairly penalize children from poor families—by reducing the fees and fines imposed on youth, we can avoid pushing families into debt and decrease this disproportionate burden.\nTo meet these goals, we must engage young people before they find themselves locked into a path from which they cannot escape. The Departments of Justice and Education created the Supportive School Discipline Initiative to incentivize positive school climates and rethink discipline policies to foster safer and more supportive learning environments. They are also working to assist States, schools, and law enforcement partners in assessing the proper role of school resource officers and campus law enforcement professionals. The Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services released a joint policy statement against the use of suspension and expulsion in preschool settings—which disproportionately affect children of color. As part of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention's Smart on Juvenile Justice initiative, we are providing services such as job training and substance use disorder treatment and counseling for youth in juvenile facilities, and we are expanding the use of effective community-based alternatives to youth detention. We are also screening youth for exposure to trauma that can put them at greater risk of entering the juvenile justice system. And through the My Brother's Keeper initiative, we are working to address persistent opportunity gaps and ensure all young people can reach their full potential—including by helping them get a healthy start in life, enter school ready to learn, and successfully enter the workforce.\nWhen we invest in our children and redirect young people who have made misguided decisions, we can reduce our over-reliance on the juvenile and criminal justice systems and build stronger pathways to opportunity. In addition, for every dollar we put into high-quality early childhood education, we save at least twice that down the road in reduced crime. That is why my Administration has sought to expand high-quality early education by increasing funding for programs like Head Start and investing in preschool, child care, and evidence-based home visiting. Investing in our communities and our kids makes sense, and if we recognize that every child deserves to remain connected to their families and communities, we can ensure youth who come in contact with the law can have a chance at a brighter future.\nThis month, we come together to ensure all young people are supported, nurtured, and provided an opportunity to succeed. We must make sure youth in every community and from every walk of life can be known for more than their worst mistakes. With enhanced possibilities, a sense of optimism, and an open mind, they can all thrive and live up to the full measure of their promise.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2016 as National Youth Justice Awareness Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month by taking action to support our youth and by participating in appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs in their communities.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

These officers hold significant civic and law enforcement responsibilities and put their lives at risk to protect us each day, at times facing some of the most adverse circumstances imaginable. The overwhelming majority of police officers are fair, dedicated, and honest public servants who strive daily to cultivate and sustain positive relationships with the communities they serve and protect. As recent tragedies have illustrated, however, it is clear that there are still too many places in America where these relationships are strained and where officers and community members have struggled to build and maintain trust.\nDuring National Community Policing Week, we reaffirm our commitment to supporting and advancing the practice of community policing and to fortifying the bonds between police officers and communities. Community policing recognizes that law enforcement cannot solve public safety problems alone and encourages interactive partnerships with relevant stakeholders—including community groups, nonprofits, faith-based organizations, and businesses. This active collaboration can improve public trust and fortify relationships, not only advancing public safety, but also deepening social connectivity and creating lasting solutions to challenging problems we face every day.\nThe underlying tensions that sometimes exist between law enforcement officers and communities span decades and reflect a breadth of social and cultural challenges, including racial and socioeconomic disparities. Through meaningful efforts to strengthen community policing, we can meet these challenges, improve these vital relationships, and make real and lasting progress. Together, we can take constructive steps to support our women and men in uniform while instilling confidence in the fairness of the justice system for everybody and ensuring that law enforcement officers discharge their duties impartially.\nA critical part of enhancing trust is making certain that when an incident occurs, the public is confident that an investigation is fair and effective—both for the officer and for the families of those who have been affected. We must also work with law enforcement on training, hiring, and recruiting techniques and provide support and proper resources as they deal with the challenges of the job. In 2015, I announced a Task Force on 21st Century Policing to bring together community leaders and law enforcement to provide recommendations to help us build the kind of trust we need. In the time since the Task Force issued a report of their findings, we have seen progress with respect to data gathering, training, transparency, and community outreach—and communities across America are working to implement these recommendations. We must also recognize that we cannot keep expecting police to solve the issues we fail to address as a society, including poverty, substandard schools, inadequate job opportunities, and lack of care for mental illnesses or substance use disorders; doing so contributes to unrest in communities and exacerbates tensions. My Administration has worked to bridge divides and bolster community policing efforts across our country. In 2014, the Department of Justice (DOJ) launched the National Initiative for Building Community Trust and Justice to invest in training, evidence-based strategies, and research to help reduce implicit bias and enhance procedural justice and reconciliation. The DOJ has provided additional resources to the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services for hiring police officers across America and advancing 21st-century policing efforts. We are also continuing to provide millions of dollars in grants to agencies that demonstrate robust community policing initiatives. Last year, the White House and the DOJ launched the Police Data Initiative to encourage law enforcement, technologists, and researchers to use data to increase transparency and strengthen accountability between community members and police. And this summer, we launched the Data-Driven Justice Initiative to equip law enforcement officers with the tools they need to safely and effectively divert low-level offenders with mental illnesses out of the criminal justice system. The Federal Government must continue to partner with State and local leaders, as well as the law enforcement community, to expand best practices that increase trust and public safety.\nEvery American has the power to make change in their communities. By working together to improve law enforcement practices and ensure we give both police officers and community members the respect they deserve, we can fulfill this important endeavor. This week, let us rededicate ourselves to building a future in which police officers are honored for their sacrifices and supported by their communities and in which members of those communities can truly feel they are being served fairly and justly by our women and men in blue.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2 through October 8, 2016, as National Community Policing Week. I call upon law enforcement agencies, elected officials, and all Americans to observe this week by recognizing ways to improve public safety, rebuild trust, and strengthen community relationships.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-09-30", "title": "Proclamation 9513—National Community Policing Week, 2016"}
