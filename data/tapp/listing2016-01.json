It would be funny if it wasn't so sad because we are NATO. And that needs to be confronted and that needs to be handled.\nIn June, Marco wrote in the Wall Street Journal that Congress needed to strengthen President Obama's efforts in Libya — not tie his hands as some Republicans wanted, which would have prolonged the conflict even longer and led to more violence and anarchy and undermined America's standing in the region with our NATO and Arab partners and allowed our enemies to believe that an American President's word was meaningless.\nBut once Qaddafi was toppled that autumn, President Obama and Hillary Clinton failed to provide the support that was needed to help the Libyan people rebuild their country. That challenge was all the greater because their reluctance to back the Libyan people prolonged the conflict.\nHere's what Marco told Fox News in October, after Qaddafi was killed:\nA lot of infrastructure has been destroyed in Libya that has to all be rebuilt; 30 some odd militias have now formed. It's going to be a bear to get them to disarm. You have a lot of young men who instead of entering the workforce and rebuilding the country are now young men that need medical rehab, prosthetics because they have been injured in war.\nThe cost of rebuilding the country has gotten exponentially high. If the United States had just gotten engaged a little bit earlier and a little bit more aggressively, what happened last week would have happened months ago and it would have cost a lot less money, there would have been a lot less uncertainty. Here is what else happened over the last eight months: Thousands of shoulder-fired rockets have gone missing, and now these rockets are out there capable of shooting down an airplane and we don't know where they're. . . .\nIf the rebels had had a no-fly zone when they asked for it, this thing would have been over in a week. . . .\nNATO has limited capabilities. The British and the French, they worked very hard; they did a very good job. But they don't have the weaponry we have. If we had just stayed in that effort a little bit longer, this thing would have ended sooner as well.\nThat same month, following a visit to Libya, Marco underscored the need for the United States to maintain its commitment to aiding a post-Gaddafi Libya:\nWe can also help Libya lay the foundation for sustainable security. This requires safeguarding the immense stockpiles of weapons and dangerous materials that exist across the country. It also requires bringing Libya's many militias under the TNC's civilian authority, and working toward their demobilization, disarmament and reintegration into Libyan society. We and our allies should encourage this peaceful process as much as we can, and oppose external efforts to pick winners who would advance factional or ideological interests through force... American support is also important for Libya's democratic transition. The TNC wants to cooperate with the U.S., especially with our nongovernmental organizations, in the monitoring of national elections (which could be held soon), the drafting of a constitution, and the development of civil society.\nAs the Benghazi Commission and other investigations have shown, despite the chaos the Obama/Clinton intervention left behind, Secretary Clinton and the Obama administration essentially abandoned Libya.  They did little to help the nascent moderate Libyan government dissolve the militias and build cohesive security forces. They ignored the growing chaos in Libya, so much so that repeated threats to our personnel in the country, including in Benghazi, went unheeded.\nThe results were the attacks on our facilities on September 11, 2012, which left four Americans dead and eventually forced U.S. personnel to leave the country entirely.\nAs Marco pointed out in October 2015 in a Breitbart piece, the Obama Administration's desire to have a \"light footprint\" is what's allowed terrorists to flourish in Libya — including the ones who killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans in Benghazi.\nAs the Libyan government was left on its own, so too were our personnel in Libya.\nAmbassador Stevens and his team requested additional security personnel from State Department headquarters on multiple occasions, only to have the requests denied. Clinton now claims that these decisions were made by her subordinates, but given her role in crafting the administration's policy toward Libya, she should have been more engaged, both before and in the middle of the worst attack on a U.S. diplomatic facility in decades.\nThis disengagement from a major crisis facing her Department is symptomatic of her broader approach to her role as Secretary of State. Indeed, she really has no major accomplishment to point to from her four years as Secretary of State and the issues on which she engaged the most often had the most disastrous results for U.S. foreign policy.\nNow, as Marco has repeatedly warned, Libya is in such chaos that it is now the premier operating area for ISIS outside of Syria and Iraq.\nWhen Qaddafi, an anti-American dictator who had the blood of Americans and Israelis on his hands, was falling, it was a no-brainer for the United States to help the Libyan people take him down.\nBut then President Obama and Hillary Clinton squandered the opportunity that presented. Reluctant to lead, they were slow to provide American help, and then failed to continue the support after Qaddafi's fall.\nThe costs of restoring Libya to stability now will be much, much greater than they would have been if America had offered more than the kind of half-hearted, politically minded intervention that has characterized the Obama-Clinton foreign policy.", "timestamp": "2016-01-01", "title": "Press Release - Wondering What Marco Rubio's Record Is on Libya, Another Example of Hillary Clinton's Failed Leadership?

I am fired up for the year that stretches out before us. And that's because of what we've accomplished together over the past 7 years.\nSeven years ago, our businesses were losing 800,000 jobs a month. They've now created jobs for 69 straight months, driving the unemployment rate from a high of 10 percent down to 5 percent.\nSeven years ago, too many Americans went without health insurance. We've now covered more than 17 million people, dropping the rate of the uninsured below 10 percent for the very first time.\nSeven years ago, we were addicted to foreign oil. Now our oil imports have plummeted, our clean energy industry is booming, and America is a global leader in the fight against climate change.\nSeven years ago, there were only two States in America with marriage equality. And now there are 50.\nAll of this progress is because of you. And we've got so much more to do. So my New Year's resolution is to move forward on our unfinished business as much as I can. And I'll be more frequently asking for your help. That's what this American project is all about.\nThat's especially true for one piece of unfinished business: our epidemic of gun violence.\nLast month, we remembered the third anniversary of Newtown. This Friday, I'll be thinking about my friend Gabby Giffords, 5 years into her recovery from the shooting in Tucson. And all across America, survivors of gun violence and those who lost a child or a parent or a spouse to gun violence are forced to mark such awful anniversaries every single day.\nAnd yet Congress still hasn't done anything to prevent what happened to them from happening to other families. Three years ago, a bipartisan, commonsense bill would have required background checks for virtually everyone who buys a gun. Keep in mind, this is a policy that is supported by some 90 percent of the American people. It was supported by a majority of NRA households. But the gun lobby mobilized against it, and the Senate blocked it.\nSince then, tens of thousands of our fellow Americans have been mowed down by gun violence. Tens of thousands. Each time, we're told that commonsense reforms like background checks might not have stopped the last massacre or the one before that, so we shouldn't do anything.\nWe know we can't stop every act of violence. But what if we tried to stop even one? What if Congress did something—anything—to protect our kids from gun violence?\nA few months ago, I directed my team at the White House to look into any new actions I can take to help reduce gun violence. And on Monday, I'll meet with our Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, to discuss our options. Because I get too many letters from parents and teachers and kids to sit around and do nothing. I get letters from responsible gun owners who grieve with us every time these tragedies happen, who share my belief that the Second Amendment guarantees a right to bear arms, and who share my belief we can protect that right while keeping an irresponsible, dangerous few from inflicting harm on a massive scale.\nSo I know there are a bunch of us who care about this. If you are one of them, I need your help.\nChange, as always, is going to take all of us. The gun lobby is loud and well organized in its defense of effortlessly available guns for anyone. The rest of us are going to have to be just as passionate and well organized in our defense of our kids. That's the work of citizenship: to stand up and fight for the change that we seek. I hope you'll join me in making America safer for all of our children.\nThanks, everybody.", "timestamp": "2016-01-01", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}
{"author": "Jeb Bush", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=112591", "text": "As Thomas Jefferson wrote, \"Agriculture is our wisest pursuit, because it will in the end contribute most to real wealth, good morals, and happiness.\" Today, it is a great economic engine for our country. Millions of families rely on our farms and ranches for their well-being. Millions of our youth see it as their future, their opportunity to rise.\nIn Florida, world-class agriculture is the second biggest industry in the state. Florida provides over 40 percent of the world's orange juice, and food production contributes over $100 billion a year to the state's economy.\nWhen I was governor of Florida, the state achieved 4.4 percent annual economic growth. Florida farmers did better, along with everyone else. Now, I have a plan for real, sustained 4 percent economic growth for the entire country.\nIt starts with putting the interests of people in towns like Washington, Iowa in front of the special interests in Washington, D.C.\nIn Iowa, it's been 15 years since middle-class families have gotten a pay raise, while Washington, D.C. has become a boom town. We need a president who can help farm families and rural America rise up.\nI think Washington can learn a few things from rural America — things like common sense, a respect for the land and love of country. These are rural values I share. Too many in Washington D.C. do not share these values. It's time for a change, and that's why I'm running for president.\nInstead of suppressing farm production, we can strengthen rural America. Here is my plan to do that:\nFree us from the Chokehold of Federal Regulations\nOverreaching federal regulations stifle the potential of American agriculture and make a mockery of state authority and private property rights. For example, the federal \"Waters of the United States\" rule is simply an illegal powergrab that demonstrates a gross lack of understanding about what it takes to run a farm or business. Worse, we now know that the federal government presented the public with biased information in order to force the rule through. Fortunately, a number of states are challenging this regulation in the courts with some success.\nOn day one of my administration, I will stop every single regulation in process. I will immediately begin a sweeping reform of federal regulations, including repeal of the most onerous Obama-era rules and regulations including the \"Waters of the United States\" rule and Dodd-Frank financial regulations. I will execute detailed plans I have already laid out to: free us from overbearing regulations; reverse the illegal federal powergrab of states' rights; and loosen the tight grip on lands that burdens ranchers in the West.\nExpand Trade and Open New Markets\nWhen we compete on a level playing field, American workers and farmers win every time. More trade — and fairer trade — may be the single best way to increase prosperity in rural areas. Total U.S. agriculture exports were over $150 billion in 2014, accounting for a third of gross farm income. Over 50 percent of the world gets its corn from the United States. We supply 40 percent of the world's cotton. Almost 30 percent of its wheat. And the world will be asking for more. We'll have the potential to feed billions of new middle-class consumers in Asia and Africa over the next few decades.\nThat's why I support trade deals that are good for American workers and farmers. For instance, unlike Hillary Clinton, I have consistently backed the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Trade deals are not just about lowering trade barriers, boosting sales and creating jobs. They are about America playing a leadership role in setting policies that will shape the global economy.\nLower Taxes\nUnder President Obama, Americans have now endured six years of tax increases, and yet the federal government still added $8 trillion to our debt.\nRestoring the right to rise in America requires accelerating growth, and that can't be done without a complete overhaul of the U.S. tax code. Farmers and ranchers, in particular, are burdened by federal taxes if they wish to pass their operations on to the next generation. My comprehensive tax reform plandecreases tax rates across the board, establishing the lowest rate since President Reagan. Perhaps more importantly to farmers and ranchers, I would entirely eliminate the death tax.\nRenewable Fuels Standard\nThe law that was passed in 2007 has worked, look at the increase in production. It has been a benefit to us as we've reduced our dependency on foreign sources of oil. We need to level the playing field for all sources of energy. As we move forward over the long haul, there should be certainty for people to invest and we ought to continue to innovate to create the lowest cost energy sources in the world. Ultimately if you can compete in an open market place, then you'll thrive, we need to make sure there is market access. I do think that phasing out, getting to a place where we don't pick winners and losers and we don't create mandates, over time, is the proper thing to do. 2022 is the law and is probably the good break point.\nAgricultural Innovation\nToday the average American farmer is 15 times more productive than the average farmer in 1950. Farming is one of the most innovative sectors of our economy. We are still discovering what biotechnology can accomplish to increase yields and better meet the needs of consumers.\nToo often, the federal government chokes innovation through overregulation and high taxation. But the federal government also misses opportunities. The government spends too much, but it also spends too much on the wrong things. Research, including agricultural research, is undervalued. For instance, the federal governmentspent $80 million last year on employees to sit at home and do no work. Some of that funding would have been better spent pursuing breakthroughs, such as the prevention of plant disease, in our agricultural research programs.\nOn the Verge of our Greatest Time\nIf we get a few big things right, we are on the verge of the greatest time to be alive. But, under President Obama, Washington is standing in the way. We need a president who makes it easier, not harder, for people to rise above their current condition. That includes getting Washington D.C. off our backs, expanding food markets, lowering tax rates and promoting innovation. Removing government barriers and opening up opportunity will offer every hardworking farming and ranching family the ability to achieve their dreams. That's what I will do as the next president of the United States.\nOriginally Posted on TheIowaRepublican.com", "timestamp": "2016-01-02", "title": "Press Release - Jeb: Agriculture is the Foundation of America"}

As the senator was speaking about the collapse of the middle class in the United States and growing income and wealth inequality, he was interrupted by a man wearing a Donald Trump T-shirt. \"Here's a Trump supporter, worried about Mr. Trump's money,\" Sanders said as the man was ushered away. \"I say to Mr. Trump and his supporters that the billionaires of this country will not continue to own this nation,\" Sanders added as the crowd cheered.\nAs he arrived in Worcester, his car was caught in traffic outside the high school.

The tally for the year-end quarter pushed his total raised last year to $73 million from more than 1 million individuals who made a record 2.5 million donations.\n\"This people-powered campaign is revolutionizing American politics,\" said Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager. \"What we are showing is that we can run a strong, national campaign without a super PAC and without depending on millionaires and billionaires for their support. We are making history and we are proud of it.\"\nThe 2,513,665 donations to Sanders' campaign broke the record set four years ago by President Barack Obama's re-election committee. Through Dec. 31, 2011, Obama had chalked up 2,209,636 donations.\nThe more than 1 million donors to Sanders also is a milestone unmatched by any first-time White House candidate. Obama's millionth donor in his 2008 campaign came on Feb. 27 of that election year. (In the next election cycle, the incumbent president's re-election campaign hit the 1-million- donors mark on Oct. 17, 2011.)\nUnlike other campaigns, small contributions made up the vast majority of all the money Sanders' campaign raised. The average donation to Sanders during the past three months was $27.16.\nUnlike other presidential campaigns, 99.9 percent of Sanders' supporters may give again because they have not reached the legal limit on donations to traditional campaign committees. Only a few hundred of the more than 1 million Sanders donors have given the maximum $2,700.\nUnlike candidates who have coordinated with so-called super PACs, Sanders has refused to work with the fund-raising behemoths that have corrupted American politics.\nAll told, Sanders supporters gave $33,281,952 during the Federal Election Commission reporting period that ended at midnight on New Year's Eve. Secretary Clinton's campaign announced on Friday that she raised $37 million in the last quarter for use in the Democratic primary. The total for Sanders far surpassed donations in either of the previous two quarters of his eight-month long campaign and brought the fundraising total for 2015 to $72.8 million. Sanders ended the year with $28.4 million cash on hand.\nThe record number of donations to Sanders is one way to measure the grassroots enthusiasm for his campaign. Another sign of his success has been big turnouts at rallies and town meetings in Iowa and New Hampshire and other states. In Iowa alone, more than 35,000 have come to Sanders-sponsored campaign events.\n\"Bernie is the only candidate generating the kind of broad-based enthusiasm and excitement that Democrats must have in order to raise funds for a general election campaign and keep the White House and make gains in Congress,\" Weaver said.", "timestamp": "2016-01-02", "title": "Press Release - Sanders' People-Powered Campaign Smashes Record Number of Donations, Revolutionizes American Politics"}

We can't stop him from using executive orders during his waning presidency to implement his futile ideas, but we can, figuratively speaking, give those ideas both barrels, shoot them full of holes and, with the next election, stop them in their tracks and attack the problem of gun violence in a way that makes sense.", "timestamp": "2016-01-02", "title": "Statement by Governor Mike Huckabee: \"Do You Feel Lucky?\""}

But Clinton said Saturday that even a 22.9-percent effective rate was still too low, and proved that the tax burden in the U.S. is not adequately shared.\n\"Thanks to President Obama's leadership, we've seen a notable uptick in the effective tax rate paid by the wealthiest Americans in 2013. But it's clear that those at the top are still gaming the system and leaving hard-working American families holding the bag,\" Clinton said. \"A quarter of the very highest earning taxpayers, those earning more than $250 million per year on average, pay a federal income tax rate of less than 20%. That's not fair and it's not good for our economy, placing burdens on middle class families and holding back investments that would help us grow.\"\nThe IRS data was released the same week that a published report pulled back the curtain on the cottage industry of tax lawyers and personal accountants who help the ultra-wealthy shelter their income and avoid U.S. taxes. Clinton has pledged that, as President, she would seek to close many of the tax loopholes that contribute to this tax avoidance. She has also pledged support for the so-called \"Buffett rule,\" a concept proposed annually as part of President Obama's budget that would guarantee that the wealthiest Americans pay an effective tax rate no less than 30 percent.\nToday, however, Clinton said she would go further, promising that later this month, she will announce additional proposals to ensure that the wealthiest US households actually pay a fair effective tax rate on their income.\n\"As President, I'll do what it takes to make sure the super-wealthy are truly paying their fair share. The Buffett rule is one idea that would help achieve greater fairness in our tax system, and in the coming weeks, I will be laying out additional proposals that go beyond the Buffett rule,\" Clinton said.", "timestamp": "2016-01-02", "title": "As New Data Reveals Top U.S. Earners Still Pay Only 23% Effective Tax Rate, Clinton Promises New Steps To Ensure Wealthiest Pay Fair Share"}

We judge a country not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it produces, but by how it treats the most vulnerable people,\" Sanders told the crowd of 280.\n\"We've got too many seniors who are struggling to provide for their basic needs. Instead of giving huge tax breaks to the wealthiest people in this country, we should pay attention to the needs of senior citizens trying to survive on as little as $12,000 a year,\" he added.\nSanders has introduced a bill in the U.S. Senate to bring down prescription drug prices, which soared more than 12 percent in 2014, the biggest jump in a decade. The legislation by Sanders and Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland would authorize the U.S. Health and Human Services Department to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies. Their bills also would make it legal to import less expensive drugs from Canada and other countries.\n\"If I am elected president of the United States, the pharmaceutical industry will know who the president is and their greed is going to end,\" Sanders said.\nOn Social Security, he told seniors that there will be no cost-of-living increase this year. It is only the third time in 40 years that payments will stay flat. Sanders said the consumer price index, which is used to calculate annual COLAs, does not accurately reflect how inflation in health care costs and prescription drug prices impact seniors. Sanders has proposed legislation to increase COLAs by accurately measuring the spending patterns of seniors.\nAlso under Sanders' Social Security plan, the wealthiest Americans who make more than $250,000 a year would pay the same share of their income into Social Security as everyone else. Current law now caps the amount of income subject to payroll taxes at $118,500. Sanders' proposal to lift the cap would raise taxes only on the wealthiest 1.5 percent of Americans. The new revenue would expand Social Security benefits by an average of $65 a month, increase cost-of-living adjustments and lift seniors out of poverty by boosting benefits for low-income beneficiaries.\nSocial Security is a key source of income for 42,000 people in New Hampshire whose benefits in 2014 averaged about $15,000. Without Social Security, more than 41 percent of the elderly in New Hampshire would be living in poverty.

And he joins me this morning from New Hampshire. Happy new year, Senator Sanders.\nWe noticed that today is the 25th anniversary of your first day in Congress. Twenty five years, what do you say to critics who say the country needs a president from outside Washington and not a career politician?\nSANDERS: Well, what I say is if you study my record, I'm not exactly a career politician. Martha, during my tenure in the Congress, I have taken on virtually every powerful special interest from Wall Street to the insurance companies to the pharmaceutical industry to the military- industrial complex.\nWhat my campaign is about is standing up to the billionaire class today, and making certain that we do not continue to see the decline of the American middle class, where people are working longer hours for lower wages and almost all new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent. That is the issue that I find that the American people are most concerned about, the decline of the middle class, massive income and wealth inequality, and a corrupt campaign finance system.\nRADDATZ: Well, let me take you back to 1990 on election night. This is what you said. \"We need a mass movement of tens of millions of people prepared to say that we want national health care, that we want the millionaires and multi-national corporations who are not paying their fair share, to pay their fair share.\"\nThat sounds an awful lot like Bernie Sanders 2015, but you haven't really been able to create that mass movement. How can we imagine that you'll do it now?\nSANDERS: Well, Martha, we're doing pretty well. You know, I started this campaign at 3 percent in the polls. There were some polls that had me out recently at 39 percent. Come to my meetings. They're huge all over the United States of America.\nAnd what we are seeing is mass dissatisfaction on the part of the middle class. We're seeing people who are really upset that they can't afford to send their kids to college. They can't afford childcare. The rich are getting richer; almost everybody else is getting poorer. And what people are saying is, you know, it's absurd. That with massive income...\nRADDATZ: Let me turn to Iowa.\nSANDERS: ...and wealth inequality...\nRADDATZ: Let me turn to Iowa, Senator Sanders. This is what you recently said at a campaign stop.\n[begin video clip]\nSANDERS: Let me tell you a secret, don't tell anybody. I don't want to get Secretary Clinton nervous. [cheers] I think we're going to win here in Iowa. [cheers]\n[end video clip]\nRADDATZ: I don't know how nervous Secretary Clinton is about that. She has consistently led in the polls in Iowa through the latter part of 2015. What can you possibly do to try to stop that momentum in just four weeks?\nSANDERS: Martha, should have been with us in our last trips to Iowa. The turnouts that we're seeing in big towns and in small towns are extraordinary. The enthusiasm is very, very strong. I think that people are tired of establishment politics and establishment economics. And they are also tired of a corrupt campaign finance system in super PACs that allows billionaires to purchase elections. That's not what the American people want.\nAnd one of the manifestations of that is the kind of incredible fundraising that we have been doing in terms of small, individual donations. We have 2.5 million small, individual contribution-style campaign. That is more than any campaign in the history of the United States of America, and I think that speaks to the enthusiasm and support that we're getting at the grassroots.\nRADDATZ: Hillary Clinton has Bill Clinton joining her on the campaign trail there in New Hampshire this week. Donald Trump and Washington Post columnist Ruth Marcus think Bill Clinton's sexual history is fair game. Do you?\nSANDERS: No, I don't. I think, you know, we have enormous problems facing this country and I think we got more things to worry about than Bill Clinton's sexual life. I think -- interestingly enough, maybe Donald Trump might want to focus attention on climate change, understand that climate change is not a hoax, as he believes that it is, that maybe Donald Trump should understand that we should raise the minimum wage in this country, which he opposes, and maybe we should not be giving huge tax breaks to fellow billionaires like Donald Trump.\nSo I think maybe he should focus on those things.\nRADDATZ: You have had some very harsh words for Donald Trump recently and you said you wanted to stay away from personal attacks...\nSANDERS: Yes.\nRADDATZ: ...in this campaign.\nSANDERS: Right.\nRADDATZ: Some of the things you've said, like calling him a pathological liar, have been pretty personal.\nSANDERS: Yes. The truth is I do not get engaged in personal attacks, but Trump really is over the edge. He has attacked me very ferociously and has called me a liar because I point that out, that nobody else has seen on television thousands of Muslims celebrating the destruction of the Twin Towers.\nTime after time, this guy just comes up with things off the top of his head that are lies. And somebody has got to say that he is a pathological liar.\nRADDATZ: Senator Sanders, President Obama is reportedly considering executive action that would require unlicensed gun dealers to get licensed by the ATF and conduct background checks on potential buyers. Recent polling shows three in four Americans thinks it's important that there be bipartisan consensus before implementing gun control. Is an executive action that circumvents Congress the right way to do it?\nSANDERS: Well, I wish that we could get bipartisan action on gun safety legislation. I think the American people have been horrified by the mass shootings we've seen over the last couple of years. What I think we need to do, among many other things, is do away with the so- called gun show loophole where people are -- do not have to go through the instant background check.\nMartha, there is a wide consensus, overwhelming majority of the American people believe we should expand and strengthen the instant background checks so that people who should not have guns, are i.e. criminals or people with mental issues, mental health issues, should not guns. I think that's what the president is trying to do and I think that will be the right thing to do.\nRADDATZ: And very quickly, Senator Sanders, on the campaign trail last week, you said that the retaking of Ramadi in Iraq is a model for destroying ISIS and that training of Iraqi troops may have turned things around. Eighty percent of the reason Ramadi is falling is because of coalition air strikes, though. That's what you think should continue?\nSANDERS: Right. I think it has to be Muslim troops on the ground who are fighting for the soul of Islam, supported by U.S., French, U.K., German, other major powers, and using our air superiority.\nRADDATZ: Might be very difficult to get those ground troops, but thank you very much, Senator Sanders.", "timestamp": "2016-01-03", "title": "Interview with Martha Raddatz of ABC News' \"This Week\""}
{"author": "Josh Earnest", "note": "* White House correction.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111380", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n12:58 P.M. EST\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome back. I'm glad the New Year has you in a good spirit and you can join in some ribbing of some of my more tanned colleagues. (Laughter.) I don't see too many tans out in the audience today -- I suspect that's mostly because that many of you actually got a little time off, and I hope it was a pleasant opportunity to spend a little time with your family. I know I certainly enjoyed that opportunity, so I hope all of you did as well.\nBut obviously, this is going to be a pretty exciting year for a variety of reasons. And we're starting off fast, and we've got a lot of work to get to. So let's go straight to questions. Julie, do you want to start?\nQ: Thanks, Josh. So, to start with, one of the things the President is getting underway this week, he's meeting with Loretta Lynch this afternoon to talk about gun control recommendations. Is it your expectation that he will come out of this meeting ready to announce what he's planning to do? Do you expect that to be an announcement for later this week?\nMR. EARNEST: I would anticipate that the President will have an announcement quite soon where he will discuss some steps that his administration has concluded and that he has concluded are within his executive authority that would keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them. And there are common-sense steps that he can take, using his authority, that do not undermine the constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans. But we have to do something in this country to address the consequences of Congress's failure to act.\nAnd, look, there are more than 30,000 Americans who die every year as the result of a gun. And we're not going to be able to pass a law or take an executive action that would prevent every single incident of gun violence, but if there's something that we can do that would prevent even one, why wouldn't we do it? And that's the President's mindset as he enters this meeting with his Attorney General and as he prepares to make some announcements.\nQ: A lot of the executive actions the President has done on other topics have faced pretty swift legal challenges. You've already seen Republicans talking about things that they expect the President to announce being unconstitutional, overstepping his bounds. Is the White House, as you prepare for these announcements, also preparing for a legal fight? And do you expect that whatever he announces is something that could be implemented right away, or do you expect it to be tied up in the courts for perhaps the rest of his presidency?\nMR. EARNEST: Part of the work -- a lot of the work that has gone on behind the scenes to take a look at what the President can do using his executive authority has been grounded in the knowledge that the gun lobby and the Republicans in Congress who regularly do their bidding are going to look for ways to try to stop it. And we know that they are likely to try to pursue a creative legal theory to prevent the implementation of these rules. And that's why the President wants to be sure that the recommendations that he receives and the executive actions that he carries out are going to stand up in a court of law.\nAnd a lot of the work that has gone on has been to ensure that we would have confidence in the legal basis of these actions. And I feel confident in telling you now that what the President does announce will be the kinds of actions in which we have a lot of confidence that they are within the legal ability of the President of the United States to carry out these actions.\nQ: If I could switch to another topic. Saudi Arabia and now some of its allies have either cut off or downgraded diplomatic relations with Iran. How concerning is this to the White House -- not just the dynamic between the Saudis and the Iranians, but also as it relates to diplomatic efforts in Syria and like the situation in Yemen?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Julie, we do continue to be concerned about the need for both the Iranians and the Saudis to deescalate the situation in the Middle East; that we're urging all sides to show some restraint and to not further inflame tensions that are on quite vivid display in the region.\nAnd Secretary Kerry has been in touch with his Iranian counterpart; United States diplomatic officials in Saudi Arabia have been in touch with their counterparts to convey this message. I would anticipate that Secretary Kerry will be in touch with his Saudi counterpart at some point soon, as well, to deliver that same message.\nAnd we have seen that a lot of the volatility and instability in the Middle East has a tendency to break down along sectarian lines. It's not a coincidence. And we believe that there is more that can be done by people on all sides to try to bridge those divides in a way that advances the interests of countries all across the region.\nFor example, Syria, I think, situation is probably the most vivid example of this. The United States has succeeded in leading the international effort to bring all sides together to try to bring about a political resolution to the situation inside of Syria.\nQ: But do you worry that with this now happening between the Saudis and the Iranians that it could influence that effort and perhaps cause it to break down?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we certainly hope -- we're hopeful that it won't. One reason that we are hopeful that it won't is that it is so clearly in the interests of both countries to advance a political solution to the situation inside of Syria.\nThe reason that Iran and Saudi Arabia have participated in those conversations that are led by Secretary Kerry are not out of charity. They're doing it because they have their own vested interest in trying to bring about an end to some of the chaos inside of Syria, and they're looking for a way that they can contribute constructively to that process.\nIt was a lot of painstaking diplomatic work to bring them to the table the first time. And there will always be reasons for them to be suspicious and be reluctant to engage with countries that they consider to be their adversaries, but the pursuit of this ultimate goal is so clearly within their own direct interest that we're hopeful that they will continue to engage. But ultimately, it will be up to them.\nRoberta.\nQ: You talked about calls that Secretary Kerry has made or is planning to make. Has the President made any calls to any of his counterparts on this issue?\nMR. EARNEST: As of this moment, the President has not made any calls to the leaders of either of those countries to discuss this issue. But certainly the President is aware of the situation, and the message that Secretary Kerry and other U.S. diplomats have been delivering is certainly consistent with the President's perspective on the situation.\nQ: And did Saudi Arabia give the White House a heads-up before cutting off ties with Iran?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not going to get into the details of all of the diplomatic conversations between the United States and Saudi officials. I can tell you that the United States regularly has raised concerns about the human rights situation inside of Saudi Arabia. The President has even done that in his conversations with King Salman. And more recently, there have been direct concerns raised by U.S. officials to Saudi officials about the potential damaging consequences of following through on the execution -- on mass executions, in particular the execution of al-Nimr, the political opposition figure but also a religious leader. And this is a concern that we raised with the Saudis in advance. And unfortunately, the concerns that we expressed to the Saudis have precipitated the kinds of consequences that we were concerned about.\nQ: Why did the U.S. pull back from imposing new sanctions on Iran's ballistic missile program last week? And did Saudi Arabia express irritation to the administration about that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Roberta, I think there are a couple things about this. The first is, we have been talking publicly for some time about the potential that the United States could levy sanctions against Iran in light of ballistic missile tests that they conducted last year. This is an option that has been on the table for some time and it's one that has been carefully considered by the experts at the Treasury Department, who are responsible for imposing those kinds of financial penalties.\nWe know that those kinds of financial penalties have an impact and they are helpful in countering Iran's ballistic missile program. But ultimately, we will impose those financial penalties -- we'll impose those sanctions at a time and place of our choosing when our experts believe they would have the maximum impact. And those decisions are not subject to negotiation by the Iranians -- or anybody else for that matter. They are actually -- those decisions are made based solely on the conclusion of our financial experts about ensuring that those penalties have the maximum impact.\nQ: So did Saudi Arabia express any irritation about the sanctions not being levied at this particular time?\nMR. EARNEST: You'd have to ask them about that. But, again, the decision that the United States makes about imposing sanctions against the Iranians for their ongoing ballistic missile program are made based on our judgment about when those penalties would have the maximum impact.\nJulie.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. What does the President think about the situation that's unfolding in Oregon on this preserve? It's federal land, and the standoff has been going on now for a few days with these armed protestors. So I wonder whether he's planning to talk with the Attorney General about this. Does he think that the federal government needs to take some action against these people? They seem to be occupying these buildings and not moving.\nMR. EARNEST: The President is certainly aware of the situation. I, frankly, would be surprised if it came up in the context of the conversation the President is planning to have later today with his Attorney General. The FBI has indicated that they're working with local law enforcement officials to resolve the situation, and we're hopeful that that situation can be resolved peacefully and without any violence.\nQ: Does the President believe these people have a right to be on this land at this point?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not sure the President has spent a lot of time considering the case of the individuals who are carrying out this action. This ultimately is a local law enforcement matter. The FBI is monitoring the situation and offering support to the local law enforcement officials as they try to deal with it.\nQ: But what is the federal government's role, given that it's federal land? I mean, you said the FBI is involved, but it can't be purely a local law enforcement matter when they're occupying federal lands.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, certainly the concern that we have is for the safety of federal personnel that work in those facilities. To our knowledge at this point, there are no federal employees that are at risk or in danger right now. Obviously we're aware of the situation and concerned about it, but ultimately right now this is a matter that local law enforcement is handling and they're doing so with the support of the FBI.\nQ: Has the federal government provided any guidance, or the administration, any guidance to the employees of that facility that they should not enter or not attempt to go to their place of work?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of that. You might check with the Department of the Interior that I believe manages these facilities.\nMara.\nQ: Just to follow up on what you said to Julie earlier about court challenges to the executive actions on guns. You said the President is confident that the recommendations will stand up in a court of law. But you are a short-timer -- the administration is a short-timer, the clock is ticking -- (laughter) -- and it's not so much of whether you might eventually prevail, it's just that, as we saw with the immigration orders, they can be tied up to the point where the clock just runs out and they can't be -- so how confident are you that the court challenges will actually all be finished in time for these to go into effect before you leave office?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I certainly am not going to be in the business of predicting court outcomes. What I can tell you is that the President will only put forward recommendations -- or only put forward executive actions in which he has confidence in their constitutionality.\nOne of the reasons that this particular effort to scrub the law, as the President described it, to consider what executive authority he has to keep guns out of the wrong hands has been rooted in his desire to make sure that these would stand up in a court of law. And we want to make sure that the arguments that we can make are arguments that we can make with not just confidence in their ability to address the issue, but also confidence in their legal standing.\nQ: Right. But can't the opponents stop the actions merely by tying them up in court for 12 months, which is all you've got?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I certainly wouldn't be surprised if they try. But again, the kind of arguments that we'll be able to mobilize in a court of law are ones that I am confident will be powerful and persuasive. Ultimately, a judge will have to decide. But we should not be distracted, however, from the fact that the reason the President is taking these actions is because Congress has utterly failed in their responsibility to do so. Congress time and again has had multiple opportunities to take action that would make it harder for the wrong hands to get ahold of guns. And there are steps that Congress can take that would not undermine the basic constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans, but Congress has refused. Congress has failed to take those actions. So the President is going to use his executive authority to follow through and take what steps he can.\nI can tell you that after the President takes those steps, Congress is still going to have a responsibility to act in their own right, as well. This will not eliminate the responsibility that Congress has to take steps that only they can take to keep guns out of the wrong hands. So the President is going to make this announcement soon, and there will be some important steps that he will take. But that will not be the end of this debate. There will still be a responsibility that Congress has to take action.\nChristi.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. You said at the beginning that there are some steps that the President has concluded are within his executive power. Has he already made up his mind? When did he do that? And is he, today in the meeting with the AG, directing her to carry them out?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, you'll have an opportunity to hear from the President when he meets with the Attorney General, so I'll let him speak for himself in that case. I can tell you that there are a number of recommendations that the President has considered and I would anticipate that we will very soon have some announcements about what actions the President has chosen to take.\nQ: Is it fair to say that he believes it's within his executive power to increase or to expand the number of people who have to register as a federally licensed firearms dealer?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there are a range of things that have been considered. And given that we will have some announcements relatively soon here, rather than speculate on what the President is likely to decide, let's let the President make a decision here and announce these steps. And then we can discuss sort of the pros and cons of what's been decided.\nQ: Just one more thing. Is he talking to us before the meeting with the AG, or after?\nMR. EARNEST: It's after. It will be after the meeting. So he'll have an opportunity to tell you a little bit about that discussion.\nMichelle.\nQ: There have been bipartisan attempts to act on this and they did fail. And in the normal course of events where you could say the way the system is supposed to work and also the way the system is supposed to work -- that kind of congressional action would be informed by public opinion. So we now have a record of these attempts on a bipartisan basis failing, and now public opinion is showing that a majority of Americans oppose stricter gun laws. So are all of those people wrong?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Michelle, I think the polls actually indicate that there is strong support for some common-sense steps that Congress could take. For example, closing what is often referred to as the gun show loophole, essentially ensuring that everybody who tries to purchase a firearm, whether it's at a gun show or at a gun store or over the Internet, has to undergo a background check -- according to a recent poll, 84 percent of voters in households with guns support requiring background checks on gun purchases at gun shows or online.\nPeople have been conducting a lot of polls of Iowa Republicans lately. I'm not sure why that is, he said jokingly. (Laughter.) But recent polls indicate that three out of four Iowa Republicans support barring people -- or support requiring criminal background checks for all gun purchases. A similar number applies to New Hampshire Republicans -- 81 percent of New Hampshire Republicans supports background checks on all gun purchases.\nSo this is not just -- this is not something that -- this is not a partisan endeavor, and this is not just something that is being advanced by people who are strong advocates of gun control. Gun owners and Republicans overwhelmingly support at least this common-sense step, closing the gun show loophole.\nThere are similar statistics that apply to congressional action that would prevent those individuals who are on the no-fly list from being able to buy a gun. That's a pretty common-sense step. If the government has determined that it is too dangerous for you to board an airplane, you shouldn't be able to purchase a firearm. About three out of four Republicans who were surveyed recently came to the same conclusion and agree with that notion. And I know that there's at least one Republican candidate for President who has articulated his support for that.\nQ: I mean, you can look at very specific aspects of this, but when you see broadly that a majority of Americans now, and fewer than a couple of years ago, support [sic] stricter gun control laws, even after the mass shootings, even after all those impassioned statements by the President -- to what does the administration attribute those numbers, that a majority of Americans would feel that way?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, what the President is focused on in the context of this exercise is very directly on what steps this administration can take to keep guns out of the wrong hands. And we're not under the illusion that that is going to prevent every incident of gun violence, but if it's possible that we could prevent even one or two incidents of gun violence, then we're going to eagerly implement those executive actions. And that's exactly what the President is focused on.\nQ: Is there any evidence that any of the President's prior executive actions on gun control have kept guns out of the wrong hands? Is there any evidence that whatever he does now will do that? And I mean, I think some of the criticism in the past has been -- or it's possible that the reason so many Americans oppose stricter laws is maybe they feel like those laws or those actions wouldn't have any effect. So why do you think that this -- whatever the action is going to be -- would be different?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me take that question a couple of different ways. After the terribly tragic shooting at Newtown in Connecticut at the end of 2012, in early 2013, the President announced about 23 executive actions that he was taking, again, to try to keep guns out of the wrong hands. Some of those steps related to ensuring that federal agencies were providing the necessary records to the system that conducts background checks. And the result was a 46 percent increase in the amount of federal records that were provided to the background check service -- it's called NICS.\nOne of the executive actions also had to do with providing an incentive to states and greater clarity to states to ensure that they're providing records, and that has resulted in a 69 percent increase in the number of records that are provided to the background check service. Now the question is, well, what's really the point of providing all that information to the background checks services if there are loopholes? That's precisely why the President supports closing loopholes. Ostensibly, that's why a majority of Americans -- including a majority of gun-owners and Republicans -- supports closing loopholes.\nBut even with the loopholes existing, our background check system over the last decade and a half or so has prevented about 2 million gun transactions. That's 2 million guns that were blocked from going into the hands of people who shouldn't have them. So the idea that we can do more to ensure that more transactions are subjected to those background checks -- that's a pretty common-sense step. And we can do that in a common-sense way because we know that a law-abiding American who doesn't have mental problems, is not the subject of a restraining order, can go through the background check system and in a timely fashion purchase a gun. And, again, that's sort of part of the kind of common-sense steps that we believe should guide these kinds of decisions.\nAlexis.\nQ: Josh, I'm going to follow up again on guns. Last year, the President was very forthright in his belief that, with the blockade in Congress, he wanted to make this a political issue. He talked about the issue as part of the body politic. Because of the number of times where he even talked about this, leading up to the State of the Union and afterwards, can you describe what his goals are in the body politic with his concentration on this issue this year, beyond what you've described as trying to keep people alive? But beyond that, what is his hope?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think his top priority is ensuring that he is using every element of his executive authority to take common-sense actions that would keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them. And that is what will -- that's what's driving the announcement that I think you can expect sometime pretty soon.\nSeparate from that, I would anticipate that the President wants to continue to engage in a dialogue and a debate about additional steps that Congress can take that would make our community safer. Again, the President doesn't operate under the illusion that there is a law that can be passed that would prevent every single incident of gun violence, but there are laws that can be passed that would reduce the likelihood that guns are going to fall into the hands of people who shouldn't have them. And we can pass those laws and implement them and enforce them in a way that doesn't undermine the constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans.\nAnd so I think the President's desire to have this discussion and have this debate I think is -- I think a piece of evidence that you have for that is that the President has agreed to participate in a town hall meeting later this week that will be broadcast in primetime on a notable cable television network, and I think that's an indication of the President's desire to not just focus on what he can do himself, using his executive authority to keep guns out of the wrong hands, but what he can do to lead an ongoing debate in this country about steps that can be taken and should be taken to reduce gun violence in communities all across the country.\nQ: You mentioned mental health. And Speaker Ryan talked about mental health in his statement this morning. Does the President believe that there is any good element of cooperation that could come out of just talking to House Republicans, including Speaker Ryan, about what more could be done on the issue of mental health?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I will say that there is a lot of skepticism rooted in Republican claims that they care about improving mental health care in this country when they're prepared this week to actually take their 60th vote to repeal the very law that has done more to expand access to mental health care than any other law in decades. So it's a little hard to consider their claim that they're interested in investing in mental health care as anything other than an attempt to excuse their own inaction to do something serious, like standing up to the NRA and passing a common-sense measure that would reduce gun violence.\nLalit.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Happy New Year.\nMR. EARNEST: Happy New Year to you, too.\nQ: On December 25th, the Indian Prime Minister visited Lahore with another peace initiative with Pakistan. And within a week there was another major terrorist attack inside India, this time again coming from across the border. What do you make of the situation there? Should India continue the peace initiative or they should --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Lalit, obviously the leaders of both countries are going to have to decide for themselves what they believe is in the interests of their citizens. The United States certainly believes that warmer relations and more cooperation between the government of India and the government of Pakistan would in the interests of both countries. But ultimately the leaders of those countries will have to decide for themselves.\nQ: And when the Pakistani Prime Minister was here, there was a joint statement issued by U.S. and Pakistan in which the Pakistanis promised that they will take action against terrorist groups like Lashkar-e-Tayyiba. Do you see any action being taken by them against these terrorist groups?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Lalit, obviously the United States and Pakistan have a security relationship that advances the interests of both of our countries. Thousands -- hundreds, if not thousands of Pakistani citizens have been the victims of terrorist groups and terrorist actions inside Pakistan over the last several years. So obviously the government of Pakistan has their own interest in trying to fight extremism and fight terrorist organizations that are operating inside their own country.\nAnd the United States has offered our support to the Pakistani government. We obviously want to help them with -- particularly in light of that terrible terrorist incident where we saw an extremist organization carry out an attack against an elementary school inside of Pakistan -- that was a little over a year ago, I believe. That I think was a rather vivid illustration -- for people who don't closely follow this issue -- that citizens in Pakistan and the Pakistani government has their own vested interest in trying to deal with terrorist organizations that are attempting to operate inside their country. And the United States obviously strongly supports the Pakistani government as they do that.\nQ: And finally -- the President invited the Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan in March some time?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any upcoming meetings between the President and the leaders of India and Pakistan. But if anything like that materializes, we'll certainly let you know.\nJames.\nQ: Josh, happy New Year.\nMR. EARNEST: Happy New Year to you, too.\nQ: I wanted to cover two subjects with you. One, guns; and the other the Middle East.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay.\nQ: We'll start with guns. You spoke repeatedly in this briefing about the confidence the President has in the lawfulness of the measures he is soon to implement. How did that confidence arise? Did he task people at the Office of Legal Counsel and the Department of Justice to provide legal memos on that subject?\nMR. EARNEST: We'll have an opportunity to get into a little bit more of this work after the President has made an announcement on this. But I will say, James, that there have been attorneys both at the White House and at the Department of Justice that have been carefully looking at the law to determine what authority the President does have to take action in this area. And their focus, as I mentioned earlier, was not just on what would be effective in addressing the problem, which is keeping guns out of the wrong hands, but also making sure that the steps that the President was taking were well within his legal authority.\nAnd so the attorneys who have been working on this were carefully considering both elements here. And that's what gives me the confidence to assert that what the President does announce will be something in which he has full confidence in the legal arguments that we could make about them.\nQ: Is it accurate to say that the President tasked the Attorney General with developing options in this realm and that she has complied?\nMR. EARNEST: The President certainly did ask the Department of Justice, including the Attorney General, to play a leading role in considering what authority was available to him to keep guns out of the hands of those who shouldn't have them.\nQ: Doesn't that call into question the independence of the Attorney General if the President can simply call her up like a Chinese food restaurant and order what he wants off the menu and she serves it up?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, unfortunately, the system for doing that wasn't quite as easy as ordering from column A and column B. Ultimately, experts at the Department of Justice had to carefully consider what the law would allow, and what -- I mean, they bring expertise of two varieties to this situation. The first is law enforcement expertise, which is understanding exactly what steps can be taken to more effectively enforce the laws that are on the books and close loopholes that may make those laws less effective than was originally intended. But they also bring an expertise in understanding exactly what the President can do using his existing executive authority and also understanding what only Congress can do. So using both of those areas of expertise, the President was able to get some recommendations from the Department of Justice.\nQ: You've repeatedly talked here today and elsewhere previously about the gun lobby, the Republicans supposedly being in the grips of the gun lobby, about the need for the Republicans and lawmakers to stand up to the NRA. And I wonder if you don't consider that precisely divisive language that asserts that only one political party is in the grip of a lobby. Is the President or the Democratic Party in the grip of any lobbies that you know of?\nMR. EARNEST: I'll let you make that observation or reach that conclusion. Obviously, I think the President is, in this case, certainly, making a principled stand on an issue on which he is quite passionate. And there are certainly groups that have been formed because they are groups that have been formed that do share the President's view on this matter. There are also groups in existence that do not share the President's view and, in fact, oppose the steps that he is taking.\nI think what we have seen, unfortunately, James, is politicians who, despite the preponderance of the kind of evidence that I was citing earlier, oppose common-sense gun measures that are strongly supported both by gun owners and even by members of their own Republican Party. And the real problem, though, are the real-world consequences of them failing to act.\nQ: To finish up on guns, I was going to ask about the evidence that you cited earlier. You recited some polling statistics as evidence that some putative majority of the country feels about this subject the way the President does. And since you are content with reciting polling statistics from the podium, I wonder if you would then, here and now, concede the legitimacy and the validity of the wide body of polling that is available online for us all to see that shows a majority of Americans disapproving of the President's performance, or a majority of Americans feeling that he is not up to the job with respect to ISIS. There's all kinds of polls. And so if you're going to cite certain types of polls, do you regard those other kinds of polls that are not favorable to the President with equal legitimacy?\nMR. EARNEST: James, I think what I was doing is -- Michelle had asked a specific question about some polling that she had seen about a broad opposition to gun control measures in this country. And I pointed out that there is strong support, including in many polls, even among Republicans and among gun owners, for the kinds of common-sense steps that the President is advocating.\nSo I'll leave the polling analysis to all of you --\nQ: Except for when you cite them.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess if we're going to have a discussion about polls, we can do that. And if you want to have a discussion about polls related to ISIL, we can do that as well. I suspect, for example, that some of the positions that are taken by the President's critics are also not -- when it relates to ISIL are also not going to be strongly supported by Republican polls.\nQ: To move to the Middle East, very quickly, two questions. In your comments about the tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran in this briefing I detected a kind of studied neutrality, calling for both countries to deescalate, talking about how Secretary Kerry has reached out to one side and will soon be reaching out to the other. Is the United States neutral in this dispute?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, that's not how I would describe it. I think that the United States, frankly, has concerns with the way that both countries have carried out their activities over the last several days. Somebody asked earlier about the consultations we've had with the Saudis about the human rights situation inside of Saudi Arabia. And we have raised concerns in the past about mass executions, about a judicial process that isn't transparent or doesn't include any obvious due process; about the unfair targeting of religious minorities or political opposition figures. Those are concerns that we continue to have, and they certainly apply in this case, where Saudi Arabia announced the execution of 46 different individuals, including one prominent religious minority figure.\nOn the other hand, we are concerned about the failure of the Iranians to fulfill their responsibility to protect the Saudi diplomatic facilities inside of Iran. There's obviously -- Iran's failure to protect diplomatic facilities has obviously soured the relationship between our two countries, so I speak with a special sense of urgency about this. But we have been concerned about their failure to do that.\nSo I guess the point is there is plenty of blame to go around. And what we would like to see are both sides -- or all sides -- begin to take the kinds of steps that will deescalate the situation and not further inflame the tensions that are obviously pretty raw right now.\nQ: Last attempt at this. You have these two countries -- Saudi Arabia and Iran. Only one of these two countries can survey the situation and say truthfully, we are an ally of the United States; we have diplomatic relations with the United States; we are a coalition partner of the United States in several successive coalitions; we have prominent commercial ties to the United States for decades of standing. The other party is the central banker of terrorism and engaged in repeated illegal ballistic missile tests. And so, why should the Saudis be satisfied to hear the United States speaking with such studied neutrality about the blame that is to go around? Why shouldn't the Saudis rather expect that the United States will behave like an ally in this situation with the Saudis?\nMR. EARNEST: James, there's no denying the United States has a much stronger and more effective relationship with Saudi Arabia than with Iran. But there's also no denying that Saudi Arabia's human rights record is something that has been the source of significant concern on the part of the Obama administration and previous administrations as well. Those are concerns that have been relayed directly by President Obama to the two Saudi Arabian leaders -- the two Saudi leaders that he has dealt with in his tenure as President, but these are also concerns that have been relayed to Saudi Arabia through a variety of channels. And I guess you could say that it is a testament to the strength of that relationship that we could be quite public and blunt about the concerns that we do have with their behavior.\nI would say that our concerns about Saudi Arabia's actions in this regard are related both to concerns that we have about the impact that these actions have on Saudi Arabia's national security, but we also have concerns about the impact that this has on U.S. interests in the region. For example, Julie asked I think an entirely legitimate question, which is we've got a very difficult situation that we're trying to navigate in terms of reaching a political resolution to the situation inside of Syria. It was very difficult to get everybody around the table. It certainly is going to be even more difficult to get everybody back around the table if you have the Saudis and the Iranians trading public barbs and public expressions of antagonism between the two countries. So we obviously want the situation to deescalate and for all sides to take the kinds of steps that will reduce tensions in the region.\nChris.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Going back to your favorite topic, polls, there's another one that was out recently that showed that more people thought allowing people to carry guns legally was a better response to terrorism than stricter gun control laws. Anecdotally, people at gun shows and gun shops have been saying that the threat of terror has brought a lot of people in to purchase guns, and I wonder if San Bernardino, unlike some of the other past shootings, has changed the equation. And is the President doing what he's doing with less support, do you think, as a result of that?\nMR. EARNEST: You'll have an opportunity to consider this after the President has announced a decision about steps that he's going to take. But based on the access to public data that we have seen so far, I think there is plenty of reason to be confident that the kinds of common-sense steps that the President will take using his executive authority are the kinds of steps that will be broadly supported not just by American citizens all across the country but, as a matter of policy, are the kinds of steps that even Republicans and gun owners would ordinarily support.\nNow, is that support going to show up in a public poll if President Obama's name is attached to it? We'll see. Probably not. But the President is focused on results. And the President is focused on taking common-sense steps that would keep guns out of the wrong hands.\nQ: So how was it determined that these are things that would be supported generally by the public? Was it polls, in part?\nMR. EARNEST: No. What I'm saying is that the President has prioritized taking common-sense steps using his executive authority that would keep guns out of the wrong hands without infringing on the constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans. Traditionally -- and, again recently, according to polls -- these are steps that are strongly supported by Americans in both parties, and even Americans who live in households that includes gun owners.\nSo I don't want to leave you with the impression that what the President is considering is poll-tested. What I want to leave you with the impression of is that the steps that the President will announce are entirely consistent with the kinds of common-sense steps that are strongly supported by the American people because they would do something important to keep guns out of the wrong hands, and they would do it without undermining the constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans.\nThe other thing that I think merits some discussion here is the fact that we have actually seen Republicans in the not-too-distant past actually articulate their support for some of these common-sense measures. President Bush -- President George W. Bush, in the context of both his presidential election and his reelection, expressed support for background checks at gun shows. When he was running for reelection in October of 2004, President George W. Bush said \"I believe in background checks at gun shows or anywhere to make sure that guns don't get in the hands of people that shouldn't have them.\"\nThis is not a controversial notion. This is something that the previous Republican President, one that everybody would agree is a conservative, a proud gun owner himself, and certainly had previously served as the governor of a state with a large number -- millions of gun owners -- this is a position that he has taken. So that is what infuses my confidence that there is strong public support as a policy matter for these steps.\nQ: There's also a political aspect to this, obviously. And Donald Trump said he would \"unsign\" these executive orders \"so fast,\" is the way he put it. Chris Christie called the President a \"petulant child.\" I wonder if the President has had any conversations with any of the Democratic candidates or intends to give them a heads-up about what his plans are in terms of the obvious politic reality that this is already a hot topic, even before they're officially announced?\nMR. EARNEST: I can't speak to all of the conversations that will take place prior to the President announcing a decision on this. I think many of you are aware that the President is meeting with some members of Congress, Democrats, who have previously made gun safety a priority and have said that it's a priority. So those kinds of conversations are occurring.\nI do think it's probably worth taking a close look at Governor Christie's record on some of these issues in particular to see whether or not he has changed his position in an effort to try to round up votes in a Republican presidential primary. I'll leave that up to you guys to decide.\nQ: But?\nMR. EARNEST: But the President is taking these steps not because he believes that it's a particularly powerful political argument -- I happen to think that it is -- but he's taking these steps because he believes we can save some lives. And that's the real tragedy in all of this, is that we have seen Republicans -- and some Democrats -- who refuse to take some what they perceive to be politically tough votes in Congress. And the consequences have been tragic.\nWe would like to see common-sense steps that would keep guns out of the wrong hands. And we would like to see loopholes closed that would do that in a way that doesn't undermine the basic constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans. And the President has got some ideas for how to do this. His team has been looking carefully at the law to make sure that he has the authority to do this, and to make sure that the steps that he is taking have the intended effect. And the President will make this announcement soon, and we'll have an opportunity to consider the merits of these individual proposals.\nQ: Just want to fact-check. You mentioned the 23 executive orders that were signed after Newtown. I believe there have been two more since, so there have been 25 total related to guns since Newtown?\nMR. EARNEST: I believe that's right, but we can check the statistics with you.\nAnita.\nQ: Thanks. I just wanted to kind of understand, why now? So there was the 23 -- and I actually don't remember the two -- the 23 that we all covered a few years ago. The Vice President had his group and he went around the country and talked to people about that. There was a whole study then three years ago about what he could do. He didn't do, presumably, what he's going to do this week or whatever he's going to announce. So there's been more mass shootings, I know, but there have been for three years. What happened? Congress voted two and a half years ago and didn't pass anything. So what happened recently that this is coming up now with less than a year in office?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me say a couple of things about that, Anita. The first is we certainly are concerned about these mass shootings that have gotten so much attention. But there are also shootings that take place every day all across the country, in some cases, presumably, shootings that could have been prevented or at least made a lot more difficult for the people who carried out those shootings to have gotten their hands on a gun. So it's not just the high-profile incidents that dominate the news coverage for 36 or 48 or sometimes 72 hours.\nBut, look, there's an organization that Mr. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, runs, Everytown for Gun Safety, that according to analysis, there are seven children or teenagers killed by a gun in the average day. That's an alarming statistic. Now, they can tell you more about the statistic. I assume this includes suicides. I assume this includes accidents. But it's a tragedy.\nAnd there's no law that we're going to pass that prevents every single one of them, but not passing laws and a failure on the part of Congress to act hasn't helped the situation. And that's why the President is determined to act. And, look, it has taken some time for the President's team to scrub the law and to take a careful look at what exactly is within the realm of his executive authority and what exactly would have the intended effect. And they've been diligent about carefully considering the available options, and that's taken time.\nBut what's also taken time is for Congress to also consider their options. And yet, they have done nothing. And the only reason the President is being forced to act is because Congress hasn't taken the kinds of common-sense steps that he has long advocated.\nQ: Were these steps considered three years ago? I guess what I'm asking is, they haven't been studying them for three years. Why didn't they come up three years ago? Were these recommendations made three years ago?\nMR. EARNEST: We'll have an opportunity to answer those kinds of questions once an announcement has been made about what course the President has decided to pursue.\nQ: Oh, and can you just -- you mentioned earlier and we just wanted to clarify -- today's meeting with members of the Democratic Party or Democratic members of Congress?\nMR. EARNEST: There are a handful of Democratic members of Congress who have made gun safety a priority who will be meeting with the President today.\nQ: At the White House here?\nMR. EARNEST: At the White House.\nQ: Separate from the --\nMR. EARNEST: Separate from the meeting with the Attorney General. And we'll have some more information about that meeting once it's concluded.\nJen.\nQ: So you've talked a lot about the -- that these are common-sense steps, and then what you've said about some of the Republican opposition and being beholden to the gun lobby. I just want to understand -- are you saying that there is no principled reason for anyone to oppose these actions?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, if there is, I haven't heard it.\nQ: So no principled reason?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, people certainly have an opportunity to make their case. And members of Congress will have to make their case about how in the face of these alarming statistics -- 30,000 gun deaths in America every year; 20,000 children under the age of 18 have been killed by firearms over the last decade; hundreds of law enforcement officers that have been shot and killed over the last decade. And in the face of all those statistics, what's Congress done?\nNow, maybe there is a principled case to be made about why they didn't do anything and why it's in the best interest of those hundreds of police officers that have been killed that Congress didn't take any steps. They're welcome to make that case. I haven't heard any sort of principled objection to that.\nQ: So Speaker Ryan said in his statement that this was subverting the legislative branch; that it was a dangerous level of basically executive overreach. So could you see the argument that while you may agree with this on policy, that the President -- that this is an expansion of his executive authority that future White Houses could well use? Maybe they don't agree with the executive authority being used here or see it as legal.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we'll have an opportunity to discuss this in more detail once the President has made an announcement. But I continue to be confident standing here knowing that what the President announces are the kinds of things that are well within his executive authority. I would note that Speaker Ryan's statement notes that it is a legislative failure that is prompting the President to act. On that measure we agree.\nThere's also something on which we agree. In January of 2013, shortly after the President announced executive actions three years ago, then-Congressman Paul Ryan, in an interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, said that gun show loopholes are a \"very reasonable issue,\" and it's \"obvious\" that it should be addressed. He said, \"I think we should look into someone who is not legally allowed to buy a gun going to a gun show, buying one. And let's figure that out. I think we need to find out how to close these loopholes and do it in such a way that we don't infringe on Second Amendment rights.\"\nThat's the Speaker of the House that's talking about this. He's been in Congress every day for the last three years, and it's unclear exactly what he's done to try to advance legislation that would do what he thinks is \"obvious\" and \"very reasonable\". But certainly in the next couple of days we'll have some tangible things that the President has done to take some common-sense steps that keeps guns out of the wrong hands.\nQ: And then finally, when you talk about that you do feel confident that this will withstand legal challenge, was there anything that the President wanted to do in this executive action but that he was advised was just beyond what the separation of powers would allow?\nMR. EARNEST: I think I've tried to be careful about not predicting judicial outcomes. And that's based on some of my own personal experience. So I wouldn't predict what the courts are going to rule. What I do predict and what I am confident of is that we will have a strong legal case to make about these actions being well within the President's executive authority. And we'll have an opportunity to discuss that once the President is prepared to actually make an announcement. When it comes to things that the President chose not to do, we can have a discussion about that also once we've discussed what the President has chosen to do.\nDavid.\nQ: Josh, there have been reports that the Department of Homeland Security and ICE have begun removal operations, I think is what they're calling it, and others are calling it raids against Central American families who came across the border illegally over the past year and a half. And some of the reports suggest that families -- the Los Angeles Times quoted a woman saying that her family in Georgia -- ICE agents came in room to room, woke up her own kids; they were shaking with fear. I'm wondering if the administration can confirm that those operations have begun, and whether the White House has had input directly with DHS about how those operations should be handled, and whether there are any concerns about striking fear into the communities -- including those who may be here legally -- living with some of these other folks as these are carried out.\nMR. EARNEST: David, for individual operations I would refer you to the Department of Homeland Security, and they can discuss with you individual operations that were carried out.\nWhat I can tell you is that the Department of Homeland Security has prioritized the cases of recent arrivals -- individuals who recently crossed the border into the United States without proper documentation. And those -- again, based on public statements, including a statement that was recently issued by the Secretary of Homeland Security -- were the nature of the operations that were carried out over the last couple of days.\nThis is consistent with the kinds of priorities that the President himself has talked about; that our enforcement efforts need to be focused on deporting felons, not families, and with a particular focus on individuals who have only recently crossed the border.\nBut, in general, I guess for these individual actions, I'd have to refer you to the Department of Homeland Security.\nQ: But you're confirming that a broader operation has begun?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm actually pointing to the statement from the Secretary of Homeland Security that has indicated that some operations have taken place that have been focused on individuals -- on deporting individuals who have recently crossed the border. And that is consistent with the kinds of enforcement priorities that the President and the Secretary of Homeland Security discussed more than a year ago when the President announced a set of executive actions related to immigration reform.\nQ: Have folks in the White House, including the President himself, talked at all with the Department of Homeland Security about sort of the way these operations are conducted -- the tone that they're taking and the way that they look for the immigrants and round them up?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously, in terms of setting policy, the White House and the Department of Homeland Security have had discussions about some of these matters. But, ultimately, when it comes to enforcement issues, those are decisions that are made by law enforcement professionals. And that's what the Department of Homeland Security has been engaged in.\nQ: There has been a sense from the Department of Homeland Security that some of these operations were prompted by the sense that the number of migrants coming from Central America has ticked up over the past few months again after some success on certainly the height of sort of the issue over a year ago. Was there also concern at the White House and other places about the discussions about -- from the Republicans on the campaign trail and elsewhere about securing the southern border but also worries about terrorism and others coming to the country illegally? Was that part of the motivation here?\nMR. EARNEST: I can assure you that politics did not factor in these kinds of enforcement decisions. And, in fact, I think it does warrant mentioning that, in fiscal year 2015, the number of apprehensions by the U.S. Border Patrol of those attempting to cross our southern border illegally decreased in what is actually the lowest number of apprehensions on the southern border since 1972 *[,with the exception of one year, 2011.] That is an indication that our borders are certainly more secure than they've been in quite some time, and that is thanks to a significant investment that this administration has made in border security.\nThere's more that we could have done when it comes to border security had Congress -- had Republicans in Congress not blocked an historic investment in border security. And it is also an indication that some of the other work that we have done that's been focused on Central America has yielded some fruit in stemming the tide of migrants from Central America to the United States.\nQ: Last question on this. I wonder if the White House, since -- do you expect -- there were over 100,000 of these families that came across I think in 2014 alone. Not all of the cases have been decided. Not all will be ordered to be returned to their countries. A similar number of unaccompanied minors came across last year and again this year. I'm wondering if the White House believes these raids will -- or these efforts will continue throughout this year, whether there's an estimated cost of this kind of operation, and whether the administration believes -- when you talk about focusing your resources on felons and others -- that this also can be done at the same time you're also looking for those other felons and those who have had other misdemeanors.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, there is a due process here, right? So there is a process by which people have to -- are evaluated by. They go through an immigration judicial proceeding. And the individuals who are participating -- who are the targets of some of these efforts were the subject of final orders of removal.\nIn each case, the individuals exhausted appropriate legal remedies, including questions about whether or not they could qualify for some form of humanitarian relief. So there is a judicial process and a legal due process that the administration is committed to following.\nBut for people who are considering -- we had a lot of these discussions 18 months ago -- for people who are considering -- who are in this country and considering asking their kids to travel from Central America through Mexico to enter the United States illegally, we strongly encourage them to not do that -- primarily because that's a very dangerous journey. We have seen individuals engaged in human trafficking try to prey upon those who are most vulnerable, including children. And too many children have been victimized and even lost their lives when trying to make that journey.\nSo certainly people should take from this the understanding that the administration is quite serious when it comes to enforcing our immigration laws and in focusing our efforts on felons and recent border crossers. That continues to be a priority, but it will be done within the context of due process.\nMary.\nQ: Beyond urging restraint and urging for Iran and Saudi Arabia to deescalate the situation, what specifically can the administration do? What do you plan to do to try and ensure that this growing tension doesn't hamper any efforts to deal with the crisis in Syria?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously that will be the subject of some of the discussions that Secretary Kerry will be having both with his Iranian counterpart and presumably with his Saudi counterpart relatively soon. Again, I think the case that we'll make to them when it comes to reaching a political solution to the situation inside of Syria, or at least pursuing that diplomatic political process, will be, frankly, similar to the case that we made to them in the fall where we got them to participate in that process in the first place, which is that it is in the interests of those two countries to try to resolve the political chaos inside of Syria; that neither side benefits from the ongoing violence, the flow of migrants, and the political instability that does threaten to spread to other parts of the region. That's not in either the Saudi or the Iranian interest.\nAnd that's why we're going to continue to urge them to participate in the broader international effort to try to bring about at least a resolution to the political differences there.\nQ: And you talked about the human rights concerns, but just to be clear, does the White House condemn these executions and the execution of al-Nimr?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we have raised significant concerns about the human rights environment in Saudi Arabia. And carrying out mass executions I think is a prime example of a government that is not doing enough to address the legitimate concerns that have been expressed by the international community about the human rights situation inside their own country.\nThe State Department put out a report detailing the long list of concerns that the U.S. has with Saudi Arabia's human rights record, and certainly mass executions would rate highly in that list of concerns and we certainly would condemn any country that's carrying out mass executions.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, back to the Oregon situation briefly. There have been some who have called the occupation of this federal facility an insurrection against the U.S. government. There's others who have called the people involved terrorists. Does the President agree with either of those characterizations?\nMR. EARNEST: Mark, I think it's difficult to discern exactly what the motive and intent is of the individuals who are undertaking this action inside of Oregon. Our hope is that local law enforcement can resolve the situation peacefully and relatively soon in a way that's consistent with the rule of law. And the FBI has indicated that they're monitoring the situation and have offered support to local law enforcement as they try to resolve it, and we're hopeful that it can be resolved without any violence.\nQ: But you don't agree with either of those characterizations? For example, you don't consider the fact that armed people taking over federal property a challenge to federal authority?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, right now, based on what we know about what has transpired, this is a law enforcement matter that's being handled by local law enforcement officials. Obviously, the federal government has a vested interest. As you point out, it's federal land and federal property that's being occupied. And that's why the FBI is closely monitoring the situation and has offered their assistance to local law enforcement officials who are dealing with this situation. But ultimately, our chief interest is the prompt and peaceful resolution of this particular matter.\nRebecca.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Following up on the ICE raids, this LA Times report out of Georgia detailed ICE agents entering a home without a warrant and taking a woman already under federal supervision into custody, along with her nine-year-old son. Why are nonviolent migrants and children and families being targeted as a priority for deportation?\nMR. EARNEST: Rebecca, I'm not able to speak to any individual law enforcement actions. So I'd encourage you to check with DHS or even ICE on that particular incident. What I can tell you more broadly is that the enforcement priorities that have been laid out by the administration are concentrating our efforts to deport felons, not families, and to prioritize the case of recent border crossers.\nThe individuals who were the targets of these efforts were subject to final orders of removal by an immigration court. And their appropriate legal remedies that included claims for asylum or humanitarian relief had been exhausted. And that's ultimately what it means to enforce the law.\nFor how that is applied in these individual cases, I'd encourage you to check with the Department of Homeland Security.\nCheryl, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Just one on executive orders. To put it in context, over the years, the President has taken a number of executive actions. Will this one on gun violence be the last major executive action of his presidency? Or do you anticipate more throughout the year? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Stay tuned. I told you at the beginning of this briefing that 2016 was going to be interesting, and I certainly would anticipate that over the course of this year and the President's remaining 12 months or so in office, the President is going to use every element of his authority that he can within the confines of the law to make the country safer, to advance the interests of the middle class, and to advance the interests of the United States around the world.\nAnd we made a lot of progress in that regard in 2015, where there are a number of long-term projects that we've been engaged in that came to fruition in 2015. That included everything from negotiating an agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon -- while we were gone for the holidays, Iran shipped I believe it was 25,000 pounds of low-enriched uranium out of Iran. That actually means that for the first time in a decade, Iran doesn't actually have the material to build a nuclear weapon. That's a remarkable accomplishment. And it was all achieved without a single shot being fired. This was achieved through tough-minded, principled diplomacy that brought the international community together to advance the interests of the United States.\nAnd that's an example of the kind of work that the President is going to be focused on in 2016. We've got a lot of work to do to continue to implement that agreement with Iran. And there are additional steps that Iran has to take, and they have to be certified by the IAEA, by the independent nuclear experts there. So that's certainly one example of the kind of long-term projects that have been in the works for quite some time that the President is determined to implement over the course of 2016.\nGo ahead, JC.\nQ: Quick question on the Dow, which has plunged almost 500 points as we speak. (Laughter.) Sorry to break that news to you, colleagues. It seems that the Middle East issue that we were talking about -- Saudi Arabia, Iran, et cetera -- poor manufacturing numbers in China has forced the Shanghai market to literally stop trading today. It has affected the U.S. and global economies. How closely is this administration monitoring the situation as we speak today?\nMR. EARNEST: JC., the Treasury Department has experts that are carefully monitoring the financial markets not just here in the United States but around the world. And we certainly make note of this kind of volatility that we've seen over the last 24 hours. In some ways, it makes it even more of a priority in the mind of the President for this administration and for Congress to work constructively to do some additional things that we know would strengthen and solidify the economy here in the United States, particularly when it comes to middle-class families.\nThat's why the President is going to continue to advocate for the ratification of the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- that we know this would be good for American companies and American workers because it will open up markets throughout the Asia Pacific for those high-quality American goods.\nWe know that there is more that can be done when it comes to investing in transportation infrastructure. We obviously were pleased that Congress did reach an agreement on a five-year highway bill at the end of last year. But, frankly, that was the bare minimum, if that. There are significantly more investments that can be made that we know would improve our infrastructure and create jobs, and lay a foundation for long-term economic strength in this country. And we believe those are worth pursuing.\nSo these are the hallmarks of the kind of economic agenda that the President is going to continue to press. And when we see this kind of economic volatility around the international community, it's a reminder of how strong the U.S. economy is right now, but it's also a reminder that there is more that we can do to strengthen that economy and to better position the United States and our economy over the long term, particularly when it comes to the interests of middle-class families.\nQ: Do you think this may forestall any future additional Fed rate hikes?\nMR. EARNEST: That will be up to the Fed to decide.\nThanks, everybody, we'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 2:07 P.M. EST", "timestamp": "2016-01-04", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}
{"author": "Ben Carson", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111676", "text": "Alexandria, Va. - January 04, 2016 - Today, Dr. Ben Carson, retired neurosurgeon and 2016 Republican presidential candidate, released his policy plan for reforming America's convoluted and systematically unfair tax code. The plan will throw out the current tax code in favor of a simple, transparent and fair flat tax on income. The plan is available for download here.\nEvery year the U.S. tax code gets more complex, costing taxpayers more than $230 billion and 6 billion hours just to be in compliance. This labyrinthine maze of regulations and loopholes only favors those with an army of accountants and tax lawyers at their disposal, leaving small businesses and middle class families at the mercy of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). At the same time, 45 percent of the households of this country pay no federal income tax at all. Dr. Carson's plan will create a tax system anyone can understand, replacing every loophole and tax shelter with one simple rate of 14.9 percent.\nUnder the Carson Flat Tax, all income, personal and corporate, will be taxed at this same rate — ensuring that no one can game the system. To help lower income families, taxpayers will only pay the flat tax for income earned above 150 percent of the Federal Poverty Level. For example, a family of four will pay a 14.9 percent tax on income above $36,375. Families that do not earn more than the allowance amount will be asked to make a de minimis payment, ensuring that every taxpayer becomes a citizen-owner of his government.\nDr. Carson's tax plan will also eliminate unfair double taxation such as the death and capital gains taxes. Americans' success and investment should be rewarded, not punished by a second round of taxation.\nRemoving these barriers to investment will also jump-start the economy. Over the first ten years of this plan, the real gross domestic product is likely to grow by more than 16 percent, with wages increasing 11 percent over the same time. By reducing corporate tax rates from 35 percent — currently the highest in the developed world — to just 14.9 percent, billions of dollars of profits that U.S. corporations currently keep overseas would be repatriated back to America for investment and development. This increased investment will help push our economic growth to nearly 4 percent, a 73 percent increase from the anemic 2.2 percent growth we have today.\n\"Liberty and fairness are bedrock principles of this great nation,\" said Dr. Carson. \"It's time that our tax system reflected those ideals. My plan for a simple, fair and transparent flat tax will not only eliminate the onerous burdens the IRS places on taxpayers, but it will grow the economy. Everyone will be on the same footing, from the largest corporation to the local family business. No one will be able to hide from their tax burden, but neither will anyone be ruined by an incomprehensible tax code. A Carson administration will push Congress from Day One to implement this plan to revitalize our economy through fundamental, common-sense tax reform. We will take the power away from the IRS and put it back in the hands of 'We The People.'\"", "timestamp": "2016-01-04", "title": "Press Release - Dr. Ben Carson Releases Pro-Growth Economic Plan; Calls for 14.9% Flat Tax"}

{"author": "Jeb Bush", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=112376", "text": "Our country is in the midst of a massive heroin epidemic, compounded by sharp increases in the abuse of prescription painkillers. Currently, this \"opioid\" abuse crisis is affecting some regions of the country more than others, but the problem is spreading, particularly in less populated areas of the country. Heroin use has doubled in just the last 10 years, and deaths related to heroin have nearly quadrupled to 8,257 last year. In 2014, more Americans died from drug overdoses than during any other year on record.\nHuge increases in the availability of cheap, highly potent heroin, with Mexican drug cartels involved in the production, trafficking, and distribution of heroin and other illicit drugs is contributing significantly to this problem. The Mexican cartels have dramatically increased their production of heroin. Most heroin available in the United States is smuggled across the border by the Mexican cartels. A cousin of Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, the fugitive head of the Sinaloa cartel, was recently convicted in New Hampshire on federal drug trafficking charges. While the conviction was related to cocaine, it illustrates the reach of the Mexican cartels, which have distribution networks throughout the United States.\nBeyond the Mexican cartels, abuse of prescription painkillers, such as hydrocodone and oxycodone, is a contributing cause of the epidemic of heroin and fentanyl abuse, and a major concern in its own right. A staggering four in 10 Americans know someone who has been addicted to prescription painkillers. In 2012, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) found that more than two million Americans were abusing prescription opioid painkillers. Deaths in the United States due to prescription opioid painkillers have more than tripled over the last 15 years. Half of the young people addicted to heroin started with a prescription painkiller. Four out of five heroin users previously used a prescription painkiller for non-medical reasons. The epidemic affects both genders, persons of all races, all ages and all income levels.\nWhile the heroin/prescription pain killer crisis is nationwide, New Hampshire is one of its epicenters. There were more than 300 drug overdose deaths in New Hampshire in 2014, with 99 of those deaths related to heroin (compared to 12 murders in the state). In one New Hampshire city, first responders treated individuals ranging from age 16 to age 69. The anguish and suffering for New Hampshire families is at an all-time high.\nBackground: Failing current efforts\nIn 2010, the Obama Administration articulated a strategy from the Office of the National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) with seven goals for reducing illicit drug use. In a progress report this year, ONDCP noted that the federal government spends more than $26.3 billion on drug control programs annually. The Government Accountability Office (GAO), an independent government watchdog tracking progress towards these goals, recently testified before Congress that the Obama Administration had made progress toward just one of these goals over the last five years, while \"none of the goals in the Strategy have been fully achieved.\" Meanwhile, prescription drug abuse and heroin-related deaths have skyrocketed. The Obama \"strategy\" has been a failure.\nOf its total drug control program spending, the federal government invests nearly $12 billion a year on drug abuse prevention and treatment, but these efforts are divided among more than 76 programs in 15 different federal agencies. According to one study, at least 40 percent of these programs are not coordinating with other federal programs, leading to duplication and inefficiency in the fight against illicit drug abuse.\nOf the $12 billion spent on prevention and treatment, Medicare/Medicaid and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) invest the most. SAMHSA spends $2.2 billion out of its $3.4 billion total budget on substance abuse prevention and treatment. And despite all of this spending, 24 million Americans now use illicit drugs, an increase from 6.7 percent in 1990 to 9.2 percent in 2012.\nCongress has focused on increased funding for current efforts to fight the epidemic. The omnibus spending bill recently passed by Congress includes more than $100 million in additional funding to fight the opioid epidemic. These funds will strengthen drug control efforts through the Drug Enforcement Agency, the CDC, substance abuse treatment programs and drug courts. While this funding is an important step, real change must include reforms to ensure we do not just add more money to reinforce the failure of the status quo.\nProposal: A comprehensive strategy\nSome government leaders label the drug epidemic just a criminal justice issue, and some try to make it just a health care issue. Both approaches oversimplify this complex challenge. The demand for abused and illicit drugs must be addressed in tandem with arresting the supply of these drugs. Governor Jeb Bush believes we need a strategy that:\n1. Prevents drug abuse and addiction before it begins;\n2. Strengthens criminal justice;\n3. Secures the border to stop the flow of illicit drugs; and\n4. Improves drug abuse treatment and recovery programs.\nHeroin and opiate-based pain pills are interrelated, and it is imperative to reduce both the demand and supply if treatment and recovery programs are going to work. Presidential leadership is essential if the country is going to dramatically reduce drug abuse. As Governor, Jeb Bush used a combination of strategies to help reduce heroin use in Florida by approximately 50 percent among youth. As President, Jeb Bush will re-elevate the Director of the Office of the National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) to a cabinet-level job and empower the ONDCP Director to coordinate the multi-disciplinary components of a national drug control strategy. The Director will evaluate and streamline current efforts, coordinate activities across the federal government, collaborate with the states and measure progress toward clearly defined goals.\n1. Prevent drug abuse and addiction\n* Invest as children grow and develop: Drug abuse and addiction prevention efforts must start in early childhood and be reinforced throughout middle and high school. That starts with dedicated parents and strong communities. It should be emphasized through locally-driven education system strategies (and many states are already taking the lead to promote drug education in schools). And current federal efforts must be better coordinated, improved with evidence-based models, coordinated with states and — most importantly — closely monitored for results. Strategies should include public and social media approaches with positive role models highlighting the dangers of drug abuse and addiction.\n* Engage local community and private sector leadership: Federal and state governments must play a critical role in preventing and fighting prescription drug abuse, including the use of public education campaigns. However, the government cannot solve it all; the private sector must also be committed to joining this fight to achieve success. Coalitions organized by local communities should involve health, local law enforcement and social services professionals to play key roles in developing solutions targeted to unique threats that differ across urban and rural areas. In addition, critical private sector efforts include better training of health care practitioners, including physicians, nurses and dentists, and a review of current clinical guidelines for opioid prescribing. Americans make up approximately five percent of the world's population, but consume about 80 percent of the world's opioid supply. Organized medical associations, such as the American Medical Association, must engage so clinicians are properly trained to manage pain without overprescribing.\n* Encourage Abuse Deterrent Formulations (ADF opioids) of prescription painkillers: Innovative pharmaceutical companies have invested in and developed opioid-based medications that reduce the risk of addiction and deter abuse (though may not fully prevent it). For example, an ADF may limit the drug's release if the pill is inappropriately cut, chewed or ground. As President, Jeb Bush will continue to encourage these innovations through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process. In addition, his FDA will reduce generic opioids on the market that lack the abuse deterrence technology when an innovative company develops a formulation of the same drug with ADF. While ADF opioids are not a silver bullet, they can play an important role in a comprehensive strategy.\n2. Strengthen criminal justice\n* Support law enforcement efforts: More than $14.8 billion in federal resources support federal, state and local law enforcement in the fight against drug trafficking and use. However, the percentage of federal drug control resources invested in supply reduction through law enforcement has dropped by six percent since 2007, while the supply of heroin from Mexico has substantially increased. Specific spending levels should be determined each year with law enforcement officials, but President Jeb Bush will ensure federal law enforcement agencies have the resources to target illicit drug pipelines and supply chains.\n* Coordinate the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) Investigative Support Centers: The HIDTA program is a federally-funded effort coordinating federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies conducting drug-trafficking investigations. GAO has reviewed current efforts and found that they are not well-coordinated, leading to duplication, overlap of responsibilities and lack of focus. For example, different HIDTA partners write the same intelligence reports and investigate the same links between criminal organizations. As President, Jeb Bush will require all federal agencies involved in HIDTAs (including the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security and ONDCP) to develop a process to coordinate efforts across agents in the field, monitor their progress towards drug control and evaluate results. This will reduce duplication of efforts across involved agencies and conserve staff and budgetary resources.\n* Identify and shut down \"pill mills\": Pain clinics are health care facilities focusing on the management of chronic pain through a suite of legitimate medical treatments (both prescription and over-the-counter). Unfortunately, some of these clinics (often referred to as \"pill mills\"), motivated solely by financial interests, are enablers of prescription drug abuse and addiction. In contrast to legitimate pain clinics, pill mills typically fail to maintain medical records, accept only cash payments and fail to screen for substance abuse issues. President Jeb Bush will support policies distinguishing pill mills from legitimate pain clinics and provide technical support to states in their role of exercising effective oversight of pain clinics. Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi's work serves as a model on this issue. Florida was an epicenter of pill mills in 2010, but today the number of registered pain management clinics in the state has been reduced by approximately 60 percent. Her successful strategies include stronger state regulation of pain management practices, better oversight of physician dispensing habits, and a statewide Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP).\n* Enact smarter federal sentencing laws: Drug dealing is harmful to society and should be punished, but current federal drug sentencing laws are antiquated and often counterproductive. Prison time served by drug offenders has increased and nearly 50 percent of federal inmates are serving drug-related sentences, but — at the same time — illegal drug use has also increased. There should be stiff consequences for drug lords, cartels and drug traffickers, while ensuring nonviolent drug offenders obtain the necessary treatment and more quickly return to their communities without serving excessive mandatory minimum sentences. This approach, whose champions include Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Dick Durbin (D-IL), will result in fairer drug abuse sentencing and will generate billions of dollars in savings (from reduced burden on federal prisons) to invest in drug prevention, treatment and recovery programs.\n* Strengthen and expand access to drug courts: Drug courts provide an alternative to the traditional justice system so that nonviolent drug offenders are screened for risk, and then given the option to obtain treatment and recover under close court monitoring and supervision for at least a year. This restorative solution model involves multi-disciplinary coordination, including participation from the judiciary, the prosecution, mental health specialists, social services and treatment professionals. According to the GAO, drug courts result in a 26 percent lower rate of recidivism. Florida led the nation in creating drug courts; and as Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush tripled the number of drug courts in the state. As President, Jeb Bush will ensure this critical program is adequately funded to broaden access in every state.\n3. Secure the border to stop the flow of illicit drugs into the United States\n* Secure the border: In August, Governor Jeb Bush offered a border security plan with six concrete steps to strengthen border security. These will make a critical difference in interdicting the flow of illicit drugs into the United States, given that most heroin enters the United States from Mexico. The plan includes a forward-leaning Border Patrol with the flexibility to deploy resources to meet threats, using new technologies to achieve continuous surveillance of the border, bolstering border infrastructure, withholding federal law enforcement funds for cities undermining federal immigration laws and making sure we detain and deport illegal immigrants who are serious criminals. The full plan can be found here.\n* Work with partner nations to address the source of illicit drugs: While the current ONDCP Strategy makes vague references to drug control efforts of major drug source and transit countries, there are few measurable action items to address it. Under President Jeb Bush, the United States will take an active role in training partner countries' law enforcement officials to interdict illicit drugs and press the issue in high-level diplomatic conversations. These efforts should be targeted at countries with high rates of poppy cultivation and heroin production, such as Mexico, Colombia and Afghanistan. For example, President Jeb Bush will assist the Mexican government in dismantling and destroying the major drug trafficking organizations based in Mexico.\n4. Strengthen drug abuse treatment and recovery\nBecause prescription painkiller abuse is closely related to heroin use, treatment and recovery efforts should address both epidemics.\n* Strengthen Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs): States run PDMPs to monitor and analyze electronic prescribing and dispensing data. They help identify inappropriate prescribing, abuse of controlled substances and patients who visit multiple doctors to abuse painkillers. However, these programs are not linked across states, and a drug abuser can drive across the border from Massachusetts to New Hampshire to obtain a new supply of prescription painkillers from a physician unaware of the patient's addiction. Under President Jeb Bush, these state databases will connect across state lines. Governor Jeb Bush has also promoted allowing electronic health care records to be shared among physicians and hospital systems (to make them \"interoperable\"): The full plan can be found here.\n* Promote innovation for a suite of treatment and recovery tools: Buprenorphene and methadone can help wean an individual from addiction to painkillers; naltrexone can block effectiveness of painkillers for abusers; and medical professionals and first responders need naloxone to save lives in emergencies by reversing the effects of severe overdoses. These are important tools in the fight against drug abuse and addiction, but more are needed. As President, Jeb Bush will promote innovation to fight against prescription drug abuse and heroin use. Governor Jeb Bush released his plan to promote innovation broadly through the FDA in October.\n* Increase accountability for existing federal prevention, treatment and recovery resources: SAMHSA, whose mission is to advance the behavioral health of the nation, currently invests over 60 percent of its budget on prevention and treatment. However, GAO has evaluated SAMHSA's stewardship of federal dollars, particularly on mental health programs, and found poor oversight of current programs and limited coordination of efforts across the federal government. President Jeb Bush will conduct a rigorous evaluation and overhaul of existing programs to ensure funding supports evidence-based programs for states and to consistently measure and monitor results. Funding should support proven models, including community-based programs with peer counseling and recovery communities that provide ongoing support to individuals and families. In addition, he will review and streamline current programs across the federal government to reduce duplication of efforts and maximize impact.\nConclusion\nDrug abuse and addiction hurts Americans from all walks of life. It is a complex problem that requires a multi-disciplinary, multi-faceted solution. Existing federal efforts must be better coordinated, streamlined and monitored for results. This will take real leadership that makes solving the problem a top priority. We know how to make a difference in this fight, and with the right leadership and solutions, we will.", "timestamp": "2016-01-04", "title": "Press Release - Drug Abuse: A National Epidemic"}

{"author": "Marco Rubio", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=113515", "text": "January 4, 2016\nAs prepared for delivery in Hooksett, New Hampshire:\nThank you all for being here.\nThough the media isn't covering it, today is actually the anniversary of a historic moment in global affairs.\nEight years ago today — January 4th 2008 — was the first day many people around the world heard the name Barack Obama. They awoke to the news that a little-known Senator from Illinois had won the Iowa caucuses the night before, and that a political frenzy was sweeping the United States. As that year went on, many around the world who resented America's influence found a lot to like about this man.\nThere have always been voices in our country who say America's not that different, that every country thinks they're special — voices who question our role abroad, who think of America as a bully rather than as a leader. But in 2008, for the first time ever, one of these voices was elected president.\nA man was elected who condemned America for having \"arrogance\" and the audacity to \"dictate our terms\" to other nations. A man who apologized for America and bowed pitifully to foreign leaders. A man willing to abandon our allies, make concessions to our enemies, and worst of all, to make historic, devastating cuts to our military and intelligence capabilities.\nFor a while, many thought all of this was the result of naivety. But it wasn't. It's now abundantly clear: Barack Obama has deliberately weakened America. He has made an intentional effort to humble us back to size. As if to say: We no longer need to be so powerful because our power has done more harm than good.\nFrom the beginning, elites around the world rejoiced at this. The Nobel Peace Prize was thrown at his feet. But happiest of all have been America's enemies. Because when America steps back, it gives darker forces the space they need to rise. And rise they have.\nLet's take a quick tour of Obama's world today.\nWhile Washington continues to weaken our military, China is undergoing the most rapid peacetime military expansion in the history of mankind. It is methodically taking over the South China Sea, one of the most valuable shipping lanes on earth. It has carried out massive cyber-attacks against the United States. It is testing missiles that can obliterate American satellites in space. It's developed a rocket that can destroy a U.S. aircraft carrier.\nMeanwhile, North Korea is in the grip of a lunatic. There's no other way to describe him. He expands his military while his country starves. He is growing his nuclear arsenal, and building missiles capable of reaching the west coast of the United States.\nTo the north, Russia is undergoing its largest military buildup since the Cold War. It is controlled by Vladimir Putin, a gangster determined to redraw the maps of Europe. He has invaded his neighbors. He is aiding Assad in Syria. Obama is standing idly by while Putin is hurtling toward a Second Cold War.\nIran, meanwhile, is governed by a radical Shia cleric who's about to receive tens of billions of dollars of sanctions relief from our president — tens of billions of dollars that will be used to sponsor anti-American, anti-Israeli terrorism and to develop long range missiles that can be used to launch nuclear weapons.\nAnd then of course there's ISIS, which is forcing its way across the borders of the Middle East, expanding beyond Syria and Iraq, now into Libya, Egypt, Afghanistan and even nuclear-capable Pakistan. It's threatening to advance into Saudi Arabia and Jordan, and has launched attacks into the Sinai, Beirut and as we saw in Paris, into the heart of Europe. It is now recruiting attackers and inspiring mass violence in the United States.\nThis is just a sampling of the threats Barack Obama will leave to our next president.\nAmerica is in far greater danger today than it was eight years ago. Our president thought he could make America like Luxembourg or Switzerland. But he can't. We are the United States of America — the highest-profile, most important, most powerful country in the world. And while we may ignore problems that exist far away, those problems do not ignore us.\nIn the 21st century, there is no such thing as a remote problem. What happens in Beijing or Moscow or Tehran is our business. Our economy and our lives are directly impacted by global events. Foreign policy is now an important part of domestic policy. Yet President Obama willfully ignores this. Instead of shaping world events, he is shaped by them. Instead of a foreign policy based on strategy, his is based on politics.\nWe saw this clearly with his despicable speech after the terrorist attack in San Bernardino. When America needed a bold plan of action from our Commander-in-Chief, we instead got a lecture on love, tolerance, and gun control designed to please the talking heads at MSNBC.\nThe result of all of this is that people are afraid. And they have every right to be. To make matters worse, candidates for president in both parties cling to the same plan of weakness and retreat.\nOn one side of this race we have, of all people, Obama's former Secretary of State. The very person who stood by while the conflict in Syria became the worst humanitarian crisis in a generation, who pushed the \"reset\" button with Russia even as Putin assaulted the sovereignty of his neighbors, and who resorted to half-measures in Libya instead of doing what it would take to prevent terrorists from taking hold — terrorists who ultimately took the lives of four Americans in Benghazi.\nNot only is Hillary Clinton incompetent, she's also a liar. While she was leading the public and the families of the fallen to believe the attack in Benghazi happened because of a YouTube video, we now know she was admitting in private emails that it was the result of terrorism. She lied to our faces. No one in the mainstream media has the courage to call her out for it. If I am our nominee, voters will be reminded of it time and time again.\nOn the other side of this election is the party of Reagan, the party of strong national defense and moral clarity, yet we have Republican candidates who propose that rulers like Assad and Putin should be partners of the United States, and who have voted with Barack Obama and Harry Reid rather than with our men and women in uniform. We have isolationist candidates who are apparently more passionate about weakening our military and intelligence capabilities than about destroying our enemies. They talk tough, yet they would strip us of the ability to keep our people safe.\nWords and political stunts cannot ensure our security. ISIS cannot be filibustered.  While some claim they would destroy ISIS, that they would make the sands of the Middle East \"glow in the dark,\" my question is: with what? Because they certainly can't do it with the oldest and smallest Air Force in the history of this country, or with the smallest Army we've had since World War II, or with the smallest and oldest Navy we've had since 1915. Yet these are what we will have thanks to the cuts these candidates have supported and even tried to deepen.\nWe need a Commander-in-Chief with a record of leadership and judgment. Of all the candidates running in either party, only I have that record.\nIn early 2011, when the people of Libya were rebelling against Muammar Gaddafi, and it was extremely unpopular to say we should get involved militarily, I was one of the few voices to argue that if America did not get involved decisively and responsibly, a vacuum would open that radical jihadists would rush to fill. And that's exactly what's happened in Libya.\nIt's also happened in Syria, where I argued from the beginning that we needed to do more than what our president was proposing. Now the results of his approach are plain to see.\nAnd while ISIS was rising, and many in Washington were hesitating, hoping the problem would magically disappear, I went down to the Senate floor and said, quote, \"If we do not confront and defeat ISIL now, we will have to do so later, and it will take a lot longer, it will be much costlier and even more painful.\" That has also proven true.\nI am also the only candidate to have laid out a detailed strategy to roll back our president's failures — a strategy to rebuild our military, revitalize our alliances, defeat ISIS, and restore American leadership to a world badly in need of it.\nI've offered numerous detailed plans on every major challenge we face, because this is a race for the presidency of the United States. The job is not described in the Constitution as \"entertainer in chief\" or \"commentator in chief\" or even, frankly, \"economist in chief.\" It is described as Commander in Chief. If you can't be bothered to offer specifics on how you will perform that job, then you don't deserve that job.\nWhen you vote for me, you know exactly what you'll get. You'll get a president who will destroy terrorists overseas by authorizing whatever tools our commanders need. You'll get a reversal of the defense cuts that Obama and Harry Reid have forced on our military. You'll get a leader who upholds the promise we make to our men and women in uniform that we will never send them into a fair fight, but will always equip them with the upper hand. Anyone who supports Obama's disastrous defense cuts cannot make that promise.\nAnd I will realize that American personnel are in harm's way every day — that no matter where we place them, they must be adequately protected, so what happened in Benghazi will never happen again, so what happened in Chattanooga will never happen again, so a young American somewhere in Afghanistan, or tonight in Iraq, or serving in an embassy somewhere in the world, will not be vulnerable to attack.\nAnd by the way, it's not just American personnel serving abroad who are in danger. It's also our people here at home. And that's why it's more important today than ever to protect our people's right to protect themselves. President Obama's executive actions limiting gun rights will restrict our law-abiding citizens, not the criminals or terrorists who target them. In fact, the president has not even attempted to point to a single mass shooting these actions would have prevented, because there isn't one.\nThis president needs to stop focusing on what he's constitutionally forbidden to do, which is interfering with our Second Amendment rights, and he needs to start focusing on what he's constitutionally required to do, which is protecting our people as Commander in Chief.\nThere is another duty that comes along with being Commander In Chief that this president has forsaken. He has broken the promise we make to our veterans: that when they return home, we're going to care for them as they cared for us. When I am president, we will have a VA system that works for our veterans rather than our bureaucrats. Every candidate supports our veterans, but I am the only one who has brought accountability to the VA. Last year I passed a law saying if managers at the VA are not doing their jobs, they can be fired.\nHere's something else I will do: I will not only restore the intelligence programs Obama and Congress have destroyed, I will strengthen them. Because ISIS does not use carrier pigeons to communicate. They use sophisticated encryption and carefully secured networks. It was already difficult to infiltrate them, now it is even harder. If ISIS had lobbyists in Washington, they would have spent millions to support the anti-Intelligence law that was just passed with the help of some Republicans now running for president.\nWhen I am president, we are not going to violate the civil liberties of Americans, but we are going to capture as many terrorists as possible. And when we catch foreign terrorists abroad, we're not going to take them to court or read them their Miranda rights. Unlike some candidates, I don't think foreign terrorists captured abroad should get any rights under our Constitution or in our courts.  America cannot fight terrorism from a courtroom. We cannot prosecute ISIS out of existence.\nWhen I am president, foreign terrorists caught overseas will receive a one-way ticket to Guantanamo where we will interrogate them and gather as much information as we can to prevent future plots.  And if you're an American who has committed the ultimate act of betrayal against our country, I will have no qualms about treating you like the enemy combatant you are if you have actionable information and refuse to cooperate.\nOur next president needs to be someone prepared on day one to execute his duty — someone with the judgment and the vision to lead this country back. I will be that president.\nI will be a president who doesn't just believe America is the greatest country in the world; I will be a president who acts like it. I will take the global stage and say, \"I know what the last eight years have been like, but America is back. We once again have a president who understands our role in the world.\"\nThat role is not to do everything or solve every problem. But that role is to do absolutely everything required to keep this country safe, and it is to lead and be an example to an afflicted world. We are the only nation capable of bringing others together to confront global challenges, and when I am president, we will do so.\nEight years ago today, our nation and our world took a turn for the worse. But we are not a weak country, we just have a weak president. And starting in a few weeks, we can take a turn back toward strength, toward greatness, toward opportunity and prosperity for all.\nNew Hampshire plays an enormous role in that, so today I'm asking for your vote.\nThe time to act is now. We cannot afford to elect Hillary Clinton, because America cannot afford another four years like the last eight. And we cannot settle for just any Republican, because this election is not a choice between two parties, it is a generational choice on our identity as a nation and as a people.\nI am running for president because while America doesn't owe me anything, I have a debt to America I will never fully repay. America changed the very history of my family.\nAll of us have benefited from the extraordinary story of America — from its greatness around the world and its opportunities here at home, from the safety our veterans and troops have provided, and from America's tradition of strength that has existed across generations.\nWith all my heart, I want my kids and yours to grow up and inherit an America equally as safe, equally as strong, equally as great as the America that changed my parents' lives, as the America that changed the world. I believe we owe that to our children. For the greatest nation on earth is what we inherited. And that is what we must pass on, and that is what we will pass on, if I can earn your support and your vote.", "timestamp": "2016-01-04", "title": "Press Release - Marco Rubio's Address on National Security in the 21st Century"}

Education is a state and local issue and parents should have direct input and control of what's being taught to their children. The single most important thing in a child's education is parental involvement,\" Cruz said. \"If you or I disagree with what some bureaucrat in the federal Department of Education says, you can't change that, and that is not the way it should be.

It's not easy because much of the education establishment is against us. So, when I was deciding whom to support for President of the United States, I evaluated each candidate by his or her willingness to consistently fight for conservative, constitutional principles—by his or her eagerness to take on the political establishment in both parties as part of those fights—and by his or her record of reducing the role of the federal government in the everyday lives of American citizens. Only one candidate truly fit the bill, and that's Ted Cruz\" said Estrada. \"I endorse Ted Cruz for President because I know that he will do what he says he will do, despite strong political headwinds from DC insiders, and will work each day to make this country a better place for every American.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118117", "text": "Gun violence has taken a heartbreaking toll on too many communities across the country. Over the past decade in America, more than 100,000 people have been killed as a result of gun violence—and millions more have been the victim of assaults, robberies, and other crimes involving a gun. Many of these crimes were committed by people who never should have been able to purchase a gun in the first place. Over the same period, hundreds of thousands of other people in our communities committed suicide with a gun and nearly half a million people suffered other gun injuries. Hundreds of law enforcement officers have been shot to death protecting their communities. And too many children are killed or injured by firearms every year, often by accident. The vast majority of Americans—including the vast majority of gun owners—believe we must take sensible steps to address these horrible tragedies.\nThe President and Vice President are committed to using every tool at the Administration's disposal to reduce gun violence. Some of the gaps in our country's gun laws can only be fixed through legislation, which is why the President continues to call on Congress to pass the kind of commonsense gun safety reforms supported by a majority of the American people. And while Congress has repeatedly failed to take action and pass laws that would expand background checks and reduce gun violence, today, building on the significant steps that have already been taken over the past several years, the Administration is announcing a series of commonsense executive actions designed to:\n1. Keep guns out of the wrong hands through background checks.\n• The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is making clear that it doesn't matter where you conduct your business—from a store, at gun shows, or over the Internet: If you're in the business of selling firearms, you must get a license and conduct background checks.\n• ATF is finalizing a rule to require background checks for people trying to buy some of the most dangerous weapons and other items through a trust, corporation, or other legal entity.\n• Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch has sent a letter to States highlighting the importance of receiving complete criminal history records and criminal dispositions, information on persons disqualified because of a mental illness, and qualifying crimes of domestic violence.\n• The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is overhauling the background check system to make it more effective and efficient. The envisioned improvements include processing background checks 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and improving notification of local authorities when certain prohibited persons unlawfully attempt to buy a gun. The FBI will hire more than 230 additional examiners and other staff to help process these background checks.\n2. Make our communities safer from gun violence.\n• The Attorney General convened a call with U.S. Attorneys around the country to direct federal prosecutors to continue to focus on smart and effective enforcement of our gun laws.\n• The President's FY2017 budget will include funding for 200 new ATF agents and investigators to help enforce our gun laws.\n• ATF has established an Internet Investigation Center to track illegal online firearms trafficking and is dedicating $4 million and additional personnel to enhance the National Integrated Ballistics Information Network.\n• ATF is finalizing a rule to ensure that dealers who ship firearms notify law enforcement if their guns are lost or stolen in transit.\n• The Attorney General issued a memo encouraging every U.S. Attorney's Office to renew domestic violence outreach efforts.\n3. Increase mental health treatment and reporting to the background check system.\n• The Administration is proposing a new $500 million investment to increase access to mental health care.\n• The Social Security Administration has indicated that it will begin the rulemaking process to include information in the background check system about beneficiaries who are prohibited from possessing a firearm for mental health reasons.\n• The Department of Health and Human Services is finalizing a rule to remove unnecessary legal barriers preventing States from reporting relevant information about people prohibited from possessing a gun for specific mental health reasons.\n4. Shape the future of gun safety technology.\n• The President has directed the Departments of Defense, Justice, and Homeland Security to conduct or sponsor research into gun safety technology.\n• The President has also directed the departments to review the availability of smart gun technology on a regular basis, and to explore potential ways to further its use and development to more broadly improve gun safety.\nCongress should support the President's request for resources for 200 new ATF agents and investigators to help enforce our gun laws, as well as a new $500 million investment to address mental health issues.\nBecause we all must do our part to keep our communities safe, the Administration is also calling on States and local governments to do all they can to keep guns out of the wrong hands and reduce gun violence. It is also calling on private-sector leaders to follow the lead of other businesses that have taken voluntary steps to make it harder for dangerous individuals to get their hands on a gun. In the coming weeks, the Administration will engage with manufacturers, retailers, and other private-sector leaders to explore what more they can do.\nNew Actions by the Federal Government\nKeeping Guns Out of the Wrong Hands Through Background Checks\nThe most important thing we can do to prevent gun violence is to make sure those who would commit violent acts cannot get a firearm in the first place. The National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which was created by Congress to prevent guns from being sold to prohibited individuals, is a critical tool in achieving that goal. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the background check system has prevented more than 2 million guns from getting into the wrong hands. We know that making the system more efficient, and ensuring that it has all appropriate records about prohibited purchasers, will help enhance public safety. Today, the Administration is announcing the following executive actions to ensure that all gun dealers are licensed and run background checks, and to strengthen the background check system itself:\n• Clarify that it doesn't matter where you conduct your business—from a store, at gun shows, or over the Internet: If you're in the business of selling firearms, you must get a license and conduct background checks. Background checks have been shown to keep guns out of the wrong hands, but too many gun sales—particularly online and at gun shows—occur without basic background checks. Today, the Administration took action to ensure that anyone who is \"engaged in the business\" of selling firearms is licensed and conducts background checks on their customers. Consistent with court rulings on this issue, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has clarified the following principles:\no A person can be engaged in the business of dealing in firearms regardless of the location in which firearm transactions are conducted. For example, a person can be engaged in the business of dealing in firearms even if the person only conducts firearm transactions at gun shows or through the Internet. Those engaged in the business of dealing in firearms who utilize the Internet or other technologies must obtain a license, just as a dealer whose business is run out of a traditional brick-and-mortar store.\no Quantity and frequency of sales are relevant indicators. There is no specific threshold number of firearms purchased or sold that triggers the licensure requirement. But it is important to note that even a few transactions, when combined with other evidence, can be sufficient to establish that a person is \"engaged in the business.\" For example, courts have upheld convictions for dealing without a license when as few as two firearms were sold or when only one or two transactions took place, when other factors also were present.\no There are criminal penalties for failing to comply with these requirements. A person who willfully engages in the business of dealing in firearms without the required license is subject to criminal prosecution and can be sentenced up to five years in prison and fined up to $250,000. Dealers are also subject to penalties for failing to conduct background checks before completing a sale.\n• Require background checks for people trying to buy some of the most dangerous weapons and other items through a trust or corporation. The National Firearms Act imposes restrictions on sales of some of the most dangerous weapons, such as machine guns and sawed-off shotguns. But because of outdated regulations, individuals have been able to avoid the background check requirement by applying to acquire these firearms and other items through trusts, corporations, and other legal entities. In fact, the number of these applications has increased significantly over the years—from fewer than 900 applications in the year 2000 to more than 90,000 applications in 2014. ATF is finalizing a rule that makes clear that people will no longer be able to avoid background checks by buying NFA guns and other items through a trust or corporation.\n• Ensure States are providing records to the background check system, and work cooperatively with jurisdictions to improve reporting. Congress has prohibited specific categories of people from buying guns—from convicted felons to users of illegal drugs to individuals convicted of misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence. In the wake of the shootings at Virginia Tech in 2007, Congress also created incentives for States to make as many relevant records as possible accessible to NICS. Over the past three years, States have increased the number of records they make accessible by nearly 70 percent. To further encourage this reporting, the Attorney General has written a letter to States highlighting the importance of receiving complete criminal history records and criminal dispositions, information on persons disqualified for mental health reasons, and qualifying crimes of domestic violence. The Administration will begin a new dialogue with States to ensure the background check system is as robust as possible, which is a public safety imperative.\n• Make the background check system more efficient and effective.  In 2015, NICS received more than 22.2 million background check requests, an average of more than 63,000 per day. By law, a gun dealer can complete a sale to a customer if the background check comes back clean or has taken more than three days to complete. But features of the current system, which was built in the 1990s, are outdated. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) will take the following steps to ensure NICS operates more efficiently and effectively to keep guns out of the wrong hands:\no FBI will hire more than 230 additional NICS examiners and other staff members to assist with processing mandatory background checks. This new hiring will begin immediately and increase the existing workforce by 50 percent. This will reduce the strain on the NICS system and improve its ability to identify dangerous people who are prohibited from buying a gun before the transfer of a firearm is completed.\no FBI has partnered with the U.S. Digital Service (USDS) to modernize NICS. Although NICS has been routinely upgraded since its launch in 1998, the FBI is committed to making the system more efficient and effective, so that as many background checks as possible are fully processed within the three-day period before a dealer can legally sell a gun even if a background check is not complete. The improvements envisioned by FBI and USDS include processing background checks 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to improve overall response time and improving notification of local authorities when certain prohibited persons unlawfully attempt to purchase a firearm.\nMaking Our Communities Safer from Gun Violence\nIn order to improve public safety, we need to do more to ensure smart and effective enforcement of our gun laws and make sure that criminals and other prohibited persons cannot get their hands on lost or stolen weapons. The Administration is therefore taking the following actions:\n• Ensure smart and effective enforcement of our gun laws. In a call earlier today, the Attorney General discussed the importance of today's announcements and directed the Nation's 93 U.S. Attorneys across the country to continue to focus their resources—as they have for the past several years under the Department's Smart on Crime initiative—on the most impactful cases, including those targeting violent offenders, illegal firearms traffickers, and dangerous individuals who bypass the background check system to acquire weapons illegally. During the call, the Attorney General also emphasized ongoing initiatives to assist communities in combating violent crime, including ATF's efforts to target the \"worst of the worst\" gun crimes. These efforts will also complement the following actions announced today:\no The President's budget for FY2017 will include funding for 200 new ATF agents and investigators who can help enforce our gun laws, including the measures announced today. Strategic and impactful enforcement will help take violent criminals off the street, deter other unlawful activity, and prevent guns from getting into the wrong hands.\no ATF is dedicating $4 million and additional personnel to enhance the National Integrated Ballistics Information Network (NIBIN). The NIBIN database includes ballistic evidence that can be used by analysts and investigators to link violent crimes across jurisdictions and to track down shooters who prey on our communities. In February 2016, ATF is standing up the National NIBIN Correlation and Training Center—which will ultimately provide NIBIN matching services at one national location, rather than requiring local police departments to do that work themselves. The Center will provide consistent and capable correlation services, making connections between ballistic crime scene evidence and crime guns locally, regionally, and nationally. These enhancements will support ATF's crime gun intelligence and enforcement efforts, particularly in communities most affected by violent crime.\no ATF has established an Internet Investigations Center (IIC) staffed with federal agents, legal counsel, and investigators to track illegal online firearms trafficking and to provide actionable intelligence to agents in the field. The IIC has already identified a number of significant traffickers operating over the Internet. This work has led to prosecutions against individuals or groups using the \"dark net\" to traffic guns to criminals or attempting to buy firearms illegally online.\n• Ensure that dealers notify law enforcement about the theft or loss of their guns. Under current law, federal firearms dealers and other licensees must report when a gun from their inventory has been lost or stolen. The regulations are ambiguous, however, about who has this responsibility when a gun is lost or stolen in transit. Many lost and stolen guns end up being used in crimes. Over the past five years, an average of 1,333 guns recovered in criminal investigations each year were traced back to a licensee that claimed it never received the gun even though it was never reported lost or stolen either. Today, ATF issued a final rule clarifying that the licensee shipping a gun is responsible for notifying law enforcement upon discovery that it was lost or stolen in transit.\n• Issue a memo directing every U.S. Attorney's Office to renew domestic violence outreach efforts. In the event of an emergency, victims of domestic violence should call 911 or otherwise contact state or local law enforcement officials, who have a broader range of options for responding to these crimes. To provide an additional resource for state, local, and tribal law enforcement and community groups focused on domestic violence, the Attorney General is issuing a memo directing U.S. Attorney's Offices around the country to engage in renewed efforts to coordinate with these groups to help combat domestic violence and to prevent prohibited persons from obtaining firearms.\nIncrease Mental Health Treatment and Reporting to the Background Check System\nThe Administration is committed to improving care for Americans experiencing mental health issues. In the last seven years, our country has made extraordinary progress in expanding mental health coverage for millions of Americans. This includes the Affordable Care Act's end to insurance company discrimination based on pre-existing conditions, required coverage of mental health and substance use disorder services in the individual and small group markets, and an expansion of mental health and substance use disorder parity policies, all of which are estimated to help more than 60 million Americans. About 13.5 million more Americans have gained Medicaid coverage since October 2013, significantly improving access to mental health care. And thanks to more than $100 million in funding from the Affordable Care Act, community health centers have expanded behavioral health services for nearly 900,000 people nationwide over the past two years. We must continue to remove the stigma around mental illness and its treatment—and make sure that these individuals and their families know they are not alone. While individuals with mental illness are more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators, incidents of violence continue to highlight a crisis in America's mental health system. In addition to helping people get the treatment they need, we must make sure we keep guns out of the hands of those who are prohibited by law from having them. Today, the Administration is announcing the following steps to help achieve these goals:\n• Dedicate significant new resources to increase access to mental health care. Despite our recent significant gains, less than half of children and adults with diagnosable mental health problems receive the treatment they need. To address this, the Administration is proposing a new $500 million investment to help engage individuals with serious mental illness in care, improve access to care by increasing service capacity and the behavioral health workforce, and ensure that behavioral health care systems work for everyone. This effort would increase access to mental health services to protect the health of children and communities, prevent suicide, and promote mental health as a top priority.\n• Include information from the Social Security Administration in the background check system about beneficiaries who are prohibited from possessing a firearm. Current law prohibits individuals from buying a gun if, because of a mental health issue, they are either a danger to themselves or others or are unable to manage their own affairs. The Social Security Administration (SSA) has indicated that it will begin the rulemaking process to ensure that appropriate information in its records is reported to NICS. The reporting that SSA, in consultation with the Department of Justice, is expected to require will cover appropriate records of the approximately 75,000 people each year who have a documented mental health issue, receive disability benefits, and are unable to manage those benefits because of their mental impairment, or who have been found by a state or federal court to be legally incompetent. The rulemaking will also provide a mechanism for people to seek relief from the federal prohibition on possessing a firearm for reasons related to mental health.\n• Remove unnecessary legal barriers preventing States from reporting relevant information to the background check system. Although States generally report criminal history information to NICS, many continue to report little information about individuals who are prohibited by Federal law from possessing or receiving a gun for specific mental health reasons. Some State officials raised concerns about whether such reporting would be precluded by the Privacy Rule issued under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Today, the Department of Health and Human Services issued a final rule expressly permitting certain HIPAA covered entities to provide to the NICS limited demographic and other necessary information about these individuals.\nShaping the Future of Gun Safety Technology\nTens of thousands of people are injured or killed by firearms every year—in many cases by guns that were sold legally but then stolen, misused, or discharged accidentally. Developing and promoting technology that would help prevent these tragedies is an urgent priority. America has done this in many other areas—from making cars safer to improving the tablets and phones we use every day. We know that researchers and engineers are already exploring ideas for improving gun safety and the tracing of lost or stolen guns. Millions of dollars have already been invested to support research into concepts that range from fingerprint scanners to radio-frequency identification to microstamping technology.\nAs the single largest purchaser of firearms in the country, the Federal Government has a unique opportunity to advance this research and ensure that smart gun technology becomes a reality—and it is possible to do so in a way that makes the public safer and is consistent with the Second Amendment. Today, the President is taking action to further this work in the following way:\n• Issue a Presidential Memorandum directing the Department of Defense, Department of Justice, and Department of Homeland Security to take two important steps to promote smart gun technology.\no Increase research and development efforts.The Presidential Memorandum directs the departments to conduct or sponsor research into gun safety technology that would reduce the frequency of accidental discharge or unauthorized use of firearms, and improve the tracing of lost or stolen guns. Within 90 days, these agencies must prepare a report outlining a research-and-development strategy designed to expedite the real-world deployment of such technology for use in practice.\no Promote the use and acquisition of new technology.

Before the new year, I mentioned that I had given the charge to my Attorney General, FBI Director, Deputy Director at the ATF, and personnel in my White House to work together to see what more we could do to prevent the scourge of gun violence in this country.\nI think everybody here is all too familiar with the statistics. We have tens of thousands of people every single year who are killed by guns. We have suicides that are committed by firearms at a rate that far exceeds other countries. We have a frequency of mass shootings that far exceeds other countries in frequency.\nAnd although it is my strong belief that for us to get our complete arm around the problem Congress needs to act, what I asked my team to do is to see what more we could do to strengthen our enforcement and prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands, to make sure that criminals, people who are mentally unstable, those who could pose a danger to themselves or others are less likely to get a gun.\nAnd I've just received back a report from Attorney General Lynch, Director Comey, as well as Deputy Director Brandon about some of the ideas and initiatives that they think can make a difference. And the good news is, is that these are not only recommendations that are well within my legal authority and the executive branch, but they're also ones that the overwhelming majority of the American people, including gun owners, support and believe in.\nSo over the next several days, we'll be rolling out these initiatives. We'll be making sure that people have a very clear understanding of what can make a difference and what we can do. And although we have to be very clear that this is not going to solve every violent crime in this country, it's not going to prevent every mass shooting, it's not going to keep every gun out of the hands of a criminal, it will potentially save lives in this country and spare families the pain and the extraordinary loss that they've suffered as a consequence of a firearm being in the hands of the wrong people.\nI'm also confident that the recommendations that are being made by my team here are ones that are entirely consistent with the Second Amendment and people's lawful right to bear arms. And we've been very careful recognizing that, although we have a strong tradition of gun ownership in this country, that even those who possess firearms for hunting, for self-protection, and for other legitimate reasons want to make sure that the wrong people don't have them for the wrong reasons.\nSo I want to say how much I appreciate the outstanding work that the team has done. Many of them worked over the holidays to get this set of recommendations to me. And I'm looking forward to speaking to the American people over the next several days in more detail about them.

This critical effort in addressing gun violence has prevented more than two million prohibited firearms purchases from being completed. But tens of thousands of people are still injured or killed by firearms every year—in many cases by guns that were sold legally but then stolen, misused, or discharged accidentally. Developing and promoting technology that would help prevent these tragedies is an urgent priority.\nIn 2013, I directed the Department of Justice to review the availability and most effective use of new gun safety technologies, such as devices requiring a scan of the owner's fingerprint before a gun can fire. In its report, the Department made clear that technological advancements in this area could help reduce accidental deaths and the use of stolen guns in criminal activities.\nMillions of dollars have already been invested to support research into a broad range of concepts for improving gun safety. We must all do our part to continue to advance this research and encourage its practical application, and it is possible to do so in a way that makes the public safer and is consistent with the Second Amendment. The Federal Government has a unique opportunity to do so, as it is the single largest purchaser of firearms in the country. Therefore, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct the following:\nSection 1. Research and Development. The Department of Defense, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Homeland Security (departments) shall, to the extent practicable and permitted by law, conduct or sponsor research into gun safety technology that would reduce the frequency of accidental discharge or unauthorized use of firearms, and improve the tracing of lost or stolen guns. Not later than 90 days after the date of this memorandum, the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall prepare jointly a report outlining a research and development strategy designed to expedite the real-world deployment of such technology for use in practice.\nSec. 2. Department Consideration of New Technology. The departments shall, to the extent permitted by law, regularly (a) review the availability of the technology described in section 1, and (b) explore potential ways to further its use and development to more broadly improve gun safety. In connection with these efforts, the departments shall consult with other agencies that acquire firearms and take appropriate steps to consider whether including such technology in specifications for acquisition of firearms would be consistent with operational needs.\nSec. 3. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to a department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nSec. 4. Publication. The Attorney General is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-01-04", "title": "Memorandum on Promoting Smart Gun Technology"}
{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111382", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:25 P.M. EST\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. It's nice to see you all. I think you all made note of the President's remarks in the East Room today about the executive actions that his administration will be taking to make it harder for criminals and other people who shouldn't be able to get guns from getting their hands on them. I have, for your convenience, thought to put a little reminder of the President's actions today. But given the President's robust remarks, I will spare you a topper but certainly look forward to taking your questions about these steps or anything else that may be on your mind today.\nSo, Darlene, would you like to start?\nQ: Yes, thank you. The President talked about $500 million for expanding mental health treatment. Can you say what the source of that money is? And does it have to be in the budget that he is going to send to Congress next month?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I certainly would expect that many of the priorities that the President discussed today will be incorporated into the budget proposal that he'll present to Congress next month. Obviously, we have seen some interest from Republicans who claim that expanding access to mental health care coverage and better mental health care coverage for Americans would make our communities safer. I've described previously why I'm skeptical of those claims -- primarily because Republicans are prepared, for the 60th time, later this week to repeal the very law that actually did more to expand access to mental health care coverage than any other law that's been passed in decades. That is Obamacare. But we're willing to call their bluff.\nAnd so the President is certainly serious about doing even more than we've already done to expand access to mental health care for people all across the country because there certainly is the reasonable prospect that that would -- that expanding access to mental health care coverage would make our communities safer. And we look forward to Republicans working with us constructively to accomplish that goal.\nQ: You said you're skeptical of their claims. Is the President also skeptical of their claims for wanting more money and attention to be paid to mental health treatment?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think if Republicans were serious about expanding access to mental health care, then surely they would be able to support those elements of the Affordable Care Act that actually do exactly that. There are millions of Americans that now have access to mental health care coverage that they didn't previously have access to because of the Affordable Care Act. And Republicans are attempting, once again, this week, to vote to repeal that law. So it's hard to take seriously their claims that they're actually interested in ensuring that people have access to mental health care. But we're willing to call their bluff, test their proposition, and if they actually are willing to work seriously with the administration to invest $500 million in expanding access to mental health care, I'm happy to be proved wrong.\nQ: Can you talk a little bit about what preparatory work may have been done either here at the White House through the Counsel's Office or maybe over at the Justice Department to prepare for the anticipated legal challenges to what the President announced today?\nMR. EARNEST: A lot of the work on this issue was done at the Department of Justice, and that's why you heard the Attorney General talk about many of these measures on a conference call last night.\nThere certainly were White House officials who were involved. And I would like to take this opportunity to single out a couple of White House officials who don't get a lot of attention but were certainly instrumental in the successful implementation of these actions. That is Michael Bosworth, who serves as the Deputy Counsel here at the White House, and Natalie Quillian, who serves as a Senior Advisor to the White House Chief of Staff. They were both the points of contact here at the White House for the development and implementation of this policy. And a lot of the steps that the President was able to announce today is thanks to the good work of those officials here at the White House, working closely with the legal experts at the Department of Justice, who, as I mentioned yesterday, were focused on producing recommendations to the President that were well within his legal authority as the President of the United States, but also effective in trying to address some of the problems that exist in the current system.\nQ: So as the work was being done to sort of figure out what he could do, the administration was also preparing for legal challenges? I mean, was it sort of a two-track process?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I wouldn't describe it as a two-track process. I would describe it as a process whereby attorneys at the Department of Justice were looking for ideas that would address the problem that we have identified, which is that right now, it's too easy for people who shouldn't be able to get guns to acquire them. Too often, guns fall into the wrong hands. And we need to do more to keep that from happening. And keeping that from happening would make our communities safer. So that is the problem that the lawyers at the Department of Justice were focused on trying to address. But they wanted to be sure that any of the prescriptions that they put forward would be well within the President's legal authority as the President of the United States, as the head of the executive branch.\nQ: Finally, can you describe for us any other time when you've seen the President be as physically emotional as he was today? It sort of goes against everything we know about the \"no drama Obama\" persona, stereotype of the President. An issue, an occasion, something that has moved him as he was so physically moved today?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Darlene, the President has talked before about how the violence at Sandy Hook Elementary in December of 2012 was the saddest day of his presidency. That's saying something. He's served as President for almost seven years now. And the President was quite emotional in speaking in this room at this podium on that day, and I think the President explained it for himself that even now, more than three years later, the thought of those first-graders being massacred is terribly sad and really tragic, and one that is emotional for the President of the United States, who also happens to have two daughters.\nI think the emotional reaction that the President has, even three years later, I think is familiar to millions of Americans across the country who -- particularly parents, who envision their own kids in school. I think this is a very emotional issue and a terribly tragic situation, and one that I think does a lot to animate the President's determination to try to do something about it.\nAnd he has been profoundly disappointed that despite this tragedy, Congress has not felt the same obligation to try to do something about it. But I think the President's announcement of 23 executive actions about a month or so after that terrible incident I think was pretty clear evidence of the President's determination to try to keep guns out of the wrong hands. And I think even three years later, a new set of executive actions that the President announced today are a vivid illustration of the President's ongoing determination to try to keep guns out of the wrong hands.\nAyesha.\nQ: Hi. Thanks. More on the gun guidance. Is the change, as far as background checks and ensuring that dealers on the Internet, gun shows, other places, that they are adhering to background checks -- is that change contingent on having 200 new ATF agents and investigators to enforce it? Because it seems unlikely that Congress would approve funding for those measures. So is that contingent on getting the 200 new agents?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the point that you're making highlights one of the most vivid contradictions in the position that is advocated by Republicans. Many of the statements criticizing the President's executive actions that littered all of your inboxes today have noted the need for the federal government to more effectively enforce the law that's on the books. Well, if Republicans were actually serious about that notion, then why wouldn't they support hiring more officers to do exactly that? So, again, it's a little hard to take seriously Republican excuses for inaction when they're not willing to back up their suggested prescriptions that they believe would be more effective in trying to solve this problem.\nBut to answer your question more directly, no, it is not contingent on the ability of the federal government to hire additional ATF agents. This guidance has been issued and it certainly does clarify that anybody who is engaged in the business of selling firearms has to get a license and to make sure that their customers are getting a background check before their customers are able to purchase a weapon.\nAnd the ATF, using the resources they have now, will enforce the law accordingly. Those who are engaged in the business of selling firearms that do choose to go without a license and do not force their customers to undergo a background check will be subject to a substantial criminal penalty. This is a statute that carries with it a criminal penalty on the order of up to five years in prison and a fine of $250,000. So this is a serious law that the ATF is committed to seriously enforcing. And the President has suggested that we should devote greater resources to enforcing the law that's on the books.\nAgain, that is a position that Republicans themselves have advocated as recently as today. So we would certainly call on Republicans to back up their news releases with actual legislative action.\nQ: So when will enforcement actually begin? Attorney General Lynch yesterday said there will be an educational period. Is there a point sometime during this year when there will be a crackdown? Or when exactly does the enforcement start?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, certainly the guidance will begin to be implemented today. And that is one of the benefits of the President's proposal, that these are actions that can be -- that aren't subjected to a protracted rule-making process but rather changes that can go into effect and begin being implemented today.\nAs for how it is enforced down the line, you'd have to check with either the Attorney General's office or even somebody at the ATF who could give you some greater clarity about how exactly that will take place.\nMary.\nQ: Do you have any indication that any Republicans are willing to work with you on these funding issues, any cause for optimism, given, as you say, that the President's proposals are in line with what they have previously supported?\nMR. EARNEST: No. But again, we look forward to Republicans actually backing up the promises that are contained in their news releases with actual legislative action. I recognize that for this Congress that's a relatively novel concept, but it shouldn't be.\nQ: And given that many are predicting that there will be challenges in the courts, how optimistic are you that these actions will actually become a reality while the President is still in office?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I did note the reaction from the NRA spokesperson to this announcement that seems to downplay the significance of these executive actions. I'm not an attorney and wouldn't even play one on TV, but that certainly seems like it's going to hurt their legal case that these are actions that must be stopped and that this is a classic example of presidential overreach if the NRA is now claiming that it's no big deal. So I certainly have more confidence in our legal case based on that public reaction than I did before.\nQ: And the President has admitted that comprehensive reform does not seem likely while he is in office. It now seems he's exhausted all of his executive options here. What will we see from him in the rest of the year? Will he continue in the coming months to sort of rally more public support for this? What will we see going forward? What more can he do?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think you'll see a budget proposal that will come later this year that will reflect some of the priorities that the President has discussed today. As Ayesha mentioned, I think you'll see some steps that are taken by law enforcement to enforce the law consistent with the guidance that has now been put forward. We're hopeful that we'll have additional law enforcement resources that we can devote to that task. And, yes, I would anticipate that you're going to continue to see the President speak out publicly, with passion, on this issue. And I think that could come as soon as the President's nationally televised town hall meeting that he'll be doing with CNN on Thursday night. And I certainly wouldn't be surprised if it makes an appearance during the President's State of the Union address that will be covered by all of your networks next Tuesday.\nJordan.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Were legal concerns one of the reasons that the background check measure was issued as a guidance rather than a rule? And are there concerns that a Republican White House would quickly reverse something like that, even more quickly than if you had issued it as a new rule or regulation?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not aware of any specific legal concerns. As I mentioned yesterday, any action that the President would announce would be something in which he and his attorneys have full confidence is well within his authority as President of the United States to exercise.\nOne of the benefits of the kind of guidance that the President issued today is that it can go into effect immediately and it can begin being implemented immediately. The rule-making process typically is more protracted and takes longer, and this is something that can be done more quickly.\nAnd each time the President has taken action, we've observed that it is not as enduring and oftentimes not as broad as what Congress can do through the legislative process. The reason the President is taking these actions today is because Congress hasn't done anything. And the President has had to resort to using every element of his authority to do as much as he possibly can to keep guns out of the wrong hands.\nIf you're asking me, well, gee, wouldn't it be better if Congress acted, I would heartily agree with you. Yes, it would be a lot better if Congress would act. It would be more enduring and it would have an even greater impact. But in the face of what even Speaker Ryan described as legislative failure, the President is determined to do as much as he possibly can to make our community safer by making it harder for those who shouldn't be able to get guns from purchasing them.\nQ: And on a separate topic, is the President aware of the reports that a U.S. servicemember was killed in Afghanistan? And is there any reaction from the White House on that report?\nMR. EARNEST: Jordan, I can tell you that the President has been briefed about the ongoing incident in Afghanistan. The Department of Defense has confirmed that one U.S. servicemember has been killed and at least two others have been injured. So I'd refer you to their specific statement.\nObviously, this does underscore that Afghanistan is a dangerous place and that our men and women in uniform who continue to serve our country there are putting themselves at risk for our own national security. We're deeply indebted to them for their service and their sacrifice, and certainly our thoughts and prayers are with the family of this individual who was killed today.\nFor more details or updates on the situation, though, I'd refer you to the Department of Defense.\nJim.\nQ: Josh, why do you think Republicans believe the President is so hostile towards the Second Amendment?\nMR. EARNEST: I think because -- I guess you'd have to ask them.\nQ: If you could hazard a guess --\nMR. EARNEST: If I would hazard a guess, it would be that it is purely politics.\nQ: And why did the President elect to go with these executive actions? He could have come out at the State of the Union and called for a legislative package, tried one more time to bring Republicans on board. Why not that route?\nMR. EARNEST: Primarily, Jim, because we have seen, again, what Speaker Ryan described as legislative failure in this policy area. Time and time again, Congress has failed to act, even in the face of unspeakable, tragic violence like what we saw in Newtown, Connecticut, but also in subsequent mass shootings.\nWhat we also see are the types of acts of gun violence that are similarly tragic but now so common that they barely rate as news. And even those overwhelming numbers -- 30,000 gun deaths in America every year; over the last decade, more than 20,000 children under the age of 18 have been killed by firearms; hundreds of law enforcement officials have been shot and killed over the last 10 years -- if none of that is going to convince Congress to take steps, common-sense steps that would prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands, I'm not sure one more speech from even this persuasive President of the United States was going to compel the kind of action that the President clearly believes is needed.\nThe only way I think at this point that we're going to see congressional action is when those who share the President's concerns about gun safety and the need to prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands make clear that they're as passionate about this issue as those on the other side are.\nThe good news is that those on the President's side of gun safety far outnumber those on the other side of the debate. But what we need to see on this side of the argument is more passion. And I think the President's passion was on display in the East Room today -- not for the first time, but certainly the most recent. And moving forward, I think the President is hopeful that he can inspire that kind of passion among those who agree with him.\nAnd, again, there's a clear majority of gun owners and even Republicans who agree that some of these common-sense steps, like closing the gun show loophole, are the right thing for the country and would make our country safer, and could be successfully implemented without undermining the law-abiding -- the constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans.\nQ: And you're not maintaining that the President's actions today effectively closed the gun show loophole? You're not saying that he has administratively done what was attempted back in the previous Congress, the Manchin-Toomey amendment? Because the guidance -- it seems to rely on a lot of self-compliance and it seems to rely on enforcement. It's not really saying everybody has to have a background check. It's not the same thing it seems. Is that the right read on this?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as you've heard me say in a variety of contexts, executive action is not a substitute for legislative action. And the President taking this executive action today does not in any way absolve Congress of the serious responsibility that they have to take steps and pass legislation that would make it harder for criminals, domestic abusers, and even would-be terrorists from getting their hands on guns. Senator John McCain has sponsored legislation to close the gun show loophole precisely because he said that he knew that criminals and would-be terrorists were using that loophole to arm themselves. So this is not a controversial notion, and this is not an excuse --\nQ: So you're not saying that you've effectively closed the gun show loophole?\nMR. EARNEST: I continue to believe and the President continues to believe that Congress must act. A congressional action, a piece of legislation would be more effective in part because, as you point out, it couldn't just be reversed by the next President. And so, yes, the President is as determined as ever to see Congress pass legislation. But, again, the President is also quite realistic about how unlikely that is to occur in this Congress. But I certainly would expect that over the course of the next 10 months that you'll hear the President make a forceful case for people who agree with him about the need to keep guns out of the wrong hands that they should make their voices heard and their opinions on this issue known at the ballot box in November, and not just when they're voting for President, but also when they're voting for their representatives in Congress.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, are there any directives or executive orders or memoranda coming out along the lines of this gun policy?\nMR. EARNEST: There are no executive orders, but certainly the details on what has been announced today is included in the factsheet that I believe you received last night.\nQ: Does he put it in writing as a memoranda to a Secretary of DHS or HHS?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not sure what sort of administrative paperwork is required to implement the policy that the President discussed today, but we can certainly consult with Counsel's Office here and get back to you with an answer on that.\nQ: And, Josh, does President Obama regret not having taken these actions years ago?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think, Mark, I think the President certainly regrets that Congress didn't take the kinds of steps that the American public clearly supports. And certainly in the aftermath of Newtown, there was even in the -- look, what happened in Newtown was terribly tragic. And the one silver lining that I think the President and others hoped would come after that terrible event was that it would sufficiently tug at the conscience of members of Congress to take action that would prevent those kinds of incidents from happening again; that it was so graphic and what happened was so grotesque and so tragic that Congress could no longer ignore their responsibility to act. But yet that's, unfortunately, exactly what they did.\nAnd since that time, the President and his team have been looking for ways that the President could take additional action. But we've never suggested that that would be a substitute for congressional action, and we're going to continue to call on Congress to take the steps that we believe are necessary.\nQ: And on one other story, there was a report last week in the Post saying that President Obama scolded aides on the flight back from Asia, feeling that the communications strategy wasn't working on U.S. policy against ISIL. Did that happen? Were you scolded? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: I will say, Mark, my wife asked me the same question when she read that story. (Laughter.)\nQ: Could I call her? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: You're welcome to do so, if you like. What I can tell you is this -- is I think the President has made quite clear, certainly not just in his words but also in his deeds over the last several weeks since the terrible incident in Paris and then again even in the aftermath of the terrorist incident in San Bernardino, to be much clearer and much more direct and even more conspicuous in making sure that all of you and the American public understand precisely the strategy that we are implementing to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\nAnd that is something that the President felt strongly about. And I think a lot of this is rooted in the criticism that has been directed at the President's strategy against ISIL has not been substantive; that we have not seen even the President's harshest critics advocating a strategy much different than the one that he's pursuing.\nThere are some isolated examples. There's the example of Lindsey Graham who, to his credit, had the courage of his convictions and actually suggested that 20,000, 30,000, 40,000, 50,000 American servicemembers should be deployed to Syria to safeguard the situation there. The President disagrees with that approach, but at least Senator Graham had the guts to put forward his own strategy.\nWe've seen others like Senator Cruz suggest that somehow the United States and our coalition partners should carpet-bomb Syria, or even potentially carry out a nuclear attack against ISIL. I don't think there's a lot of support for that strategy, but he did advocate something different than what the President is already doing.\nBut most of the criticism that you hear from the President's critics, when you ask them what is it that the administration should be doing, they typically recite the list of things that we've already been doing for quite some time. And that is what prompted the President to conclude that we needed to be more effective and do a better job of helping all of you and the American public understand precisely what our strategy is.\nJames.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. As yesterday, I'd like to focus on two subjects. First, guns, and then the Middle East. I'll try and do this all quickly. You and the President have cited a great number of statistics in the run-up to this moment, so I wanted to share some statistics with you and get your reaction to them. Syracuse University's Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, or TRAC, which uses the Freedom of Information Act to pry loose statistics from the Department of Justice and other federal agencies, records that federal criminal convictions on firearms charges have decreased almost 6 percent from last year; 15.5 percent since 2010; and 34.8 percent since 2005. How do you explain this stark plunge year after year getting bigger year after year under this President of enforcing the existing gun laws?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, James, enforcement decisions are decisions that are made by prosecutors at the Department of Justice. So I'm certainly not going to be in a position to second-guess those prosecutorial decisions, but I think there are a couple of things that we could do to help. The first is we could devote more ATF officers and investigators to prosecute -- to investigating these crimes so that prosecutors have more material to work with.\nQ: Do you have fewer such investigators now than President Bush had?\nMR. EARNEST: I'd have to check with the Department of Defense -- or the Department of Justice about that.\nQ: But you agree these are stark plunges?\nMR. EARNEST: They are, but they reflect decisions that are made by career prosecutors. What I'm suggesting is that there are some steps that we could take, consistent with what the President announced today, that could turn those numbers around, which include hiring more ATF officers or even clarifying what exactly the rule is for how people should be licensed and who should actually have to go through a background check. That's exactly what the guidance that has been issued by the administration today.\nQ: So to that point, you were asked earlier in this briefing if the issuance of some of these executive actions in the form of guidance, as opposed to rules, doesn't have the feature of making those particular actions less susceptible to court challenge, and you didn't really answer that question. So perhaps the way to put it to you in a way that can be answered summarily with a yes or a no is, as follows, did President Obama receive legal advice from anyone at the White House or the Department of Justice to the effect that the issuance of some of these actions as guidance rather than rules would have that feature of making them less susceptible to court challenge?\nMR. EARNEST: James, I'm not able to give you much insight into the legal advice that is given to the President of the United States, but I do think that there are legal experts who would observe that the kind of guidance that the President issued today is well within his legal authority as President of the United States to offer --\nQ: The question is not whether it's within his authority. The question is whether he's choosing to use one vehicle rather than the others so he can evade court challenge.\nMR. EARNEST: I think what I would describe as the chief benefit of the approach that the President has taken today is that it can be more quickly and effectively implemented.\nQ: Last on guns. After the shooting of Congresswoman Giffords five years ago, which the President has been noting in some of his remarks lately, there was a kind of a national discourse on the national discourse about guns, and whether it's appropriate to use words like \"targeting,\" \"killing,\" and so forth in the way we discuss not only the gun issue but all kinds of national issues. Today, in his remarks, President Obama accused his political opponents on this issue, which he likes to characterize as the gun lobby, of holding the Congress and the American people hostage. Isn't that precisely the kind of divisive and violence-tinged language that the President himself inveighed against after the Arizona shooting?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, James, the President is certainly not advocating violence. But I do think it is an apt metaphor for what exactly is happening right now. There are members of Congress who are quite concerned about the political influence that is wielded by the gun lobby, and that is the most powerful explanation about why they have refused to take action. If there is a more principled one, I'm open to hearing it. But given the toll that we know that gun violence has taken on communities all across the country, this is not just violence that has occurred in Democratic congressional districts across the country, that there are Democrats and Republicans all across the country who have been affected by gun violence. There were Democrats and Republicans standing on that stage with the President today and in the audience today who are concerned about this issue. And that is the point. The President wants to rally the American public to encourage Congress to respond.\nQ: Very quickly, on the Mideast. Yesterday, from the podium, you called on both Saudi Arabia and Iran to deescalate their conflict, and you mentioned calls placed and pending by Secretary of State Kerry. Is there any evidence that those calls have been heeded today?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, for positions or announcements that may be planned by the Iranians or Saudis, I'd refer you to them --\nQ: Have you noticed a de-escalation today is what I'm asking.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I haven't heard any new announcements from them that would appear to inflame or escalate the situation. But this is not something that, again, we're going to judge based on 24-hour increments, but rather over the long term, can this decades, centuries long sectarian conflict in this region of the world that is being fueled by the leaders of these two countries, that is having a terribly destabilizing influence on the entire region -- can they change that path? It's not in the interest of either of those -- the leaders of either of those countries or the citizens of either of those countries to continue to destabilize the region so violently, to continue to foment the kind of violence that often leads to radicalization and terrorism. It certainly is not the kind of path that is going to lead to greater economic prosperity for their citizens.\nSo that's why we believe that we've got a strong case to make when we can go individually to the Saudis, with whom we have a close and strong relationship, but even when we're making a case to the Iranians, with whom we do not even have official diplomatic relations, that it is within their interest to try to change the path that they're currently on. And we won't be able to judge within 24 hours whether or not that message will be received or adhered to, but we're certainly hopeful that they'll get the message or at least arrive at that conclusion.\nQ: Last thing on Iran. On December 7, my Fox News colleagues, Jennifer Griffin and Lucas Tomlinson broke an exclusive story reporting that back on November 21st, Iran had conducted a second illegal ballistic missile test. The United States government has yet to confirm that this second test occurred. Are you ready to do so now?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not. But if we have more information about those reports to share with you, we'll follow up.\nByron.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Two forward-looking questions for you; the first of which is, can you give us a general idea of what else is on the President's agenda for this upcoming year and whether there's anything in there that might perhaps have some political benefits -- rallying Democratic voters, or getting them excited for the upcoming 2016 election?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me take some liberties with your question in one way, which is to say that there is a high priority of the President's for this year that may not rally the Democratic base in the way that you described but certainly has shown some important political momentum just in the last couple of days. And that is the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement that was completed at the end of last year. It was endorsed yesterday by the National Association of Manufacturers. This is an organization that typically does not endorse priorities of the Obama administration, but I think is a clear example of how even Democrats and Republicans can agree that the Trans-Pacific Partnership would do good and important things for the U.S. economy.\nJust today, the Business Roundtable announced their endorsement for the Trans-Pacific Partnership. This comes on the heels of endorsements from the Farm Bureau and other business organizations that are not typically aligned with the Obama administration who announced their support for this proposal at the end of last year.\nSo that certainly is an administration priority. I think we are realistic that there is some deeply entrenched opposition in the Democratic Party to these kinds of measures, but there is bipartisan support for them in the Congress. And we're looking forward to that case and we are pleased to have the assistance of some influential Republicans in making the case.\nBut something that is more focused on what Democrats can support -- I mean, there are a range of things that -- well, let me go to the next sort of legislative priority, which would be criminal justice reform. There are a lot of Democrats across the country and in Congress that are enthusiastic about the prospect of reforming our criminal justice system in a way that will both make our communities safer but also make our criminal justice system more just. And I think that progress in passing legislation that would do that would be warmly received by Democrats across the country, I believe.\nThe President is certainly going to continue his advocacy on a range of economic issues that the President knows would benefit middle-class families in the United States and certainly those families that are trying to get into the middle class. We're going to move forward on implementing the Affordable Care Act.\nWe're certainly going to continue to encourage Congress and officials at the state and local levels across the country to raise the minimum wage. Right now the federal minimum wage, if somebody is trying to raise a family of four and working full-time, making the minimum wage, they're trying to raise that family below the poverty line. That certainly is not consistent with our view that in this country, if you're working hard, that you should get a fair shot at success. So the President wants to make those changes and would like to see some of those changes made.\nThere are some other things that we believe can be done to make our tax code more fair, to close loopholes that only benefit the wealthy and well-connected, and make sure that we're investing the proceeds from those reforms into the kinds of things that benefit everybody, like a more modern infrastructure.\nSo those are some of the things that I think you can anticipate the President will talk about quite a bit over the course of this year and maybe as soon as a week from today.\nQ: Related, the State of the Union is earlier this year. It's I think a week from today. Is there anything you can preview? We've seen some reports it might not be the traditional speech. Anything you can share with us?\nMR. EARNEST: Not at this point, but before the end of the week we'll get you some more guidance about what to expect in the speech.\nPeter.\nQ: Josh, as in physics, every time there's an action there's always an equal opposite reaction to that. So given the fact that the President makes his remarks, every time after he speaks there is a spike in gun purchases in this country. Why do you think that is? Why do you think so many people hear this President speak and immediately go to their local gun dealer and purchase a weapon?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know, Peter. You probably have to ask them. I think what we have seen is that there -- because we have seen this pattern so much, I think it is hard for the gun lobby to continue to make the case that putting more guns on the streets somehow makes us safer, but yet that is what they often do. I'm sure it's only a coincidence that their ability to make that case is entirely consistent with their profit motive.\nSo I guess you'd have to ask people who are making those purchases why they're doing it. The President did rather conspicuously point out today his -- not for the first time -- his firm belief to the constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans to bear arms, consistent with the Second Amendment of the Constitution. But again, you'd probably have to ask them.\nQ: And while we've been speaking -- you spoke about the NRA, the gun lobby, as the President refers to -- and today, the executive director of the NRA's Institute of Legislative Affairs, Chris Cox, while you've been speaking put out a statement and referred to the President's remarks in part as another emotional, condescending lecture. He said, \"Again, President Obama has chosen to engage in political rhetoric instead of offering meaningful solutions to our nation's pressing problems. Today's event,\" he adds, \"represents an ongoing attempt to distract attention away from his lack of a coherent strategy to keep the American people safe from terrorist attacks.\" How does the White House respond to that?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the President's remarks make quite clear his passion and his determination to put in place using his executive authority that will keep guns out of the wrong hands. The President believes that doing so will make our communities safer. People are certainly entitled to disagree, but most Americans don't. Most Americans, most gun owners, most Republicans agree with the President.\nQ: To conclude, 23 million -- I think more than 23 million background checks were conducted in the course of 2015. By some accounts, 40 percent of gun sales in this country are completed without any background check. Today the President called for -- it will be part of his budget -- 200 or so additional ATF agents will be the new enforcers to try to fill these gaps, as it were. Doesn't that sort of acknowledge the limits to the executive power, the limits to his ability to really effect any real change? Because we're talking about millions of sales in this country that will still go --\nMR. EARNEST: I would make sure, Peter, that you take a close look at all the proposals that we put forward. One of the things that would address the problem that you've highlighted are some modernization proposals that we have for the background checks system; that an investment in new administrators who can conduct a background check and investment in a new system that would reflect technological advances that have been made in the last couple of decades that would make the system more efficient, presumably would make the system work more quickly, those would certainly address the kinds of challenges that you've just raised.\nQ: Kind of going back to the question of how airtight this would be from legal challenges -- obviously when the President announced his executive actions on immigration he said he was confident that that would pass judicial review, and it was rejected so far in the appeals courts. So did his legal team or did the President himself really take lessons from that setback in the courts to advance a more limited approach here that they believe may pass judicial muster?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me take that in a couple different ways. The first is, I wouldn't describe this as a limited approach. I would describe this as an approach that reflects the extent of his authority under the current statute, and that is I think why we would describe these as pretty robust actions that would make it much harder for those who shouldn't be able to get guns from being able to purchase them. So that's the first thing.\nSecond is we've been very mindful of the fact that our political critics and, in some cases, opponents on this issue were prepared to go to great lengths to try to use the legal system to block the implementation of these actions, and I continue to be confident that they will try to do that. But I also continue to be confident in the legal power of the arguments that we'll be able to make about how these actions fall well within the President's authority. And, again, it does strike me that the public statements from the NRA thus far significantly undermine I think any sort of legal claim that they would have that this is some sort of gross infringement on the Constitution if they're out there on the record saying it's no big deal. I'm not sure they can have it both ways.\nQ: But when you were talking yesterday about the President, this kind of serious study to see what would be within his authority to do -- was his legal team kind of influenced at all by some of the rulings -- I mean, a recent appeals court ruling that said that he went too far on immigration -- was he concerned, or was his legal team concerned that result would happen with this executive action?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we continue to have a lot of legal confidence in the arguments that we'll make later this year before the Supreme Court about the President's authority to reform -- or about the kinds of reforms that we've proposed to the immigration system. But, look, this is not a legal strategy that started with the immigration issue. We saw repeated Republican challenges. There's even one that's ongoing now to the Affordable Care Act -- something that was signed into law by the President almost six years ago. Time after time, even going all the way to the Supreme Court, as you've covered quite closely, our arguments have held up. So we are mindful of the lengths that our opponents will go to, to try to prevent the President from using executive action in this way, even common-sense steps like the President is proposing today. And so we've been mindful of that at every stage of the process. And I think, frankly, that would be true even if we'd won the appeal at the level of the Fifth Circuit on immigration reform.\nQ: And then I guess when we talk about the statement from the NRA, I mean, do you expect lawsuits?\nMR. EARNEST: I will certainly not be surprised if there are legal challenges that emerge to this executive action, but I continue to be confident, as the entire administration is, that these actions fall well within the legal authority of the President of the United States.\nQ: And then, finally, when you're talking about -- this sounds like any opposition will be purely politics, I mean, in parts of the speech, I mean, the President is saying, you know, if you love your kids and your country then have the courage to vote, I mean, going so far as to say vote gun rights supporters out of office. How is that not political, just as you're saying the opponents are?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not denying that this is a political problem. The President has acknowledged this before. The failure of Congress to act even on measures that are strongly supported by the vast majority of Republicans and gun owners I think is an open and shut case when it comes to political dysfunction in Washington, D.C. That's the point that the President is making. And in order to see that change we're going to need to see more people be engaged in the political process to solve that political problem. And this is something the President has observed on previous occasions and he reiterated that observation again today.\nQ: But, I mean, it is injecting -- he is making this in some ways a political issue going into the campaign. Is that part of what the President is hoping to see as he starts this conversation on gun control -- that it is going to be an issue in the campaign and voters will vote gun control opponents out of office?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I'm not going to predict the outcome of the election, but I will feel confident about our political prospects if we can mobilize those Americans that agree with the President of the United States on this issue. We know there's a lot of passion out there on this issue on both sides. But we need to make sure that the passion on the side of people who agree with the President that we need to do more to keep guns out of the wrong hands -- those people need to be mobilized.\nWe know that they far outnumber the people on the other side of the issue. The polls indicate that -- whether you slice and dice the numbers by region or by political party, by age, or even by gun ownership -- that a majority of Americans agree that it is a common-sense step to make sure that everybody gets a background check, even if they're purchasing a gun at a gun show. That's something that even the previous Republican President who was reelected advocated.\nBut yet, in the face of all of that, in the face of terrible real-world consequences of congressional inaction, and in the face of public polls that indicate that the American public strongly believes that action is necessary, Congress hasn't done anything. And I think that is a clear illustration of political dysfunction on Capitol Hill. And that is a political problem that demands a political solution.\nAnd let's be honest about this. Opponents of gun safety measures have been very effective in using politics to blunt action in Congress. That's been a clear part of their strategy. Every time something like this happens, they try to -- I'm confident that this is ongoing right now, that right now there is somebody at the NRA or some other gun owners group that is sending an email and putting out the call that people should flood their members of Congress with telephone calls urging them to oppose the President's executive actions.\nWhat we need to see is we need to see people on the President's side of this issue responding in the same way and with the same passion, and responding the same way on Election Day, too, by making sure that they show up at the polls and making sure they vote for a member of Congress in either party that is willing to stand up for their position on this issue when they're actually representing their district or their state in the United States Congress. And that ultimately is what's going to be required to see the solution that the President would like to see.\nQ: So this is not just any -- kind of as you were suggesting yesterday, this is the President kind of doing what he can under his executive authority to effect changes, but it's also a call to action, a political call to action for voters to make changes in Congress or in the White House -- not change the White House, but for voters.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, that voters, if they feel strongly enough about this issue, that they should make their voices heard both now and on Election Day, and that at some point -- the President has made this observation before, that at some point, people who are in favor of gun safety measures -- at some point, they may have to just conclude that they're going to be single-issue voters; that they're going to set aside the other issues, that this one is going to take precedence over all the others. Obviously people will have to make up their own minds about that.\nThere are plenty of people on the other side of this debate who are single-issue voters, and maybe it's time for people on the side of gun safety and on the side of keeping guns out of the wrong hands to display a similar passion, both in communicating to their members of Congress their passion for the issue but also making clear that there are going to be consequences on Election Day.\nDavid.\nQ: I just wanted to ask a little something off-topic. John King started as acting Education Secretary today. We're hearing that he may end up remaining in sort of the acting role for the full year. Is that true? Does the administration give any thought to formally nominating him, or would you think that that would be too hard to get a nomination of that level through a Republican Congress at this point? And if so, if he's going to remain active, does that limit any of his effectiveness?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, David, I don't have any announcements to make about the Acting Secretary of Education at this point. I would observe, as surely you're familiar with, the record of this Congress in confirming presidential appointees is horrendous, to put it bluntly. Even people who serve in non-political positions, or have been appointed to serve in non-political positions, non-partisan positions, have been mindlessly blocked by Republicans in the United States Senate.\nAnd let me just go to my favorite example, because it is one that is utterly indefensible: Adam Szubin is a financial expert who has served Presidents in both parties. He has been appointed to a position that puts him in charge of wielding some of the most powerful weapons that the United States has to impose sanctions against Iran, either for their ballistic missile program or for human rights violations or for their involvement in terrorism. This office is also responsible for imposing financial costs on Russia for their actions inside of Ukraine. The office that Mr. Szubin has been appointed to run is also responsible for countering Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations that are seeking to carry out acts of violence against U.S. allies or U.S. interests around the world. No one has questioned Mr. Szubin's qualifications for the job. The suggestion is not that he's dishonest or that he's unqualified or that he is inappropriately political. In fact, there's no objection to him serving in that role other than he was appointed by Barack Obama.\nI'm not sure why somebody who has been appointed to the job of the Secretary of Education that I think is understandably and even legitimately a more political position would get a more fair hearing from a stridently partisan Republican majority in the United States Senate.\nQ: So just to be clear, I mean, the White House -- the President feels John King would be a capable full-time Education Secretary. That's not in question.\nMR. EARNEST: That is not at all in question. And I think -- look, you'd have to ask them. I suspect that there are even some Republicans -- I don't know if they'd do it on the record -- surely off the record -- I feel confident in telling you on the record that many Republicans in Congress off the record would confirm for you that Acting Secretary King is eminently qualified and would do an excellent job of leading that agency over the next year or so. But whether or not he will actually get a fair hearing in the United States Senate I think is definitely in doubt. But we'll have to see moving forward about whether or not we choose to appoint him to the job.\nQ: Final thing -- does that put any limitations on an Acting Secretary versus a full-time Secretary in that sense, I mean, in the ability to do his job, or to be effective, or to be listened to?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I certainly think when you're put in charge of an organization as large as the Department of Education that it is helpful and you can be more effective if it is quite clear that you've earned the approval of a bipartisan majority of the United States Senate.\nI think Mr. King is going to be particularly successful whether or not he's confirmed by the United States Senate. But his prospects would be strengthened if the process worked the way that it should, which is that his credentials were carefully considered and he were given an opportunity to answer questions, even hostile, unfair, skeptical questions from people who do not serve in the same party. I'm confident that he would be able to withstand that questioning and make a forceful case about why he would be effective serving in this role. But I'm skeptical that he'll get that opportunity. But we'll see.\nIsaac.\nQ: You were talking about voters being single-issue voters on guns. Is the President willing to be a single-issue voter on guns? Will he make decisions about who he campaigns for based on that?\nMR. EARNEST: That's an interesting question. I haven't talked to him about it. I think that you've seen the President be quite passionate about this issue and I think you have seen him acknowledge that we're going to need to see more conviction on the parts of voters and political activists who share the President's view on gun safety included in the political process if we want to see Congress take the kinds of steps that we'd like to see. But I don't want to make a formal declaration here without having spoken to the President about it, but maybe there will be an opportunity for you at some point to ask the President that question.\nQ: And can you foresee a situation where he would campaign for a Republican who's for gun control? Pat Toomey maybe, or Mark Kirk, both of whom are up for reelection?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as the President noted today, the President certainly gave Senator Toomey credit for what he had previously done on this issue. I think there are a lot of other things on which the President and Senator Toomey disagree, so it's hard to imagine a scenario where the President is willing to campaign for Senator Toomey, given the significant differences that they have on a whole bunch of other issues that the President also feels passionately about.\nBut I have -- again, I guess maybe this is the other way to answer your question, which is the other thing single-issue voters do is they give credit where it's due, and Senator Toomey, to his credit, did step forward three years ago to co-sponsor bipartisan legislation to close the gun show loophole.\nQ: So, conceivably, if the President is going to be a single-issue voter himself, he could campaign for Senator Toomey despite all their other disagreements?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I am skeptical that that will happen given the significant other --\nQ: But if it's a single-issue voter --\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, but --\nQ: I mean, would the President say to single-issue voters in Pennsylvania that they should be single-issue voters and reelect -- or vote for Senator Toomey because of where he was on gun control even though they may disagree with him on all those other issues that the President also disagrees with?\nMR. EARNEST: But here's the thing, Isaac. I suspect that Mr. Toomey's Democratic opponent, once he has one, will have at least as good of a record as Senator Toomey does when it comes to gun safety and keeping guns out of the hands of those who shouldn't have them, if not a better one.\nAnd we'll see. I know there's a contested primary in Pennsylvania. But I feel pretty confident that a Democratic candidate that he faces off against will be someone who has in their own right a strong record on these issues.\nQ: One other thing. In October, Hillary Clinton spoke about some gun control measures that she'd like to see -- at that point that she wanted to see, and one of them was this gun show loophole question. People in the administration seemed to dismiss that as something that would work then. I'm wondering what changed in the intervening time.\nMR. EARNEST: I'm surprised to hear you say that people were dismissive of it.\nQ: That it can't really work --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not sure who those people were. Maybe they didn't understand the question or maybe they didn't know what they were talking about.\nGardiner.\nQ: Can you just sort of give us another update on the Iran-Saudi disagreement and how it affects U.S. interests in the Syria talks and in the anti-ISIL effort? There's been obviously -- a couple of days has passed since this breach has happened. Are you yet seeing problems crop up in these very strong U.S. interests around both the Syria talks and around the anti-ISIL efforts? I have a few questions, but --\nMR. EARNEST: Okay. Well, let me -- I think the short answer to your question is no. But let me just step back to provide a little context to that answer, which is to say it was very difficult and required a lot of painstaking diplomacy to bring Iran and Saudi Arabia into this process several months ago. There were already sufficient differences between those two countries that it was very difficult to get them into the same room. The only reason that we succeeded in making that case is we persuaded them that their own self-interest in the resolution of the political situation inside of Syria trumped the significant objections that they have about their adversary's behavior.\nThey didn't participate in these talks as a favor to anybody else. They did so because they concluded it was in the interest of their country and their citizens to try to resolve the political situation inside of Syria.\nI think the case that we'll continue to make to them is that their self-interest in trying to reach this political resolution continues to be quite significant. And we're hopeful that they'll continue to participate in a constructive way as we work through that process.\nQ: The issues in southern Oregon right now with the group that's holding hostage -- perhaps that's bad language -- but the building there, there is concern that the -- what is the administration doing in terms of monitoring that? If you are not actively monitoring that at the Homeland Security Department and elsewhere, there is some criticism that this administration is not taking domestic extremism as seriously as it takes foreign extremism. And why aren't you doing that?\nMR. EARNEST: Let me clarify one thing which is that there -- to our knowledge -- at least, I have not been told that there are any hostages involved in this particular situation. But there are --\nQ: I mistakenly used that word.\nMR. EARNEST: That's okay. That's okay. I just wanted to clarify --\nQ: Yes, sir.\nMR. EARNEST: -- to make sure that we're all in the same place in this.\nLet me also just assure you that this is something that the law enforcement officials take quite seriously. The FBI is responsible for enforcing the law and ensuring that the law is followed. And they're working closely with state and local officials to respond to this particular situation.\nLet me also just be blunt, Gardiner, about something else, which is it's not exactly clear what the motives or intentions are of the individuals who are involved in this particular situation. The speculation by some is that it's politically motivated. And I certainly wouldn't want to say something from here that could be construed as inflaming that situation, so that's why over the course of the last 24 hours or so I've been quite circumspect in discussing this issue, primarily because we're hopeful that law enforcement officials who are responding and closely monitoring the situation and take it quite seriously will be able to succeed in resolving it peacefully.\nQ: Okay, one last. The videos of Anwar al-Awlaki on YouTube have repeatedly turned out to be a factor in radicalizing supporters of al Qaeda and ISIS in the U.S. -- from Boston to San Bernardino. Does the President have any regrets about ordering the killing of al-Awlaki since it is now clear that his death has given him the authority of martyrdom? And what does the President think about calls for YouTube and other platforms to take down his material, his early mainstream lectures on Islamic history, as well as his calls for attacks after joining al Qaeda?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me say a couple of things about that. As the President has discussed, Mr. Awlaki was someone who was an active leader of a terrorist organization and was involved in operational planning against the United States and our interests. So it is not just the spreading of propaganda and, in some cases, outright hate speech that totaled our concerns with his actions. And that is why the President and his national security team concluded that the United States would be safer by taking him off the battlefield. And that's what was done.\nMore generally, this issue of cooperating with technology companies -- this is part of the discussion that we had last month -- and there is ongoing work by the administration and by technology companies to take a look at the most effective way for us to deal with these kinds of situations. Obviously, we need to protect free speech and free expression. But at the same time, these technology companies don't want to see their tools used to propagate hate speech and inspire people to carry out acts of terrorism against innocent civilians.\nSo there has been effective -- there is a precedent, however, for working through these kinds of issues. Law enforcement officials have been able to work effectively with technology companies to counter the proliferation of child pornography, for example. This is something that obviously is spread around the Internet. And law enforcement organizations have been able to work effectively with technology companies to counter it. And obviously the issues are going to be a little bit different, but there is a precedent, at least a framework, for having a conversation about the best way to approach the situation consistent with national security and consistent with the kinds of values that are enshrined in our Constitution.\nQ: Thanks, Josh.\nMR. EARNEST: JC, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. On the same topic of terrorist videos, supposedly ISIL released a video yesterday of executions of reported British spies. And along with that went a message to Prime Minister Cameron and to the British people, a very threatening message. What is the administration's reaction to that?\nMR. EARNEST: JC, I haven't seen the videos. I've seen some of the news reports about them. I don't know whether or not the intelligence community has authenticated them.\nQ: If I may interrupt, Prime Minister Cameron certainly has authenticated it in his own words.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay.\nQ: And he sent back a rather vociferous reaction to that.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me just say that the British government and the British people have stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the United States as we have confronted the threat from ISIL. And the British military has made substantial contributions to our counter-ISIL effort. And there are a range of other steps that the British government has taken to contribute to our effort to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. That is one example of the kind of deep cooperation between the United States and the United Kingdom that makes our countries and our citizens more secure.\nAnd the President, over the course of his seven years in office, has sought to deepen that coordination and to make that coordination even more effective than it has historically been. And he has found Prime Minister Cameron to be a very able partner in pursuing that kind of relationship that is so special between our two countries.\nQ: If I can just add, this was supposedly payback to the British people and to Mr. Cameron for their enhanced military activities in Syria.\nMR. EARNEST: I feel confident -- I did not see Prime Minister Cameron's remarks, but I feel confident in saying that the British people and the leaders of that country will not be cowed, will not be terrorized, will not allow these kinds of videos to strike fear in their hearts or in any way diminish their commitment to succeeding in degrading and ultimately destroying that terrorist organization.\nThanks, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 2:34 P.M. EST", "timestamp": "2016-01-05", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}
{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111430", "text": "MATTHEWS: Thank you, Madam Secretary. This is a big interview for us. Twenty-two years we've been doing this, and this is one of our big ones. I want to tell you—want to ask you about 12 questions tonight...\nCLINTON: OK.\nMATTHEWS: ... in two segments. I hope we get through them all.\nCLINTON: Thanks, Chris.\nMATTHEWS: Back in 2001, when we had 9/11 and you were a senator from New York, there was a different spirit in this country, including the Republican Party. You had a Republican president who went on the air and made it clear time and again this is not a battle between the West and the East. It's not about Muslims. It's about terrorism. And he did it so effectively.\nAnd now we have the leading candidate for the Republican nomination for president basically declaring a war on Muslims, saying they're not allowed in the country, the whole works. What do you make of this?\nCLINTON: Well, it's deeply distressing to me because I, as you know, well remember what happened after 9/11. And I have publicly given President Bush a lot of credit for the way that he set the tone and his entire administration echoed that.\nAnd now we need to have a sense of unity and purpose in combatting terrorism. I view it as a threat. I believe ISIS cannot be contained. It has to be defeated. But in order to do that, we need to work within our own country with Muslim Americans, so that what I'm hearing from the other side, is not only offensive and shameful, it's dangerous, counterproductive. And of course, we have to work with countries around the world in order to have a unified coalition against terrorism.\nAnd I've laid out very clearly what I think needs to be done, and it does include an American-led air alliance, and we're doing that. And we're supporting troops on the ground that are not Americans, special forces, but we do need to have the Kurds and the Arabs with special forces support, but not American combat troops.\nAnd we need to go after the arc of instability that fuels this terrorist ideology from North Africa to Pakistan, Afghanistan, and go after their funding and their foreign fighters and their very effective use of the Internet.\nBut then the third pillar of my approach is we have to be safe here at home. We have to work with our friends and allies around the world. And I know you just got back from Israel. We have a lot of important work to do with countries from one end of the globe to the other. And we need to do it in alliance with Muslims here in America and elsewhere. And that's what I'm advocating.\nMATTHEWS: That's why I'm concerned about the Republican Party because this ethnic way of going at this situation, the way they seem to be going at the Muslim people, rather than the terrorists—this started—remember when the man whose name we dare not speak anymore, Donald Trump—I mean, the fact is, Trump started his sort of initiation in politics by saying the president of the United States was an illegal immigrant, he was probably a Muslim, he had a—he almost was an identity thief who created a notion of himself through a phony birth certificate, a phony birth announcement, and he was somehow—in fact, he used to say things—Trump would say things like, Nobody knew him in school, like he's some phantom impersonator, usurper.\nThe Republican Party, every time he did that, said nothing.\nCLINTON: Right.\nMATTHEWS: Boehner, the speaker of the House, who was pretty much respected, wouldn't—isn't this a Republican Party problem, that started with Trump's first arrival on the world stage as some sort of politician, that it's ethnic with them? The president of the United States is one of the bad guys, one of the—if not the terrorists, one of the sneaker-in-ers who snuck into the country and assumed an identity. It's pretty sick.\nCLINTON: Well, it's very divisive and I think counterproductive. It undermines our values, who we are as a people. We are a nation of immigrants, which you know so well. And when I hear what's coming from the other side—and it's not just one person. There's an echo chamber there. And it's very troubling to me to try to divide and conquer, divide and conquer, and you know, a house divided against itself cannot stand.\nWe need to be united. And we should not reward people who use inflammatory rhetoric, who use the kind of derogatory comments, whether it's about Muslims or Mexicans or women or people with disabilities, whoever it might be. That is not a sign of leadership. That's a sign of, you know, showmanship, of desperation that should be rejected roundly by the American people.\nMATTHEWS: By the way, you know, my grandmother spoke Irish when I grew up. I had an Irish accent in the house.\nCLINTON: Yes?\nMATTHEWS: Let me ask you about guns...\nCLINTON: I would have guessed that.\nMATTHEWS: Yes. Well, let's talk about guns because you've shown a lot of guts out there. And we know all the politics of guns. You know it. You ran with your husband. You ran before for president.\nThere are states that have a real gun culture, including the state I grew up in, Pennsylvania. And you come from that part of the world, in a way. And you do come from [inaudible] Scranton...\nCLINTON: My father comes from, right.\nMATTHEWS: So you know there's a gun culture. How do you deal with that in Electoral College situations, where you've got to beat a Republican come next November, hopefully, for you? How do you—how do you make sure that the gun people don't emotionally say, Oh, she's an enemy of guns?\nCLINTON: Well, I think it's important to be focused on what we can do together, and that's why I do support comprehensive background checks and to close the gun show loophole and the on-line loophole and what's called the Charleston loophole...\nMATTHEWS: Right.\nCLINTON: ... and to prevent people who are on the no-fly list from getting guns. And in fact, what I am proposing is supported by a great majority of the American people and a significant majority of gun owners.\nJust today at Osage—you were here when I was speaking to the crowd—and then afterwards, I always take time so people can come up to me. Sometimes I do it publicly, a lot of times I do it privately, what's on their minds.\nAnd a man came up. He had a veterans cap on. And he said, you know, I'm a gun owner, he said, but I don't see any reason why we can't do more to keep guns out of the wrong hands.\nMATTHEWS: Yes.\nCLINTON: And he asked me, What can I do? I said, Well, please stand up against the NRA and the gun lobby. And please talk to your friends because what we are proposing is consistent with constitutional rights.\nBut I agree with you, Chris, it's going to be part of the—you know, the political debate, and frankly, the battle in a lot of parts of our country going forward.\nMATTHEWS: Yes.\nCLINTON: But it is so important, when we lose 90 people a day, 33,000 Americans every year, and when you have met as many victims of gun violence as I have, when you've sat there and you've listened to their stories about losing a child, losing a husband, losing a parent—and I've met with the mothers who have lost children to gun violence by police hands, by, you know, more likely, gun and gang—deadly combination. I've just so many people, from Columbine to Sandy Hook.\nI just can't remain silent. And I think we are at a turning point. And what I said to the man here is, you know, There needs to be a rival organization to the NRA of responsible gun owners, who know that their hunting rights...\nMATTHEWS: Moms Demand Action.\nCLINTON: ... their collecting rights, all of that is not going to be affected. So I'm going to keep beating the drum, and I'm delighted that the president announced the actions he did today.\nMATTHEWS: Well, you're back in this fight.\nCLINTON: I am.\nMATTHEWS: You know, you were here eight years ago. Here you are again.\nCLINTON: I am. I am.\nMATTHEWS: And I do wonder sometimes at you sometimes, your ability—your... [laughter]\nTo use the word \"stamina,\" that hasn't been used correctly lately. You know, I'm a student of history, like you are, and I remember Nixon back in 1950 ran against Helen Gehagen Douglas. And she was one of the first women, liberal, to go out there...\nCLINTON: She is.\nMATTHEWS: ... progressives, to try to win a big seat.\nRight.\nAnd he used to—he said things like, You know, it's awfully hard on a woman. [laughter] He used these little shots at her.\nCLINTON: Yes.\nMATTHEWS: Here we are, two thirds of a century later...\nCLINTON: Right.\nMATTHEWS: ... and the leading Republican candidate is out saying that you don't have the stamina, the strength—is this sexism? Is it what it is?\nCLINTON: Well, you know, I have a new year's resolution...\nMATTHEWS: I know. I've heard this... [crosstalk]\nCLINTON: I will not respond to his, you know...\nMATTHEWS: What does it say about the Republican...\nCLINTON: ... personal attacks.\nMATTHEWS: Well, let me try to phrase it—I feel like a lawyer now. How do I rephrase? [laughter]\nHow does the Republican Party deal with the fact they're voting for this guy, that 35 percent of people are supporting him, and even though he's making these charges, which a lot of people would say are—why would he go after your stamina, rather than Bill's stamina or George McGovern's stamina or anybody else's, except you're a woman?\nCLINTON: Well, look...\nMATTHEWS: He's older than you.\nCLINTON: That's true.\nMATTHEWS: I'm older than you.\nCLINTON: That's true!\nMATTHEWS: My stamina's all right.\nCLINTON: That's true.\nMATTHEWS: So why is he doing this?\nCLINTON: Well, why does he do whatever he does? I can only tell you what I hear from people, and what I hear from people is really about their lives and their future. I mean, lot of this back and forth that goes on...\nMATTHEWS: I know, but...\nCLINTON: ... in the political...\nMATTHEWS: ... he's winning.\nCLINTON: ... universe—well, we'll see. We'll see. We haven't had a single caucus. We haven't had a single primary. The Republicans will have to choose whoever they decide to be their nominee, and I'm looking forward, if I am so fortunate to be the nominee, to run against whoever they put up.\nI'm just going to keep working really hard, like right out there today, you know, getting people to caucus for me, connecting them up with my great organizers. I have an amazing team here...\nMATTHEWS: OK...\nCLINTON: ... and we're just going to work as hard as we can to make my case.\nMATTHEWS: He ain't going to stop. He did an interview with my colleague, Joe Scarborough, this morning. It's going to air tomorrow morning. He's out there again saying he's going after your family. He said it's fair to go after them.\nCLINTON: Well, I just...\nMATTHEWS: He's just going to keep doing it.\nCLINTON: Well...\nMATTHEWS: He says you're an enabler. He's making it personal with you.\nCLINTON: Well, he can say whatever he wants to say. I'm going to keep talking about what people talk to me about...\nMATTHEWS: OK.\nCLINTON: ... and what they talk to me about is, What will you do about prescription drug prices?\nMATTHEWS: By the way, you're good on that one. That's so true.\nCLINTON: Well, it's unbelievable what's happening to people!\nMATTHEWS: Everybody's taking drugs now, and you need—if you have diabetes, like me, or somebody, everybody needs it—if your parents died of Alzheimer's—you talked about that out here.\nCLINTON: Yes.\nMATTHEWS: These are real things.\nCLINTON: These are real things that people talk to me about.\nMATTHEWS: OK...\nCLINTON: And I'm going to be a president who does the big stuff that gets in the headlines, that, you know, you and other analysts and reporters talk about, and I'm going to do the stuff that keeps people awake at night...\nMATTHEWS: OK...\nCLINTON: ... like, you know, making sure they can afford their prescription drugs.\nMATTHEWS: I want to say something nice about you.\nCLINTON: Oh, please! [laughter]\nMATTHEWS: No, I have to. I'm personally responsible. Back when you had all the difficulty in the second administration of President Clinton, your husband, and you had a difficult situation you had to go through—and you went through it, and I think you were completely stunned by it initially, and then you had to deal with it as you became aware of what was going on.\nAnd what did you do? You didn't cry. You didn't go away and say, Gee, whiz, this is terrible, why am I going through this? What you did is you went out and you acted like a champion for Democrats. You went around the country campaigning like mad. You were the real banner carrier for the Democratic Party in '98.\nAnd something interesting happened. An epiphany happened. Somehow, out there campaigning in New York for Chuck Schumer and other people, you said something to yourself. You said, You know what? Something good can come out of this for me. I can become a hero to people.\nAnd you ran for the Senate from New York, when a lot of people were critics of you, would have loved you to have fallen on your face. They would have eaten it up if you'd gone down in a ditch up in New York and lost—because at the time, you were running against Rudy...\nCLINTON: That's right.\nMATTHEWS: ... who looked unbeatable.\nCLINTON: That's right.\nMATTHEWS: And you had the guts to go out there. What made you do it? Because there's a lot of women watching right now. Half my viewers are women. And they want to hear what's it take for a woman to just rise out of a situation which is pretty bad and come out of it and say, You know what? I can rise to this occasion. How did you do it?\nCLINTON: Well, you know, that's a great question because I...\nMATTHEWS: Do you know the answer?\nCLINTON: I didn't have any sense that all of this would happen. I really didn't.\nMATTHEWS: Well, New York came and fell in love with you and said, We like you.\nCLINTON: And—and...\nMATTHEWS: Come up here, live up here, be our senator.\nCLINTON: They did, and Please run. And I said, no, no, no. I said no, no...\nMATTHEWS: Charlie Rangel...[crosstalk]\nCLINTON: Yes, and so many others. And I absolutely said no. And I'll tell you what changed my mind, and it was maybe something that other women can relate to because I was in the news, like, Would she or wouldn't she, and I kept saying, I'm not going to. And I was first lady going up to do an event in New York City to promote women in athletics, and Billie Jean King and great athletes were there.\nMATTHEWS: She's great.\nCLINTON: And so I was introduced by this young woman. I think she was, like, the volleyball or basketball captain. And I came up and shook her hand, and you know, I said, Great job. She leaned over to me and she said, Dare to compete, Mrs. Clinton, dare to compete.\nAnd I thought, Wow. You know, I have encouraged so many women and girls to compete on the athletic fields, in academics...\nMATTHEWS: Yes.\nCLINTON: ... in politics, in business, and I'm being asked to compete. And it...\nMATTHEWS: And stick your neck out.\nCLINTON: And stick my neck out. And it is scary! It is.\nMATTHEWS: It's different than supporting your spouse, isn't it.\nCLINTON: Totally different. ?I mean, I had the hardest time when I started saying, I am me. I'm happy to say, you know, my husband this, or candidate X or Y, but to stand up there and be the person out there...\nMATTHEWS: Wow.\nCLINTON: And it is a big challenge. And I think because, you know, we're coming into our own as women in all walks of life, but still, there's something a little bit daunting about...\nMATTHEWS: Yes.\nCLINTON: ... holding yourself out, asking people to support you, to give you money, to vote for you. It's hard.\nMATTHEWS: And you know who went through that? Another New York senator, Bobby Kennedy.\nCLINTON: Yes.\n[crosstalk]\nMATTHEWS: ... his brother's brother.\nCLINTON: I remember reading about that.\nMATTHEWS: And then all of a sudden, he had to be the guy and stuck his neck out.\nAnyway, we're going to come back and talk about...\nCLINTON: OK.\nMATTHEWS: ... you because I—the way I look at politics—and you called me an analyst. I like that. I'm an analyst. And I look at this race for president, 2016, which we're now in, and really, that list is closing. And a guy at Georgetown, a professor, once said, there's a difference between free will and free choice. Free choice means there's a limit number of choices. And it looks like there's a limited number of choices for the president of the United States coming in 2016, and you're one of them.\nWe'll be right back and talk about Hillary Clinton as the possibly the next—in fact, the first-ever woman commander-in-chief of the United States.\n[commercial break]\nMATTHEWS: Madam Secretary, you may have a new title if this campaign is successful. You have to win the primary. You got to beat Bernie. You got to beat Martin O'Malley. But if all that happens, then you have to beat whoever on the Republican side, you could be the first woman commander-in-chief.\nAnd this is all happening, perhaps coincidentally, or maybe culturally, when Ashton Carter, the secretary of defense, has just made it clear now that all combat roles are open to women. This is something unique in our history. Now, maybe every woman doesn't want these jobs.\nCLINTON: Right.\nMATTHEWS: But these jobs are now open. You can go out there and be infantry. You can go out there, you know, with a knife in your teeth and you can go swinging on ropes into whatever valley you got to go kill people in. Women are going to be doing that, just like in Israel, where I just was.\nHow's our country going to adapt to that? And is it important culturally for us to have women in this combat role?\nCLINTON: I think it's important to open up all roles to women, but I also agree with Secretary Carter that you have to have standards. And women and men have to meet those standards because we're talking literally life or death. So I am...\nMATTHEWS: You mean like climbing ropes and things like that.\nCLINTON: Absolutely. Absolutely. And how much weight you can carry because maybe one of your, you know, fellow soldiers will need that one day. And so I am a huge supporter of women being able to break whatever glass ceilings are holding them back...\nMATTHEWS: If they can physically handle it.\nCLINTON: They've got to be able—and mentally.\nMATTHEWS: Yes.\nCLINTON: You know, it—physically, mentally, you have to be prepared. You have to be ready. And I think that you're right, not every woman's going to want to do that, and some of the women who want to do it are not going to qualify.\nBut we just had a few women pass Ranger school, which is an enormously...\nMATTHEWS: Yes.\nCLINTON: ... competitive, grueling experience. It was just less than a handful, but they proved they could do it. And from everything I know, nobody cut any slack for them. They did it.\nAnd in fact, after it was over, they interviewed some of the, you know, male competitors...\nMATTHEWS: Right.\nCLINTON: ... to go through Ranger school, and these guys said, You know, after a while, I didn't even notice. I mean, yes, you're right, she was a woman. She carried her weight. She pulled her own.\nMATTHEWS: Yes.\nCLINTON: That's what you want because I think about the job that I'm applying for, and it really is a job interview that I'm doing all over America.\nMATTHEWS: Commander-in-chief.\nCLINTON: President and commander-in-chief. And I feel ready to fulfill both roles. I think it's important that the next president get the economy working for everybody so that we don't keep having the deck stacked for those on the top. We've got to stay safe at home and strong in the world. And we've got to deal with these problems that keep people up at night, I like to say.\nMATTHEWS: Yes.\nCLINTON: I feel particularly well prepared to do every part of the job. And when it comes to being commander-in-chief, my eight years as a senator from New York after 9/11, my four years as secretary of state, my many, many hours in the Situation Room, I know how hard these choices are.\nMATTHEWS: You were there when Osama was killed.\nCLINTON: I was. You know, I was one of the very few people that was brought in to advise the president.\nMATTHEWS: Yes.\nCLINTON: And it was the most...\nMATTHEWS: You said, Go for it.\nCLINTON: I did. I did, you know, after, as I say, sitting through hours of meetings, listening to the intelligence being presented, listening to Admiral McRaven, who was then the head of special forces, talk about, you know, what special forces could do, looking at other options...\nMATTHEWS: Yes.\nCLINTON: ... like a cruise missile or a Predator—armed predator, and recommending to the president that we go with the Navy SEAL option, and then being there that day, watching part of the operation on a video screen in the Situation Room, just holding my breath literally through the whole thing.\nI know how hard these choices are. And I know what a cool, deliberative head needs to be finally making them.\nMATTHEWS: Yes.\nCLINTON: I have learned so much, Chris, over the last years. I feel very ready.\nMATTHEWS: You have the—you know who said you had the temperament for it? Bill Clinton, which I thought was interesting, because he would know your temperament.\nCLINTON: Yes. Yes.\nMATTHEWS: Let me ask about your sort of position on this. You voted for the Iraq War authorization, if not the war.\nBernie Sanders is out there still hitting you on that one. Of course, he's coming from the left on you. You have got Rand Paul out there, who is a libertarian and a bit of a—I would say a bit of a dove, saying that you would be more for regime change, that you would start the next war.\nCLINTON: Yes. Well, he's wrong. He is wrong.\nMATTHEWS: They're positioning you as to the hawkish side of Obama.\nCLINTON: Yes. Right.\nMATTHEWS: How—where would you—you read Fred Hiatt of \"The Washington Post\" the other day...\nCLINTON: Yes.\nMATTHEWS: ... position you as someone, I thought, a notch to the hawkish side, because he said you were for a no-fly zone in Syria. You were for ground troops, but not necessarily our troops, but some...\nCLINTON: Right.\nMATTHEWS: Because you need a ground component to tell the bombs where to—to tell them where to drop the bombs.\nCLINTON: Right. Exactly. Right.\nMATTHEWS: Does that make you more hawkish than the president?\nCLINTON: Well, I think most of what I have been advocating, the president is now doing.\nMATTHEWS: But not that.\nCLINTON: Well, we have special forces on the ground. He sent them.\nMATTHEWS: But no-fly zone?\nCLINTON: But the no-fly zone, for me, was an idea that I developed with some advisers.\nMATTHEWS: Is it dangerous with the Russians flying around there?\nCLINTON: Well, of course you would have to have the Russians to sign off on it.\nMATTHEWS: Yes.\nCLINTON: And we were making progress.\nI don't know what the result will be of the conflict now between Saudi Arabia and Iran. But, you know, for the last four years, we have been pushing to try to get a peace conference going.\nAnd I give Secretary Kerry credit for getting everybody agreeing to be in the same room. I saw the no-fly zone as leverage. Number one, if we could get the Russians on board, because we would have to—and I think we could, if we were to say, look, we need safe zones. If we're going to be operating on the ground, advising the Kurds, the Arabs, we need safe zones.\nWe also need safe places for civilians, so that they're not refugees leaving Iraq and Syria. And it can be done. It can be done in a way that doesn't create more problems.\nBut now I'm—I'm very supportive of what the president's doing. We're making some progress. And I have been calling for that, calling for reconstituting the approach toward the sheiks, the Sunni sheiks in Anbar Province, getting them back into the fight, so to speak.\nMATTHEWS: Yes.\nCLINTON: They are. Rebuilding the Iraqi army.\nMATTHEWS: Yes. That's what we need.\nCLINTON: We need that.\nMATTHEWS: We need the Sunnis to retake their land, because the Shia can't do it.\nCLINTON: We need the—well, the still largely Shia Iraqi army took Ramadi, but with Sunni troops.\nMATTHEWS: Army. They have to turn it over to Sunnis.\nCLINTON: And then turn it over.\nMATTHEWS: Yes.\nCLINTON: This makes all the sense in the world to me.\nSo, I view myself as being a realist, being practical, and in accordance with our values, because I think it's very important that we get back to promoting our values and pursuing our interests and protecting our security.\nIf the United States doesn't do that on our own behalf or on behalf of our friends in Europe and Asia and the Middle East, no one will. So this is not a choice. It's not a luxury. It's a necessity.\nMATTHEWS: OK. Last question. We're running out of time.\nI want to try to help you for this audience tonight, our audience, locate yourself politically in this country. [laughter]\nNow, we have Trump out there and we have Bernie out here.\nNow, Bernie calls himself a socialist. Nobody uses a derogatory term anymore. It's—he loves to have that label. He's never ran as a Democrat. He runs against Democrats up there in Vermont.\nYou're a Democrat. I would say you're a pretty typical Democrat in the tradition of the Democratic Party, and Humphrey, the rest of them, Scoop—not even Scoop. I would say Mondale. You're somewhere in there.\nWhat's the difference between a socialist and a Democrat?\nCLINTON: Well, you have to...\nMATTHEWS: Is that a question you want to answer, or would you rather not?\n[crosstalk]\nCLINTON: Well, you would have to ask...\n[crosstalk]\nMATTHEWS: Well, see, I'm asking you. You're a Democrat. He's a socialist. Would you like somebody to call you a socialist? I wouldn't like somebody calling me a socialist.\nCLINTON: Well, but I'm not one. I'm not one.\nMATTHEWS: OK. Well, what's the difference between a socialist and a Democrat? Last question.\nCLINTON: Well, I can tell you what I am.\nI am a progressive Democrat. I am a progressive Democrat...\nMATTHEWS: How is that different than a socialist?\nCLINTON: ... who likes to get things done and who believes that we're better off in this country when we're trying to solve problems together, getting people to work together.\nThere will always be strong feelings, and I respect that, from, you know, the far right, the far left, libertarians, whatever—whoever it might be. We need to get people working together. We have got to get the economy fixed. We have got to get all of our problems, you know, really tackled. And that's what I want to do.\nMATTHEWS: I know.\nYes, I think the difference is—and Debbie Wasserman Schultz wouldn't answer the question either I asked her, because I know, politically, you have to keep together. The center-left and the left has to work together. I know all that.\nLet me ask you about working together. You gave a nice speech here today in Osage about the need to work—I wrote a book about Tip and Reagan. When it comes to an urgent issue, they can find a solution.\nCLINTON: Right.\nMATTHEWS: Obama—I have always supported the president on his philosophy, on his general approach to a lot of things.\nBut he doesn't seem to like the company of fellow politicians. He just doesn't. He doesn't want to hang out with them, play cards with them at midnight. Maybe he did it in Springfield. For some reason, he doesn't want to do it in Washington.\nYou seem to like the company of people like Lindsey Graham and John McCain. And you can find a way, go on CODELs with them and getting along with them. And it seems to me that is an important part of life, that you have to find—you were talking about Tom DeLay here.\nAnd I get along with Tom DeLay. Even though you disagree 180 on something, you have got to find—Congress means coming together.\nCLINTON: Yes. Well, your book is a perfect example of...\nMATTHEWS: \"Tip and the Gipper.\"\nCLINTON: Exactly. And, look, there may be...\nMATTHEWS: You read it?\nCLINTON: I did.\nMATTHEWS: Thank you.\nCLINTON: I don't—I don't want you to know that, but I did.\nMATTHEWS: But you have just told me that. I like this. You're throwing me an encomium here.

Smith, R-MO, and 9 cosponsors)\nThe Administration is committed to ensuring that regulations are smart and effective, and tailored to further statutory goals in the most cost-effective and efficient manner. The retrospective review of regulations has been an ongoing priority of this Administration. Starting in 2011, the President institutionalized the retrospective review of regulations in Executive Orders 13563 and 13610, requiring agencies to report twice a year on the status of their efforts. H.R. 1155, the Searching for and Cutting Regulations that are Unnecessarily Burdensome Act, would make the process of retrospective regulatory review less productive. Further, the bill also would create needless regulatory and legal uncertainty; increase costs for businesses and State, local and tribal governments; and impede common-sense protections for the American public. Accordingly, the Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 1155 in its current form.\nAlthough outside input and perspective on what rules may be ripe for potential reform or repeal is crucial, retrospective review is most effective when led by the agencies. The bill's creation of a stand-alone commission to review the entire Code of Federal Regulations is likely to produce a haphazard list of rules that, under the procedures in the bill, must be repealed if approved by a joint resolution. There appears to be no mechanism for making thoughtful and modest modifications to rules to improve their implementation and enforcement, which is often the best course of action for making regulations work better. Moreover, the bill's \"cut-go\" approach is problematic: it would interfere with the ability of agencies to issue regulations that are essential for the protection of public health, safety, and the environment.\nThe Administration recognizes that the applicability of \"cut-go\" in H.R. 1155 is narrower than in other bills being considered in the Congress. Nonetheless, it is essential that agencies have the flexibility to promptly issue new, vital rules. This ability should not be constrained by a Commission's recommendation, or Congressional approval of a list of repealable rules. While retrospective review is an Administration priority and an essential tool to relieve unnecessary regulatory burden, it is important that retrospective review efforts not unnecessarily constrain an agency's ability to provide a timely response to critical public health or safety issues, or constrain its ability to implement new statutory provisions.\nFor these reasons, the Administration strongly opposes H.R. 1155 in its current form. If the President were presented with the current version of H.R. 1155, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.", "timestamp": "2016-01-05", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 1155 - Searching for and Cutting Regulations that are Unnecessarily Burdensome Act of 2015"}

H.R. 712 would undermine critical public health and safety protections, introduce needless complexity and uncertainty in agency decision-making, and interfere with agency performance of statutory mandates. Accordingly, the Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 712.\nH.R. 712 would impose unnecessary procedures on agencies and invite wasteful litigation. When a Federal agency promulgates a regulation, it must adhere to the robust and well-understood procedural requirements of Federal law, including the Administrative Procedure Act, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, the Paperwork Reduction Act, and the Congressional Review Act. In addition, for decades, agency rulemaking has been governed by Executive Orders issued and followed by administrations of both political parties. These require regulatory agencies to promulgate regulations upon a reasoned determination that the benefits justify the costs, to consider regulatory alternatives, and to promote regulatory flexibility.\nThis Administration is committed to a regulatory system that is informed by science, is cost-justified, and is consistent with economic growth. Through the Regulatory Flexibility Act as well as through Executive Order and the direction of the President, agencies must also ensure that they take into account the consequences of rulemaking on small businesses. Executive Order 13563 requires careful cost-benefit analysis, increased public participation, harmonization of rulemaking across agencies, flexible regulatory approaches, and a regulatory retrospective review. Through Executive Orders 13579 and 13610, the Administration also has taken important steps to promote systematic retrospective review of regulations by all agencies. Collectively, these requirements promote flexible, commonsense, cost-effective regulation.\nPassage of H.R. 712 would impose additional, unnecessary procedural requirements that would seriously undermine the ability of agencies to execute their statutory mandates. H.R. 712 would require numerous, cumbersome layers of reporting from Federal agencies. It also would address a nonexistent problem that is already prohibited by Federal regulations: collusion between agencies, interest groups, and the courts to avoid compliance with the rulemaking procedures described above. H.R. 712 accordingly would serve only to introduce redundant processes for litigation settlements and spawn excessive, expensive, and time-consuming regulatory litigation. H.R. 712 therefore would impede the ability of agencies to protect public health, welfare, safety, and our environment, as well as to promote economic growth, innovation, competitiveness, and job creation.\nIf the President were presented with H.R. 712, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.", "timestamp": "2016-01-05", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 712 - Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act of 2015"}

My daughter Noelle suffered from addiction, and like many parents facing similar situations, her mom and I struggled to help.\nI have so many friends and know so many families who have faced this terrible challenge. Addiction crosses all barriers, all lines, all races and all incomes. It creates real hardship and heartbreak in families. And, it places substantial demands on government at every level.\nI never expected to see my precious daughter in jail. It wasn't easy, and it became very public when I was Governor of Florida, making things even more difficult for Noelle. She went through hell, so did her mom, and so did I.\nIt's very debilitating when you have a loved one who is struggling, and you can't control it. You have to love them, but you also have to make it clear you cannot enable the behavior that gets them in trouble.\nShowing a lot of courage, Noelle graduated from drug court. Drug courts use a restorative solution model involving multi-disciplinary coordination, including the judiciary, the prosecution, mental health specialists, social services and treatment professionals. I was the proud dad that saw Noelle finish that. She's drug-free now.\nAs Governor of Florida, I used a combination of strategies to help reduce heroin use among youth in Florida by approximately 50 percent. As President, I will lead this country to dramatically reduce drug abuse.\nThe country's massive heroin and illicit drug epidemic is compounded and fueled by sharp increases in the abuse of prescription painkillers. The problem is exacerbated by huge increases in the availability of cheap, highly potent heroin, primarily the result of Mexican drug cartels getting involved in the production, trafficking and distribution of heroin and other illicit drugs.\nSome label the drug abuse epidemic just a criminal justice issue, and some try to make it just a health care issue. Both approaches oversimplify this complex and heartbreaking challenge. It is imperative to reduce both the demand and supply if treatment and recovery programs are going to work. To win this fight across the country, I believe we need a multi-faceted strategy that:\nPrevents drug abuse and addiction before it begins: Drug abuse and addiction prevention efforts must start in childhood. That begins with dedicated parents, strong communities and local education. The private sector must also be committed to joining this fight to achieve success, including coalitions driven by local communities and involving health, local law enforcement and social services professionals. When I was governor of Florida, my wife Columba took a very active role in prevention efforts with children; treatment facilities focusing on women with children and struggling children; and coordination of a resource network for local communities at the county level.\nStrengthens criminal justice: I will ensure federal law enforcement agencies have the resources they need, support policies that distinguish pill mills from evidence-based pain clinics, and broaden access to drug courts, an alternative to the traditional punishment system so that nonviolent drug offenders obtain treatment and recovery support. I will also enact smarter sentencing laws for drug offenders, with stiff consequences for drug lords, cartels and violent drug traffickers, while ensuring nonviolent drug offenders obtain the necessary treatment and more quickly return to their communities with reduced mandatory sentences.\nSecures the border to stop the flow of illicit drugs: I will secure the border to stop the flow of illicit drugs into the United States, given that most heroin enters the United States from Mexico. I will work with partner nations, such as Mexico, Colombia and Afghanistan, to address the source of illicit drugs and interdict illicit drug trafficking.\nImproves drug abuse treatment and recovery programs: I will strengthen and coordinate Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs) to monitor and analyze electronic prescribing and dispensing data. I will promote innovation for a suite of treatment and recovery tools that align with individuals' unique medical needs and beliefs. And I will conduct a rigorous evaluation of existing prevention, treatment and recovery programs to ensure funding supports evidence-based programs that consistently monitor results.\nDrug abuse and addiction hurts Americans from all walks of life. It is a complex problem that requires a multi-disciplinary, multi-faceted solution. It will take real leadership that makes solving the problem a top priority. I've successfully fought this epidemic as a Governor, but more importantly, I've experienced it as a father. We know how to make a difference in this fight, and with the right leadership and solutions, we will.", "timestamp": "2016-01-05", "title": "Press Release - Addressing the Heartbreak of Addiction"}

{"author": "Jeb Bush", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=112612", "text": "Barack Obama has proved again why he will go down as one of the most liberal and divisive presidents in the history of our nation. Obama's declaration that he will impose his gun control agenda by executive order shows an utter disregard for the Second Amendment as well as the proper constitutional process for making laws in our nation.\nLiberals like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton seize on every opportunity to advance a gun-grabbing agenda. After the ISIS-inspired terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Obama and Clinton called for sweeping gun control provisions that would trample on the Second Amendment. Recognizing that there is no chance to push their agenda through Congress, where even less liberal Democrats oppose their gun control policies, Obama has once again turned to unlawful executive orders to bypass Congress. Similar to his executive orders to grant legal status to millions of immigrants here illegally without securing the border or the support of Congress, Obama is now trying to do an end-run on the Second Amendment.\nWhen I am president of the United States, I will repeal Obama's anti-gun executive orders on Day One of my administration. I will oppose legislative actions that impose unnecessary burdens on law-abiding gun owners, and I will nominate and fight for conservative judges who have a deep respect for the Constitution and the Second Amendment. With the next president possibly having the opportunity to nominate as many as four justices to the Supreme Court, the stakes in this election couldn't be higher for gun owners. Hillary Clinton will surely stack the federal judiciary with liberal judges who will chip away at the Second Amendment. We cannot give her that opportunity.\nThe question facing Republican voters is who is the best candidate to take the fight to Hillary Clinton. No one has a stronger track record of standing up for gun owners and winning than I do. I am a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association (NRA) and as governor of Florida I passed several pro-Second Amendment pieces of legislation that made our state a national model for protecting and advancing gun rights. We were the first state to pass Stand Your Ground to enable citizens to defend themselves from attackers outside their homes. We also expanded concealed carry permits and provided reciprocity to gun owners in other states so they could carry while visiting Florida. As a result of our efforts to fortify Second Amendment rights of our citizens, Florida today has more concealed carry permit holders than any other state. I am proud of the fact that I earned an A+ rating from the NRA.\nI am equally proud of the fact that we proved in Florida that reducing gun violence and crime and respecting the Second Amendment can go hand-in-hand. Early in my first term as governor, I signed a law that imposed tough mandatory minimum sentences on felons who used guns in their crimes. The legislation, which was called 10-20-Life, put gun felons behind bars for 10 years if they brandished a firearm in the commission of a crime; 20 years if they shot the weapon; and life in prison if they shot and injured or killed another person. Together with other tough on crime strategies, 10-20-Life helped reduce gun violence in Florida by nearly 20 percent while bringing our overall crime rates down to a 35-year low.\nWith radical Islamic terrorist organizations like ISIS using mass shootings like the ones in San Bernardino and Paris to wage jihad against America and our allies, I believe it is more important than ever to stand strong in defense of gun rights.\nThe Second Amendment is the original homeland security act. Rather than taking guns out of the hands of law-abiding citizens as Obama and Clinton would like to do, we should focus on keeping guns out of the hands of the terrorists who want to kill innocent Americans. My commitment to responsible gun owners is clear. As president of the United States, I will defend the Second Amendment, always.\nOriginally Posted on The Cedar Rapids Gazette", "timestamp": "2016-01-05", "title": "Press Release - Barack Obama's Executive Orders Trample on the Second Amendment"}

Will they like me? No. Will they begin to play by the rules if I'm president? You better believe it.\"\nSanders presented a sweeping plan to rein in the greed of the nation's biggest financial institutions, drawing sharp contrasts with Sec. Clinton's approach. \"My opponent says that as a senator she told bankers to 'cut it out' and end their destructive behavior,\" Sanders said. \"But, in my view, establishment politicians are the ones who need to 'cut it out.' The reality is that Congress doesn't regulate Wall Street. Wall Street and their lobbyists regulate Congress. We must change that reality and as president I will.\"\nSanders' administration will create a list of \"too big to fail\" institutions by the end of his first 100 days in the White House. \"Within one-year, my administration will break these institutions up so that they no longer pose a grave threat to the economy,\" he said. Sanders will accomplish this goal by appointing strong regulators who will utilize Section 121 of Dodd-Frank to ensure the safety and soundness of the financial system by breaking up large banks and shadow banks that pose a grave threat to the economy.\nSanders promised to fight to establish a 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act, a Depression-era law signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt designed to prevent Wall Street speculators from crashing the economy. He also said his administration will cap ATM fees, allow post offices to offer banking services and reform the Federal Reserve to focus on its full employment mandate.\n\"Secretary Clinton says that Glass-Steagall would not have prevented the financial crisis because shadow banks like AIG and Lehman Brothers, not big commercial banks, were the real culprits. On this issue, Secretary Clinton is wrong. Shadow banks did gamble recklessly, but where did that money come from? It came from the federally insured bank deposits of big commercial banks – something that would have been banned under the Glass-Steagall Act,\" Sanders said.\nSanders also said he will fight to cap ATM fees at $2, cap interest rates on credit cards and loans at 15 percent, establish modest banking services at post offices, and turn credit rating agencies into non-profits that are committed to accurately rating financial products, and are not beholden to Wall Street.\n\"Not one major Wall Street executive has been prosecuted for causing the near collapse of our entire economy,\" Sanders said before describing some of the biggest crimes committed by financial institutions in recent years. \"That will change under my administration.

{"author": "Bernie Sanders", "note": "As prepared for delivery.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=114496", "text": "The American people are catching on. They understand that something is profoundly wrong when, in our country today, the top one-tenth of 1 percent own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent and when the 20 richest people own more wealth than the bottom 150 million Americans — half of our population. They know that the system is rigged when the average person is working longer hours for lower wages, while 58 percent of all new income goes to the top 1 percent.\nThey also know that a handful of people on Wall Street have extraordinary power over the economic and political life of our country. As most people know, in the 1990s and later, the financial interests spent billions of dollars in lobbying and campaign contributions to force through Congress the deregulation of Wall Street, the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act and the weakening of consumer protection laws in states.\nThey spent this money in order to get the government off their backs and to show the American people what they could do with that new-won freedom. Well, they sure showed the American people. In 2008, the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street nearly destroyed the U.S. and global economy.\nMillions of Americans lost their jobs, their homes and their life savings.\nWhile Wall Street received the largest taxpayer bailout in the history of the world with no strings attached, the American middle class continues to disappear, poverty is increasing and the gap between the very rich and everyone else is growing wider and wider. And Wall Street executives still receive huge compensation packages as if the financial crisis they created never happened.\nGreed, fraud, dishonesty and arrogance, these are the words that best describe the reality of Wall Street today.\nSo, to those on Wall Street who may be listening today, let me be very clear. Greed is not good. In fact, the greed of Wall Street and corporate America is destroying the fabric of our nation. And, here is a New Year's Resolution that I will keep if elected president. If you do not end your greed, we will end it for you.\nWe will no longer tolerate an economy and a political system that has been rigged by Wall Street to benefit the wealthiest Americans in this country at the expense of everyone else.\nWhile President Obama deserves credit for improving this economy after the Wall Street crash, the reality is that a lot of unfinished business remains to be done.\nOur goal must be to create a financial system and an economy that works for all Americans, not just a handful of billionaires\nEnding \"Too Big To Fail\"\nThat means we have got to end, once and for all, the scheme that is nothing more than a free insurance policy for Wall Street, the policy of \"too big to fail.\"\nWe need a banking system that is part of the productive economy — making loans at affordable rates to small- and medium-sized businesses so that we create decent-paying jobs. Wall Street cannot continue to be an island unto itself, gambling trillions in risky financial instruments, making huge profits and assured that, if their schemes fail, the taxpayers will be there to bail them out.\nIn 2008, the taxpayers of this country bailed out Wall Street because we were told they were \"too big to fail.\" Yet, today, 3 out of the 4 largest financial institutions (JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo) are nearly 80 percent bigger than before we bailed them out. Incredibly, the six largest banks in this country issue more than two-thirds of all credit cards and more than 35 percent of all mortgages. They control more than 95 percent of all financial derivatives and hold more than 40 percent of all bank deposits. Their assets are equivalent to nearly 60 percent of our GDP. Enough is enough.\nIf a bank is too big to fail, it is too big to exist. When it comes to Wall Street reform that must be our bottom line. This is true not just from a risk perspective and the fear of another bailout. It is also true from the reality that a handful of huge financial institutions simply have too much economic and political power over this country.\nIf Teddy Roosevelt, the Republican trust-buster, were alive today, he would say \"break 'em up.\" And he would be right.\nAnd, here's how I will accomplish that.\nWithin the first 100 days of my administration, I will require the secretary of the Treasury Department to establish a \"Too-Big-to Fail\" list of commercial banks, shadow banks and insurance companies whose failure would pose a catastrophic risk to the United States economy without a taxpayer bailout.\nWithin one year, my administration will break these institutions up so that they no longer pose a grave threat to the economy as authorized under Section 121 of the Dodd-Frank Act.\nAnd, I will fight to reinstate a 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act to clearly separate commercial banking, investment banking and insurance services. Let's be clear: this legislation, introduced by my colleague Senator Elizabeth Warren, aims at the heart of the shadow banking system.\nIn my view, Senator Warren, is right. Dodd-Frank should have broken up Citigroup and other \"too- big-to-fail\" banks into pieces. And that's exactly what we need to do. And that's what I commit to do as president.\nNow, my opponent, Secretary Clinton says that Glass-Steagall would not have prevented the financial crisis because shadow banks like AIG and Lehman Brothers, not big commercial banks, were the real culprits.\nSecretary Clinton is wrong.\nShadow banks did gamble recklessly, but where did that money come from? It came from the federally-insured bank deposits of big commercial banks — something that would have been banned under the Glass-Steagall Act.\nLet's not forget: President Franklin Roosevelt signed this bill into law precisely to prevent Wall Street speculators from causing another Great Depression. And, it worked for more than five decades until Wall Street watered it down under President Reagan and killed it under President Clinton.\nAnd, let's not kid ourselves. The Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department didn't just bail out shadow banks. As a result of an amendment that I offered to audit the emergency lending activities of the Federal Reserve during the financial crisis, we learned that the Fed provided more than $16 trillion in short-term, low-interest loans to every major financial institution in the country including Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, not to mention large corporations, foreign banks, and foreign central banks throughout the world.\nSecretary Clinton says we just need to impose a few more fees and regulations on the financial industry. I disagree.\nAs former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich has said and I quote: \"Giant Wall Street banks continue to threaten the wellbeing of millions of Americans, but what to do? Bernie Sanders says break them up and resurrect the Glass-Steagall Act that once separated investment from commercial banking. Hillary Clinton says charge them a bit more and oversee them more carefully … Hillary Clinton's proposals would only invite more dilution and finagle. The only way to contain the Street's excesses is with reforms so big, bold, and public they can't be watered down — busting up the biggest banks and resurrecting Glass-Steagall.\"\nSecretary Reich is right. Real Wall Street reform means breaking up the big banks and re-establishing firewalls that separates risk taking from traditional banking.\nMy opponent says that, as a senator, she told bankers to \"cut it out\" and end their destructive behavior. But, in my view, establishment politicians are the ones who need to \"cut it out.\" The reality is that Congress doesn't regulate Wall Street. Wall Street, its lobbyists and their billions of dollars regulate Congress. We must change that reality, and as president I will.\nEnding Too-Big-To-Jail\nIt is no secret that millions of Americans have become disillusioned with our political process. They don't vote. They don't believe much of what comes out of Washington. They don't think anyone is there representing their interests. In my view, one of the reasons for that deep disillusionment is the widespread understanding that our criminal justice system is broken and grossly unfair — and that we do not have equal justice under the law. The average American sees kids being arrested and sometimes even jailed for possessing marijuana or other minor crimes. But when it comes to Wall Street executives, some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in this country, whose illegal behavior caused pain and suffering for millions — somehow nothing happens to them. No police record. No jail time. No justice.\nWe live in a country today that has an economy that is rigged, a campaign finance system which is corrupt and a criminal justice system which, too often, does not dispense justice.\nNot one major Wall Street executive has been prosecuted for causing the near collapse of our entire economy.\nThat will change under my administration. \"Equal Justice Under Law\" will not just be words engraved on the entrance of the Supreme Court. It will be the standard that applies to Wall Street and all Americans.\nThe business model on Wall Street is fraud\nIt seems like almost every few weeks we read about one giant financial institution after another being fined or reaching settlements for their reckless, unfair and deceptive activities.\nSome people believe that this is an aberration: that we have an honest financial system in which, every now and then, major financial institutions do something wrong and get caught. In my view, the evidence suggests that would be an incorrect analysis.\nThe reality is that fraud is the business model on Wall Street. It is not the exception to the rule. It is the rule. And in a weak regulatory climate the likelihood is that Wall Street gets away with a lot more illegal behavior than we know of.\nHow many times have we heard the myth that what Wall Street did may have been wrong but it wasn't illegal?\nLet me help shatter that myth today.\nSince 2009, major financial institutions in this country have been fined $204 billion. $204 billion. And that takes place in a weak regulatory climate.\nHere are just a few examples of when major banks were caught doing illegal activity.\nIn August 2014, Bank of America settled a case with the Department of Justice for more than $16 billion on charges that the bank misled investors about the riskiness of mortgage-backed securities it sold in the run-up to the crisis.\nIn November of 2013, JP Morgan settled a case for $13 billion with the Department of Justice and the Federal Housing Finance Agency over charges the bank knowingly sold securities made up of low-quality mortgages to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\nIn June of 2014, BNP Paribas was sentenced to five years' probation and was ordered to pay $8.9 billion in penalties by a U.S. District Judge in Manhattan after this bank pled guilty to charges of violating sanctions by conducting business in Sudan, Iran and Cuba.\nLet me read you a few headlines and you tell me how it makes sense that not one executive was prosecuted for fraud.\n* CNN Headline, May 20, 2015: \"5 big banks pay $5.4 billion for rigging currencies.\" Those banks include JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup.\n* Headline from the International Business Times (February 24, 2015): \"Big Banks Under Investigation For Allegedly Fixing Precious Metals Prices.\" The Banks under investigation included Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase.\n* Headline from The Real News Network (November 26, 2013): \"Documents in JPMorgan settlement reveal how every large bank in the U.S. has committed mortgage fraud.\"\n* Headline from The Washington Post (March 14, 2014): \"In lawsuit, FDIC accuses 16 big banks of fraud, conspiracy,\" which included Bank of America, Citigroup and JP Morgan Chase.\n* Headline from the Guardian (April 2, 2011): \"How a big U.S. bank laundered billions from Mexico's murderous drug gangs.\" This article talks about how Wachovia (which was acquired by Wells Fargo) aided Mexican drug cartels in transferring billions of dollars in illegal drug money. Here is what the federal prosecutor (Jeffrey Sloman) said about this: \"Wachovia's blatant disregard for our banking laws gave international cocaine cartels a virtual carte blanche to finance their operations.\"\nYet, the total fine for this offense was less than 2% of the bank's $12.3 billion profit for 2009 and no one went to jail. No one went to jail.\nAnd, if that's not bad enough, here's another one.\n* Headline: The Wall Street Journal, February 9, 2011: \"J.P. Morgan Apologizes for Military Foreclosures.\" Here is a case where JP Morgan Chase, the largest bank in America, wrecked the finances of 4,000 military families in violation of the Civil Service Members Relief Act, yet no one went to jail.\nAnd, when I say that the business model of Wall Street is fraud that is not just Bernie Sanders talking. That is what financial executives told the University of Notre Dame in a study on the ethics of the financial services industry last year.\nAccording to this study, 51 percent of Wall Street executives making more than $500,000 a year found it likely that their competitors have engaged in unethical or illegal activity in order to gain an edge in the market.\nMore than one-third of financial executives have either witnessed or have firsthand knowledge of wrongdoing in the workplace.\nNearly one in five financial service professionals believe they must engage in illegal or unethical activity to be successful.\nTwenty-five percent of financial executives have signed or been asked to sign a confidentiality agreement that would prohibit reporting illegal or unethical activities to the authorities.\nHere's what one banker from Barclays said in 2010, when he was caught trying to price-fix the $5 trillion-per-day currency market: \"If you ain't cheating, you ain't trying.\"\nHere's what an analyst from Standard & Poors said in 2008, \"Let's hope we are all wealthy and retired by the time this house of cards falters.\"\nThis country can no longer afford to tolerate the culture of fraud and corruption on Wall Street.\nUnder my administration, Wall Street CEOs will no longer receive a get-out-of jail free card. Big banks will not be too big to fail. Big bankers will not be too big to jail.\nAs president, I will nominate and appoint people with a track record of standing up to power, rather than those who have made millions defending Wall Street CEOs. Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks will not be represented in my administration.\nTax on Wall Street Speculation\nAnd, if we are serious about reforming our financial system, we have got to establish a tax on Wall Street speculators. We have got to discourage reckless gambling on Wall Street and encourage productive investments in the job-creating economy.\nWe will use the revenue from this tax to make public colleges and universities tuition free. During the financial crisis, the middle class of this country bailed out Wall Street. Now, it's Wall Street's turn to help the middle class.\nReforming Credit Rating Agencies\nWe cannot have a safe and sound financial system if we cannot trust the credit agencies to accurately rate financial products. And, the only way we can restore that trust is to make sure credit rating agencies cannot make a profit from Wall Street.\nInvestors would not have bought the risky mortgage backed derivatives that led to the Great Recession if credit agencies did not give these worthless financial products triple-A ratings — ratings that they knew were bogus.\nAnd, the reason these risky financial schemes were given such favorable ratings is simple. Wall Street paid for them.\nUnder my administration, we will turn for-profit credit rating agencies into non-profit institutions, independent from Wall Street. No longer will Wall Street be able to pick and choose which credit agency will rate their products.\nCap Credit Card Interest Rates and ATM Fees\nIf we are going to create a financial system that works for all Americans, we have got to stop financial institutions from ripping off the American people by charging sky-high interest rates and outrageous fees.\nIn my view, it is unacceptable that Americans are paying a $4 or $5 fee each time they go to the ATM.\nIt is unacceptable that millions of Americans are paying credit card interest rates of 20 or 30 percent.\nThe Bible has a term for this practice. It's called usury. And in The Divine Comedy, Dante reserved a special place in the Seventh Circle of Hell for those who charged people usurious interest rates.\nToday, we don't need the hellfire and the pitch forks, we don't need the rivers of boiling blood, but we do need a national usury law.\nToday, we need to cap interest rates on credit cards and consumer loans at 15 percent.\nIn 1980, Congress passed legislation to require credit unions to cap interest rates on their loans at no more than 15 percent. And, that law has worked well. Unlike big banks, credit unions did not receive a huge bailout from the taxpayers of this country. It is time to extend this cap to every lender in America.\nWe must also cap ATM fees at $2.00. People should not have to pay a 10 percent fee for withdrawing $40 of their own money out of an ATM.\nBig banks need to stop acting like loan sharks and start acting like responsible lenders.\nAllow Post Offices to Offer Banking Services\nWe also need to give Americans affordable banking options.\nThe reality is that, unbelievably, millions of low-income Americans live in communities where there are no normal banking services. Today, if you live in a low-income community and you need to cash a check or get a loan to pay for a car repair or a medical emergency, where do you go?\nYou go to a payday lender who could charge an interest rate of over 300 percent and trap you into a vicious cycle of debt. That is unacceptable.\nWe need to stop payday lenders from ripping off millions of Americans. Post offices exist in almost every community in our country. One important way to provide decent banking opportunities for low income communities is to allow the U.S. postal Service to engage in basic banking services, and that's what I will fight for.\nReforming the Federal Reserve\nFurther, we need to structurally reform the Federal Reserve to make it a more democratic institution responsive to the needs of ordinary Americans, not just the billionaires on Wall Street.\nWhen Wall Street was on the verge of collapse, the Federal Reserve acted with a fierce sense of urgency to save the financial system. We need the Fed to act with the same boldness to combat unemployment and low wages.\nIn my view, it is unacceptable that the Federal Reserve has been hijacked by the very bankers it is in charge of regulating. I think the American people would be shocked to learn that Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JP Morgan Chase, served on the board of the New York Fed at the same time that his bank received a $391 billion bailout from the Federal Reserve. That is a clear conflict of interest that I would ban as president. When I am elected, the foxes will no longer be guarding the henhouse at the Fed. Under my administration, banking industry executives will no longer be allowed to serve on the Fed's boards and handpick its members and staff.\nFurther, the Fed should stop paying financial institutions interest to keep money out of the economy and parked at the Fed. Incredibly, the excess reserves of financial institutions that are sitting in the Federal Reserve has grown from less than $2 billion in 2008 to $2.4 trillion today. That is absurd.\nInstead of paying banks interest on these reserves, the Fed should charge them a fee that could be used to provide affordable loans to small businesses to create hundreds of thousands of jobs.\nConclusion\nFinally, let me tell you what no other candidate will tell you. No president, not Bernie Sanders or anyone else, can effectively address the economic crises facing the working families of this country alone. The truth is that Wall Street, corporate America, the corporate media and wealthy campaign donors are just too powerful.\nWhat this campaign is about is building a political movement which revitalizes American democracy, which brings millions of people together — black and white, Latino, Asian-American, Native American — young and old, men and women, gay and straight, native born and immigrant, people of all religions.\nYes. Wall Street has enormous economic and political power. Yes. Wall Street makes huge campaign contributions, they have thousands of lobbyists and they provide very generous speaking fees to those who go before them.\nYes. They have an endless supply of money. But we have something they don't have. And that is that when millions of working families stand together, demanding fundamental changes in our financial system, we have the power to bring about that change.\nYes, we can make our economy work for all Americans, not just a handful of wealthy speculators. And, now more than ever, that is exactly what we must do.\nAnd so my message to you today is straightforward: If elected president, I will rein in Wall Street so they can't crash our economy again.\nWill they like me? No. Will they begin to play by the rules if I'm president? You better believe it.\nThank you and I look forward to working with the most powerful force in our great nation, not the Barons of Wall Street but the people our government was created to serve.", "timestamp": "2016-01-05", "title": "Remarks on Wall Street and the Economy in New York City"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118120", "text": "Following President Obama's March 2012 call to strengthen federal efforts to combat human trafficking, we - as agencies of the President's Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (PITF) - have brought together leaders from government, the private sector, advocates, survivors, communities of faith, civil society, law enforcement, and academia to strengthen our nation's collective efforts to combat human trafficking. In implementing this ambitious agenda, the Obama Administration has focused on four priority areas: rule of law, victim services, procurement and supply chains, and public awareness and outreach.\nHuman trafficking is a crime involving the exploitation of someone for the purposes of compelled labor or a commercial sex act through the use of force, fraud, or coercion. Where a person younger than 18 is induced to perform a commercial sex act, it is a crime regardless of whether there is any force, fraud, or coercion. A victim need not be physically transported for a trafficking crime to occur.\nPITF agencies are leveraging resources more effectively and developing robust whole-of-agency responses to combat trafficking. The diverse achievements range from advancing the first-ever Partnership for Freedom competition - a public-private partnership announced by President Obama to spur innovative solutions to problems caused by modern slavery - to gathering data on the sectors at greatest risk of trafficking-related activities in federal contracts and global supply chains. We were also proud to announce last month the formation of the new U.S. Advisory Council on Human Trafficking, through which survivors will provide input and expertise to federal agencies on U.S. anti-trafficking policy.\nThis fact sheet offers only a snapshot of the Administration's accomplishments, and more information is available from the State Department.\nRule of Law:\n• In September, the Justice Department announced $22 million in grant funding to combat human trafficking, almost half of which will fund 16 anti-human trafficking task forces made up of federal, state, and local law enforcement.\n• The highly effective Anti-Trafficking Coordination Team (ACTeam) Initiative, a partnership between the Departments of Justice, Homeland Security, and Labor, develops high-impact human trafficking investigations and prosecutions. We look forward to announcing in 2016 the Phase II ACTeam sites through a competitive, nationwide selection process.\n• The FBI takes part in more than 120 Human Trafficking Task Forces and Working Groups that partner with other federal, tribal, state, and local law enforcement agencies, as well as NGOs to ensure trafficking victims are provided with comprehensive services. This unprecedented, unified effort has resulted in the arrests of almost 3,500 persons for human trafficking offenses during FY2015, and the safe recovery of numerous victims throughout our country.\n• The Intelligence Community (IC) partnered with law enforcement agencies to conduct pilot research projects designed to identify gaps in our knowledge base and translate those findings into targeted collection efforts. The IC also participated in the training of Embassy personnel overseas in an ongoing effort to expand reporting on trafficking.\n• As president of the U.N. Security Council in December, the U.S. Mission to the United Nations convened an open debate, unprecedented in its 70-year history, on \"Trafficking in Persons in Situations of Conflict\" to shine a spotlight on human trafficking by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and Boko Haram.\nVictim Services:\n• In 2015, the Administration announced an unprecedented $28 million from DOJ and HHS in funding for comprehensive services for victims of human trafficking in the United States.\n• The Department of State just launched a new in-person registration program that supports continued efforts to enhance protections for domestic workers employed by foreign personnel at foreign missions in Washington, and will expand the program in the future to include domestic workers employed by foreign personnel at foreign consulates as well as personnel at international organizations throughout the United States.\n• The Department of Health and Human Services' established the Office on Trafficking in Persons to coordinate anti-trafficking responses and victim assistance efforts across multiple systems of care, including refugee resettlement, child welfare, runaway and homeless youth, and domestic violence programs. This year, HHS will expand training for health and human service providers likely to work with trafficking victims and provide enhanced tools and guidance on trauma-informed practices to address related mental health needs.\n• The Department of Labor's 4-year, nearly $12 million \"BRIDGE Project,\" From Protocol to Practice: Building a Bridge to Global Action on Forced Labor, works to fight forced labor of adults and children around the world.\nProcurement and Supply Chains:\n• The White House Forum on Combating Human Trafficking in Supply Chains brought together leaders from the private sector, NGOs, and the federal government to discuss the prevention of human trafficking in federal contracts and private-sector supply chains.\n• Secretary Kerry presented the 2015 Presidential Award for Extraordinary Efforts to Combat Trafficking in Persons to the Coalition of Immokalee Workers for pioneering a zero-tolerance program that puts workers and social responsibility at the center, and has eradicated human trafficking in the farms that participate in its Fair Food Program.\n• Working at the nexus of business and human rights, USAID has pioneered a new initiative called Supply Unchained to better identify and counter human trafficking in supply chains. USAID is partnering with an NGO in India to create a model for identifying human trafficking cases in the lowest tiers of global supply chains, and also with the Issara Institute to create a mobile application for Burmese migrant workers to better connect and share information to counter human trafficking risks in Thailand's export-oriented seafood supply chains.\n• The Department of Defense, in April 2015, held its largest ever Operational Contract Support Exercise that evaluated current policies aimed at combating human trafficking via the supply chain in U.S. Pacific Command's area of responsibility. The Department is planning a similar exercise this April for U.S. Southern Command.\n• As discussed at the January 2015, White House Forum on Combating Human Trafficking in Supply Chains, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council will soon release the proposed rule for public comment through a federal register notice for a government-wide definition for recruitment fees. The definition will provide greater clarity and help ensure federal contractors and other companies are successful in addressing human trafficking concerns in their supply chains.\n• The recently concluded Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiated by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative includes enforceable obligations on labor rights, including on the elimination of forced labor and to address trade in goods produced by forced labor, and specifically targets trafficking concerns in trading partners, such as Malaysia, by requiring reforms in law and practice to better protect vulnerable populations and to prosecute traffickers.\n• Additionally, the State Department this month will launch an online resource, ResponsibleSourcingTool.org, to strengthen protections against forced labor in federal and global supply chains.\nPublic Awareness and Outreach:\n• The Department of Homeland Security's Blue Campaign collaborates with multiple government agencies to support awareness and training efforts within the government and with the public. The Blue Campaign's public service announcement, \"Out of the Shadows,\" aired more than 52,900 times across the Nation on television and more than 11,800 times on the radio. Additionally, the DHS-HSI Victim Assistance Program held over 1,000 community events focused on raising public awareness and educating law enforcement and NGOs.\n• The Department of the Interior convened the first ever Native American Human Trafficking Task Force in Albuquerque. The group will conduct training and public awareness campaigns with tribal leaders and gaming institutions as well as work with New Mexico state officials to develop protocols for responding to human trafficking.\n• The Department of Agriculture is working with the DHS Blue Campaign to develop food and agriculture centric materials to raise awareness of human trafficking with industry partners and will partner with Health and Human Services to increase awareness of trafficking in USDA StrikeForce states that may be particularly susceptible to trafficking due to extreme poverty. The StrikeForce teams collaborate with more than 500 community partners across 20 states to address rural poverty.\n• The Department of Education published Human Trafficking in America's Schools to help school staff identify potential victims, protect students, and work with partners in their efforts to prosecute traffickers. Additionally, Education and HHS formed a public-private partnership with President Lincoln's Cottage to launch a peer-to-peer social media competition to raise awareness about human trafficking among high school students.\n• The Department of Transportation partnered with DHS to implement trainings tailored for airline personnel and the motor coach industry, and, at industry's request, will train transit operators beginning in 2016.\n• The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has partnered with several community-based organizations and conducted 244 events to raise awareness about human trafficking and educate vulnerable communities. The Commission also trained staff and representatives of state and local fair employment practice agencies on identifying and developing instances of human trafficking.\nAdditional references:\nPresident Obama Announces Members of United States Advisory Council on Human Trafficking  here.

As one of our country's leading advocates for reproductive rights, NARAL's work is more important than ever. Women's health and rights are under attack across America. In Texas, state leaders are taking their fight to cut women off from access to safe and legal abortion all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. In Colorado Springs, a violent extremist targeted a health center. Meanwhile, Congress has voted to restrict reproductive rights and cut women off from access to affordable health care. And one after another, Republicans running for President have pledged to cut funding for Planned Parenthood; restrict abortion access; and repeal the Affordable Care Act, which ensures that women will no longer be charged more just for being women.\n\"In January 2017, a new President will walk into the Oval Office. We cannot afford to elect a Republican who will rip away the progress women have made. We need to protect and advance reproductive rights, not allow politicians to interfere in women's personal health decisions. I will stand with NARAL and women across the country in defending access to abortion, contraception, and sex education. I will stand with NARALin advocating for policies that help women and families.

Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Please have a seat. Thank you. Thank you so much.\nMark, I want to thank you for your introduction. I still remember the first time we met and the time we spent together and the conversation we had about Daniel. And that changed me that day. And my hope, earnestly, has been that it would change the country.\nFive years ago this week, a sitting Member of Congress and 18 others were shot at, at a supermarket in Tucson, Arizona. It wasn't the first time I had to talk to the Nation in response to a mass shooting, nor would it be the last. Fort Hood. Binghamton. Aurora. Oak Creek. Newtown. The Navy Yard. Santa Barbara. Charleston. San Bernardino. Too many.\nAudience member. Too many.\nAudience member. Too many.\nAudience member. Too many.\nThe President. Now, thanks to a great medical team and the love of her husband Mark, my dear friend and colleague, Gabby Giffords, survived. She's here with us today with her wonderful mom. Thanks to a great medical team, her wonderful husband Mark, who, by the way, the last time I met with Mark—this is just a small aside—you may know Mark's twin brother is in outer space. [Laughter] He came to the office, and I said, \"How often are you talking to him?\" And he says, \"Well, I usually talk to him every day, but the call was coming in right before the meeting so I think I may have not answered his call\"—[laughter]—which made me feel kind of bad. [Laughter] That's a long-distance call. [Laughter] So I told him if his brother Scott is calling today, that he should take it. [Laughter] Turn the ringer on. [Laughter]\nI was there with Gabby when she was still in the hospital, and we didn't think necessarily at that point that she was going to survive. And that visit right before a memorial—about an hour later Gabby first opened her eyes. And I remember talking to mom about that. [Laughter] But I know the pain that she and her family have endured these past 5 years and the rehabilitation and the work and the effort to recover from shattering injuries.\nAnd then, I think of all the Americans who aren't as fortunate. Every single year, more than 30,000 Americans have their lives cut short by guns—30,000. Suicides. Domestic violence. Gang shootouts. Accidents. Hundreds of thousands of Americans have lost brothers and sisters, or buried their own children. Many have had to learn to live with a disability or learned to live without the love of their life.\nA number of those people are here today. They can tell you some stories. In this room right here, there are a lot of stories. There's a lot of heartache. There's a lot of resilience, there's a lot of strength, but there's also a lot of pain. And this is just a small sampling.\nThe United States of America is not the only country on Earth with violent or dangerous people. We are not inherently more prone to violence. But we are the only advanced country on Earth that sees this kind of mass violence erupt with this kind of frequency. It doesn't happen in other advanced countries. It's not even close. And as I've said before, somehow, we become numb to it, and we start thinking that this is normal.\nAnd instead of thinking about how to solve the problem, this has become one of our most polarized, partisan debates, despite the fact that there's a general consensus in America about what needs to be done. And that's part of the reason why, on Thursday, I'm going to hold a town hall meeting in Virginia on gun violence. Because my goal here is to bring good people on both sides of this issue together for an open discussion.\nI'm not on the ballot again. I'm not looking to score some points. I think we can disagree without impugning other people's motives or without being disagreeable. We don't need to be talking past one another. But we do have to feel a sense of urgency about it. In Dr. King's words, we need to feel the \"fierce urgency of now.\" Because people are dying. And the constant excuses for inaction no longer do, no longer suffice.\nThat's why we're here today. Not to debate the last mass shooting, but to do something to try to prevent the next one. To prove that the vast majority of Americans, even if our voices aren't always the loudest or most extreme, care enough about a little boy like Daniel to come together and take commonsense steps to save lives and protect more of our children.\nNow, I want to be absolutely clear at the start—I've said this over and over again; this also becomes routine; there is a ritual about this whole thing that I have to do—I believe in the Second Amendment. And it's there written on the paper. It guarantees a right to bear arms. No matter how many times people try to twist my words around, I taught constitutional law, I know a little about this—[applause]—I get it. But I also believe that we can find ways to reduce gun violence consistent with the Second Amendment.\nI mean, think about it. We all believe in the First Amendment, the guarantee of free speech, but we accept that you can't yell \"fire\" in a theater. We understand there are some constraints on our freedom in order to protect innocent people. We cherish our right to privacy, but we accept that you have to go through metal detectors before being allowed to board a plane. It's not because people like doing that, but we understand that that's part of the price of living in a civilized society.\nAnd what's often ignored in this debate is that a majority of gun owners actually agree. A majority of gun owners agree that we can respect the Second Amendment while keeping an irresponsible, law-breaking few from inflicting harm on a massive scale.\nToday, background checks are required at gun stores. If a father wants to teach his daughter how to hunt, he can walk into a gun store, get a background check, purchase his weapon safely and responsibly. This is not seen as an infringement on the Second Amendment. Contrary to the claims of what some gun rights proponents have suggested, this hasn't been the first step in some slippery slope to mass confiscation. Contrary to claims of some Presidential candidates, apparently, before this meeting—[laughter]—this is not a plot to take away everybody's guns. You pass a background check, you purchase a firearm.\nThe problem is, some gun sellers have been operating under a different set of rules. A violent felon can buy the exact same weapon over the Internet with no background check, no questions asked. A recent study found that about 1 in 30 people looking to buy guns on one website had criminal records. One out of 30 had a criminal record. We're talking about individuals convicted of serious crimes: aggravated assault, domestic violence, robbery, illegal gun possession. People with lengthy criminal histories buying deadly weapons all too easily. And this was just one website within the span of a few months. So we've created a system in which dangerous people are allowed to play by a different set of rules than a responsible gun owner who buys his or her gun the right way and subjects themselves to a background check. That doesn't make sense. Everybody should have to abide by the same rules. Most Americans and gun owners agree. And that's what we tried to change 3 years ago, after 26 Americans—including 20 children—were murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary.\nTwo United States Senators, Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia, and Pat Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania, both gun owners, both strong defenders of our Second Amendment rights, both with \"A\" grades from the NRA—that's hard to get—worked together in good faith, consulting with folks like our Vice President, who has been a champion on this for a long time, to write a commonsense, compromise bill that would have required virtually everyone who buys a gun to get a background check. That was it. Pretty commonsense stuff. Ninety percent of Americans supported that idea. Ninety percent of Democrats in the Senate voted for that idea. But it failed because 90 percent of Republicans in the Senate voted against that idea.\nHow did this become such a partisan issue? Republican President George W. Bush once said, \"I believe in background checks at gun shows or anywhere to make sure that guns don't get into the hands of people that shouldn't have them.\" Senator John McCain introduced a bipartisan measure to address the gun show loophole, saying, \"We need this amendment because criminals and terrorists have exploited and are exploiting this very obvious loophole in our gun safety laws.\" Even the NRA used to support expanded background checks. [Laughter] And by the way, most of its members still do. Most Republican voters still do.\nHow did we get here? How did we get to the place where people think requiring a comprehensive background check means taking away people's guns?\nEach time this comes up, we are fed the excuse that commonsense reforms like background checks might not have stopped the last massacre or the one before that or the one before that, so why bother trying. I reject that thinking. We know we can't stop every act of violence, every act of evil in the world. But maybe we could try to stop one act of evil, one act of violence.\nSome of you may recall, at the same time that Sandy Hook happened, a disturbed person in China took a knife and tried to kill—with a knife—a bunch of children in China. But most of them survived because he didn't have access to a powerful weapon. We maybe can't save everybody, but we could save some. Just as we don't prevent all traffic accidents, but we take steps to try to reduce traffic accidents.\nAs Ronald Reagan once said, if mandatory background checks could save more lives, \"it would be well worth making it the law of the land.\" The bill before Congress 3 years ago met that test. Unfortunately, too many Senators failed theirs.\nIn fact, we know that background checks make a difference. After Connecticut passed a law requiring background checks and gun safety courses, gun deaths decreased by 40 percent—40 percent. Meanwhile, since Missouri repealed a law requiring comprehensive background checks and purchase permits, gun deaths have increased to almost 50 percent higher than the national average. One study found, unsurprisingly, that criminals in Missouri now have easier access to guns. And the evidence tells us that in States that require background checks, law-abiding Americans don't find it any harder to purchase guns whatsoever. Their guns have not been confiscated. Their rights have not been infringed.\nAnd that's just the information we have access to. With more research, we could further improve gun safety, just as with more research, we've reduced traffic fatalities enormously over the last 30 years. We do research when cars, food, medicine, even toys harm people so that we make them safer. And you know what? Research, science, those are good things. They work. [Laughter] They do.\nBut think about this. When it comes to an inherently deadly weapon—nobody argues that guns are potentially deadly—weapons that kill tens of thousands of Americans every year, Congress actually voted to make it harder for public health experts to conduct research into gun violence, made it harder to collect data and facts and develop strategies to reduce gun violence. Even after San Bernardino, they've refused to make it harder for terror suspects who can't get on a plane to buy semiautomatic weapons. That's not right. [Laughter] That can't be right.\nSo the gun lobby may be holding Congress hostage right now, but they cannot hold America hostage. We do not have to accept this carnage as the price of freedom.\nNow, I want to be clear. Congress still needs to act. The folks in this room will not rest until Congress does. Because once Congress gets on board with commonsense gun safety measures, we can reduce gun violence a whole lot more. But we also can't wait. Until we have a Congress that's in line with the majority of Americans, there are actions within my legal authority that we can take to help reduce gun violence and save more lives, actions that protect our rights and our kids.\nAfter Sandy Hook, Joe and I worked together with our teams, and we put forward a whole series of executive actions to try to tighten up the existing rules and systems that we had in place. But today we want to take it a step further. So let me outline what we're going to be doing.\nNumber one, anybody in the business of selling firearms must get a license and conduct background checks or be subject to criminal prosecutions. It doesn't matter whether you're doing it over the Internet or at a gun show. It's not where you do it, but what you do.\nWe're also expanding background checks to cover violent criminals who try to buy some of the most dangerous firearms by hiding behind trusts and corporations and various cutouts.\nWe're also taking steps to make the background check system more efficient. Under the guidance of Jim Comey and the FBI and our Deputy Director Tom Brandon at AF—ATF, we're going to hire more folks to process applications faster, and we're going to bring an outdated background check system into the 21st century.\nAnd these steps will actually lead to a smoother process for law-abiding gun owners, a smoother process for responsible gun dealers, a stronger process for protecting the people from—the public from dangerous people. So that's number one.\nNumber two, we're going to do everything we can to ensure the smart and effective enforcement of gun safety laws that are already on the books, which means we're going to add 200 more ATF agents and investigators. We're going to require firearms dealers to report more or lost—more lost or stolen guns on a timely basis. We're working with advocates to protect victims of domestic abuse from gun violence, where too often, people are not getting the protection that they need.\nNumber three, we're going to do more to help those suffering from mental illness get the help that they need. So high-profile mass shootings tend to shine a light on those few mentally unstable people who inflict harm on others. But the truth is, is that nearly two in three gun deaths are from suicides. So a lot of our work is to prevent people from hurting themselves.\nThat's why we made sure that the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare—[laughter]—finally, under—that law made sure that treatment for mental health was covered the same as treatment for any other illness. And that's why we're going to invest $500 million to expand access to treatment across the country.\nIt's also why we're going to ensure that Federal mental health records are submitted to the background check system and remove barriers that prevent States from reporting relevant information. If we can continue to destigmatize mental health issues, get folks proper care, and fill gaps in the background check system, then we can spare more families the pain of losing a loved one to suicide.\nAnd for those in Congress who so often rush to blame mental illness for mass shootings as a way of avoiding action on guns, here's your chance to support these efforts. Put your money where your mouth is.\nNumber four, we're going to boost gun safety technology. Today, many gun injuries and deaths are the result of legal guns that were stolen or misused or discharged accidentally. In 2013 alone, more than 500 people lost their lives to gun accidents, and that includes 30 children younger than 5 years old. Now, in the greatest, most technologically advanced nation on Earth, there is no reason for this. We need to develop new technologies that make guns safer. If we can set it up so you can't unlock your phone unless you've got the right fingerprint, why can't we do the same thing for our guns? If there's an app that can help us find a missing tablet—which happens to me often the older I get—[laughter]—if we can do it for your iPad, there's no reason we can't do it with a stolen gun. If a child can't open a bottle of aspirin, we should make sure that they can't pull a trigger on a gun. Right? So we're going to advance research. We're going to work with the private sector to update firearms technology.\nAnd some gun retailers are already stepping up by refusing to finalize a purchase without a complete background check or by refraining from selling semiautomatic weapons or high-capacity magazines. And I hope that more retailers and more manufacturers join them, because they should care as much as anybody about a product that now kills almost as many Americans as car accidents.\nI make this point because none of us can do this alone. I think Mark made that point earlier. All of us should be able to work together to find a balance that declares the rest of our rights are also important. Second Amendment rights are important, but there are other rights that we care about as well. And we have to be able to balance them. Because our right to worship freely and safely, that right was denied to Christians in Charleston, South Carolina. And that was denied Jews in Kansas City. And that was denied Muslims in Chapel Hill and Sikhs in Oak Creek. They had rights too.\nOur right to peaceful assembly, that right was robbed from moviegoers in Aurora and Lafayette. Our unalienable right to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness, those rights were stripped from college students in Blacksburg and Santa Barbara and from high schoolers at Columbine and from first-graders in Newtown. First-graders. And from every family who never imagined that their loved one would be taken from our lives by a bullet from a gun.\nEvery time I think about those kids, it gets me mad. And by the way, it happens on the streets of Chicago every day.\nSo all of us need to demand a Congress brave enough to stand up to the gun lobby's lies. All of us need to stand up and protect its citizens. All of us need to demand Governors and legislatures and businesses do their part to make our communities safer. We need the wide majority of responsible gun owners who grieve with us every time this happens and feel like your views are not being properly represented to join with us to demand something better. And we need voters who want safer gun laws, and who are disappointed in leaders who stand in their way, to remember come election time.\nI mean, some of this is just simple math. Yes, the gun lobby is loud and it is organized in defense of making it effortless for guns to be available for anybody, any time. Well, you know what, the rest of us, you—we all have to be just as passionate. We have to be just as organized in defense of our kids. This is not that complicated. The reason Congress blocks laws is because they want to win elections. And if you make it hard for them to win an election if they block those laws, they'll change course, I promise you.\nAnd yes, it will be hard, and it won't happen overnight. It won't happen during this Congress. It won't happen during my Presidency. But a lot of things don't happen overnight. A woman's right to vote didn't happen overnight. The liberation of African Americans didn't happen overnight. LGBT rights, that was decades' worth of work. So just because it's hard, that's no excuse not to try.\nAnd if you ever have any doubt as to why you should feel that \"fierce urgency of now,\" think about what happened 3 weeks ago. Zaevion Dobson was a sophomore at Fulton High School in Knoxville, Tennessee. He played football; beloved by his classmates and his teachers. His own mayor called him one of their city's success stories. The week before Christmas, he headed to a friend's house to play video games. He wasn't in the wrong place at the wrong time. He hadn't made a bad decision. He was exactly where any other kid would be. Your kid. My kids. And then, gunmen started firing. And Zaevion—who was in high school, hadn't even gotten started in life—dove on top of three girls to shield them from the bullets. And he was shot in the head. And the girls were spared. And he gave his life to save theirs, an act of heroism a lot bigger than anything we should ever expect from a 15-year-old. \"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\"\nWe are not asked to do what Zaevion Dobson did. We're not asked to have shoulders that big, a heart that strong, reactions that quick. I'm not asking people to have that same level of courage or sacrifice or love. But if we love our kids and care about their prospects, and if we love this country and care about its future, then we can find the courage to vote. We can find the courage to get mobilized and organized. We can find the courage to cut through all the noise and do what a sensible country would do.\nThat's what we're doing today. And tomorrow, we should do more. And we should do more the day after that. And if we do, we'll leave behind a nation that's stronger than the one we inherited and worthy of the sacrifice of a young man like Zaevion.\nThank you very much, everybody. God bless you. Thank you. God bless America.", "timestamp": "2016-01-05", "title": "Remarks on Gun Violence"}

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111383", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:20 P.M. EST\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. I apologize for the delay. There's a lot going on today, as you've seen. Before we go to your questions, there is some news I did want to discuss proactively that all of you have been covering closely.\nThere's a lot of good news about the American auto industry in today's papers. And the early analysis indicates that the American auto industry has just completed a record year, and that is a pretty stark turnaround. Those of you who have covered the administration from the beginning will recall the rather dark future that was facing the American auto industry in late 2008 and early 2009. But since then, there has been a remarkable turnaround. And one way to illustrate that I think is to actually look at some of the reporting that has been done by outlets represented in this room and, in some cases, journalists who are represented in this room.\nSo let's start in January of 2009 -- I think we have some graphics here. The New York Times, in January of 2009, had a headline that said, \"Markets Declined as Auto Sales Plummet.\" But earlier this week, they reported that \"Auto Industry Sales Explode In An Ever-Changing Market.\"\nThe next slide has a Reuters report that notes that \"U.S. 2009 auto sales is at a 27-year low.\" But yesterday, Reuters reported that auto sales in 2015 set a record after a strong December.\nThe next slide is USA Today -- it covered extensively that in January of 2009 they noted that in 2008 auto sales dropped by 3 million. But then yesterday, they noted that auto sales had soared to a record high by increasing 9 percent year over year.\nThere were newsprint outlets who were noting this. CBS News had also reported that U.S. auto sales fell 18 percent in 2008, but yesterday, they noted, as others did, that auto sales cruised to a new high in 2015.\nLast, but certainly not least is The Washington Post. They noted in January 2009 that \"U.S. auto sales fell 36 percent in December.\" But they reported yesterday -- I believe it was in today's paper -- that U.S. auto sales hit a record high in 2015.\nSo it's been a pretty stark turnaround. And in many ways, the auto industry is the best way to illustrate how strongly the U.S. economy has come back since the depths of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.\nNow, a key part of this was a decision that the President made in his first couple of months in office to bail out the American auto industry. This is something of which the American public was deeply skeptical. Before the President officially took office in December of 2008, there was a CNN poll, Jim, that showed that 61 percent of those surveyed opposed government assistance for major U.S. automakers. A Gallup poll from a similar time period found that 51 percent, a very slim majority of Americans, opposed the federal government giving major financial assistance to the Big Three U.S. auto companies. That same question was opposed by 65 percent of Republicans.\nIn March of 2009, about the same time that the President was announcing his plan to bring the auto industry back, a poll found that 63 percent of Americans said extending loans to General Motors and Chrysler to help the automakers stay in business was the wrong thing for the government to do. As you'll recall, that actually was the strategy that was implemented by the Obama administration. And since mid-2009, after the strategy was implemented, the U.S. auto industry has added 640,000 new jobs, the strongest growth on record for that industry over that period of time.\nNow, let's be honest about the fact that none of this would have been possible without the grit and determination and innovation of American autoworkers and the workers in industries that are critical to the success of the American auto industry. But what's also true is that because of the policy decisions that were made by this administration to place a bet on those workers, America has won, and our economy has been better for it.\nAnd I think all of this is an apt illustration of what the job of being the U.S. President actually is; that when you're President of the United States, you're faced with weighty choices with significant consequences, and there will be a tendency, understandably so, to be worried about the next poll that's going to come out or the next news cycle, and to be conscious of how likely you are to be sharply criticized for the decision that you make in the immediate aftermath of that decision. But the best Americans Presidents ensure the strength of this country by looking beyond the next news cycle or the next poll, or even the next election, and focusing on the long term. And I don't think there's a clearer case study of that approach to presidential leadership than the kinds of decisions that President Obama made early in 2009, and the results of those decisions that we're seeing here in early 2016.\nSo with that long windup, I'm happy to take additional questions about the success of the American auto industry, or anything else that may be on your mind. I think it's possible I may have exhausted any questions that you may have about this topic. (Laughter.) But I think that is merely an endorsement of my opening statement. So either way, I win -- I think. (Laughter.)\nBut, Josh, go ahead.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I want to turn to North Korea.\nMR. EARNEST: I thought you might. (Laughter.) I don't know much about the North Korean auto industry. I suspect it's not doing very well.\nQ: Has the U.S. determined whether there was a nuclear test, what kind of a test it was, and whether it was successful?\nMR. EARNEST: Josh, this is a serious subject. The initial analysis that's been conducted of the events that were reported overnight is not consistent with North Korean claims of a successful hydrogen bomb test. There is nothing that's occurred in the last 24 hours that has caused the United States government to change our assessment of North Korea's technical and military capabilities.\nNow, I hasten to add that we're continuing the work necessary to learn more about the nuclear test that North Korea conducted last night. But you've probably seen by now the extensive independent analysis that's been done in the United States and in other countries that includes significant and understandable skepticism of the claims of the North Korean regime.\nSo we're obviously going to continue to look at this by monitoring the situation, assessing the available data and evidence. But the initial analysis is not consistent with the claims that the regime has made of a successful hydrogen bomb test.\nQ: So, at this point, can you rule out that it was an H-bomb? Or just, so far, you haven't seen that --\nMR. EARNEST: Based on this initial analysis that has been completed, the initial analysis indicates that the initial analysis is not consistent with the North Korean claims of a successful hydrogen bomb test.\nQ: Regardless of what this was, it was clearly a provocative act. And, Josh, every time that North Korea does something like that and we all have this response about what we're going to do about it, there seems to be some lack of confidence that the options that we have available to us through the U.N., such as sanctions, are really up to the job of stopping North Korea from going down this path. We slap some new sanctions on them, and they basically ignore it and keep doing what they're doing. Is the White House confident that the new sanctions that you're calling for today at the Security Council, for example, are capable of securing your goal of preventing North Korea from becoming a nuclear state?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Josh, you're right to point out that any kind of nuclear test like the one that North Korea conducted last night is provocative and a flagrant violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions -- not just one, but any number of them. And based on reports of that nuclear test, both the United States and Japan called an emergency United Nations Security Council meeting. That meeting did recently conclude, and the result of that meeting was that additional measures against North Korea would be considered for the violation of their international obligations.\nWhat is true is that North Korea continues to be one of the most isolated nations in the world. And their isolation has only deepened as they have sought to engage in increasingly provocative acts. These include not just nuclear tests, but some of the ballistic missile tests that have attracted some attention over the years, as well. What the United States has succeeded in doing under the leadership of President Obama is not just further isolating the North Koreans, but also cementing the international unanimity of opinion that North Korea needs to end these provocations, needs to commit to a denuclearized Korean Peninsula, and demonstrate a commitment to some peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.\nAnd it is notable that it's not just our stalwart allies in the Asia Pacific, like South Korea and Japan, who are voicing their disapproval of these North Korean actions, it's also notable that our collective statements are echoed by countries like China and Russia, with whom we don't always agree. So we've already seen quite strong statements from those countries that echo the sentiments that I have just relayed to you. And I think that is an indication that the interest of the United States can be successfully advanced through principled, focused, tenacious, diplomatic engagement. And that's what we're going to continue to pursue.\nQ: If sanctions and diplomacy don't work, is military option on the table if North Korea continues to march towards a nuclear weapon?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Josh, the thing that I should reiterate at this point is the rock-solid commitment on the part of the United States to the safety and security of our allies in South Korea. That commitment also extends to the safety and security of our allies in Japan. And we have demonstrated our significant investment in that security relationship, and there's no doubting the strength of that commitment.\nBut, at this point, what we want the North Koreans to do -- and when I say \"we,\" I don't just mean the United States, I mean our allies and our partners in the Six-Party Talks -- is we want the North Koreans to end their provocative acts both in the form of missile tests and nuclear tests, to commit to denuclearization, and to demonstrate a commitment to pursuing peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. We're not asking them to do that out of charity. We actually also believe that that would be in the interest of the North Korean people and certainly the broader region. And that was the goal of the Six-Party Talks. And we would like the North Koreans to begin to orient their public posture and their behavior in the direction of constructive international engagement.\nQ: And one other topic, I wanted to ask you about an internal timeline from the State Department on the political transition for Syria that was obtained by the AP. And maybe you can't talk about the document itself, which lays out March 17th as -- I'm sorry -- March 2017 as the best-case scenario for when President Assad would relinquish his office. But I'm wondering if it's fair at this point to say that the White House does not envision a scenario where President Assad leaves office prior to the time that the President does.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Josh, I think we've been quite clear in our view that Bashar al-Assad has lost the legitimacy to lead the country of Syria. And we don't just say that out of our moral objection to the way he has violently attacked his own people. I say that as an observation about his inability to lead a country where most of the citizens have been victims of his violence. It would just be impossible for somebody who had that much blood on their hands to succeed in uniting and governing that country successfully.\nSo it's not just that we find his actions morally repugnant, it's just, as a practical matter, he won't be able to lead that country and unify it in a way that we can bring it into the political chaos, that we can begin to address the significant security situation inside of Syria that has allowed a terrorist organization like ISIL to gain a foothold, we can begin to address the root causes of the millions of people that have fled their homes inside of Syria.\nThere are a lot of problems, and they all trace back to Bashar al-Assad. And it's not possible to envision a scenario in which he could succeed, even just as a practical matter, in leading that country. And that's why we have always envisioned a political transition that includes Bashar al-Assad leaving power, and the Syrian people having some say over the future of their country. The Syrian people shouldn't be in a position where they have to choose between a dictator and a brutal terrorist organization running their country.\nQ: My question is really about the timing. Do you see any chance for that happening before this presidency is over?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I certainly wouldn't set a timeline for it. There's an ongoing process that is being painstakingly negotiated right now. This is a process that's being led by the U.N. But we wouldn't have made as much progress as we have thus far without the leadership of Secretary Kerry in his efforts to bring the international community together to be engage in these talks.\nThe United States is obviously invested in seeing these political and diplomatic discussions make some progress. But I would -- given all the starts and stops that we have seen as this political transition process has been pursued, I'd be reluctant to make any public predictions about when certain mile posts will be reached.\nAyesha.\nQ: Going back to North Korea, has the U.S. deployed equipment that would detect a vapor that would tell us about the nature of the nuclear test, an authenticity of North Korea's claims? Or do you plan -- or does the U.S. plan on launching such equipment?\nMR. EARNEST: Ayesha, I don't have a lot of details to share with you. I can tell you that the United States will be collecting additional evidence and conducting an additional analysis to learn more about the nuclear test that North Korea conducted last night. We'll obviously be working closely with our allies and partners in the region who have their own capabilities that can be brought to this collection and analysis of data. And as we have more analysis to share, we'll try to do that.\nQ: And can you talk a bit about what -- as the United States and U.N. are considering additional options in light of this action by North Korea, what could be done as far as sanctions? You talked about earlier how the country is already isolated, already very poor. What actions -- what additional sanctions could actually be taken? And then also, could you talk a bit about -- it seems that China would have to play a major role in enforcing any sanctions against North Korea for them to really take effect. So can you talk a bit -- has the U.S. reached out to China on that issue? What would the U.S. like to see China do in response to the action from North Korea?\nMR. EARNEST: Both of these are very good questions. Let me start with the first one, which is the United Nations Security Council right now is taking a look at what additional steps can be taken, what additional measures can be deployed to further isolate the North Koreans as a result of their provocative acts.\nYou're right, North Korea is a country whose citizens are enduring extreme poverty and extreme isolation from the international community. All of that is a result of the failed leadership of the North Korean regime. And the international community is united in insisting that the North Korean regime needs to end their provocative acts, end the missile tests, end the nuclear tests, and actually commit to a process of pursuing peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. Then we could start to see North Korea emerge as a constructive participant in the international community.\nWe obviously would welcome that development. It would be good for the nation of North Korea. It would be even better for the people of North Korea. There also would be obvious benefits for the broader region of Northeast Asia. And that's obviously the direction that we're headed.\nThere's no denying the significant role that China will play in all of this. The subject of North Korea and their repeated violations of their international obligations is something that the President discusses with his counterpart just about every time they get on the phone or meet in person. And this is something that the two leaders discussed when President Xi was at the White House this past fall, and there was an agreement out of that meeting that neither the United States, nor China will accept North Korea as a nuclear-weapons state.\nAgain, that is a testament to how unified the international community is on this issue. There are plenty of things on which the United States and China disagree, and all of you have spent some time talking about those disagreements when President Xi was in Washington. But this is an issue on which we do agree, and that agreement is significant because of the important role that China plays as a neighbor of North Korea.\nI would anticipate that -- there already have been conversations between U.S. officials and Chinese officials. I can tell you that the President's National Security Advisor, Susan Rice, recently completed a conversation with the Chinese ambassador to the United States to discuss this very issue.\nQ: Today?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, when I say \"just finished,\" I mean shortly before I walked out here.\nQ: And this was --\nMR. EARNEST: This is Susan Rice, the President's National Security Advisor, and the Chinese ambassador to the United States.\nJim.\nQ: You mentioned that the United States and other allies, meaning China and Russia, are condemning what happened in North Korea and that additional sanctions may come down the road. What good, though, does that do when it comes to North Korea? This is already the most isolated regime in the world. It's already facing crippling sanctions. What more can you do to North Korea?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Jim, I think what we can do is basically make clear to them that there is only one path out of the extreme poverty and isolation that they currently face. And it's not a path that is advanced by pursuing nuclear weapons; it is actually a path that they can follow by ending their provocative acts, ending the missile tests, ending the nuclear tests, and demonstrating some sort of commitment to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. That is the path that North Korea has to escape the poverty and isolation that has led millions of North Koreans to suffer needlessly.\nQ: And Hillary Clinton put out a statement a little while ago saying that the Chinese need to be tougher. Does the White House agree with that? Do the Chinese need to be tougher with North Korea?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Jim, I can tell you that the United States is committed to working closely with the international community, including the Chinese, who obviously have significant influence here, to try to address the situation and to make it clear to the North Koreans what their options are, and to describe to them the situation that I just described.\nQ: Do they have a more constructive role, would you say?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we certainly are going to be talking with China about what role we believe they can play. But, look, Jim, the Chinese were definitive. President Xi was definitive when he visited with President Obama here at the White House last fall that China will not accept North Korea as a nuclear weapons state. That obviously is the position of the United States. And we're going to work together as the world's two largest economies, two of the more influential nations in the world, and we're going to work together to accomplish that goal.\nThe fact that we'll also be working with our allies in South Korea and our allies in Japan -- there aren't also a lot of things that Japan, South Korea, and China agree on, but yet this is one of them. So there is a lot of -- there's unanimity of opinion here about what North Korea needs to do.\nQ: And earlier today, Speaker Ryan described the executive actions that were laid out by the President yesterday as a distraction. What did you make of that? I guess the Speaker is trying to say that what you announced yesterday won't really amount to much and that this is an attempt to distract the country from problems in the country right now.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there are a lot of different ways I guess I could --\nQ: Pretty heartfelt statement that was made by the President yesterday and the Speaker comes out and says, well, it was a distraction.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes. Well, I guess you probably would have to ask the Speaker what he was talking about. I think the President -- again, I think as was evident from his comments yesterday, does believe the fact that 30,000 Americans are killed by guns every year that this is a significant problem and that there are some common-sense things that can be done to prevent gun violence. And the President is determined to take action where he can. And that's what the President announced yesterday.\nOne of those common-sense steps is closing the gun show loophole, something that, in 2013, Speaker Ryan described as \"obvious and very reasonable.\" But I did note that in his news conference today, he said \"there isn't a loophole.\" So, as confusing as his declaration about a distraction is, it's a quite alarming reversal of opinion for him to say that the gun show loopholes are a reasonable issue and it's \"obvious that it should be addressed,\" and now three years later, he's denying that it even exists.\nSo I guess there are a lot of questions that are raised by Mr. Ryan's comments today.\nQ: And has the President met with Speaker Ryan yet, personally, since he became Speaker?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know that they've had any face-to-face conversations. I can tell you that --\nQ: It doesn't sound like the relationship is off to a very good start. You've been hammering the Republicans pretty consistently, and then the Speaker comes out today and makes this comment today. It doesn't sound like the relationship is off to a promising start.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Jim, I think the legislative success that we saw at the end of last year I think is a testament to the ability of the President and the Speaker to work together to try to find common ground in some areas. The budget agreement was obviously significant. We feel good about the results of that process. It certainly was a compromise process, but it was one that was important nonetheless.\nWe've seen significant reform of the \"No Child Left Behind\" law enacted. We've seen the Ex-Im Bank reauthorized. We've seen reforms to the IMF that the President has sought for five or six years now finally be approved by the Congress. To say nothing of the transportation bill that Democrats and Republicans have long sought. All of that has happened since Speaker Ryan took office. And I do think that is an indication that there is an actual ability of the two leaders to work together.\nBut there is no denying that there are significant differences on a range of policy issues and certainly a commitment to reducing gun violence would be one of them. But Speaker Ryan, at the same time, has noted a couple of things. We need to do more to enforce gun laws and we need to expand access to mental health care to address this problem. We agree. And there will be an opportunity for Speaker Ryan to actually do what he says. And hopefully he will when it comes to those issues.\nMara.\nQ: Just one question about guns. A lot has been made out of the fact that many of these recent mass shooters got their guns legally, passed background checks. And one of the things that would certainly decrease the number of victims is a ban on assault weapons. And the President hasn't really talked about that recently. I know it couldn't get anywhere in Congress, but I'm wondering why he doesn't talk about that anymore.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what the President has been focused on lately are actions that he can take using his own executive authority. And it is not possible, using only his executive authority, for the President to reinstate the assault weapons ban, but it surely is something that the President supports. Over the last couple of weeks -- or the last month or so, that's a position of the President's that I've repeated a couple of times, and it certainly is a position that the President continues to believe would make the country safer. But there continues to be entrenched opposition in Congress to reinstating that ban.\nI will note -- I don't think I have it in front of me, but as I recall, former President George W. Bush, when he was running for President, noted his support for reinstating the assault weapons ban.\nSo, again, you're right, we don't talk about it as much, but it's a position that didn't previously attract a whole lot of controversy, at least if it's a position that was held by the conservative Republican President and his progressive Democratic successor.\nQ: Is the point of tomorrow's town hall meeting for the President to focus on the executive actions he's described this week, or to talk about gun violence in a much broader way?\nMR. EARNEST: The goal of the town hall meeting is for the President to engage with both people who support his position on gun safety, but also to have a conversation with those who don't agree with some of the President's positions on these issues.\nAnd, look, the President has often said that we can disagree without being disagreeable. And when it comes to protecting our constitutional rights and protecting our kids, surely we should be able to find some common ground even if we don't agree on all the particulars. And the President is hopeful that he can have an enlightening discussion.\nAnd I'm confident that there will be an opportunity for the President to discuss the executive actions that he announced yesterday that we do believe will make our communities safer. But I'm also confident that it will spark a broader conversation about additional steps that state and localities can undertake to make their communities safer about how gun manufacturers and gun dealers and gun store owners could assume greater responsibility for their actions. And I'm confident that there will be a discussion of the politics of this issue, too. After all, we do see this as a very good example of how political dysfunction on Capitol Hill has serious consequences for the safety and security of communities and kids all across the country.\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, Happy New Year.\nMR. EARNEST: Happy New Year, nice to see you.\nQ: Nice to see you. Can you give us any detail on how the President was informed, when he was informed about this test, and whether it was Ambassador Rice and if in this phone call with the Chinese ambassador, if she requested a conversation between President Xi and President Obama?\nMR. EARNEST: I can tell you that the President has been briefed a couple of times on this issue. I don't have the timing of the mechanisms to relay to you for how that occurred. But the President has been thoroughly briefed on this as recently as this morning.\nI can tell you that before the end of the day, the President is hoping that he'll have the opportunity to speak on the phone both with Prime Minister Abe and President Park of South Korea. We're still working to schedule those calls -- it's obviously the middle of the night over there. But if those calls are completed, we'll be sure to let you know.\nObviously, consulting with our allies in the region and reiterating our steadfast commitment to their security is a priority at this time, and that's something that the President will do personally as conversations with those two leaders. I know that there have been a number of U.S. officials that have been in touch with their counterparts just in the last 18 hours or so. I know that Secretary Kerry has communicated with both his Japanese and Korean counterparts. I know that Secretary Carter has been in touch with his South Korean counterpart as well. Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken will be traveling to the region next week, I believe, to discuss these issues with our partners in the region.\nSo there is some -- there's a lot of engagement and discussion of these issues that are ongoing. I think all of it underscores what I was describing earlier, though, which is that the international community is united in our belief that Iran -- that the North Koreans need to end their provocative actions and commit to denuclearizing the Korean peninsula.\nQ: Did Ambassador Rice speak to the Chinese ambassador in person or on the phone? Was he summoned here?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know if he was summoned here, but he was here in person to speak with Ambassador Rice today.\nQ: And then more broadly -- you threw Iran in there.\nMR. EARNEST: I know, I'm sorry.\nQ: No, no, I think it's actually a good pivot because we've heard so much from this administration -- (laughter) -- I didn't mean the pun on that one, either -- you've heard so much from the administration on direct engagement, the need to speak directly to Iran is the best way to denuclearize that state or prevent it from becoming a nuclear state. Why not the same with North Korea? Because your critics love the talking point that Dennis Rodman is the American who's spent the most time with Kim Jong-un. Why with this administration -- direct engagement not a choice?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess there are a variety of reasons for that. Each country is different, and so our approach to each country is going to be a little bit different. What's true about the North Koreans is that they -- well, they essentially acquired nuclear weapons under the previous administration, and so the President inherited a situation where he was already dealing with a nuclear-armed North Korea.\nThe situation with the Iranians was different. And what is true now about the Iranians is that they have begun to take steps in a verifiable way to confirm that they don't have a nuclear weapon and will not acquire one. So there was a significant development in the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action over the holidays where the Iranians announced that they had shipped 25,000 pounds of enriched uranium out of their country, consistent with the obligations under the international agreement to prevent them from obtaining a nuclear weapon. That's a significant step.\nThe North Koreans already had nuclear weapons when the President took office. What we have also seen on the part of the North Koreans is an apparent willingness to accept international isolation. In our dealings with the Iranians, the President had -- well, obviously, we're dealing with a much bigger country, a much bigger and more developed economy, and an economy with much greater and deeper economic ties all around the world. That's why it was much harder, again, as a practical matter, to build an international coalition to isolate the Iranians.\nAnd it was painstaking work. And Secretary Clinton has, rightly, taken some credit for some of her work in this regard in flying around the world to convince other partners of the United States to help us enforce the sanctions that were in place against Iran. And by applying that pressure to Iran, we gave them an incentive -- because they had a desire to reengage with the world -- they now had an incentive to start to live up to their international obligations and to verify for the international community that they had not acquired a nuclear weapon.\nSo those are just two differences. But I do think that they underscore why a different approach was required and, ultimately, why a different approach -- an approach with Iran is on the track to success.\nQ: But you just also talked about, in the case of North Korea, that they've accepted international isolation. So adding on more sanctions only feeds into that same problem. Outsourcing it to China, some would say, in terms of reining them in, hasn't prevented this type of testing. Is it the view of this administration that the capabilities of North Korea so far just make it a nuisance -- a bad actor, but not a threat -- to the national security of the U.S.?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I will say that we take the provocations and these violations of their international obligations quite seriously. We do have the expectation that the North Koreans will live up to U.N. Security Council resolutions and international obligations that the rest of the international community abides by.\nQ: Even though they don't?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, but the expectation of the United States and the international community is that they should. And I mean, it's notable that North Korea is the only country that over the last 15 years has conducted a nuclear test. So that's an indication that there is value to protecting the international unanimity of opinion as we pressure the North Koreans. But, yes, ultimately the North Koreans will have to decide for themselves exactly how they want to reengage with the international community. And the international community has made clear that the only way they can do that is to end their provocative acts and commit to a denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.\nQ: But at this point, it sounds like you're saying a new approach is not needed, even though the President has spent a lot of time talking about prioritizing denuclearization and a lot of time talking about refocusing on Asia. But the policy so far has not led to the kind of reengagement and taking these actions that you're calling for. So are you doubling down on that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm suggesting that the fact that we see these provocative acts from the North Koreans is an indication that we aren't getting the results that we'd like to see yet. But we do continue to have a steadfast commitment to the security of our allies in South Korea. We have a steadfast commitment to the national security of our allies in Japan. And we're concerned about the destabilizing impact that North Korea's provocative acts have on the broader region.\nThe Chinese and the Russians are concerned about that, too. And that's why we're working hard to keep the international community together and to make it clear to North Korea that there's only one path back that will be good for the North Korean people, be good for the North Korean economy, be good for the country of North Korea in terms of their ability to engage with the international community.\nMargaret.\nQ: I got a couple. Just some cleanup on North Korea. Shockingly, the Republican presidential candidates have held up the latest test as evidence that President Obama has a weak foreign policy that invited North Korea to do this. Generally weak -- weak because you didn't immediately sanction Iran after the most recent thing; and that it's also Hillary Clinton's fault because she was Secretary of State at the time. So I just wanted to give you an opportunity to respond. Do you think there's any merit to any of that? Or if not, why do you think Republicans are saying that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think they're saying that because they're trying to win votes from conservative Republicans in the presidential primary. That's the way our process works, and they're certainly entitled to do that. But we've heard a lot of campaign rhetoric but not a lot of specific, tangible suggestions about what should be done differently. And I think that is not unique in the context of an election. But that's why the President is focused on confronting this challenge by making our national security interests the top priority. My guess is that the priority of some of the candidates is right now focused on their presidential ambitions.\nQ: Also, I wanted to ask you whether the President is -- what the President's reaction is to the fact that questions are now being raised by some of Ted Cruz's -- well, by one of Ted Cruz's opponents about the nature of his birthplace and whether that qualifies him to run for President, and whether he in any way enjoys watching that play out?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know if he does, but I sure do. (Laughter.) Look, it would be quite ironic if after seven or eight years of drama around the President's birth certificate, if Republican primary voters were to choose Senator Cruz as their nominee -- somebody who actually wasn't born in the United States and only 18 months ago renounced his Canadian citizenship.\nQ: Do you think he's a legitimate candidate? Are you questioning his -- okay. (Laughter.) And then perhaps this is a question better posed for Hillary Clinton given her love of burrito bowl, but I wanted to ask you whether the White House is following the situation with Chipotle, whether you have any national health concerns about the -- as of yet, not completely understood -- the nature of the E. coli outbreak, whether you have any reaction to that at all.\nMR. EARNEST: I've seen some of those reports, but for a detailed reaction, why don't I have somebody else follow up with you?\nLet me also clarify, Margaret, one thing that you and I just discussed. North Korea is the only country in the last 15 years to test a nuclear device. I think I said nuclear test earlier, so just trying to be precise here.\nMary.\nQ: A question about the timing of all of this. Did the administration have any indication that this test was happening, or was this a surprise?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it was not a surprise, and I think the best way I think I can describe that to you is that about a month or so ago I was asked, based on public reports about North Korea's intentions, about whether or not we believed they had a hydrogen bomb. And so I expressed some skepticism of their claims at the time. I think that's a pretty clear indication not just to us but to all of you and to the public of what they were up to.\nQ: But specifically, this day, this precise timing, not just that they were working on -- the timing of this you knew was coming?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I would say that based on -- I can tell you that the United States government was not surprised.\nDave.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. You made a reference to the town hall meeting coming up tomorrow night and that the President wants to have a conversation about guns with those that don't agree with him. Can you flesh that out a little bit? Are you expecting that to take place tomorrow night at this town hall meeting at a campus in Northern Virginia?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we'll have a little bit more detail about the event tomorrow. But the audience will include not just people who agree with the President, but also some people who have views that differ from his on this issue. And our expectation is that when the President takes questions from the audience, that people with different kinds of views will be given the opportunity to ask a question. Obviously the journalist at CNN will decide exactly who attends and who gets called on. But my expectation is that they think that that kind of discussion would be more interesting and more fruitful. And that's certainly what we're hoping for.\nQ: Is the White House exerting less control over this event and who attends than typically in the past?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'll just say that it's CNN that will be -- we've consulted with CNN about who will be in the audience, but ultimately it's CNN who is making the call about who will participate. And I think that's actually typical of most of our events, that the general public is generally invited when the President is on the road and some of the people who attend will be specifically invited by the White House, but it certainly is not uncommon for the general public to be invited.\nMax.\nQ: On the gun orders, considering the President signed more than two dozen following Sandy Hook, how come the ones announced yesterday, it took three years for them to be developed and they didn't come out before?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Max, the process that the administration undertook to review the law and carefully consider what sort of authority the President could exercise under existing law was painstaking. And there was a lot of work done to determine how far the President could do based on the authority that he's given by the law. And the emphasis was on the kinds of actions that would actually address the problem that we've identified, which is that it's too easy for criminals to get their hands on guns. And then the question is, what is it that the President has within his authority to do about it? And there's a lot of work involved that was carried out by lawyers at the Department of Justice and in close consultation with White House officials, as well, as you'd expect. And that's what resulted in the announcement you saw yesterday.\nQ: And what further guidance has the White House given the state of Connecticut's Governor when it comes to his attempt at banning people on a no-fly list from purchasing guns in the state?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Max, we obviously believe this is a pretty common-sense proposal. If the government has determined that it's too dangerous for you to board an airplane, then it should be too dangerous for you to buy a gun. And we believe that Congress should actually pass a law, a national law that would prevent those who are on the no-fly list from being able to buy a gun.\nQ: So you think that would be a power best for Congress, not necessarily the state of Connecticut?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the state of Connecticut has obviously been quite aggressive in taking the kinds of common-sense steps that we believe should be implemented all across the country. I don't have an update for you in terms of conversations that have taken place between the administration and Governor Malloy's office on this issue, but we obviously believe that this is a common-sense proposal that the United States should pass and should go into effect all across the country. The good news is that there are -- there's at least one Republican presidential candidate who agrees that this is a good idea. So there's no reason that this has to be a partisan thing. But again, it would not be the first time that the Republican-dominated Congress has blocked a common-sense proposal that has bipartisan support.\nAndrew.\nQ: I want to go back to North Korea. Now that it seems very likely that North Korea has conducted three nuclear tests during the Obama administration, in retrospect, do you think that the administration's policy was the correct one?\nMR. EARNEST: Andrew, I think it is true that we have not achieved our goal, but we have succeeded in making North Korea more isolated than ever before, and the international community more united than ever before about the fact that North Korea needs to bring a halt to their nuclear activities. The North Koreans have flagrantly violated their international obligations, including a variety of United Nations Security Council resolutions.\nAnd, you're right, it's not the first time that they have done that. But there continues to be strong international unanimity of opinion about the correct approach here and about the steps that North Korea can take to reengage with the international community. And ultimately, the North Koreans will have to decide when they're ready to begin taking those steps. Right now, they apparently are under the misimpression, the wrong impression that there is a path to integrating into the international community that can be pursued by developing nuclear weapons. They're just wrong about that.\nAnd the United States is not the only country to say that they're wrong about that. China, Russia, South Korea, Japan all agree. And what we seek is a North Korea that is prepared to renounce their nuclear intentions, abide by their international obligations, and actually pursue the kind of peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula that would actually benefit the North Korean people.\nQ: While you wait for North Korea to try and change their calculus, it seems like there's a cycle developing. North Korea tests something, there are more sanctions; they test again, there are more sanctions, all the while, it develops more and more dangerous technology. I mean, where is the red line? Is it attacking South Korea? Is it developing a hydrogen bomb? Is it miniaturizing that bomb, putting it on a warhead and pointing it at the U.S.? I mean, where is the line?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there is no denying the U.S. commitment to protecting the national security of our allies in South Korea. There are thousands of U.S. military personnel on the Korean Peninsula right now who can testify to that fact. And what I can say is that we continue to be confident in our ability to protect the United States from the threat that's emanating from North Korea. And we do believe that resolving this situation would resolve a lot of the instability in Northeast Asia right now. And that would be a good thing for our allies and partners in Asia.\nKevin.\nQ: Josh, Happy New Year.\nMR. EARNEST: Same to you.\nQ: I wanted to follow up on something Margaret was asking, and that is, is the broader strategy vis-а-vis North Korea working, given that since 2009 there's been no conversation? Is it working, would you say, or not working?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we have not yet seen the kinds of results that we would like to see. But what we have succeeded in doing is making North Korea more isolated than ever before, and the international community more united than ever before; that North Koreans need to end their provocative acts, give up their nuclear program, and actually commit to a process that will bring greater peace and stability to the Korean Peninsula.\nQ: Is it your view that the President bears some responsibility for this, based on the fact that they haven't been talking to North Korea, the Six-Party Talks haven't been moving forward? Is there any responsibility from this perspective, the U.S., given the fact that actors like Assad and Putin and Un and even Iran continue to sort of poke their finger in the chest of the United States?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't think that's the situation that we see. What we have succeeded in doing is actually ensuring that Iran will not be able to develop a nuclear weapon.\nBashar al-Assad is in a situation where his country has been torn apart by his own failed leadership. And, yes, the international community is sitting down thanks to the leadership of the United States to plot the political transition that will result in him leaving power. Again, that is somebody whose failed leadership has caused a lot of problems not just for the rest of the world, but for himself as well.\nWhen it comes to North Korea, that is a country that is enduring extreme poverty and extreme isolation. Meanwhile, the rest of the international community stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the United States as we seek to resolve that situation. I think that is an indication of successful presidential leadership even if we haven't at this point accomplished our ultimate goal of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.\nQ: Can you understand how some critics would argue that because this hasn't been a very robust engagement by the United States, that actors like Putin in Crimea, for example, and Assad and even Un are kind of running wild right now in absence of American strong leadership?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I don't think you can \"run wild\" if you are more isolated than any other world leader. And we certainly are concerned about the destabilizing impact that North Korea's provocative actions are having on Northeastern Asia. And we certainly are concerned about the impact that that could have on the north -- on the national security situation of our close allies like Japan and South Korea. But what is clear is that as the international community continues to work together to confront the situation, the national security interests of the United States are enhanced and our interests are advanced.\nQ: You mentioned Iran earlier, and I'm wondering if there's a bit of sleight of hand there from the Iranians' perspective -- meaning they're trying to, on the one hand, work with the international community to have sanctions relief, but on the other hand, it's been widely reported that they've been working with the North Koreans, perhaps even using them as a proxy to continue development of their own nuclear ambition. Does the White House understand that view?\nMR. EARNEST: I can't speak to the veracity of those claims. Obviously both Iran and North Korea have been subjected to significant sanctions and significant international efforts to prevent them from developing nuclear weapons, and that certainly has had an impact on the ability of both those countries to get access to materials and technology that could advance their efforts.\nQ: Just so I'm clear, are you saying that the White House doesn't believe that Tehran and Pyongyang are working together in concert in nuclear development, like -- even in this particular test?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm just saying that I can't confirm the veracity of those kinds of claims. But I can suggest that there -- because of the leadership of the United States and other international institutions like the United Nations, there are significant barriers to those two countries doing exactly what you described.\nQ: Last one. Trey Gowdy said his committee has dates on the calendar to interview Mr. Rhodes and Ms. Rice. At this point, they have not said that they would refuse, although Gowdy is willing to issue a subpoena. And I guess the obvious would be, would Rice and Rhodes be willing to testify without the necessity of a subpoena?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't seen that announcement from Mr. Gowdy's committee, but we'll take a look at it and get back to you.\nQ: Thank you.\nMR. EARNEST: Byron.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Can I ask specifically about the President's options regarding North Korea? The White House statement overnight said the U.S. would respond appropriately. Can you talk a little bit about what that might mean? Will he use provisions in the executive order that he signed after the Sony hack? Will they be relisted as a state sponsor of terror? What are some of the actions that the United States might take?\nMR. EARNEST: Byron, at this point I'm not prepared to sort of list the potential actions that the United States and the international community could take in light of North Korea's nuclear test. But we certainly will consider a wide range of options to appropriately respond to this particular situation. That was the subject of the discussion at the United Nations just this morning at an emergency United Nations Security Council meeting that the United States and Japan convened.\nSo this is something that we take quite seriously. But I don't have specific potential responses to itemize for you at this point.\nQ: Doesn't this test show that for all the time the President has invested in Asia, what you've termed the \"pivot,\" that it's failed to result in any sort of changes to North Korean behavior?\nMR. EARNEST: We haven't seen the kinds of changes in North Korean behavior that we would like to see. But I do think the President's investment in Asia is at least in part responsible for the unanimity of opinion we see among the Chinese, the South Koreans and the Japanese for confronting this situation. It's notable that those three countries that don't often agree on much do all agree on the appropriate approach here.\nIt's also notable that the Chinese government has confirmed that they agree with the United States that the international community will not accept North Korea as a nuclear-weapons state. That is a result of this administration's efforts to continue to strengthen our ability to work with China on those areas where we can find common ground -- and North Korea is certainly one of them. And our efforts to resolve this situation will certainly be enhanced based on that common ground.\nQ: Related to China, does the U.S. need to put more pressure on China to get involved in this situation? Has the President prioritized economic issues in climate change in its relationship with China rather than dealing with the North Korean security situation?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Byron, whenever the President sits down to talk to his counterpart -- and whether that was President Hu or President Xi over the last year, year and a half -- the agenda has been filled with lots of items. When you're talking about these two large countries and two large economies, you'd expect that there would be a lot on the agenda. And surely, when they do sit down to talk, they spend a lot of time talking about the economy and climate change and cybersecurity, maritime security and other high-priority issues -- that includes human rights -- that the North Korean issue is one that also comes up.\nThe Chinese are, understandably, concerned about provocative actions from the North Koreans. Again, instability in Northeast Asia, and on the Korean Peninsula, in particular, has significant consequences for China because they share a border with North Korea. So they're rightly concerned and invested in their own right in trying to resolve the situation. And we certainly are pleased that we've been able to find some common ground around an approach that will apply significant pressure to the North Koreans.\nBut, look, as you point out and as I've acknowledged here on a number of occasions, our ultimate goal here has not yet been achieved.\nChris.\nQ: If I can just follow up on Byron's question about the statement from the NSC overnight that there would be an appropriate response to any and all provocations. Even if you're not willing to enumerate what some of the things might be that are on that list, is this something that requires a response beyond what's already out there? In other words, not just doubling down on more of the same.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, at this point, I wouldn't -- that's a difficult question to answer. Presumably, if there's something like that out there, it's not something we would want to announce in advance. If there were a new type of financial sanction that we're prepared to implement, for example, that's something that we would want to do without announcing it in advance.\nSo let me just say that I'm confident that the President and his national security team will think broadly about the most appropriate way to respond, but also we're going to want to do so in a way that preserves the kind of unanimity of opinion across the world that we see right now. That strengthens our hand in dealing with the North Koreans. And we want to make sure that we're preserving international unity even as we consider a range of steps that we believe will advance the interests of the United States.\nQ: When you said this is an initial assessment -- how confident is the White House this was not a hydrogen bomb?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I can't give you a detailed assessment at this point because it's only an initial analysis that has been completed. This, after all, is an event that just occurred 18 hours or so ago. But that initial analysis is not consistent with the claims that were made by the North Koreans that they had successfully conducted a test of a hydrogen bomb.\nWe have determined that they conducted a nuclear test last night. That's based largely on seismic data but also based on information that was collected by our allies and partners in the region. We are certainly interested in examining and analyzing more evidence and more data to see if we can get greater clarity about what exactly did happen.\nQ: Is anybody else going to be in the meeting with Secretary Kerry and the President?\nMR. EARNEST: When they meet today?\nQ: Yes.\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know the answer to that, but we'll keep you posted.\nQ: Let me just ask you quickly about the announcement yesterday on the executive orders. Even some critics who, frankly, support broader regulation of guns have said that part of the problem is that, one, there's no clear indication of how many more background checks will be conducted, and that the ATF is not, frankly, set up to deal with sort of more work, that 200 agents who are being proposed are barely enough to keep up with attrition, that it's already an agency that's understaffed. It's been behind many other agencies and doesn't even have a permanent director. So even if you work from the assumption that what the White House hopes will happen will happen, which many people are skeptical of, are the ATF and the FBI prepared to deal with it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me answer that in two ways. The first is, one of the proposals that the President has put forward is to invest in actually making the background check system more efficient and more effective. Right now, the background check system is run on technology that is a decade or two old. Obviously tremendous advances have been made in information technology that could --\nQ: How long would it take to bring it up to speed?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we've got some really good people working on it, and our record of making these kinds of improvements is a good one. So obviously it will be a priority and something that they are working on. So by deploying some better technology we can certainly address some of the concerns that you have just raised. By making the system more efficient we can more quickly get results and get more reliable results that can be used to make sure we're keeping guns out of the wrong hands.\nBut, look, we've also asked for more resources to hire additional agents to conduct additional investigations. And again, the refrain from Republicans is that we don't need any new laws, we just need to better enforce the laws that we have. I can't think of a better way of doing that than clarifying the law by issuing some legal guidance and making clear exactly what the law is, which is what the President did in the course of the executive actions, and backing that up by hiring more agents to go out and actually enforce that law.\nAnd again, that's why it is hard to take seriously the kind of criticism and objection that has been raised by Republicans. It's just not serious. But it is rooted in politics. And the President has talked at some length about how this issue, I think, as well as any other, is a good illustration of the political dysfunction and the broken politics on Capitol Hill.\nLet me just say one other thing about the numbers. One reason that it is hard for us to point to a lot of data on this issue is that Republicans supported legislation that actually prevents the collection of data. That's how outrageous this whole situation is. Republicans like to say, well, there's no data out there to support these claims, and yet it's Republicans themselves that have specifically prohibited the CDC and others from actually collecting that data in the first place and allowing analysis to be done that would target it.\nSo, again, it certainly raises some questions about those claims. But there is a lot of anecdotal evidence. And there is one website that has been viewed that is advertising the sale of about 80,000 guns. And the question is whether or not that website and all those transactions would be subject to a background check. And that's what we're seeking to clarify and that's what we're seeking to enforce. And if there are people who are out there selling guns for profit and right now hiding behind the hobbyist exemption that currently exists, they should know that they're running a significant risk, that the penalty associated with violating the statute that has now been clarified is significant. If you're found in violation of the statute, you can be punished with up to five years in jail and subject to a fine of up to $250,000.\nSo this is something that is quite serious. And I think that understanding the stakes and understanding that there are serious consequences for not complying with the law I think will prompt a substantial number of people to take the necessary steps to make sure that they are complying with the law, and as a result, making sure that their customers are going through background checks. And if we can make that background check system more effective, we can actually do a better job of keeping guns out of the wrong hands, which is a common-sense goal and certainly one that the President is determined to make progress on.\nQ: So if this is the priority that you and the President have indicated it is, what level of priority is it to get a permanent director into the ATF?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we've talked before, and I guess we'll talk again, about the sordid record that Republicans have of confirming highly qualified Obama administration nominees to important positions.\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there certainly -- if there were, I would not have any confidence that that individual would be treated fairly by Republicans in the Senate. There are plenty of nominees right now who are not appointed to controversial jobs like leading the ATF that are being treated very poorly by Republicans, some of which have significant national security consequences for the United States.\nQ: Will there be a nomination?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any personnel announcements to make at this point. I wouldn't rule it out, necessarily.\nGardiner.\nQ: Josh, just one quick question. The President has apparently appointed a new CENTCOM commander -- the former Special Operations boss, Joe Votel. To what extent does this signal a different or a new approach in the military campaigns in places like Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan that you now have a Special Operations guy in charge of the military operations in all of those areas?\nMR. EARNEST: Gardiner, I've seen some reports speculating about potential personnel announcements that may be made, but I'm not in a position to confirm it. I'll just say, in general, that we're talked about the important role that our Special Operations personnel are playing in our ongoing efforts to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. And the President did announce the deployment of some Special Operations personnel into Syria to be a force multiplier with some opposition forces that are working with our coalition to fight ISIL and we've also seen the establishment of these expeditionary task forces that could carry out raids and pursue other priorities that are identified by the administration, and obviously there are Special Operations personnel that are involved in that effort as well.\nSo any personnel announcements notwithstanding, the observation that you have made about the important role that our Special Operations personnel are playing in the counter-ISIL campaign is certainly warranted.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, on North Korea, what are the agencies that make the determination about what type of nuclear device was detonated?\nMR. EARNEST: The intelligence community obviously draws on significant scientific resources and their relationships in the region to offer an assessment like this. I don't know exactly when they'll have a more robust assessment that they'll be able to share, but the intelligence community will obviously be working closely on this, based on the scientific expertise that they can bring to the situation.\nQ: And on Congress, when you talk about disagreeing without being disagreeable, isn't it being disagreeable when you accuse Congress of political dysfunction?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, even Speaker Ryan himself acknowledged that Congress not passing legislation to close the background check loophole -- he described that in his statement as a legislative failure. I think a legislative --\nQ: He meant by you.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't know. It didn't say the President's legislative failure. (Laughter.) I mean, I don't know. The President doesn't serve in the Congress, he doesn't serve it the legislature. I think he was describing a legislative failure on the part of Congress. It's a legislative failure that he obviously sought to advance.\nBut, look, I think acknowledging that there is political dysfunction on Capitol Hill I think is obvious and is an opinion that is shared by Democrats and Republicans who work on Capitol Hill themselves. I'm also confident that that is an opinion that is shared by the up to 80 percent of Americans, both Democrats and Republicans, who say that they have an unfavorable view of Congress. So I don't intend it to be disagreeable; I intend it to be a statement of fact.\nQ: Now, you and President Obama have both criticized Congress for defying popular opinion on background checks. And yet, at the start of the briefing you trumpeted how the President defied popular opinion on the auto bailout. Is there a disconnect there?\nMR. EARNEST: I think when I cite polls talking about the strong support for the common-sense steps that the President announced yesterday, I'm not suggesting that Congress should take these steps because they're popular; I'm suggesting that Congress can't use as an excuse to oppose those steps the suggestion that somehow what the President is doing is controversial or something that a whole bunch of Republicans don't support. So that's the point that I'm trying to make by citing the poll there.\nQ: Not having it both ways?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't think so. I'm sure my critics won't agree.\nQ: He doesn't think so. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Gregory, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thanks. The Secretary of Defense is ordering a review of medals, decorations and awards granted to soldiers -- servicemen and women since 9/11, with the idea of reexamining whether some of those servicemen and women should be awarded the Medal of Honor. The feeling is that perhaps in the warzone of Iraq and Afghanistan, too many valorous deeds have been overlooked and that too many of those medals, where they have been awarded, have been awarded posthumously. Does the President share those concerns and would he like to see more Medal of Honor ceremonies in the East Room?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of that specific announcement by the Secretary of Defense, so I want to be cautious about what I do say, based on what you have asked, primarily because the process for awarding a Medal of Honor goes through a rigorous chain-of-command process that the President eventually signed off on. So I don't want to say something from here that could influence that process at a stage before it reaches the President's desk. But let me just say, in general, that the President has, on a number of occasions over the last seven years, had the great honor of presenting that medal to servicemembers who have undertaken significant acts of bravery while serving our country in Iraq and Afghanistan. And the President himself has spoken rather movingly about the contributions of the 9/11 generation of military personnel to our national security.\nAnd there's no denying that that generation of Americans has made a substantial commitment to our national security and, in some cases, paid a substantial sacrifice. Some of the medals that the President has awarded have been posthumous. Some of the medals that the President awarded to a servicemember, even those who are living when they receive the medal, had families back home who endured their loved one being in a warzone for months or years at a time. And that's an indication that this generation of Americans has borne a significant burden in protecting our country since 9/11.\nAnd we certainly have -- the President himself has raised concerns about the wisdom of the decision that was made by the previous administration to go to war in Iraq. But that does not in any way diminish the President's deep appreciation, respect, and even honor for those who have served our country in Iraq and Afghanistan since 9/11.\nBut I will see if there is more that we can get you, Gregory, from here on that particular review process.\nThanks a lot, guys. We'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 2:39 P.M. EST", "timestamp": "2016-01-06", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}

Courts already have ample authority under the existing rules governing class actions to screen out frivolous and baseless lawsuits. H.R. 1927 would expand upon the existing rules by requiring the plaintiffs in a class action to demonstrate that each member of the proposed class suffered the same type and scope of injury. This new requirement would narrow the availability of class actions, potentially dissuading plaintiffs from pursuing meritorious claims, including under important civil rights, privacy and consumer protection laws, and denying them access to justice. Moreover, there is already an established process for amending the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which is the more appropriate vehicle for ventilating and potentially adopting the proposed revision of Rule 23 standards regarding class actions.\nIn addition, based on the false assertion that there is endemic fraud in the asbestos trust system, H.R. 1927 would impose mandatory reporting and disclosure requirements that would release into the public domain asbestos victims' names, exposure histories, and other sensitive information. This disclosure would threaten their privacy, make them more vulnerable to identity thieves and other predators, and potentially disadvantage them in many ways unrelated to asbestos exposure, including in their efforts to obtain employment, credit, and insurance.\nIf the President were presented with H.R. 1927, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.", "timestamp": "2016-01-06", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 1927 - Fairness in Class Action Litigation and Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency Act of 2015"}

Cruz first introduced the five-year phase out in 2014.\nCruz publicly called for the phase out at the Iowa Ag summit last March: \"But Cruz, who has called for phasing out the RFS program over five years, said Americans are fed up with \"career politicians\" who pander to voters, especially in places like Iowa, with its outsized role in the presidential nominating process.\"\nCruz reiterated this strategy in an interview with RFD-TV last September: \"And so I've introduced legislation to phase out the mandate, not to drop it out immediately, but phase it out over five years, in part to recognize, as you pointed, the investment-back expectations and to give some time in terms of changing the rules. \"\nFurther, Cruz has always said government shouldn't pick winners or losers. Which means government shouldn't be handing out subsides or creating mandates to or for favored industries, but they also shouldn't create barriers that prevent industries from having access to and expanding their markets.\nTo that end, he would instruct the Justice Department to vigorously enforce antitrust laws and he would eliminate the EPA's regulations that impose a hard wall against the general sale of mid-level ethanol blends, such as E25 (25% ethanol, 75% gasoline). This opens up entire new markets for ethanol. Indeed, his argument is that ethanol manufacturers would more likely be better off without government interference than with the mandates and regulations.

Many go undiagnosed for years, and services that would vastly improve their lives are unaffordable for most families.\nThat's why Hillary just announced a broad plan to help people of all ages and their families who are impacted by autism.\nHere's what it will do:\n1. Launch a national early screening campaign\nDiagnosis is the first step in helping people with autism. Yet, studies show that in many children, especially girls and African American and Latino children, early signs of autism go overlooked for months or even years. Hillary's plan will boost early screening rates so that kids can get diagnosed and receive the services that will make a difference in their lives.\n2.?Ensure health insurance coverage for autism services\nWhen autism services aren't covered by insurance, many families can't afford them. The Affordable Care Act has gone a long way to help those with autism get the support they need—by making it illegal for insurance companies to deny coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, ending lifetime dollar limits on benefits, and allowing young adults to remain on their parents' coverage until the age of 26.\n3. Invest in research to deepen our understanding of autism\nWe need to invest in more research to better understand autism, create better diagnostic tools, and improve treatments and services for people on the autism spectrum. Hillary will significantly increase funding for autism-related research and call for the first-ever study of the prevalence of adult autism.\n4. Increase employment opportunities for those with autism\nPeople with autism are unemployed at a much higher rate: More than half of youth with autism are not getting a job or pursuing higher education in the two years after they graduate high school. Hillary's plan will work to close the employment gap by launching a new Autism Works Initiative that will include a post-graduation transition plan for every student with autism, along with a public-private partnership to connect people with autism to employment opportunities.\nHillary is the only candidate with a?comprehensive plan?to support Americans with autism.

So in 2016, this country faces a choice: Let Republicans take their assault on reproductive health and rights all the way to the White House, or fight back.The reality is, Republican presidential candidates don't just have bad records—they're tripping over themselves to brag about who will do more damage to women's health if they get elected. We have to make sure they don't get the chance.Here are a few of the reasons why a Republican president would be very, very bad news for women:\nPlanned Parenthood\nIt's not just Republicans in Congress. Every single Republican presidential candidate has vowed to defund Planned Parenthood, which would cut off millions of patients' access to life-saving preventive care, including cancer screenings, well-woman exams, STI and HIV tests, and more.\nToday's vote proves that it's never been more critical to have a president who stands with Planned Parenthood. You won't find that person in the Republican field.\nSafe and legal abortion\nLast year alone, Republicans in Congress voted numerous times to chip away at women's reproductive rights. And Republican presidential candidates are on the same mission: Every single one of them supports efforts to restrict women's access to safe and legal abortion, and some even oppose abortion in cases of rape, incest, or to protect a woman's health.\nIn other words: If Congress sends a bill restricting women's reproductive rights to a Republican president, you can bet he or she will sign it—and with as many as four Supreme Court seats opening up within the next president's term in office, the right to safe and legal abortion itself could hang in the balance.\nAccess to birth control?\nAll of the Republican presidential candidates have pledged to repeal the Affordable Care Act—which makes birth control and preventive care available at no out-of-pocket cost.\nTo make matters worse, many of the Republican candidates for president applauded the Supreme Court's recent Hobby Lobby decision, which lets bosses impose their personal beliefs on their employees' birth control options. Instead of protecting and expanding access to birth control the way President Obama has done, a Republican president would put it back out of reach for millions of women.\nThe Affordable Care Act\nRepublican candidates have made it crystal clear: Each one of them, if elected, will waste no time in tearing up the Affordable Care Act, kicking 18 million Americans off their health care plans, and ripping away all the progress we've made. That means taking us back to the days when insurers could charge women more than men for the exact same health coverage. It means going back to insurers denying women coverage because of \"pre-existing conditions\" like breast cancer, pregnancy, or domestic violence (seriously). And it means forcing women to go back to paying hundreds of dollars a year for basic health care, like cancer screenings and birth control.\nIt's 2016, and Republican candidates still think they have the right to interfere in decisions that should be made by women in consultation with their doctors.", "timestamp": "2016-01-06", "title": "Press Release - 4 Reasons a Republican President Would Be a Nightmare For Women's Health"}

Obviously the nation of China wields more influence over the North Korean regime than probably any other country in the world. And we certainly want to work closely with them to determine an appropriate response.\nAgain, what I think is notable is that we have seen some unanimity of opinion across the international community about how what North Korea has done is provocative and a flagrant violation of their international obligations and certainly of a variety of U.N. Security Council resolutions.\nQ: So if sanctions haven't worked in the past to deter their behavior, what makes you think they will work in the future?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we do know that the international community remains united -- frankly, more united than ever before -- on this issue and on the appropriate approach to dealing with North Korean provocations. As a result, the North Korean regime is more isolated than ever before. And it makes clear to the North Koreans that they have only one path to choose to try to deal with the extreme poverty and extreme isolation that causes millions of their citizens to suffer. And that path is one that includes them ceasing their provocative activities. That includes ceasing missile tests and ending nuclear tests like this one. It also means committing to denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and pursing peace and stability on the Peninsula. That is the path for the North Koreans. It's the only path out. And the international community, even as we consider additional options to further isolate them, I think that will be the best way for us to reinforce that message.\nQ: What is the White House's view -- what, in the White House's view, did Republicans accomplish by forcing the President to veto a repeal of the Affordable Care Act?\nMR. EARNEST: Nothing. They've voted 60 times to repeal the Affordable Care Act. This is the first time that it has reached the President's desk. But it has no impact. And we've heard Republican presidential candidates on the campaign trail talk about how ineffectual the Republican Congress has been. In this case, they're right. And I think there is no clear illustration of the ineffectual Republican leadership in Congress than this.\nQ: And finally, the NRA says it won't participate in tonight's gun talk, calling it a public relations spectacle orchestrated by the White House. Do you care to respond to that description? And is the President disappointed the NRA won't be there? Will it detract from the event?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, just to set the record straight, and with all due respect to Mr. Acosta and his colleagues, it's actually hosted by CNN. The President's desire is to engage in a serious conversation, both with people who share his views about common-sense steps we can take to make our community safer and keep guns out of the wrong hands, but also have a conversation with those who disagree. And we certainly are looking forward to having the opportunity to engage in that discussion with people who are interested in participating in it.\nJeff.\nQ: Josh, the President has repeatedly pressed Chinese leaders about their currency policy. So what is the White House's reaction today to Beijing's decision to let the yuan fall?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Jeff, obviously this is something that is closely monitored by the Treasury Department. And the case that we have made to the Chinese has centered on the responsibilities that come with being one of the world's largest economies, particularly an economy like theirs that is growing rather rapidly and is quite dynamic in terms of the kind of innovation that exists inside their economy.\nWhat our approach has been, has been to press China on the pace of its reforms, including additional measures for an orderly transition to a market-oriented exchange rate that responds to upward as well as downward market pressure. And that essentially is the core of our policy and it is the case that we have made to the Chinese that implementing those kinds of reforms at a reasonable pace is good for the broader international economy but also will have long-term benefits for the Chinese economy as well.\nAnd so we're obviously going to continue to monitor the situation and continue to stay in close touch with Chinese economic officials, particularly in the face of the kind of volatility that's been on display over the last few days.\nQ: And there is volatility as a result of it, but would you say that what they're doing is consistent with what you've been asking? Are you welcoming the move today?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, for that kind of analysis, I'd refer you to the Treasury Department. They obviously are the ones who are watching this most closely. I also think the other thing that we would be reluctant to do is to make a judgment about their adherence to these kinds of reforms based on just one action or one day's activity in the market. What we're looking at is a longer-term commitment to pursuing these kinds of reforms.\nThere's an acknowledgement on the part of the United States and I think the broader international community that the kinds of reforms that we seek include a longer-term commitment to implementing reforms, but also are the kinds of reforms that we wouldn't expect them to just implement overnight. That wouldn't promote the kind of economic policymaking that we believe would be responsible and in the best interest of the global economy.\nSo there's an understanding that over the long term, that it will take time to implement the reforms that we would like to see. But that's consistent with the other thing that we would like to see, which is an actual commitment to following through on implementing the reforms.\nQ: Are you concerned about the reaction in the stock market?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I do my best not to comment on the day-to-day actions in the markets. But obviously we're aware of the kind of volatility that we've seen in China over the last several days, and that has had an impact on markets in other countries, including ours. So that's certainly something that we're closely watching.\nQ: All right. Just one other topic. South Korea says it's in talks with the U.S. to display -- to deploy, rather, U.S. strategic weapons on the Korean Peninsula. Can you tell us what kind of weapons you're talking about?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me say a couple things about that. The first is, we have been quite consistent in making clear that any sort of U.S. capability, military capability that is deployed to the Korean Peninsula is arrayed solely against the threat that is posed by the North Koreans, and I think is a testament -- it certainly is a testament to our commitment to the national security of our allies in South Korea.\nAt this point, there have been no discussions or consultations with the South Koreans about the deployment of what's called a THAAD battery. This is essentially a defensive and anti-ballistic missile capability. But there are a variety of anti-ballistic missile capabilities that we have over the last several years been ramping up in the Asia Pacific region to protect the United States in response to the threat emanating from North Korea. And that includes the deployment of additional resources to Alaska. It includes additional naval resources in the Pacific Ocean, including an Aegis ballistic missile defense ship. It also includes radar systems that have been deployed, two of them in Japan, that can be used to effectively counter the ballistic missile program that North Korea seeks to develop and that could threaten the United States.\nSo this is something that we've been mindful of for quite some time, and we've taken a number of steps over the years to prepare for any eventualities. And the steps that we have taken to support the national security of South Korea are focused on the threat that emanates from North Korea.\nQ: So when they say that they're in talks with the U.S., which set of those options that you just addressed are they talking about?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have a lot of insight to share with you in terms of our private consultations with the South Koreans. I'll just reiterate at this point that we continue to be resolute in our commitment to the national security of our allies in the Republic of Korea.\nJim.\nQ: So getting back to the town hall this evening, is the President looking forward to engaging with people with opposing views? And what is he going to say to a gun rights supporter who thinks that the President wants to take away their guns?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President, frankly, is looking forward to talking to people on both sides of this issue. And presumably, Mr. Cooper will give him that opportunity this evening. I think you'll obviously be able to hear directly from the President about this later tonight. But particularly for somebody who makes -- who repeats that false claim, I think the President will repeat once again his belief in and commitment to the Second Amendment to the Constitution, and that the constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans are worth protecting, including the constitutional rights that are guaranteed by the Second Amendment to the Constitution.\nQ: And so what do you make of when Ted Cruz sends out an email to his supporters that says Obama wants your guns? A pretty sinister-looking portrayal of the President.\nMR. EARNEST: I think he's appealing to people's anxieties and insecurities and even outright fears in an attempt to win votes for his presidential campaign. And that's unfortunate. In some cases, it veers into the territory of being irresponsible. But, ultimately, that's clearly what he's up to. He's not the only one, but he certainly is one of them.\nQ: Why has this built up over the years so much, do you think? And do you think that the President has responded forcefully enough over the years to counter this narrative that's out there? I mean, there are a lot of gun rights supporters who just think that this is the way it is, this is reality.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think part of it, Jim, is that we know this is -- there's a profit motive on the part of the industry to try to convince their customers that the government wants to take away their guns or will somehow limit their ability to buy guns -- because you guys have all documented the fact that every time they say that, it works. People go out and buy record numbers of guns. So this has a whole lot more to do with a profit motive than it does anybody's constitutional rights.\nQ: And a totally different subject. There are thousands of Cuban migrants in Central America who appear to be on the verge of getting on a Costa Rican plane, if I'm not mistaken, that will take them to the Mexican-El Salvadoran border, where those Cuban migrants are hoping to travel to the U.S. border for refugee status. I guess, first of all, is the administration monitoring this? What does the administration plan to do when they get there? And with the opening of relations between the U.S. and Cuba, is there any chance that this refugee status issue might change, that the administration may try to adjust that status before the President leaves office?\nMR. EARNEST: Jim, we are aware of the reports that you're citing. I can tell you that some of the discussions that you referred to about the movement of these individuals is not something that the United States has been a part of, and we're certainly not a part of efforts to facilitate the movement or arrival of Cuban migrants into the United States.\nI will just say, as a policy matter, that there are no plans to change the policy that goes back to the Cuban Adjustment Act that was passed in the mid-1960s. The goal of that bill was to provide Cubans a safe, orderly and legal means to migrate to the United States, and there are no plans at this point to make any changes to that policy.\nQ: And so what will happen to those migrants when they get to the border?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, they'll be -- again --\nQ: They could cross the border, presumably, and say, I'd like to apply for refugee status, and --\nMR. EARNEST: Presumably, they could attempt to do that. There is a migratory framework in place for processing Cuban migrants that arrive on American soil. And again, that process is unique to Cuban migrants because of the unique political situation in their home country. And there's a longstanding policy in place that guides this processing, and there are no plans at this point to change that policy.\nToluse.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. In Libya, there was a truck bomb that killed several dozen policemen. I'm wondering if the White House has a reaction to that or to the idea that Islamic State is stepping up its actions in Libya.\nMR. EARNEST: Toluse, at this point we have not made an assessment about who precisely is responsible for carrying out this cowardly act of terrorism. It is apparent that this attack killed as many as 65 people at a training center in Libya.\nObviously, we send our condolences to the victims and families of those who were killed. And those condolences are rightly directed to all the people of Libya who were affected by this act of terrorism.\nThe United States continues to be deeply concerned about ISIL-inspired terrorists carrying out acts of violence, particularly in Libya. And that is why you've seen the United States take aggressive action, including inside of Libya, to take out ISIL leaders. It was only four or six weeks ago that DOD confirmed -- the Department of Defense -- the United States Department of Defense confirmed that the leading ISIL figure in Libya had been killed. So we're certainly mindful of the threat in that country and are taking aggressive steps to mitigate it.\nQ: Is there a chance that we'll see more airstrikes in Libya, more actions by the United States military in Libya? Or is that something that you're leaving to the Europeans to take the lead on?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously we do have a coalition to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. And we do have partners who are involved in that coalition that have significant capabilities, including resources and knowledge inside of Libya. And we certainly will work closely with them. But I would not take off the table additional military action against ISIL targets in Libya.\nQ: Another topic, on Keystone. TransCanada did basically try to appeal the decision of the President to deny the Keystone Pipeline. I'm wondering if you have a reaction to both the idea that they decided to appeal it and the idea that they're using NAFTA on this trade agreement as a way to try to respond and react to the President's action.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it not so much an appeal as really a lawsuit in a couple of different venues. So because of the pending litigation, I'm obviously limited in what I can say.\nI'll just say something you've heard me say before, which is that after extensive public outreach and consultation, the State Department decided that the Keystone XL Pipeline would not be in the interest of the United States. And the President agreed that building the Keystone Pipeline would not serve the national interests of the United States. And that's why we continue to be confident that the administration acted lawfully. But obviously there will be a court proceeding, and for additional questions about that I'd refer you to the Department of Justice.\nWhen it comes to the ISDS claim, again, I continue to be limited in what I can say because of that ongoing process. I'll just say that we are confident that the decision that was made vis-а-vis the Keystone Pipeline is entirely consistent with all of our international obligations, including our obligations under NAFTA. The one thing I'll point out about ISDS is it's a process that -- ISDS is this dispute resolution process that's been in place for 50 years, and the United States has never lost a case. And we certainly feel confident in the arguments that we'll be able to make in this case before the ISDS, as well.\nQ: And how do you respond to people who are opposed to the TPP agreement using this as an example of saying this is how corporations can use the ISDS, which is also in the TPP, to undermine U.S. laws outside of the U.S. court system?\nMR. EARNEST: Well I would say, first of all, that we've never lost a case. I think that is an indication that we have not seen corporations be able to use it effectively to change or alter U.S. law. But because we've never lost a case, it is an indication that we've been quite effective in taking other countries and raising concerns about other countries' practices at the ISDS in a way that has benefitted the ability of American businesses to do business overseas.\nSo our strong record in that venue actually, I think, is a strong argument for precisely why Congress should approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Do you have the latest numbers on the detainees at Gitmo right now that you can share? And do you anticipate any more movement of detainees in the week or month ahead?\nMR. EARNEST: This is a relevant question. You're asking about the reports yesterday that two additional Gitmo detainees were transferred, this time to the nation of Ghana. That means the totals now -- the total population as of today is 105 detainees at the prison at Guantanamo Bay; 46 of those have been approved for transfer. And I wouldn't rule out additional transfers in the near term.\nQ: So those are -- the 46 we're speaking of, Congress has been notified of their ability to be transferred, is that correct?\nMR. EARNEST: No, not quite. Those 46 are actually -- have been through this process the President established during his first year in office whereby you would essentially have national security experts reviewing their case files and determining which detainees are essentially under the right circumstances, could be safely transferred from the prison at Guantanamo Bay. Essentially, that we could put them in other places, in other countries where we could put in place steps that would mitigate the risk that they would pose to the United States.\nQ: Then there's that 30-day clock.\nMR. EARNEST: Correct. So these 46 are essentially the group of individuals that have been cleared for transfer, but now we have to go to other countries and determine what other countries, under the circumstances that we lay out, are willing to take them. Once we secure an agreement with another country, that's when we notify Congress. So I don't have any news to make at this point about any impending transfers, but I just wouldn't rule out the notion that there are some additional ones.\nQ: What goes into the conversation with the government, say, in Accra or other governments?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we --\nQ: Like, do you pay them? Do you say we can set this up so that they can be housed? How does that work?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, typically we ask them to assist us in accomplishing what we believe is a national security goal and makes certainly the United States and our partners and allies safer, and what we often describe as what they can do to help; that there may be certain individuals who could be good candidates for a transfer to a particular portion of the world. And we discuss with them and we work together with them on putting in place the kinds of security arrangements that would be necessary to mitigate any sort of ongoing risk that these individuals could pose to the United States after being transferred from the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\nObviously there's a pretty rigorous certification process that has to be carefully considered by the Secretary of Defense, who has to personally certify that the safeguards that have been put in place do sufficiently mitigate the risks that these individuals could pose to the United States. And that, essentially, is the kind of conversation we have. I think you can imagine why those kinds of conversations are not easy and requires some skilled diplomacy to make it happen.\nQ: A couple more. I want to ask you about California. Has there been a request for assistance in the wake of the severe flooding and mudslides there?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any specific request that has come from the state government of California. Obviously we're monitoring the weather conditions on the West Coast. And if there are any requests like that that come, we'll obviously look at them carefully but also try to respond promptly. It obviously is state officials who are responsible for the response, but the federal government stands ready and pre-deploys assets so that they can quickly support the ongoing local efforts if that kind of support is necessary.\nQ: I haven't had a chance to ask you about Oregon. Do you have an update on what's happening out west there? I know it's complicated. I recognize that there's been this sort of impulse to just let that play out with local law enforcement and federal assistance. What's the latest you can share on that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the FBI is now in the lead of that situation, and they treat this quite seriously and they are working closely with local law enforcement to try to resolve the situation peacefully and hopefully as quickly as possible. As I noted earlier this week, I've been a little reluctant to spend a whole lot of time talking about the case, both because it's an ongoing law enforcement matter, but also because of the sort of political overtones of that situation I wouldn't want to say anything from here that would make it more difficult to resolve that situation quickly and peacefully.\nQ: But you can understand why some people feel like there may be a double standard in how that particular group is being treated compared to others.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I see that some people have made those claims. I can tell you that local law enforcement and certainly federal law enforcement take the enforcement of the law quite seriously. And this is a situation that they take quite seriously, and I know that this is something that is being worked closely -- in close coordination with local law enforcement out in Oregon.\nQ: Last one, on North Korea. Is it your sense that, given what they've been doing lately and consistently, that this will hasten the pivot, if you will, or the attention on Asia, the focus on Asia? Or do you feel like it's already been there and this is just part and parcel to what you expect?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, part of the Asia rebalance that you've seen the administration prioritize since the early years of the Obama presidency has been focused not just on defending the U.S. from threats like those that emanate from North Korea. And certainly some of the steps that I announced about the increased military deployments to the Asia Pacific, some of the work that we have engaged in with Japan and our other allies there to put in place infrastructure that would actually protect the national security of the United States, that is certainly part of the Asia rebalance policy that we have prioritized here. But a lot of that policy is actually oriented toward capitalizing on opportunities that exist in the Asia Pacific for the American people.\nAnd that's why we often describe the Trans-Pacific Partnership as the centerpiece of our Asia rebalance, because what that does effectively do is it creates significant opportunities for American businesses and American workers, and ultimately American middle-class families if we can start to level the playing field between U.S. businesses and the fast-growing economies of the Asia Pacific. And we can raise standards in terms of labor standards and environmental standards that their competitors in Asia have to adhere to. That's going to level the playing field. And we're confident that if we can level the playing field, that American businesses and American workers aren't just going to compete in those kinds of environments, they're going to -- more often than not, they're going to end up winning. And that's going to be good for our broader economy.\nAnd look, countries in the Asia Pacific also recognize that a closer economic relationship with the United States is good for them. It means that the middle-class populations in their countries also will have access to the kinds of U.S. goods that are typically sold around the world. So we see a lot of countries in the Asia Pacific that are interested in strengthening those economic ties that they have with the United States.\nSo this is an opportunity for the United States to advance our interests and to do so in a way that has important economic benefits for middle-class families back here in the United States.\nQ: So no concerns about what's happening with the Chinese economy and what's going on with North Korea more broadly in the region?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I would actually make the case that the best way for the U.S. economy to weather some of the volatility that we see in the international economy is actually to strengthen our relationship, our economic relationship, with those countries that do have a fast-growing economy. When you start to see volatility in places like China, having access to other fast-growing markets in the world becomes even more important.\nAnd I think, if anything, this strengthens the case that we regularly make to Congress that they should act quickly to ratify the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement. Now, we're still in the process of giving people an opportunity to look at the details of the agreement. I'm not suggesting that Congress should fast-forward through that process and vote today. But I am suggesting that we should move expeditiously through this process and that Congress should not wait until the end of the year or even next year to approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement. If anything, to do that would only allow -- would be a significant opportunity lost.\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, can you give us any update on whether there are plans for President Obama to speak with President Xi either about the economy and the markets or North Korea?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any plans in the near term for President Obama to consult with President Xi. I certainly wouldn't rule out any additional conversations. But we'll keep you posted as they occur. I do know that Secretary Kerry, if he hasn't already, will be in touch with his counterpart with whom he regularly consults.\nQ: And has the President -- you mentioned sanctions were an option here when it comes to North Korea. Were you indicating that perhaps the President has ordered the Treasury or ordered others in the U.S. government to begin preparing unilateral U.S. sanctions?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't think any sort of order like that is necessarily required. I think what the Treasury Department regularly does is engage in a process of ensuring they're prepared to respond quickly -- as quickly as is possible in this kind of situation -- to emergent scenarios. And obviously there are experts who look at this closely, and I'm confident that they have -- given all the work that they've already done in North Korea, I'm confident that if the President determines that additional steps are necessary, I'm confident that the Treasury Department will be prepared to present him with some options in a pretty short timeframe.\nQ: So you weren't indicating that the President had made that decision when you said that sanctions are an option?\nMR. EARNEST: I did not mean to leave you with the impression that the President has ordered anything, but I certainly did want to leave you with the impression that there are additional sanctions that the international community or the United States could impose on North Korea that would only serve to further deepen the kind of isolation that they suffer from already.\nQ: And is it the White House's view that you need to determine exactly what kind of atomic device was detonated before you deploy those sanctions? Or what is the thing that's holding that up, if not getting China on board?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I would not say that any sort of -- let me try to say it this way. Just because our initial analysis indicates that North Korea doesn't have any new military or nuclear capabilities doesn't mean we aren't concerned about what they've done. Conducting a test of a nuclear device like this is a provocative act.\nAnd so we certainly are collecting information, and want to learn more about what kind of test occurred. But either way, the United States will be consulting closely with our allies and with our partners in the region to determine the appropriate international response.\nQ: Because critics could say, you know, you're moving slowly or you're soft-pedaling this, if from this podium, as you said yesterday, you have certainty that there was a nuclear test, which would violate international law and U.S. calls for stopping that kind of --\nMR. EARNEST: And something we would roundly condemn. We've seen both China, Russia and our allies condemn this flagrant violation of North Korea's international obligations.\nAs we discussed yesterday, in the last 15 years, North Korea is the only country in the world to test a nuclear device like this. That's an indication both of how isolated they are, but it's also an indication of their bad track record when it comes to fulfilling these kinds of international obligations. And the United States is going to work in close consultation with our partners and with our allies to determine an appropriate response.\nQ: So sanctions could come at any time, or U.S. response could come at any time? I mean, the President -- in the release of the President's call with the South Korean President, there was a unified, strong response the U.S. is committed to. Any timeline on when we will see that strong response?\nMR. EARNEST: No. I think it would be appropriate for you to describe -- for you to say that the response could come at any time. I would just point out that, typically, these kinds of responses are most effective when they can be closely coordinated and implemented with our allies and partners. So that's why you can't just flip a switch to implement these things; that there is some consultation and diplomacy involved. And then there's some technical cooperation involved to ensure that the application of the appropriate response is most effectively implemented.\nSo, yes, a response could come at any time, but you should also know that the kinds of sanctions that are being discussed are not the kinds of sanctions that can be developed and effectively implemented all across the globe just overnight.\nQ: And just lastly, can you summarize whether the U.S believes, whether the White House believes there is a threat to U.S. territory posed by North Korea? You've spoken to U.S. commitment to its allies in the region, but is there a threat to Americans living at home on American territory?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously there -- I can't give you a full intelligence assessment about what we have concluded about North Korea's military and nuclear capabilities. What I can tell you is that we are mindful that a threat of one degree or another does exist. And that is why you have seen the President, not just in reaction to this incident, but rather over the last several years, seek to ramp up our missile defense capabilities in the region. And that included the deployment of these radar systems to Japan. It includes at least one Aegis naval vessel, and the deployment of a so-called THAAD battery to Guam.\nThere are additional capabilities that have been deployed to Alaska, as well, all mindful of the threat from North Korea. It's why I can say again what I said yesterday, which is we continue to be confident of our ability to mitigate the threat to the United States that is posed by the North Koreans and their missile program. But this is certainly -- I think based on what you've heard me describe, I think you could conclude this is a threat that we take seriously.\nChris.\nQ: I just want to follow up on that. A threat you take seriously, but do you believe that they have the capability to hit in the continental United States?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm just not going to be in a position to offer up a full intelligence assessment about --\nQ: So you're not ruling it out?\nMR. EARNEST: What I'm suggesting is that even though I'm not in a position to provide you a detailed assessment of North Korea's nuclear and military capabilities, the President has taken the kinds of steps that I think reflect that this is a threat that we take seriously. And certainly our commitment to protecting the American people and the American homeland is what the President always describes as his first responsibility and top priority.\nAnd making these kinds of prudent long-term decisions -- again, I just want to stress this is not in reaction to the test that we saw two days ago, but rather something that, for years, the United States, our military, and our Commander-in-Chief have been focused on in making sure that we have resources in place to protect the United States.\nQ: I understand. But it just seems there's a huge difference between proactive planning in the case of a possibility of that ability on their part, and it's quite another thing for them to actually have the ability. And you're not ruling it out.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think that based on the long list of failed missile tests that we've seen from North Korea, I think that there are reasons, for sure, for us to be skeptical of the claims that they make about their missile program and their military capabilities. But yet, because protecting the homeland is paramount, the President has made a number of prudent decisions that are consistent with our Asia rebalance policy to deploy additional assets onto the territory of our allies and into the region to ensure that the United States and our people remain safe. And we're going to continue to be mindful of the need to invest in that.\nQ: Just a couple quick things. Back to China, and a lot of Americans are nervous as they're seeing their 401(k)s shrink. It's been a terrible start to the year. And I just wonder what the level of concern is here at the White House about the long-term global implications and, by extension, not just to the economy but the concerns of the American people to understand this as they relate it to the stock market.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Chris, I'm careful not to sort of comment on day-to-day actions in the stock market, and I'm sure investment advisors across the country are reminding their customers of the need to -- particularly when it comes to investing in a 401(k) -- to keep a long-term view. But I think as a policy matter and as somebody who is involved in making policy here in our nation's capital, the President is quite focused on making sure that our priorities when it comes to his domestic agenda are focused on strengthening the economy for middle-class families here in the United States.\nAnd so that's why we're going to continue to push Congress to ratify the TPP agreement. That's certainly something -- a tangible way that we could promote strength and stability in the U.S. economy. We do believe that there is more that Congress can do to invest in an infrastructure package. The President was obviously pleased to sign a bill at the end of last year that would provide five years of funding for transportation infrastructure. But that essentially was the bare minimum of funding for five years.\nThe President believes that there is certainly more of an investment that can be made that would have a short-term economic benefit in terms of creating jobs, but would also have a longer-term benefit in terms of making sure that the U.S. economy could rely upon a modern 21st-century infrastructure that's in good shape.\nWe've also talked about how the U.S. economy would benefit from closing some tax loopholes that only benefit the wealthy and well-connected, and using some of that revenue to invest in the kinds of things that we know would benefit the U.S. economy. And certainly if investors are supposed to think long term, the President of the United States should think long term, too. And that's why proposals like ensuring that every child in America has access to a high-quality, early childhood education program -- those are the kinds of things that are going to benefit our economy over the long term. Making sure that every hardworking student in American has access to two years of community college -- that certainly would be the kind of thing that, over the long term, would be good for our economy to make sure that the United States can continue to have the best educated, most innovative, most ambitious workforce in the world. Those are the kinds of things that President Obama thinks about every day. And there's a decent chance you might hear him talk about this a little bit in his speech to the nation on Tuesday.\nQ: Finally, Donald Trump.\nMR. EARNEST: I've heard of him.\nQ: You've heard of him. (Laughter.) He's threatened to abandon his plan to invest more than a billion dollars in Scotland if they vote -- if Britain votes to bar him from entering the country over his comments. And it's getting a tremendous amount of attention over there. And I'm wondering if this is -- as you smile -- just politics. Or, given that a billion dollars is not an insignificant amount of money, given the GDP of that country of $230 billion, does it have any kind of economic or diplomatic implications?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I have to admit that this is the first time I'm hearing of this little kerfuffle between Mr. Trump and the good people of Scotland.\nQ: You haven't been reading the Daily Mail online? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Apparently I'm missing some good stories by failing to do that. There are no obvious diplomatic concerns that are raised by this -- at least that I can see, based on what you've just said. Obviously, private citizens of the United States can make their own decisions about how and where they choose to invest their money.\nCarol.\nQ: Do you have an update on the President's Guantanamo plan? Did he discuss that with Secretary Carter in their meeting this week? And do you expect that to come sooner rather than later?\nMR. EARNEST: Carol, I did not get a detailed readout of the President's meeting with Secretary Carter. I know that the ongoing effort to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay is something that is often discussed in those meetings, and certainly something the President frequently discusses with his Secretary of Defense. I don't know whether or not that is something that they discussed when they met earlier this week.\nThis does continue to be a priority of the President's, and you heard him when he spoke at his news conference prior to departing for Hawaii three or four weeks ago make clear that this is a priority and that it continues to be clearly within the national security interests of the United States to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. It also would be a better use of taxpayer dollars to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay and find a more effective way to mitigate our interests against -- or mitigate the threat that is posed by the individuals that are housed there now. This is something that the President considers a priority, but I don't have an update for you in terms of timing about when a plan may be presented.\nQ: Doesn't it get harder the longer that you guys wait?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it depends, I guess. I think it's been plenty hard so far. And --\nQ: That's what I mean. You haven't done it in seven years. What makes you think you're going to do it in one when you still haven't sent your revised plan to Congress?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it certainly hasn't been for a lack of trying. And the reason that we haven't succeeded is because Republicans have made a concerted effort to block the kinds of plans that we put in place to close the prison. And it's true that there are both Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill who are on the wrong side of this issue, but it is true that it has not gotten easier as time has gone on. But at this point, I'm not sure it could get harder.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. A leading sexual assault prevention group, PAVE -- I think they may have worked with the White House on some projects -- is on the Hill today. They're endorsing some proposed legislation that would revoke the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Bill Cosby. And in July, at his press conference, the President said he didn't have a mechanism to do it, there's no precedent to do such a thing. But if Congress established such a mechanism affirming his power to remove the medal from Bill Cosby, would he support something like that?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't spoken to him about it. Obviously this is something that Congress will have to consider. I think, until then, we'll take a look at the proposal if Congress takes a vote on it and we'll let you know if the President chooses to sign it.\nQ: Does the White House consider the medal sort of a settled matter? I mean, are you open to a proposal of some kind to kind of reexamining this? Or is it sort of your preference that it's sort of given and move on?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I certainly wouldn't want our position on this issue to be perceived by anyone or any group as a way to condone the kind of behavior that Mr. Cosby has been accused of. At the same time, these kinds of essentially symbolic commemorations are always difficult to deal with. And you certainly wouldn't want a scenario where this kind of process would get infused with politics, and you have members -- you have successive Congresses in the future passing pieces of legislation to try to undo medals that have been conferred by previous Presidents that happen to be in the other party.\nSo I think that's part of what we're mindful of here, but I think the President was quite clear in that news conference in showing his own personal disgust for the kind of behavior that Mr. Cosby is accused of. And the President made clear that he doesn't have any tolerance for it.\nQ: Is he aware that Bill Cosby was charged in a sex assault case? Do you know -- has he given any reaction to that?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't discussed it with him. I'm sure he's aware of it.\nQ: And on the topic of respect for women and dignity for women -- obviously something the President is passionate about -- Hillary Clinton has made it a focus of her campaign. Donald Trump is out with a video today taking aim at Clinton on that front; it includes some references to her husband and his admitted infidelities. The President sort of steered clear of that in 2008 when running up against Hillary Clinton. But is it fair game for other candidates to raise truthful aspects about Bill Clinton's record in this campaign? Does the President have a take on that?\nMR. EARNEST: The President may. You'd have to ask him; I haven't discussed that with him. I think what I would merely say is that based -- even just based solely on Secretary Clinton's service as Secretary of State in this administration, her commitment to fighting for justice and equality for women, not just in the United States but around the world, is second to none. And it is something that she is clearly personally passionate about, and she has put her own prodigious skills to focusing on those kinds of issues.\nAnd obviously people can have whatever kind of debate they want to have in the context of a political election. But in that kind of debate, Secretary Clinton brings a lot of credentials.\nGardiner.\nQ: Speaker Ryan said two things I'd love your reaction to today. One was that U.S. lawmakers are looking finally at possible formal congressional authorization to fight the Islamic State, obviously something that you have called for, for some time. And the other was a suggestion that President Obama should have gotten as emotional over the deaths caused by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as he did over gun violence. Can you react to both of those, Josh, if possible?\nMR. EARNEST: I guess what the -- in some ways, your first question actually illustrates the answer to the second, which is that if Speaker Ryan felt so strongly about the situation that he just described when it comes to ISIL, you'd think he'd actually be in a position to point to something he's done about it. And it's not clear to me he can. Again, I'm happy for him to do so. He has not made hardly any progress that anybody can detect in passing an authorization to use military force against ISIL. This obviously is the basic responsibility of the United States Congress, and Congress has not done it.\nThe White House, the administration has actually gone to such great lengths to try to get this done that we've even written legislation for them that they have refused to take up. That's been a source of significant disappointment. I know there are a lot of spending reforms that the Department of Defense would like to see that they believe would strengthen our national security that Congress has, time and again, rebuffed.\nCertainly there are Republicans in Congress who could confirm Adam Szubin to the position at the Treasury Department. We all know how important financial sanctions are. We've even been talking about them quite a bit in the context of this briefing. And I was able to exhibit enough self-restraint not to bring up Mr. Szubin in the context of all those discussions, but in the context of this one, I think it's appropriate. This is a very basic way that Congress could contribute to our ongoing efforts against ISIL. Obviously he needs to be confirmed by the Senate, not the House, but certainly this is the latest example of Republicans refusing to fulfill even their basic responsibility to ensure that the government is prepared to keep the American people safe -- and in this case, to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\nThe other thing that comes to mind is the loophole that exists that allows those individuals who are currently listed on the no-fly list from being able to buy a firearm. That would keep the country safer. John McCain has observed that criminals and would-be terrorists have previously used the gun show loophole, or at least attempted to use the gun show loophole to buy guns. Why wouldn't they close it? So there's --\nQ: Are you saying that Speaker Ryan should be crying about each one of these, or --\nMR. EARNEST: No, what I'm suggesting is that if he feels so strongly about countering ISIL and making sure that Americans are not put at risk by ISIL terrorists, then he should actually fulfill his basic responsibility, and the leaders in his party in Congress should fulfill their collective basic responsibility to do something about it. And again, I would welcome something, some indication from some House Republican pointing to one thing that they've done to actually try to advance this campaign.\nFrancesca.\nQ: Well, first, I'd like to strongly recommend that you read the Daily Mail online articles more often. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: I thought you might.\nQ: But I don't want to ask about Donald Trump, you'll be happy to know. I would like to talk about the State of the Union. Yesterday, the White House previewed that in a video that dropped. We're now five days out. You didn't want to talk about it earlier this week. I was wondering if we could talk about that now. Denis McDonough said in it that President Obama is doing something different this time. \"This year the President will do what is rarely done in Washington: Think beyond the next election.\" Surely, the White House is not suggesting that in the past ones he's only been thinking to the next election. So what I want to know is, what is it that he's doing that is going to be so different?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as I noted yesterday at the beginning of the briefing in talking about the dramatic recovery and success of the American auto industry, that there are a number of examples I can point to of President Obama looking beyond the next news cycle or the next poll or the next election to make decisions that are in the best interest of the country. And our country has been served very well by President Obama's approach to the job.\nWhat you traditionally see in the State of the Union address is essentially a laundry list of past accomplishments and proposals for the year ahead. As Denis's email suggests, there are a lot of accomplishments for us to discuss that have been achieved over the last seven years, and there certainly are a lot of things the President is looking forward to getting done in the year ahead. But what the focus of his speech will be, however, is on some longer-term issues.\nWe are at an interesting place in our history. The United States has recovered from the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression and we see all of this economic volatility in countries around the world, and the strength of the U.S. economy stands in stark contrast to that kind of instability. And, again, that's a testament to the grit and determination of the American people that devoted so much time and attention, blood, sweat, and tears into digging out of that hole.\nBut the question that's really facing the country now is what are we going to do with the opportunity that lies before us. And so much of the rhetoric that we hear from the other side is focused on fearing the future and being anxious and insecure about a changing world. The fact is, the United States is better positioned than any other nation in the world to capitalize on the opportunities that lie ahead for us. And the President is determined to make sure that we're making the kinds of decisions now that will pay off not just for this generation of Americans, but for our kids, and for their children.\nAnd those are the kinds of issues that the President is hoping to discuss in the State of the Union. And, again, there's lots that we have to -- lots of accomplishments we can talk about. There certainly is a long list of things the President is looking forward to getting done next year, but this is a unique opportunity. This is the grandest stage in all of American politics, where you have the President of the United States standing at a podium in the well of the House of Representatives, speaking to every member of Congress, just about every member of the Cabinet, just about every member of the Supreme Court, the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The eyes of the nation are focused on that moment. And the question is how is the President going to use that unique opportunity. And in this case, he wants to focus most of his time on the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead for the country, and how the choices that we make today will have a significant impact on the success of future generations of Americans.\nQ: So it sounds like that, in the past, you mentioned a laundry list of things that a lot of them take congressional approval, and Republicans are in charge of Congress obviously until the end of this administration. So it sounds like what you're saying is that you'll just be presenting more of a hopeful and optimistic vision for the country over his last year in his office, for the future, not so much a list of priorities he wants to achieve. I just want to clarify that a little.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think you'll get a lot of clarity about that on maybe -- hopefully between 9:45 and 10:00 on Tuesday night.\nJordan.\nQ: Is one of those decisions for the American people that the President is going to talk about is electing a Democrat to the White House? Because what you described sounds an awful lot like laying the groundwork for Democrats in November.\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I think there will be ample opportunity for the President over the course of this year to deliver a political speech. But that's not what tomorrow is about -- or not what Tuesday is about.\nThe President is, like I said, is looking forward to talking about the longer-term challenges and longer-term opportunities that are available to the country. And while certainly the next election is an important one, it's important that we don't allow the decisions that we make today be driven by short-term considerations related to the next election. So I guess I do think that the kinds of -- that the vision that the President will lay out will be generally consistent with the kinds of priorities that you hear Democrats talking about on the campaign trail. But I think the President's message is mostly going to be focused on looking beyond the next election and making sure that we're making decisions that are going to ensure that our children and their children inherit a country that's as strong and as safe and as prosperous as it's ever been.\nEmel.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. Today, Saudi Arabia has increased the tension by attacking the Iranian embassy in Yemen. Clearly, the Saudis are following their own strategy without consulting U.S. Do you think this will -- permanent damage to U.S.-Saudi relationship?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Emel, there are two kinds of reports that we've seen from Yemen. The first is we've seen Iran's claims that the Saudi coalition airstrike targeted the Iranian embassy in Sana'a. We've also seen reports that there has not been any significant damage to the Iranian embassy in Sana'a. So we're still collecting some information to determine exactly what happened or whether anything happened, to be frank about it. So we'll take a look at those reports. At this point, we are hopeful that the positive round of diplomatic talks that took place on December 15th in Switzerland to try to resolve the situation inside of Yemen will lead to an additional and constructive round of talks next week.\nQ: The U.S. always maintains its position as an ally of Saudi Arabia. The U.S. may be dragged into a position it doesn't support. What do you think?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we certainly have been encouraging all sides inside of Yemen to try to resolve their differences peacefully and through diplomacy. And that's why we have worked hard to try to support the peace talks that -- the first round of which occurred back in December and hopefully are going to continue next week.\nBut the concerns that the Saudis have expressed about the political chaos in Yemen spilling over the border into Saudi Arabia are understandable. But what we are hopeful of is that the situation can be resolved through diplomacy. We believe that's actually the only way that this will be resolved, and we're hopeful that both sides will be serious -- that all sides will be serious in pursuing a diplomatic resolution to that situation.\nQ: Secondly, what is the primary goal of the Vice President to go to Turkey on January 23rd?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have an update on the Vice President's trip, but we can certainly follow up with you on that.\nAnita.\nQ: I'll ask you something -- sort of a fun one maybe.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay.\nQ: The Speaker is having a ceremony today -- perhaps you've heard about the health care -- Obamacare -- they're having an enrollment ceremony to sanction the bill. I was wondering if you all were planning a veto ceremony and what that might be like.\nMR. EARNEST: (Laughter.) We are not. Again, I think this may be a half-hearted or at least an ill-fated attempt on the part of some Republicans to try to pump some drama into another failed effort on their part to have any sort of success in --\nQ: They succeeded finally on their end.\nMR. EARNEST: I'm sorry?\nQ: They succeeded on their end this time.\nMR. EARNEST: They succeeded in a victory that amounts to absolutely nothing. The fact is, the President will veto this bill. They know that. They also know that they don't have the votes to override it. And in the meantime, we are actually seeing record numbers of Americans sign up at Healthcare.gov for the benefits that are being provided to the American people through Obamacare. I know that HHS has announced today that more than 11 people -- 11 million people -- 11 people would be bad -- (laughter) -- 11 million people, however, is an impressive number, and that is actually the number of people that in just this open enrollment period have signed up for a plan. And so that includes *more than a million three million new people.\nWe talked about how one of our challenges entering the open enrollment period was going to be getting additional people who were not previously signed up for a health care, presumably because they were in relatively good health and didn't think that they needed the protection that's afforded by health insurance. But we have persuaded those individuals that paying a penalty to the IRS doesn't make sense if you can take that money, use it to purchase health insurance, and actually get a lot of benefits including things like free preventative care, free birth control, and other things that obviously healthy people benefit from too.\nSo that's why I don't think that they -- or that we have concluded that any sort of pomp and circumstance around a veto is necessary.\nPhillip.\nQ: Thank you. It's the one-year anniversary of the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris today. Has this come up at the White House today? And secondly, has the President been made aware during the course of this morning of this apparent attempt by one man to attack a police station in Paris? He was killed at the end of this. Has the President been updated on that situation?\nMR. EARNEST: Phillip, the White House is certainly monitoring the attempted terrorist attack in Paris earlier today. I don't know the extent of the presidential briefing on this, but I can tell you that senior members of the President's national security team are aware of this situation. And obviously we are pleased that no innocent people were killed in that incident.\nBut this is a fateful anniversary. And we did see, one year ago today, terrorists attack innocent people in Paris. And there are innocent people who, over the course of two or three days, who lost their lives -- whether they were cartoonists who were exercising their right to the freedom of expression, or just innocent people who were shopping for groceries.\nAnd it is certainly a sad thing to remember, but it is also a way to remember the resolve that the French people have shown through a difficult year. And it certainly is an opportunity to remember, once again, that France is the oldest ally of the United States. And we stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of France as they confront the terrorist threat to their nation.\nAnd even on the days when we remember the sad events of a year ago, the French people can know that the American people and the American government is standing right there with them.\nQ: They have these commemorations in Paris. French people, I think it's safe to say, would say that the world is a less safe place today than a year ago. Is that an analysis you would share?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think a broad generalization like that is a difficult one to make. Certainly the United States and France have been working together quite a lot over the last year to deal with the threats that are out there. And certainly President Obama is mindful of them. I'm confident that President Hollande is mindful of them as well. President Obama obviously spends a lot of time thinking about, talking to his staff and making decisions that are directly related to the safety and security of the American people, the U.S. homeland and our interests around the world.\nWe also believe that the national security of the United States is enhanced when our allies like France are safe and secure. And that is why you have seen the United States expend significant resources to make sure that we are coordinating closely with our allies in France and with our allies around the world, frankly, to confront ISIL, to confront terrorists and extremists of all stripes to ensure the safety and security of our people and our nations. And that work will continue in the years ahead.\nQ: Quick question on North Korea. The Pentagon tells us that in a phone call between Secretary of Defense Carter and his South Korean counterpart yesterday, this came up from both of them -- they agreed that provocations will have consequences. Using this kind of case you'd refer me to the Defense Department I think, but how would you interpret this coming from the head of the U.S. military when he says that provocations like the nuclear test in North Korea will have consequences?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't think he was necessarily promising that it would have military consequences, but I certainly wouldn't take them off the table. I think what you can anticipate in the days and weeks ahead is that the United States will be in consultations with our allies in the region, including our close allies in the Republic of Korea, about an appropriate international response. This is also something that is being discussed at the United Nations around the table of the Security Council. And we'll continue to consult closely with our friends and allies as we determine an appropriate response, and I'm confident that's what Secretary Carter was referring to.\nMark, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thanks. On the Obamacare bill, Republicans are taking some satisfaction in that, if nothing else, they're forcing the President to cast a veto. Now, is that much of an imposition?\nMR. EARNEST: Not at all. Stroke of a pen.\nQ: Well, they're also saying that it shows that next year at this time, if a Republican -- well, not at this time, but almost at this time, if a Republican were elected President they could get a bill to his desk that would repeal Obamacare. Now, is that something the President is worried about?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it's based on I think two rather large assumptions. The first is that the Republicans hold on to a majority in the United States Senate, which I think is certainly a question that's up in the air. It also assumes that Republicans will hold on to the House of Representatives. There certainly will be a meaningful election. I think Republicans will be favored in that regard. But there will be an election to contest. And it also depends on a presidential candidate from their party actually winning an election.\nAll of that is made a whole lot more difficult if the centerpiece of the Republican agenda is fighting a five-year-old political fight to zero impact on the country. And that ultimately is what the Republicans in Congress have to show for their efforts.\nQ: Last question. Did President Obama have any role in getting Denis McDonough to go on Twitter? (Laughter.) Did it take an executive order? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: It did not require an executive order. But I do think that some of Denis's acerbic observations about the political process will translate pretty well to the medium of Twitter. We'll all have an opportunity to watch whether or not that actually takes place.\nThanks a lot, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 3:03 P.M.

And good evening from George Mason University here in Fairfax, Virginia. We are here tonight to talk about one of the most divisive issues in America today: guns. Their protection is enshrined in the Constitution in the Second Amendment, and gun ownership is an integral part of American history and culture.\nThere are some 30,000 gun deaths in America each year. Two-thirds of them are suicides; one-third of them are homicides. So the question we want to confront tonight is, how you find a balance between protecting the rights of American citizens who want to own guns, but preventing guns from getting into the hands of people who shouldn't have them?\nWe brought together people here tonight who represent really all sides of the issue: gun owners, gun sellers, people who have survived shootings or lost loved ones. Some here believe that having more guns makes us all safer and believe the right to bear arms defines us, preserves us from tyranny, and cannot be compromised in any way. Others here tonight believe just as passionately that more needs to be done to limit the sale of firearms. And we respect all of their views, and we want to hear from as many as we can tonight in the hour ahead.\nOne voice you will not hear from tonight is the National Rifle Association. They're the Nation's largest, most influential and powerful gun rights group. We invited them to be here; they are—I think their office is just a couple miles away. They declined to take part. Some of their members are here tonight though. We're very thankful for that. And so are representatives from the National Firearms Retailers Association.\nThis town hall is not something the White House dreamed up or that the White House organized. CNN approached the White House shortly after the San Bernardino terror attacks with this idea. And we're pleased that they agreed to participate and pleased to welcome tonight the President of the United States, Barack Obama.\nThe President. Hey. Please take your seat.\nMr. Cooper. Thank you, Mr. President. Welcome.\nThe President. Thank you, everybody.\nMr. Cooper. Thanks for being here. I appreciate it.\nThe President. Great to be here. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Great to see you.\nThe President's Experience With Guns\nMr. Cooper. Good to see you. Let me start. Have you ever owned a gun?\nThe President. I have never owned a gun. Now, up at Camp David, we've got some skeet shooting, so on a fairly regular basis, we get a 12-gauge and—I'm not making any claims about my marksmanship. [Laughter] But——\nMr. Cooper. Before you were President, did you ever feel a desire to get a gun, feel the need to get a gun? The President. I grew up mostly in Hawaii, and other than hunting for wild pig, which they do once in a while, there's not the popularity of hunting and sportsmanship with guns as much as there are in other parts of the country.\nGun Sales/Gun Violence/Gun Ownership\nMr. Cooper. Right. I mean, I ask the question because there's a lot of people out there who don't trust you, obviously, on the issue of guns. You keep saying you don't want to take away everybody's guns. But there's a lot of people out there tonight watching who don't believe you. There are a lot of people in this room who, frankly, don't believe you. And it's not just that you don't really have personal experience having owned a gun, but it's that things you've said: support for Australia's tough antigun policies. They banned semiautomatic assault rifles. They banned even shotguns in Australia.\nThe President. Right.\nMr. Cooper. You've praised their policies over and over.\nBack in 2008, you said—you talked about bitter Americans clinging to their guns. Even now, these executive actions have caused a lot of concern among a lot of people. What can you say to somebody tonight to convince them that you don't want to take away everybody's guns, that you're not coming for their guns?\nThe President. Well, first of all, Anderson, I think it's useful to keep in mind, I've been now President for over 7 years, and gun sales don't seem to have suffered during that time.\nMr. Cooper. If anything, actually, you've helped.\nThe President. They've gone up. I've been very good for gun manufacturers. [Laughter] More importantly, let me—I'll tell you a story that I think indicates how I see the issue.\nBack in 2007, 2008, when I was campaigning, I'd leave Chicago, a city which is wonderful—I couldn't be prouder of my city—but where every week, there's a story about a young person getting shot. Some are gang members, and it's turf battles. Sometimes, it's innocent victims.\nMr. Cooper. Fifty-five people have been shot in Chicago in the last 7 days.\nThe President. Sometimes, it's happened just a few blocks from my house, and I live in a reasonably good neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago.\nSo that's one image, all right: talking to families who've gone through the pain of losing somebody because of violence in Chicago, gun violence.\nMichelle and I are then campaigning out in Iowa, and we're going to farms, and we're going to counties. And at one point, Michelle turned to me, and she said, you know, if I was living in a farmhouse, where the sheriff's department is pretty far away, and somebody can just turn off the highway and come up to the farm, I'd want to have a shotgun or a rifle to make sure that I was protected and my family was protected. And she was absolutely right.\nAnd so part of the reason, I think, that this ends up being such a difficult issue is because people occupy different realities. There are a whole bunch of law-abiding citizens who have grown up hunting with their dad or going to the shooting range and are responsible gun owners. And then, there's the reality that there are neighborhoods around the country where it is easier for a 12- or 13-year-old to purchase a gun—and cheaper—than it is for them to get a book. Gun Violence Prevention Efforts/Background Check System\nMr. Cooper. But what you're proposing, what you proposed this week, the executive actions, the other things, are they really going to be effective? And I ask this because the vast majority of felons out there—I mean, we can all agree criminals should not get guns; we want to keep guns out of the hands of criminals.\nThe President. Right.\nMr. Cooper. The vast majority of criminals get their guns from—either illegally or from family or friends. So background checks is not something that's going to affect them, is it?\nThe President. Well, but that's not exactly accurate. Look, first of all, it's important for everybody to understand what I've proposed and what I haven't proposed. What I've said consistently throughout my Presidency is, I respect the Second Amendment. I respect the right to bear arms. I respect people who want a gun for self-protection, for hunting, for sportsmanship. But all of us can agree that it makes sense to do everything we can to keep guns out of the hands of people who would try to do others harm or to do themselves harm.\nBecause every year, we're losing 30,000 people to gun violence. Two-thirds of those are actually suicides. Hundreds of kids under the age of 18 are being shot or shooting themselves, often by accident, many of them under the age of 5. And so if we can combine gun safety with sensible background checks and some other steps, we're not going to eliminate gun violence, but we will lessen it. And if we take that number from 30,000 down to, let's say, 28,000, that's 2,000 families who don't have to go through what the families at Newtown or San Bernardino or Charleston went through.\nAnd so what we've proposed is that if you have a background check system that has a bunch of big loopholes, which is why a lot of criminals and people who shouldn't have guns are able to get guns——\nQ. But they're not buying them at gun shows. Only 1 percent of criminals are buying them at gun shows.\nThe President. No, but this is what happens. Let's go back to the city of Chicago that has strong gun control laws. And oftentimes, the NRA will point to that as an example and say, see, these things don't work. Well, the problem is, is that about 30, 40 percent of those guns are coming from Indiana, across the border, where there are much laxer laws. And so folks will go to a gun show and purchase a whole bunch of firearms, put them in a van, drive up into Mike Pfleger's neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago, where his parish is, open up the trunk, and those things are for sale.\nNow, technically, you could say those folks bought them illegally, but it was facilitated by the fact that what used to be a small exception that said collectors and hobbyists don't need to go through a background check has become this massive industry where people who are doing business are, in fact, saying that they're not in the business of selling guns, but are.\nAnd all we're saying here is, is that we want to put everybody on notice that the definition of doing business—which means you have to register, and it means you have to run a background check—is if you are making a profit and repeatedly selling guns, then you should have to follow the same rules as every other gun dealer. And what that means——\nBackground Check System/National Rifle Association/Consumer Product Safety Regulations Mr. Cooper. But there are a lot of people who believe that's not specific enough, because there's a lot of fathers and sons who sell guns every now and then and at gun shows. Are they going to have to now start doing background checks? Are they going to start to have to register?\nThe President. Look, what the Justice Department has done is provided a whole range of very specific examples. And what we ultimately need, I believe, is for Congress to set up a system that is efficient, that doesn't inconvenience the lawful gun seller or purchaser, but that makes sure that we're doing the best background check possible.\nAnd the fact, Anderson, that the system may not catch every single person or there may be a circumstance where somebody doesn't think that they have to register and do and that may cause some redtape and bureaucracy for them, which—or inconvenience—has to be weighed against the fact that we may be able to save a whole bunch of families from the grief that some of the people in this audience have had to go through.\nAnd keep in mind, for the gun owners who are in attendance here, my suspicion is, is that you all had to go through a background check, and it didn't prevent you from getting a weapon. And the notion that you should have to do that, but there are a whole bunch of folks who are less responsible than you who don't have to do it, doesn't make much sense.\nSo why we should resist this—keep in mind that, historically, the NRA was in favor of background checks. Historically, many in the Republican Party were in favor of background checks. And what's changed is not that my proposals are particularly radical. What's changed is, we've suddenly created an atmosphere in which I put out a proposal like background checks, or, after Sandy Hook, we're calling on Congress, along with people like Gabby Giffords, who herself was a victim of gun violence—we put out a proposal that is common sense, modest, does not claim to solve every problem, is respectful of the Second Amendment, and the way it is described is that we're trying to take away everybody's guns.\nAnd part of the reason I welcomed this opportunity by CNN to have a good discussion and debate about it is because our position is consistently mischaracterized. And by the way, there's a reason why the NRA is not here. They're just down the street, and since this is the main reason they exist, you'd think that they'd be prepared to have a debate with the President.\nMr. Cooper. Would you be willing to meet with them? They haven't been to the White House for 3 years. They have—[inaudible]—about it.\nThe President. Oh, no, no, we've invited them. We've invited them.\nMr. Cooper. So right now, tonight you're saying you would be welcome to meet with them?\nThe President. We have invited them repeatedly. But if you listen to the rhetoric, it is so over the top and so overheated and, most importantly, is not acknowledging the fact that there's no other consumer item that we purchase——\nQ. So is that an open invitation that——\nThe President. Hold on a second. Let me finish this point, Cooper. There's nothing else in our lives that we purchase where we don't try to make it a little safer if we can.\nAudience members. That's right.\nThe President. Traffic fatalities have gone down drastically during my lifetime. And part of it is technology, and part of it is that the National Highway Safety Administration does research and they figure out, you know what, seatbelts really work. And then, we passed some laws to make sure seatbelts are fastened. Airbags make a lot of sense; let's try those out. Toys—we say, you know what, we find out that kids are swallowing toys all the time, let's make sure that the toys aren't so small that they swallow them if they're for toddlers or infants. Medicine—kids can't open aspirin caps.\nNow, the notion that we would not apply the same basic principles to gun ownership as we do to everything else that we own——\nMr. Cooper. But you don't——\nThe President. ——just to try to make them safer, or the notion that anything we do to try to make them safer is somehow a plot to take away guns, that contradicts what we do to try to create a better life for Americans in every other area of our lives.\nNational Rifle Association/Gun Confiscation Fears/Gun Sales\nMr. Cooper. So just so I'm clear, tonight you're saying you would welcome to meet with the NRA?\nThe President. I'm happy—Anderson, I've said this repeatedly. I'm happy to meet with them. I'm happy to talk to them. But the conversation has to be based on facts and truth and what we're actually proposing, not some imaginary fiction in which Obama is trying to take away your guns.\nMr. Cooper. Well, let's talk about what you're proposing.\nThe President. The reason, by the way, that the gun manufacturers—that gun sales spike not just before I propose something—every time there is a mass shooting, gun sales spike. And part of the reason is, is that the NRA has convinced many of its members that somebody is going come grab your guns, which is, by the way, really profitable for the gun manufacturers. It's a great advertising mechanism, but it's not necessary. There's enough of a market out there for people who want protection, who are sportsmen, who want to go hunting with their kids. And we can make it safer.\nMr. Cooper. I want to open this up to people in our audience.\nThe President. Absolutely.\nMr. Cooper. A lot of people have traveled far. I want you to meet Taya Kyle. She's the widow of Chris Kyle, former Navy SEAL, author of \"American Sniper.\" Taya wrote a book, \"American Wife: A Memoir of Love, War, Faith, and Renewal.\"\nTaya, we're happy you're here. What do you want to ask the President?\nCrime Rates/Gun Ownership Rates/Background Check System\nQ. I appreciate you taking the time to come here. And I think that your message of hope is something I agree with, and I think it's great. And I think that by creating new laws, you do give people hope. The thing is that the laws that we create don't stop these horrific things from happening, right? And that's a very tough pill to swallow.\nThe President. Right.\nQ. We want to think that we can make a law and people will follow it. But by the very nature of their crime, they're not following it. By the very nature of looking at the people who hurt our loved ones here, I don't know that any of them would have been stopped by the background check. And yet I crave that desire for hope too. And so I think, part of it, we have to recognize that we cannot outlaw murder, because the people who are murdering, right, are—they're breaking the law, but they also don't have a moral code that we have. And so they could do the same amount of damage with a pipe bomb. The problem is that they want to murder.\nAnd I'm wondering why it wouldn't be a better use of our time to give people hope in a different way, to say, you know what, we—well, first of all, actually, let me back up to that. Because with the laws, I know that at least the last I heard, the Federal prosecution of gun crimes was, like, 40 percent. And what I mean by that is that there are people lying on these forms already, and we're not prosecuting them. So there's an issue there, right? But instead, if we can give people hope and say that also during this time, while you've been President, we are at the lowest murder rate in our country—alltime low of murders.\nMr. President. Right.\nQ. We're at an alltime high of gun ownership, right? I'm not necessarily saying that the two are correlated, but what I'm saying is that, we're at an alltime low for a murder rate. That's a big deal.\nAnd yet I think most of us in this country feel like it could happen at any moment. It could happen to any of us at any time, at a moment's notice. And I'm almost finished. Just, when you talk about the NRA, and after a mass shooting that gun sales go up, I would argue that it's not necessarily that I think somebody is going to come take my gun from me, but I want the hope, and the hope that I have the right to protect myself, that I don't end up to be one of these families; that I have the freedom to carry whatever weapon I feel I need, just like your wife said on that farm road. The sheriffs are not going to get to my house either. And I understand that background checks aren't necessarily going to stop me from getting a gun, but I also know that they wouldn't have stopped any of the people here in this room from killing. And so it seems like almost a false sense of hope.\nSo why not celebrate where we are? I guess that's my real question is——\nThe President. Well, first——\nQ. ——celebrate that we're good people, and 99.9 percent of us are never going to kill anyone.\nThe President. Well, let me make a couple of points. First of all, thanks to your husband for his service, and thank you for your service, because of extraordinary heroism that he and your family have shown in protecting all of us. And I'm very grateful for that.\nNumber two, what you said about murder rates and violent crime generally is something that we don't celebrate enough. The fact of the matter is, is that violent crime has been steadily declining across America for a pretty long time. And you wouldn't always know it by watching television, but overall, most cities are much safer than they were 10 years ago or 20 years ago.\nNow, I'd challenge the notion that the reason for that is because there's more gun ownership, because if you look at where are the areas with the highest gun ownership, those are the places, in some cases, where the crime rate hasn't dropped down that much. And the places where there's pretty stiff restrictions on gun ownership, in some of those places, the crime has dropped really quickly. So I'm not sure that there's a one-to-one correlation there. But I think the most important point I want to make is that you will be able to purchase a firearm. Some criminals will get their hands on firearms even if there's a background check. Somebody may lie on a form. Somebody will intend to commit a crime, but they don't have a record that shows up on the background check system.\nBut in the same way that we don't eliminate all traffic accidents, but over the course of 20 years, traffic accidents get lower—there's still tragedies, there's still drunk drivers, there's still people who don't wear their seatbelts—but over time, that violence was reduced, and so families are spared. That's the same thing that we can do with gun ownership.\nThere is a way for us to set up a system where you, a responsible gun owner, who—I'm assuming, given your husband and your family—is a much better marksman than I am, can have a firearm to protect yourself, but where it is much harder for somebody to fill up a car with guns and sell them to 13-year-old kids on the streets. And that is, I think, what we're trying to do.\nWhat we're also trying to do is make the database more effective. So that's part of the proposal, which, by the way, will convenience you when you go to the store, because if we can set up a 24/7 background check system, then that means that it's less likely that things slip through the cracks or it's more difficult for you to get your background check completed.\nAnd we're also trying to close a loophole that has been developing over the last decade, where now people are using cut-out trusts and shell corporations to purchase the most dangerous weapons—sawed-off shotguns, automatic weapons, silencers—and don't have to go through background checks at all. And we don't know whether—are these sales going to drug traffickers? Are they—we don't know who's purchasing them right now. And so what we're saying is, you know what, that is something that we've got to do something about.\nThe same thing is true with Internet sales, where one study has shown that 1 out of 30 persons who are purchasing weapons over the Internet turn out to have a felony record. And that's not something you want to see.\nMr. Cooper. I think one question a lot of people have about you is, do you believe the fundamental notion that a good guy with a gun or a good woman with a gun is an important bulwark against a bad person with a gun? And before you answer, I want you to meet Kimberly Corban. Kimberly was a college student in Colorado in 2006. Kimberly is right over there. She was raped by a man who broke into her apartment. She testified for 3 hours in the trial against him. Her attacker was sentenced to 24-years-to-life in prison. And I know that attack, Kimberly, changed your view of handguns. What's your question for the President?\nConcealed-Carry Laws/Gun Ownership for Self-Defense/Background Check System\nQ. Absolutely. As a survivor of rape and now a mother to two small children, it seems like being able to purchase a firearm of my choosing and being able to carry that wherever my—me and my family are, it seems like my basic responsibility as a parent at this point. I have been unspeakably victimized once already, and I refuse to let that happen again to myself or my kids. So why can't your administration see that these restrictions that you're putting to make it harder for me to own a gun or harder for me to take that where I need to be is actually just making my kids and I less safe?\nThe President. Well, Kimberly, first of all, obviously, your story is horrific. The strength you've shown in telling your story and being here tonight is remarkable. And so I'm really proud of you for that. I just want to repeat that there's nothing that we've proposed that would make it harder for you to purchase a firearm. And now, you may be referring to issues like concealed carry, but those tend to be State-by-State decisions, and we're not making any proposals with respect to what States are doing. They can make their own decisions there. So there really is no—nothing that we're proposing that prevents you or makes it harder for you to purchase a firearm if you need one.\nThere are always questions as to whether or not having a firearm in the home protects you from that kind of violence. And I'm not sure we can resolve that. People argue it both sides. What is true is, is that you have to be pretty well trained in order to fire a weapon against somebody who is assaulting you and catches you by surprise. And what is also true is, there's always the possibility that that firearm in a home leads to a tragic accident. We can debate that, round or flat.\nBut for now, what I just want to focus on is that you certainly would like to make it a little harder for that assailant to have also had a gun. You certainly would want to make sure that if he gets released, that he now can't do what he did to you to somebody else. And it's going to be easier for us to prevent him from getting a gun if there's a strong background system in place—background check system in place.\nAnd so if you look at the statistics, there's no doubt that there are times where somebody who has a weapon has been able to protect themselves and scare off an intruder or an assailant. But what is more often the case is that they may not have been able to protect themselves, but they're— end up being the victim of the weapon that they purchased themselves. And that's something that can be debated. In the meantime, all I'm focused on is making sure that a terrible crime like yours that was committed is not made easier because somebody can go on the Internet and just buy whatever weapon they want without us finding out whether they're a criminal or not.\nMr. Cooper. Kimberly, thank you for being here. I appreciate it.\nYou talked about Chicago, and there's a lot of folks from Chicago here tonight. I want you to meet—or I want everybody to meet, because I know you've met her before, Cleo Pendleton. She's sitting over there. And I should point out—I think I said it earlier—55 shootings in Chicago in just the past 7 days. Cleo Pendleton, her daughter, Hadiya, performed at your second Inauguration. She was shot to death a little more than a week later. She was 15 years old. She was an honor student, a majorette. And you being here tonight honors her, so thank you very much for being here. What's your question to the President?\nBackground Check System/Concealed-Carry Laws\nQ. Well, I want to say thank you, first of all, for making it more difficult for guns to get in the hands of those that shouldn't have them. Thank you for the action you took on Tuesday. But I want to ask a question: How can we stop the trafficking of guns from States with looser gun laws into States with tougher gun laws? Because I believe that's the case often in Chicago and possibly the source of the gun that shot and murdered my daughter.\nThe President. Well, first of all, it's great to see you again. And part of the reason that we do this is because when you meet parents of wonderful young people and they tell their stories, at least for me, I think of Malia and I think of Sasha and I think of my nieces and I think of my nephews. And the pain that any of us go through with a loss like that is extraordinary. And I couldn't be prouder of the families who are here representing both sides, but who've been affected in those ways. If we are able to set up a strong background check system—and my proposal, by the way, includes hiring—having the FBI hire a couple hundred more people to help process background checks, because they're big numbers, you're talking about 20 million checks that are getting done every year—hiring 200,000—or 200 more ATF agents to be able to go after unscrupulous gun dealers, then that will apply across the country.\nAnd so even—some States may have laws that allow for conceal-and-carry; some States may not. There's still going to be differences. But what will at least be consistent across the country is that it's a little bit harder to get a gun.\nNow, we can't guarantee that criminals are not going to have ways of getting guns. But, for example, it may be a little more difficult and a little more expensive, and the laws of supply and demand mean that if something is harder to get, and it's a little more expensive to get, then fewer people get them. And that, in and of itself, could make a difference.\nSo if somebody is a straw purchaser—and what that means is, they don't intend the guns for themselves, they intend to resell them to somebody else—they go to a gun show in Indiana, where right now they don't have to do a background check, load up a van, and open up that van and sell them to kids and gangs in Chicago—if now that person has to go through a background check, they've got to register, ATF has the capacity then to find out if and when a gun is used in a crime in Chicago where that gun had come from. And now you know, all right, here's somebody who seems to be willing to sell a gun to a 15-year-old who had a known record.\nMr. Cooper. But you're only going to be asking people to get a license and do background checks if they give out business cards, if they're selling weapons that are in the original packaging. Somebody just walking around a gun show selling a weapon is not necessarily going to have to register.\nThe President. No, the—look, there's going to be a case-by-case evaluation: Are they on an ongoing basis making a profit, and are they repeatedly selling firearms?\nMr. Cooper. Okay. I want you to meet Sheriff Paul Babeu of Pinal County, Arizona.\nThe President. Good to see you.\nMr. Cooper. He's a Republican running for Congress. After the recent terror attacks, Sheriff, I know you've been telling citizens to arm themselves to protect their families. What's your question to the President?\nQ. Well, first, deputies' slow response time has been mentioned a couple times. I want to be clear that my deputies have a very fast emergency response.\nThe President. [Laughter] I'm sure that's true.\nGun Violence Prevention Efforts/Crime Prevention Efforts\nQ. Yes. Mr. President, you've said you've been thwarted by—frustrated by Congress. As a sheriff, I oftentimes get frustrated. But I don't make the laws, and I've sworn an oath to enforce the law, to uphold the Constitution, the same oath you've taken. And the talk and why we're here is all these mass shootings, and yet you've said in your executive action, it wouldn't have solved even one of these or the terrorist attack——\nThe President. No, I didn't say that. I didn't say that it wouldn't solve one.\nQ. Well, looking at the information, what would it have solved? Now, knowing—— Mr. Cooper. None of the recent mass shootings, I should point out, none of the guns were purchased from an unlicensed dealer.\nQ. Correct. And that's what I'm speaking to, the executive action that you mentioned earlier. Aspirin, toys, or cars, they're not written about in the Constitution. I want to know—and I think all of us really want to get to the solution, and you said don't talk past each other—what would you have done to prevent these mass shootings and the terrorist attack? And how do we get those with mental illness and criminals—that's the real problem here—how are we going to get them to follow the laws?\nThe President. Well, first of all, appreciate your service. Good luck on your race. You sure you want to go to Congress?\nQ. I don't want your endorsement. [Laughter]\nThe President. I'm sure that's true. That will hurt you. And I'm sure it's a Republican district. [Laughter]\nThe—look, crime is always going to be with us. So I think it's really important for us not to suggest that if we can't solve every crime, we shouldn't try to solve any crimes.\nAnd the problem when we talk about that \"guns don't shoot—kill people, people kill people,\" or it's primarily a mental health problem, or it's a criminal and evil problem, and that's what we have to get at—all of us are interested in fighting crime. I'm very proud of the fact that violent crime rates have continued to go down during the course of my Presidency. I've got an Attorney General, an FBI that works very closely with local law enforcement in busting up crime rings all the time. That's a huge priority to us. And we're probably providing grants to your department to help go after criminals.\nThe challenge we have is that in many instances, you don't know ahead of time who's going to be the criminal. It's not as if criminals walk around with a label saying, \"I'm a criminal.\" And by the way, the young man who killed those kids in Newtown, he didn't have a criminal record, and so we didn't know ahead of time, necessarily, that he was going to do something like that. But he was able to have access to an arsenal that allowed him, in very short order, to kill an entire classroom of small children. And so the question then becomes, are there ways for us—since we can't identify that person all the time—are there ways for us to make it less lethal when something like that happens?\nAnd I mentioned this during my speech at the White House a couple of days ago. Right around the time of Newtown, in China, a guy who was obviously similarly deranged had a knife and started attacking a bunch of schoolchildren. About the same number were cut or stabbed by this guy. But most of them survived. And the reason was because he wasn't wielding a semiautomatic.\nSo the main point I think that I want to make here is that everybody here is in favor of going after criminals, locking them up, making sure that we're creating an environment where kids don't turn into criminals and providing the support that they need. Those are all important things. Nobody is saying we need to be going soft on criminals.\nWhat we do have to make sure of is that we don't make it so easy for them to have access to deadly weapons. In neighborhoods like Chicago—but, I keep on using Chicago—this is all across the country. You go into any neighborhood, it used to be that parents would see some kids messing around on the corner, and they'd say, \"Yo\"—even if they weren't the parent of those children—\"go back inside, stop doing that.\" And over time, it was a lot harder to discipline somebody else's kid and have the community maintain order or talk to police officers if somebody is doing something wrong, because now somebody is worried about getting shot.\nAnd if we can create an environment that's just a little bit safer for—in those communities, that will help. And if it doesn't infringe on your Second Amendment rights, and it doesn't infringe on your Second Amendment rights, and you're still able to get a firearm for your protection, why wouldn't we want to do that?\nMr. Cooper. We've got to take a break. We're going to take a quick break. Our live town hall conversation, \"Guns in America,\" with President Barack Obama continues right after this.\n[At his point, the town hall meeting was interrupted by a commercial break. Mr. Cooper then resumed his remarks as follows.]\nMr. Cooper. And welcome back. We're live at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, continuing our \"360\" town hall conversation with President Barack Obama, \"Guns In America,\" talking to voices from all sides of the issue, including the President.\nYou made your announcement just the other day in a very obviously emotional ceremony at the White House. I want to play just a moment from it for those who haven't seen it.\n[A video of a portion of the President's January 5 remarks on gun violence was shown. Mr. Cooper then resumed his remarks as follows.]\nMr. Cooper. I think a lot of people were surprised by that moment.\n2012 Shootings in Newtown, Connecticut/Crime Prevention Efforts\nThe President. I was too, actually. I visited Newtown 2 days after what happened, so it was still very raw. It's the only time I've ever seen Secret Service cry on duty. And it wasn't just the parents. You had siblings—10-year-olds, 8-year-olds, 3-year-olds—who, in some cases, didn't even understand that their brother or sister weren't going to be coming home. And I've said this before, it continues to haunt me. It was one of the worst days of my Presidency.\nBut look, I want to emphasize that there are a lot of tragedies that happen out there as a consequence of the victims of crime. There are police officers who are out there laying down their lives to protect us every single day—and tears are appropriate for them as well, and I visit with those families as well—victims of terrorism, soldiers coming home.\nThere's a lot of heartache out there. And I don't suggest that this is the only kind of heartache we should be working on. I spent a lot of time and a lot of hours—in fact, a lot more hours than I spend on this—trying to prevent terrorist attacks. I spend a lot of time and a lot of hours trying to make sure that we're continuing to reduce our crime rate.\nThere are a whole bunch of other answers that are just as important when it comes to making sure that the streets of places like Chicago and Baltimore are safer, making sure kids get a good early childhood education, making sure that we're teaching conflict resolution that doesn't involve violence, making sure that faith communities are able to reach out to young people and intervene in timely ways.\nSo this is not a recipe for solving every problem. Again, I just want to emphasize that the goal here is just to make progress. And it's interesting, as I enter into my last year as President, I could not be prouder of the work that we've done. But it also makes you really humble, because you realize that change takes a long time, and a lot of the work you do is just to incrementally make things better so that, 10 years from now, 20 years from now, the crime rate has gone down.\nThat's not just because of my administration, that's—the groundwork was laid by a bunch of good work by law enforcement and others for years, across administrations, on a bipartisan basis.\nThe same is true with traffic safety. The same is true with advances in medicine. The same can be true with this if we stop exaggerating or mischaracterizing the positions of either side and we just come up with some sensible areas that people agree with. Background checks are an example: The majority of gun owners agree with this.\nMr. Cooper. You talk about faith communities. Father Michael Pfleger is here. I know you know him well. He's a Roman Catholic priest in Chicago. For those who don't know, his church is St. Sabina on the South Side of Chicago. I was there about a month ago. It was a great honor to be there.\nFather, you've given a lot of eulogies for a lot of kids in your community, far too many over the 40 years that you have been there. What your question for the President?\nU.S. Military's \"Jade Helm 15\" Exercise/Gun Licensing and Registration/Smart Gun Technology\nQ. Mr. President, first of all, thank you for your courage and your passion, and keep pushing. I happen to be from one of those cities where violence is not going down. Not only, as Anderson mentioned, the 55 shot, there's been 11 killed in 7 days in Chicago. And one of the main reasons for that is the easy access to guns. It's easier to get a gun in my neighborhood than it is a computer. And the reality is, is because many of those guns have been bought legally. And I understand why people are pushing against you, because I understand it's a business and it's about a business, and so if we cut back the easy access to guns, less money for the gun manufacturers, less money for the gun lobby. I understand the business of it. But that business is causing blood and the kids that are dying in Chicago. And for many years, nobody even cared about Chicago because the violence is primarily Black and Brown.\nThe reality is that I don't understand why we can't title guns just like cars. If I have a car and I give it to you, Mr. President, and I don't transfer a title and you're in an accident, it's on me. We don't take cars away by putting titles on them. Why can't we do that with guns and every gun in America? So if somebody who's buying 200 guns, selling them on the streets, if they can't transfer those titles, then they're going to be held responsible for the guns that they sell.\nThe President. Well, Father Mike, first of all, for those of you who don't know him, has been working since I—since before I moved to Chicago, and I was a 23-year-old when I first met him. And somehow, I aged, and he didn't, which—[laughter].\nMr. Cooper. Your gray hair is not going back, I can tell you from experience.\nThe President. He was always the best looking priest in Chicago. So—[laughter]. But Father Pfleger has done heroic work at St. Sabina Parish.\nIssues like licensing, registration, that's an area where there's just not enough national consensus at this stage to even consider it. And part of it is, is people's concern that that becomes a prelude to taking people's guns away. I mean, part of the challenge in this is that the gun debate gets wrapped up in broader debates about whether the Federal Government is oppressive. And there are conspiracy theories floating around the Internet these days all the time. We did a military exercise in Texas—[laughter]—and a whole bunch of folks were sure that this was the start of martial law and were suggesting maybe don't cooperate with the United States Army in an effort to prepare so that if they get deployed overseas, they can handle it. But that's how difficult sometimes these debates are.\nBut there—but I want to pick up on some things where I think there should be consensus. One of those areas that I talked about at the speech, part of the proposal, is developing smart gun technology. Now, this is an interesting example. I don't exactly understand this, and maybe there will be somebody in the audience who explains it to me. Back in 1997, the CEO of Colt said we can design or are starting to develop guns where you can only use it if you've got a chip, so you wear a band or a bracelet, and that then protects your 2-year-old or 3-year-old from picking up the gun and using it. And a boycott was called against him, and they had to back off of developing that technology. The same with Smith & Wesson. They were in the process of developing similar technology, and they were attacked by the NRA as \"surrendering.\"\nNow, to me, this does not make sense. If you are a gun owner, I would think that you would at least want a choice so that if you wanted to purchase a firearm that could only be used by you—in part to avoid accidents in your home; in part to make sure that if it's stolen, it's not used by a criminal; in part, if there's an intruder, you pull the gun, but you—somehow, it gets wrested away from you, that gun can't be turned on you and used on you—I would think there might be a market for that. You could sell that gun.\nNow, I'm not saying that necessarily would be the only gun that's available, but it seems to me that that would be something that in any other area, in any other product, any other commercial venture, there would be some research and development on that because that's a promising technology.\nMr. Cooper. Can I—I want to——\nThe President. It has not been developed primarily because it's been blocked by either the NRA, which is funded by gun manufacturers, or other reasons. In part, what we proposed was, you know what, we're going to do some of the research. We'll work with the private sector. We'll figure out whether or not this technology can be developed and then give everybody a choice in terms of the kind of firearm that they want to purchase. Because I think that there will in fact be a market for that. And over time, that's an example of how we could reduce some of the preventable gun deaths that are out there.\nMr. Cooper. I want to bring in somebody who actually knows a lot about selling guns. I want you to meet Kris Jacob. He's vice president of the American Firearms Retailers Association. And he's the owner of the Bullseye Indoor Shooting Range and gun store in San Rafael, California. Kris, it's great to have you here. First of all, how is business under President Obama?\nThe President. Great.\nMr. Cooper. Because everything I read says gun sales have been going up. Every time he talks about guns, gun sales go up.\nBackground Check System/Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives/Enforcement of Gun Laws\nQ. It's been busy. And certainly, I think that shows, as Taya said earlier, that there's a very serious concern in this country about personal security. And the sheriff is right: They do everything they possibly can to make sure they get there as quickly as they possibly can. And my question is actually focused around law enforcement as well. There are 53,000 licensed gun dealers in the United States who stand behind the counter and say \"no\" to people all day.\nThe President. Yes.\nQ. We feel it's our responsibility to make sure that people who have a criminal past, people who are mentally ill or are having a bad day don't get possession of firearms.\nThe President. Right.\nQ. So we assist law enforcement all the time in the process of making sure that those things don't change hands inside our commercial market if they shouldn't. It's a very serious responsibility for us, and as a group, we take it very seriously.\nMy question is around the Executive order related to the investigators, the inspectors, the adding of 200 inspectors who are more on the auditing and record-keeping side. Why not add 200 ATF agents on the law enforcement side to keep the criminals and the bad guys out of the stores in the first place? I mean, the problem seems to me to be—you mentioned dealers who are less responsible than others, and certainly, it's possible that those folks are out there, but if we can enforce the laws that already exist, the tens of thousands of gun laws that are on the books right now, it might create a very significant deterrent in just getting those people in the stores.\nMr. Cooper. Kris, let me also point out the number of ATF agents during your administration has actually declined. So even if you hired 200 more——\nThe President. Yes, but not because of my budget, but because of——\nMr. Cooper. But even if you hired 200 more, it will get it to what it was right before you took office.\nThe President. Absolutely. Well, look, first of all, there are a whole bunch of responsible gun dealers out there. And my hope would be that those gun dealers would support making sure that everybody is following the same rules that they are. That's number one.\nNumber two is, we're not writing a new law. Only Congress can do that. This is about enforcing existing laws and closing what has grown into a massive loophole where a huge percentage of guns—many of whom end up being traced to crime—are not going through the responsible gun dealers, but are going through irresponsible folks who are not registered as doing business. And the whole goal here is to clarify and to put on notice that if you're a business, even if you don't have bricks and mortar, then you're supposed to register, and you're supposed to conduct background checks. So the issue is not where you do it, it's what you're doing. And that should not be something that threatens responsible gun dealers across the country.\nIn terms of the ATF, it is absolutely true that the ATF budget has been shrank because—has been shrunk—it's a little late—[laughter]—but you knew what I meant—[laughter]—and part of it is because the politicizing of this issue. So many in the Republican Congress feel as if the ATF is not their friend, but their enemy. Part of the story I was telling——\nMr. Cooper. You said this issue should be politicized though.\nThe President. Well, but what I mean by that, Anderson, is, is that they have been portrayed as trying to take people's guns away as opposed to trying to make sure that the laws are enforced. And one of the most frustrating things that I hear is when people say—who are opposed to any further laws—\"Why don't you just enforce the laws that are on the books?\" And those very same Members of Congress then cut ATF budgets to make it impossible to enforce the law.\nAnd so it is—and by the way, the ATF is a law enforcement agency working under the FBI that is doing enormous work in going after criminals and drug cartels and have a pretty dangerous job. So it's not as if doing background checks or auditing gun sales is all that they're doing.\nPart of my proposal is also developing better technologies so that we can do tracing of shells when a crime is committed in order to figure out who exactly are the perpetrators of the crime and where did they obtain the weapon. So there's a whole bunch of other elements to this that are going to be important. But my hope is, is that responsible gun dealers like yourself and your organization are going to be supportive of this proposal, because it should actually help push away unscrupulous dealers, and that means more customers for you guys.\nMr. Cooper. I want to bring in Mark Kelly. As you know, a former astronaut, husband of former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who, we're proud to say, is here tonight. Five years ago this week in Tucson, Arizona, Congresswoman Giffords was shot. Six others were killed. Captain, your question?\nFormer Representative Gabrielle D. Giffords/Gun Confiscation Fears\nQ. Well, thank you for being here, Mr. President. As you know, Gabby and I are both gun owners. We take gun ownership very seriously and really think about the voices of responsible gun owners in this debate. But I want to follow up to something Father Pfleger said and your answer to his question, and it's about expanded background checks. Often, what you hear in the debate of expanding background checks to more gun sales—and as you know, Gabby and I are 100 percent behind the concept of somebody getting a background check before buying a gun—but when we testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, we heard not only from the gun lobby, but from United States Senators that expanding background checks will—not may—will lead to a registry, which will lead to confiscation, which will lead to a tyrannical Government.\nSo I would like you to explain, with 350 million guns in 65 million places, households, from Key West to Alaska—350 million objects in 65 million places—if the Federal Government wanted to confiscate those objects, how would they do that? [Laughter]\nThe President. Well, look, first of all, every time I see Gabby, I'm just so thrilled because I had visited her in the hospital, and as I mentioned, I think, in the speech in the White House, as we left the hospital then to go to a memorial service, we got word that Gabby had opened her eyes for the first time. And we did not think that she was going to be here, and she is. And Mark has just been extraordinary. And by the way, Mark's twin brother is up in space right now—[laughter]—and is breaking the record for the longest continuous orbiting of the planet, which is pretty impressive stuff.\nWhat I think Mark is alluding to is what I said earlier, this notion of a conspiracy out there, and it gets wrapped up in concerns about the Federal Government. Now, there's a long history of that. That's in our DNA. The United States was born suspicious of some distant authority.\nMr. Cooper. But let me just jump in—is it fair to call it a conspiracy?\nThe President. Well, yes. Mr. Cooper. I mean, there's a lot of people who really believe this deeply, that they just don't trust you.\nThe President. I'm sorry, Cooper, yes it is fair to call it a conspiracy. What are you saying? Are the—are you suggesting that the notion that we are creating a plot to take everybody's guns away so that we can impose martial law——\nMr. Cooper. Not everybody, but there is certainly a lot of people——\nThe President.——is a conspiracy? Yes, that is a conspiracy. I would hope that you would agree with that. Is that controversial, except on some websites around the country?\nMr. Cooper. There are certainly a lot of people who just have a fundamental distrust that you do not want to get—go further and further and further down this road.\nThe President. Look, I mean, I'm only going to be here for another year. [Laughter] I don't know—when would I have started on this enterprise, right? [Laughter]\nI come from the State of Illinois, which—we've been talking about Chicago, but downstate Illinois is closer to Kentucky than it is to Chicago. And everybody hunts down there, and a lot of folks own guns. And so this is not, like, alien territory to me. I've got a lot of friends like Mark who are hunters. I just came back from Alaska, where I ate a moose that had just been shot, and it was pretty good. [Laughter]\nSo yes, it is a false notion that I believe is circulated for either political reasons or commercial reasons in order to prevent a coming together among people of good will to develop commonsense rules that will make us safer while preserving the Second Amendment.\nAnd the notion that we can't agree on some things while not agreeing on others and the reason for that is because, \"Well, the President secretly wants to do X,\" would mean that we'd be paralyzed about doing everything. I mean, maybe when I propose to make sure that unsafe drugs are taken off the market that, secretly, I'm trying to control the entire drug industry or take people's drugs away. But probably not. [Laughter] What's more likely is, I just want to make sure that people are not dying by taking bad drugs.\nGun Control Legislation/2016 Presidential and Congressional Elections\nMr. Cooper. You wrote an op-ed that just got published.\nThe President. Yes.\nMr. Cooper. A lot of people probably have not read it yet. One of the things you say in it is that you are not going to campaign for, vote for any candidate, regardless of what party they're in, if they do not support commonsense gun reform.\nThe President. Yes. I meant what I said. And the reason I said that is this: The majority of people in this country are a lot more sensible than what you see in Washington, and the reason that Washington doesn't work well in part is because the loudest, shrillest voices, the least compromising, the most powerful or those with the most money have the most influence.\nAnd the way Washington changes is when people vote. And the way we break the deadlock on this issue is when Congress does not have just a stranglehold on this debate—or, excuse me, the NRA does not have a stranglehold on Congress in this debate, but it is balanced by a whole bunch of folks: gun owners, law enforcement, the majority of the American people. When their voices are heard, then things get done. The proposals that we've put forward are a version—a lawful, more narrow version—of what was proposed by Joe Manchin and Senator Toomey of Pennsylvania, a Republican and a Democrat, both of whom get straight-A scores from the NRA. And somehow, after Newtown, that did not pass the Senate. The majority of Senators wanted it, but 90 percent of Republicans voted against it. And I'll be honest with you, 90 percent of those Senators didn't disagree with the proposal, but they were fearful that it was going to affect them during the election.\nSo all I'm saying is, is that this debate will not change and get balanced out so that lawful gun owners and their Second Amendment rights are protected, but we're also creating a pathway towards a safer set of communities—it's not going to change until those who are concerned about violence are not as focused and disciplined during election time as those who are. And I'm going to throw my shoulders behind folks who want to actually solve problems instead of just getting a high score from an interest group.\nMr. Cooper. We have time for one more question. And we talked about Chicago a little bit. We haven't really heard from young people tonight—no offense to those who have spoken. [Laughter] Because I'm in the same category as you all. Sorry, Father.\nThe President. You're a kid.\nMr. Cooper. There's a lot of kids, as you know, growing up in Chicago, fearful of walking to school, fearful of coming home from school.\nThe President. Yes.\nMr. Cooper. A lot of kids have been killed on buses. There's a lot of moms of kids who have been killed in the streets of Chicago. And I want you to meet Trey Bosley. He's 18 years old. He's a high school student whose brother Terrell was shot and killed nearly 10 years ago while he was helping a friend in a church parking lot. Terrell would have turned 28 years old on this Tuesday. What's your question, Trey?\nGun Violence Prevention Efforts/Gun Violence Research\nQ. Yes. As you said, I lost my brother a few years ago—well, 10 years ago. And I've also lost a countless amount of family members and friends to gun violence as well. And just speaking, growing up as a young Black teen in Chicago, where you're surrounded by not only just gun violence, but police brutality as well, most of aren't thinking of our life on a long-term scale. Most of us are either thinking day to day, hour to hour, for some, even minute to minute. I want to thank you for your stand against gun violence for not only the victims of gun violence, but those on the verge of being victims of gun violence. And my question to you is, what is your advice to those youth growing up surrounded by poverty and gun violence?\nThe President. Well, first of all, Terell, I couldn't be prouder of you. And I know—is that your momma next to you? I know she's proud of you right now. [Laughter] So good job, Mom.\nWhen I see you, Terrell, I think I about my own——\nMr. Cooper. Trey.\nThe President. Excuse me—Trey. When I see you, I think about my own youth, because I wasn't that different from you. Probably not as articulate and maybe more of a goof-off. But the main difference was, I lived in a more forgiving environment. If I screwed up, I wasn't at risk of getting shot. I'd get a second chance. There were a bunch of folks who were looking out for me, and there weren't a lot of guns on the streets. And that's how all kids should be growing up, wherever they live. I mean, my main advice to you is to continue to be an outstanding role model for the young ones who are coming up behind you. Keep listening to your mom. Work hard and get an education. Understand that high school and whatever peer pressure or restrictions you're under right now won't matter by the time you're a full adult and what matters is your future. But what I also want to say to you is, is that you're really important to the future of this country.\nAnd I think it is critical in this debate to understand that it's not just inner-city kids who are at risk in these situations. Out of the 30,000 deaths due to gun violence, about two-thirds of them are actually suicides. Now, that's part of the reason why we've—are investing more heavily also in mental health under my proposal.\nBut while the majority of victims of gun homicide are Black or Hispanic, the overwhelming majority of suicides by young people are White. And those, too, are tragedies. Those, too, are preventable. I'm the father of two outstanding young women, but being a teenager is tough. And we've all—remember the times where you get confused, you're angry, and then the next thing you know, if you have access to a firearm, what kind of bad decisions you might make. So those are deaths we also want to prevent.\nAccidental shootings are also deaths we want to prevent. And we're not going to prevent all of them. But we can do better. We're not going to, through this initiative alone, solve all the problems of inner-city crime. Some of that, as I said, has to do with investing in these communities and making sure there's good education and jobs and opportunity and great parents. And moral responsibility and ethical behavior and instilling that in our kids, that's going to be important.\nSo this is not a proposal to solve every problem. It's a modest way of us getting started on improving the prospects of young men and young women like you, the same way we try to improve every other aspect of our lives. That's all it is.\nAnd if we get started—as I said before, it used to be, people didn't wear seatbelts, didn't have airbags. It takes 20, 30 years, but you look, and then you realize all these amazing lives of young people like this who are contributing to our society because we came together in a practical way, looking at evidence, looking at data, and figured out: How can we make that work better?\nRight now Congress prohibits us even studying, through the Center for Disease Control, ways in which we could reduce gun violence. That's how crazy this thing has become. Let's at least figure out what works. And some of the proposals that I'm making may turn out are not as effective as others. But at least let's figure it out; let's try some things. Let's not just assume that every few weeks there's a mass shooting that gets publicity, every few months there's one that gets national publicity, every day there are a whole bunch of folks shot on streets around the country that we don't even hear about. That is not something that we can be satisfied with.\nAnd part of my faith and hope in America is just that—not that we achieve a perfect Union, but that we get better. And we can do better than we're doing right now if we come together.\nSo thank you.\nMr. Cooper. Mr. President, thank you very much for your time. [Inaudible].\nThe President. Appreciate it very much.", "timestamp": "2016-01-07", "title": "Remarks and a Question-and-Answer Session at CNN's \"Guns in America\" Town Hall Meeting in Fairfax, Virginia"}

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111385", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n**Please see below for a correction, marked with an asterisk.\n1:05 P.M. EST\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Happy Friday. Before we get started, we've spent a lot of time over the course of this week talking about the global economy and the impact on the U.S. economy, if any. And we got another important data point today that bears mentioning.\nWe did learn from the Department of Labor that the United States economy, in December of 2015, created 292,000 jobs. Now, that's obviously a good report. The revisions from the two previous months were good. You've heard me say on many occasions that we don't get too disappointed if there's one jobs report that doesn't meet expectations, and we don't get too excited when there's one jobs report that exceeds expectations. What we're looking at are the broader trends, and that is what I think the American people can be justifiably excited about.\nThe last two years have been the strongest two-year period of job creation since the last two years of the Clinton administration. That was 15 years ago now -- 16 years ago now. The decline in the unemployment rate over the last two years is the fastest two-year decline in the unemployment rate in 30 years. And included in this data was some additional information about wage growth -- something that has been drawing the intense focus of the President, of course.\nAnd what we have seen is that over the last 12 months, wages have grown by 2.5 percent, which is not quite as fast as we would like, but is the fastest rate of wage growth that we have seen since the end of the Great Recession. And that represents an important improvement in a key metric that we're going to continue to watch closely.\nSo with all that, Kevin, I'm happy to talk about that or other topics you would be interested in today. So why don't you fire away.\nQ: Well, I wanted to ask -- two Iraqi-born men who came to the U.S. as refugees have been arrested on terrorist-related charges by federal authorities in Texas and California. And some are arguing that perhaps this is an indication that the screening process for refugees is not stringent enough, that something maybe you missed with the screening process. Could you address that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, I have seen the announcements from the Department of Justice. Because they have ongoing investigations into these two individuals, I'm not going to be able to discuss specific cases from here. But there are a few things I can say generally that are relevant to that news.\nThe first is that you have heard me on a number of occasions describe how our law enforcement and our national security professionals work 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year to keep us safe. And they are incredibly skilled, they're patriotic Americans, and they have access to incredible resources. And they use all of that to keep us safe. And these cases in particular are good examples of how the Department of Homeland Security, the intelligence community, our law enforcement, and other national security agencies work effectively together to keep us safe.\nWhen it comes to refugees specifically -- this is something that we talked about quite a bit at the end of last year -- but there are some relevant facts that do bear mentioning. The first is that no one is allowed to short-circuit the system. The fact is that individuals who are admitted to the United States through the refugee process undergo the most rigorous screening of any individual that enters the United States. That includes careful review of biographic and biometric information that is both reviewed and collected. There are in-person interviews that are conducted. And in the context of that screening process, the burden of proof is on the applicant to demonstrate that he or she is credible, that he or she qualifies for refugee status, and is otherwise eligible to enter the United States.\nThere are a number of reforms that have been added to this screening system over the years that have made this system tighter and better. That includes adding additional databases that are used in the screening process. That means that there are databases that are maintained by the Department of Defense, the National Counterterrorism Center, a variety of other intelligence agencies. There are international law enforcement databases that are also maintained where this information is run through.\nAnd all of this is an indication of just how thorough that process is. I think the other thing that is relevant here is that means that there are substantial amounts of information about these individuals that is collected. That is information that, if warranted, based on information that's been obtained by law enforcement that can be then used to investigate individuals. Again, that's not something that you do willy-nilly, or based on a person's identity or their religion, but is something that can be -- it is information that can be used to investigate individuals if their behavior warrants it.\nAnd again, as we see in these two cases, we've got law enforcement officials working closely with national security officials to take steps to keep us safe.\nOne last thing. I know that these kinds of situations are likely to prompt calls from the other side that are now familiar, that suggest that the United States should somehow impose some sort of religious test or a test based on an individual's ethnicity to limit their ability to enter the United States. It doesn't represent who we are as a country. And most importantly, it's not going to keep us safe. That is our top priority. That is the top priority of our law enforcement officials. That's the top priority of our national security officials. And that's the top priority of the officials who manage the refugee system.\nSo all of this is consistent with our national security interests and consistent with the kinds of values that the United States has long stood for.\nQ: White House officials are meeting with the tech industry about how to disrupt the Islamic State group and other organizations. What exactly should the tech industry be doing better? Can you provide some specifics about what you're seeking from them?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, it is true that there are some senior White House officials, including the White House Chief of Staff; the President's top counterterrorism advisor, Lisa Monaco; the U.S. Chief Technology Officer, Megan Smith are participating in a meeting with a number of other senior national security officials in the U.S. government, including the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security.\nThis is a meeting that the President alluded to in his address to the nation last month that talked about the need for the government and counterterrorism officials and law enforcement officials, in particular, to work more closely with the technology community to fight terrorism. And this kind of meeting and this level of engagement is consistent with what the President called for.\nAnd the goal here is to find additional ways to work together to make it even harder for terrorists or criminals to find refuge in cyberspace. We've talked a little before that there is a precedent to this that law enforcement officials in the U.S. government have been able to work effectively with technology companies to combat child pornography. And there obviously is -- technology leaders are patriotic Americans. They don't have any desire for child pornographers or would-be terrorists to be using their tools and their technology to harm innocent people.\nQ: Any specific proposals from the White House to the tech industry that you are making?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the meeting hasn't started yet, so I certainly don't want to get out ahead of the meeting. But I do think there is an opportunity for there to be a robust discussion about ways we can make it harder for terrorists to leverage the Internet to recruit, radicalize, and mobilize supporters to carry out acts of violence.\nSurely we can have a discussion about ways to create, publish, and amplify content from credible sources that counteracts the radicalizing messaging from ISIL and other extremists. Given the way that technology works these days, there surely are ways that we can disrupt paths to radicalization, to identify recruitment patterns, and to provide metrics that allow us to measure the success of our counter-radicalization efforts.\nSo certainly the U.S. government and our national security and law enforcement officials have some ideas of things that they would like to discuss with the technology community. I'm also confident that leaders in the technology community are going to come with their own ideas about -- ideas about topics that should be on the agenda, and ideas for accomplishing the kinds of goals that I just enumerated. Clearly, there should be some common ground that we can find here between law enforcement, the United States, and these technology companies. And that will be the kind of conversation we're hoping to have later today out in California.\nAyesha.\nQ: So, shortly before we came in here, there were reports that a suspect in a shooting of a police officer in Philadelphia is saying that he did it in the name of Islam. Has the President been briefed on this matter? And are there concerns that this is another terrorist attack?\nMR. EARNEST: Ayesha, I'll tell you this is actually the first him hearing of it. I don't know whether or not the President has been briefed on it. But we can certainly check on it for you.\nQ: On another topic, some Democratic leaders in Congress are denouncing Homeland Security raids on recent undocumented people from Central America. They've asked the President to stop these raids. Is the President hearing these concerns? Are there plans to change strategy regarding these raids?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Ayesha, we're of course aware of these concerns. But the enforcement strategy and priorities that the administration has articulated are not going to change. And here's why. We have focused those enforcement efforts on high-priority areas that we have identified. That is specifically criminals, as you would expect. That's important in keeping our communities safe. That means individuals that have criminal convictions or a criminal history will certainly be prioritized for removal. This is consistent with the way we've described our priorities, that we are seeking to deport felons -- not break apart families.\nThe other area of priority that is important is to ensure that we're maintaining security at the border, and that means individuals who have only recently crossed the border are also priorities for removal. Now, the other thing to keep in mind is that these enforcement strategies and actions are consistent with the need to follow due process. And each of these individuals is considered on a case-by-case basis for any sort of humanitarian or asylum claims they may have to make. And their legal remedies are exhausted before they are deported. And, again, that is an indication that we are committed to working through due process on a case-by-case basis. That's relevant because you actually have a President of the United States who has worked hard to use his own executive authority to try to make that process more fair. After all, there are 700,000 people that have benefitted from DACA, from the -- these are DREAMers. The President has also sought to use his executive authority -- and this is an issue that's being litigated in the courts, potentially in front of the Supreme Court later this year -- to further expand the group of people who could be given the opportunity to remain in the United States.\nSo certainly the President is aware of this issue, is focused on making sure that we can have a more fair and just immigration system that I think just about everybody who looks at it agrees is broken. And the one way that we could solve this is for Congress to finally take overdue action to reform our broken immigration system. And we know exactly how to get that done. We've got a bipartisan agreement about how to get that done through the United States Senate but, unfortunately, House Republicans blocked that common-sense proposal despite the fact that it was supported by Democrats and Republicans all across the country, including leaders in the business community, leaders in the labor community, and leaders in the law enforcement community.\nQ: Finally, just a quick question. Going back to the arrest of the refugees, where are things at in the review of the fiancй visa program?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have an update for you on that process. I can tell you that it's ongoing. This is something that both the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security are working on together, but I don't have an update for you at this point.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, where is the tech meeting taking place?\nMR. EARNEST: It's taking place in San Jose, California. So these are senior White House officials and top law enforcement officials based here in Washington, D.C. that are traveling out to California to --\nQ: All of them?\nMR. EARNEST: I believe that there are -- we can get you some greater detail about who is actually participating in the meeting. But I believe that --\nQ: Are they talking part by way of video hookup?\nMR. EARNEST: There may be some. I can tell you that the White House officials that I described before are all going to be there in person.\nQ: How big a problem is it that a terrorist is using the Internet for radicalizing and recruiting?\nMR. EARNEST: We have seen that this is a tactic that more extremist organizations are attempting to use. And whether it is somebody who -- we have seen that ISIL, in particular, is using some sophisticated strategies to try to radicalize individuals around the globe. They're particularly effective at it but they're by no means the only extremists who have resorted to using these tools. We know that there are organizations like AQAP and other more closely linked al Qaeda affiliates that also use technology to try to recruit supporters and to inspire them to carry out acts of violence. So this is something that we're mindful of.\nThere are obviously a lot of complicated First Amendment issues and other things. But our sense here is that there is some common ground that we should be able to find with technology companies. As I mentioned before, many of these technology companies that are participating in the meeting today are run by patriotic Americans. And they certainly don't have any interest or desire in seeing their tools and their technology being used to aid and abet terrorists, or certainly make it easier for terrorist organizations to recruit followers and incite them to carry out acts of violence against innocent Americans. So we're committed to trying to find that common ground.\nQ: Can we expect a readout after the meeting?\nMR. EARNEST: We'll try to get you some more information about what exactly is discussed. I wouldn't expect any sort of breakthrough announcements or agreements to emerge from this discussion. But it certainly is only the latest in a series of discussions that the Obama administration has convened with technology leaders.\nWhen the President traveled out West to the Cybersecurity Summit on the campus of Stanford University last February, some of these issues were on the agenda. You'll recall that these were some of the issues that were discussed at the United Nations Security Council meeting that was convened at the most recent U.N. General Assembly back in September, where efforts to counter violent extremism were discussed. And some of the countering -- some of the strategies that are used by extremists online were part of that discussion.\nQ: It must be seen as a very urgent problem in order to dispatch officials at that level to a meeting out on the West Coast.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it is an indication that it is a priority of the President and of our national security team to counter the strategy that ISIL is so clearly pursuing online.\nQ: And are you referring to websites by ISIL and AQAP?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there are a variety of tools that we know that these extremist organizations use to try to disseminate their message, to try to recruit followers, and to try to inspire them to carry out acts of violence. So I think it's -- certainly some of it is social media, but some of it also the broadcasting of information. And as I mentioned in response to Kevin's question, there is a precedent for us to try to confront this kind of problem. We know that there are some people who try to make money based on the selling and trafficking of child pornography. And they're using websites to do that. And we've been able to work effectively with the tech community to counter those efforts. We, of course, haven't eliminated that practice, but we have enjoyed some success in countering it by working effectively with the technology community. And we're hopeful that we can do the same thing when it comes to countering the actions of extremists online.\nQ: Is encryption part of the agenda?\nMR. EARNEST: It's hard to imagine that it wouldn't come up. And this is a particularly thorny element of that discussion, but it's an important one nonetheless.\nThe President, as he's said on many occasions, believes in robust encryption. He believes that that is important to the success of this technology. But also he believes that's important to protecting the civil liberties and privacy of law-abiding Americans.\nBut at the same time, we can't allow terrorist organizations or extremists to be able to use communications online as some sort of safe haven that is beyond the reach of law enforcement and national security organizations. And so that certainly means that there are some complicated issues to work through. And the solutions aren't necessarily obvious. But what is obvious is that there should be some common ground between technology companies who certainly do not want to see their tools used to carry out acts of violence.\nCheryl.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. On the State of Union. And I did hear what you said yesterday about opportunities and challenges, but for those of us who love laundry lists, I'm wondering if you could give us any clues on policy directions or priorities that the President will be bringing up.\nMR. EARNEST: Not at this point. But let's talk again on Monday; maybe there's more I can do to help you.\nJustin.\nQ: Quickly, just back on the tech meeting. Is there any hope that even -- I know you said that you're not expecting an announcement here -- but of an eventual program that would help you guys more aggressively monitor and take down social media posts from terrorists or terrorist sympathizers? Is that the kind of goal of this?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the goal -- I don't know that there's a specific program that we would envision as a goal. I think the hope is that we would be able to find ways to work effectively with the technology community that would make it harder for terrorists to use the Internet to recruit followers and incite them to carry out acts of violence. So I don't know what form that will take. I'm confident that will be part of the discussion.\nQ: You still aren't interested in pursuing legislation on encryption specifically? And I'm kind of wondering if that continues to be the case.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, our policy on that has not changed.\nQ: Yes, why not? If this is such a kind of big issue, why kind of leave it up to tech companies to do it voluntarily?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, let me address that in two ways. The first is, as you point out, this is a complicated and big issue. And Congress has not demonstrated a lot of success in handling complicated big issues recently. So I wouldn't hold up sort of Congress as the ideal way to handle these kinds of things.\nThat said, as I pointed out, the reason that we want to work with the technology industry to try to address some of these problems is precisely because it's in their interest to do so. It is not part of their business model. It does not make them look good. It does not help them win more customers to be associated with these kinds of efforts.\nQ: Well, that's why they push back to some extent, right?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know.\nQ: On encryption, the idea of being that if they can provide a private platform so the government can't snoop in your emails, that that's a selling point.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, certainly being able demonstrate their ability to protect somebody's privacy I think is certainly good for their business model. Having that technology be used by terrorists, I'm not sure is. They would know better than I. I'm certainly not involved in running their business, and I'm not able to look at their numbers. But I do, however, speak with a lot of confidence in saying that the vast majority of these technology companies are run by patriotic Americans. And I do believe -- and you can go ask them -- they're more likely to have this conversation with you than they are with me, but I do have a lot of confidence that those companies that are run by patriotic Americans are not interested in seeing their tools or their technology used by terrorists to harm innocent Americans. That certainly is not what they were designed for.\nAnd we're hopeful that there would be a willingness on their part to work with us to try to find some solutions.\nQ: Can I ask about the President's campaign pledge in his New York Times editorial?\nMR. EARNEST: Please do. (Laughter.)\nQ: Yes. I'm just kind of wondering if you can put some parameters on that -- what a candidate would have to do or not do for the President -- or I guess what a candidate would have to do or not for the President to say I'm not going to vote for you, I'm not going to campaign for you, I'm not going to fundraise for you. And also how he would kind of extricate his actions with the DNC or the DSCC or whoever else in that.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't know that I have like a comprehensive list of outlines. But I think based on the discussion that we've been having over the last several days, you have a pretty good sense of what the President is talking about when he talks about common-sense gun safety measures. So these are things like closing the gun show loophole, or closing the no-fly, no-buy loophole. This is the loophole that -- at this point, there's no law that prevents somebody who is on the no-fly list from being able to walk into a gun store and purchasing a firearm. Surely, if the government has determined that it's too dangerous for you to board an airplane, then it should be too dangerous for you to buy a gun. This is another common-sense proposal that the President has in mind.\nIn the op-ed that you just cited, the President talked at some length about the responsibility that gun manufacturers have in gun safety, and there are some common-sense things that we believe that gun manufacturers could do. And there are certainly some common-sense things that -- well, there are certainly some things that Congress has done that don't fit common sense that have absolved gun manufacturers from assuming some of that responsibility. So those are some of the things that the President has in mind.\nQ: Bernie Sanders, for instance, voted against legislation that would have given liability to gun manufacturers -- or shielded them from liability. So if Bernie Sanders was the Democratic presidential nominee, the President wouldn't campaign for him?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I certainly noticed that Senator Sanders told one of your colleagues/competitors here when asked this very question he was eager to point out that Senator Sanders had made clear that he was willing to revisit that position. That's exactly the goal here, right? We want people to change their minds. We want members of Congress to start taking different positions.\nSo, again, I am not familiar with Senator Sanders's record, so maybe this is something that he said on many previous occasions. But if not, I'm ready to start taking some credit for changing some minds on Capitol Hill. Right? I mean, this is -- ultimately the goal here is to get a different outcome that better reflects the views of the American people.\nQ: What about somebody like Heidi Heitkamp, who was a big vote for you guys on TPA, and the President made a big point of saying, I'm going to go out and campaign and raise money for these people who put their neck out?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, there is no denying the fact that I think that when it comes to most issues, the President agrees with Senator Heitkamp on them, particularly when it comes to a whole range of economic issues and national security issues -- that there are a lot of reasons for them to be on the same page. But what the President made clear in that op-ed is that when it comes to this issue, he's prepared to be a single-issue voter. And he hopes that other people will, too.\nAnd he's hopeful that that will have an impact on the kinds of decisions that Democrats and Republicans make on this issue in the future when they're serving in the United States Congress and when they're called to vote on them.\nQ: Last one. Sorry for James Rosen-ing for a second, but -- (laughter) -- El Chapo apparently was just captured, and so I'm wondering if you've heard reports about that or have any update on that.\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't seen the -- I did not see that report before we walked out here, but we'll check on it for you.\nKevin, it seems only fair that I'm going to -- (laughter) -- it seems only fair.\nQ: Thanks.\nQ: Keep it short.\nQ: I will. (Laughter.) Short and pithy, right? I'm sure you saw the report in the Journal about the Hellfire that was sent to Europe and then somehow inadvertently was sent over to Cuba. Can you tell us what the President is aware of in that circumstance and how on Earth something like that could happen?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, Kevin, unfortunately, I cannot comment on specific defense trade licensing cases and compliance matters. Under the Arms Export Control Act, the Department of State licenses both permanent and temporary exports by U.S. companies of regulated defense articles. And U.S. companies are responsible for documenting their proposed shipping logistics in their export license application as well as reporting any shipping deviations to the department as appropriate. So obviously this is something that both the Department of Defense and the State Department are quite keenly aware of, I think as you would expect. And so for additional questions about this, I'd refer you to those two agencies. And just because of the ongoing casework here, I'm just very limited in what I can say about it.\nQ: If I could use a \"Josh-ism\" -- (laughter) -- as a general matter, how concerned is the White House about this report?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think you can tell, based on what I have read, that this is an issue that the administration takes very, very seriously, I think for quite obvious reasons. And because both the Department of Defense and State Department are, again, I think for obvious reasons, quite interested in getting to the bottom of what exactly happened, I'm pretty constrained in what I can say, but there may be more information that the Department of State or Department of Defense can share with you.\nQ: Let me ask you about the tech meeting, and I just want to kind of maybe take a slightly different look at it. If, on the one hand, the suggestion is maybe the White House and tech companies can partner to eliminate, if not curtail, the ability for some of these terrorism groups to recruit online, would the White House then be interested in doing the same thing as it relates to domestic terrorist groups, or groups that might also -- white supremacists or other groups that might domestically be recruiting others to potentially do harm to other Americans? In other words, are you going to take the same tack in both cases, or is this specific to overseas audiences? I'm just trying to understand.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me try to describe it to you this way. I think our goal here is to prevent any sort of extremist, any sort of terrorist -- whether foreign or domestic -- from using technology to carry out an act of violence against innocent Americans. And we're very interested in countering that from whatever source it emanates. I think the reason that we spend so much time talking about ISIL and their activities online is that they have shown a particular ability to use these tools to maximum effect. So that is certainly the threat that we are quite mindful of. But as you point out, taking the right steps and pursuing the right approach would allow us to make it harder for anybody to use these kinds of tools to encourage someone to carry out an act of violence.\nQ: But doesn't that get to the fundamental American ideal of free speech?\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah. There are certainly First Amendment issues here, but there are a variety of ways in which our First Amendment rights are curtailed. You can't yell \"fire\" in a crowded theater because that would potentially harm the people in the crowded theater. So I'm certainly not a First Amendment attorney, and I'm not denying that there are complicated issues here, but surely we can find some common ground when it comes to finding ways to prevent terrorists from using technology to harm innocent patriotic Americans.\nQ: Last one, on guns. It's sort of a full-court press. We saw the President make his announcement, and then of course the town hall, and now the op-ed today in the Times. I'm just curious, what's next? Why this approach, this sort of all-in approach? And how does the White House respond to criticism that even if everything that the President has proposed had been in place previously, it would not have impacted the circumstances that affected the country so dramatically last year?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, there are a couple other things that are coming. The President is convening a call later this afternoon with activists who share the President's passion for this issue, and having an opportunity to speak to all of them is an important moment. So I think all of you will have the opportunity to hear about that call.\nI also wouldn't rule out that this is the kind of issue that comes up in the President's State of the Union address. So we talked earlier this week about how the State of the Union is a large platform where the President is commanding the attention of both houses of Congress and any number of Supreme Court justices and members of the Cabinet. And I would expect that this is an issue that he'll bring to their attention, because he's surely focused on it.\nJim.\nQ: And on the issue of guns, I wanted to ask you about the President's town hall meeting last night during which the NRA did not participate. And the President seemed pretty frustrated about that and said that the NRA had been invited on multiple occasions to talk about this issue, discuss the issue. Would the President debate a high-level official from the NRA, engage in a public discussion with an official from the NRA if the opportunity were to present itself? Or do you think that was the opportunity last night, and the NRA missed its chance?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the NRA did miss their chance yesterday. And based on the response that they have offered up after the meeting, it doesn't seem like they're feeling very good about the way they looked by dodging the opportunity yesterday. Demonstrating their unwillingness to participate in a rational, measured, fact-based discussion of these issues that was taking place just a couple of miles from their national headquarters I think might be an indication that they don't have a lot of confidence in their case.\nSo they have had multiple opportunities to participate in events here at the White House and then to accept an invitation from CNN to attend yesterday's event, and they turned it down.\nQ: And has the President ever spoken with anybody from the NRA before, personally? Phone? I mean, it's just never happened?\nMR. EARNEST: Off the top of my head, I'm not aware of any specific conversations. I know that there is at least one instance where a representative of the NRA attended a meeting that was convened by the Vice President. That was a number of years ago. I'll note that the NRA walked out of that meeting trashing the Vice President in the efforts that the administration was pursuing at that time to take common-sense steps that would make our communities safer. So there certainly is ample reason to question the good faith of people at the NRA to engage in these kinds of discussions. But yet, that has not prevented us from inviting them to participate. And even then, those invitations have been rebuffed.\nQ: I wanted to find out what the administration is doing about these Syrian children. There have been images of starving Syrian children that have been in news reports over the last several days. I assume the President is aware of this, or the whole security team is aware of this or wherever -- the State Department. Is there anything the administration can do about these kids? Because the pictures are just horrible to look at.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, it's gut-wrenching. The situation inside of Syria and the impact that it is having on millions of innocent people is terrible. And that's the kind of violence and chaos that we're seeing millions of Syrians flee when they seek to enter any of the neighboring countries or to travel all the way to Europe. There's a reason that they're running away from their homes. And it is -- it's terrible. And it certainly is something that the President is mindful of, and I think that's why the United States you've seen once again step forward to play a leading role here. The United States is the largest bilateral donor of humanitarian assistance to try to meet the needs of those who are fleeing violence inside of Syria.\nQ: Is that assistance getting to these -- it seems like that assistance it not getting to these folks.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it's difficult, obviously, to get humanitarian assistance into a war-torn country like Syria.\nQ: You could be the top donor of humanitarian assistance, but if you don't have the wherewithal, the ability to get that assistance to those people, it seems like sort of --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there is some assistance that is getting into Syria. But, look, in a war-torn chaotic country like this where you've seen that the central government has utterly failed and extremists like ISIL have stepped in, there are consequences and they're grave.\nBut, look, the assistance that is provided by the United States is reaching some Syrians inside of Syria. We also know that there are millions of Syrian migrants that have fled to neighboring countries in the region. Countries like Jordan, even Turkey, are bearing a significant burden when it comes to trying to meet the basic humanitarian needs of those fleeing violence in Syria. And the United States has provided substantial financial resources to those countries as they try to meet the basic humanitarian needs of the Syrian people.\nQ: And getting back to Cheryl's question about the State of the Union, she asked about the laundry list. And I guess it was my understanding from listening to you folks over the last couple of weeks that this is going to be a nontraditional, unconventional State of the Union speech. There isn't a whole lot of time left to get a big laundry list done. So is the White House telling various agencies and departments, hey, hold off on these laundry lists, the President is going to go big picture on this one?\nMR. EARNEST: No. There is a lot that we have been able to accomplish over the last seven years. And typically, states of the union -- a State of the Union address will cover the important progress that's been made and there's a lot to talk about in that regard. The President also has a year remaining in office, and he is quite focused on making sure that we maximize the opportunity that exists during his final year in office to get a lot of important business done. Some of that is business that we'd like to get done with Congress. Some of it is business that we'll get done using the President's executive authority. And some of it is business that we'll get done by deepening our engagement with countries around the world and continuing to play the kind of leading role in the international community that has made the country safer and advanced our interests around the globe. So there's a lot to talk about in that regard.\nBut what the President will focus on in the context of the State of the Union speech are the kinds of challenges that are facing America over the long term. We're at a critical juncture in our history. We have made tremendous progress digging out of the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession. The jobs numbers that were released today are just the latest piece of evidence that testify to that progress. And now the question is, what are the kinds of decisions that we're going to make right now that are going to ensure that we're going to pass onto our kids and their kids the most prosperous, the most secure, the most fair United States that's ever existed. And those are the kinds of challenges that the President is looking forward to focusing on in the State of the Union.\nLauren.\nQ: Two questions. First of all, is it significant that Congress was able to get the repeal of the Obamacare bill to the President's desk, as the critics are saying? They're saying that this is the first time that has happened, and therefore this is significant.\nMR. EARNEST: No, it's not significant. It got them nothing. And with the stroke of a pen, the President dispensed with it.\nQ: And secondly, the Little Sisters of the Poor filed a Supreme Court brief against the federal contraceptive mandate, saying that the administration wants the petitioners to do precisely what sincere religious beliefs forbid, and ultimately that the brief claims that the government is violating federal law by speaking for the sisters in saying that the accommodation is compatible with their religious beliefs. Does the White House have any thoughts on that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we'll obviously have our own strong case to present to the Supreme Court about the steps that we have taken to ensure that we are balancing the religious liberties of Americans with the rights of other Americans to make their own decisions about their health care. And fortunately, there are a wide variety of federal judges all across the country that have agreed that this policy has been implemented appropriately, and that gives us a lot of confidence in the argument that we'll make before the Supreme Court.\nIsaac.\nQ: Sorry, I just want to come back to the Sanders issue for a second. You're pleased with the movement that he seems to have made about changing his mind?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I will acknowledge that I am not intimately familiar with the ins and outs of his record, and so it may be that this is a position that he has previously described -- a willingness to sort of revisit his previous support for liability legislation that benefits gun manufacturers. So I was being a little flip in talking to Justin. But look, if that represents a genuine change in his position as a result of the President's announcement, then that's great. But look, if he's --\nQ: And that's enough for the President to be comfortable to campaign for him if that's what it comes to?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as I just acknowledged, I'm not familiar with the ins and outs of his record. But if Democratic voters across the country confirm that he is the Democratic nominee, then I'm confident that we're going to spend some time here learning about his record and learning about what is on his agenda to make that decision.\nQ: But it was unintentional, the mention of the gun manufacturer liability issue in the op-ed as a -- since that's been an issue in the primary race, that wasn't something that was an intention from the White House to put in there as a factor in the primary race?\nMR. EARNEST: Correct. The President was quite intentional about raising this issue as it relates to gun manufacturers and how they have essentially abdicated their responsibility to ensure that their business practices and that their products are safe. But that was not any sort of secret or subtle signal to demonstrate a preference in the presidential primary.\nBut the President takes this seriously. And any candidate running for any office is going to have to demonstrate their commitment to these common-sense measures before they can expect to get the support of the President of the United States.\nQ: And I asked you the other day about whether he would campaign for Republicans who were pro-gun control -- a Pat Toomey or a Mark Kirk. You said then that you hadn't talked to the President about it. It seems like he's made up his mind about single-issue voting in sort of the positive -- or the negative sense. Like, he won't vote for people who are not with him on gun control. Have you discussed with him the prospect of supporting Republicans who are where he wants them to be on gun control?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, look, I wouldn't rule it out. But these kinds of elections are a test. And certainly the President will be considering the kinds of policies that are put forward by the Democratic candidate in those races. And look, if both candidates support the kind of common-sense gun safety measures that the President does, then that's great. That means the President's decision about who to support will then involve a consideration of a range of other issues. A consideration of those other issues probably doesn't stack up very well for a lot of congressional Republicans, including Senator Kirk and Senator Toomey.\nBut, look, the President is serious about this. And this certainly applies to presidential candidates, and it applies to candidates for both houses of Congress, but also to candidates further down the ballot, as well.\nQ: Earlier this week, Debbie Wasserman Schultz had an interview that was published, and she said that she wasn't as progressive on criminal justice reform issues as some people in the Democratic Party might want her to be. She is the DNC chair. Criminal justice reform is a priority for this White House and this year. Have you guys had any discussions with her about making sure that she's where you want people to be on this issue?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any detailed conversations that have taken place between the White House and Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz on this issue. And to be honest with you, I'm not quite familiar with the particulars of her position. But I think the thing that we are gratified by is that there is an emerging bipartisan consensus around a lot of the issues that are being discussed in Congress. And we certainly have tried to nurture that bipartisan agreement, and we'll be doing that in the weeks and months ahead.\nQ: As you push forward with this, do you want the chair of the DNC to be with the President, right?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we certainly will be making a strong case to everybody, including Democrats who are close to the President, that criminal justice reform, like the type that's being discussed by many members of the House and Senate, is consistent with the priority that the President has placed on making our country more fair, but also making our communities more safe.\nMr. Viqueira.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. Back on guns. And with an eye towards writing those curtain-raiser scripts and pieces for the State of the Union -- and a couple other issues, but first on guns -- is the President maxed out now on what he can do with the executive actions on gun control --\nMR. EARNEST: I think what I would say is, based on the most recent analysis that has been done, the answer to that question is, yes, the President has done as much as he can. That said, I wouldn't rule out that at some point over the next 12 months, that the President's team goes back to take another look to see if there's more that can be done. But I'll tell you that there's nothing that we're keeping in reserve in terms of additional actions that the President could take.\nQ: One other thing that's really outstanding on the President's agenda, and has been since the day after he took office, is Guantanamo Bay. What is the status of consideration there when it comes to the constitutionality of the President taking unilateral action or executive orders? Are those under consideration?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, first, let me just note, since you brought it up, that the Department of Defense has announced the transfer of an additional Guantanamo detainee to Kuwait. This individual was approved for transfer by the Periodic Review Board just last fall. And that actually brings now the number of Guantanamo detainees to 104. And it's a good illustration of our effort to chip away at the population there and to try to resolve these individual cases in a way that's consistent with our national security interests. That, ultimately, is what the President is focused on, which is keeping the country safe. And closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay would make us safer, and that's why it's a priority.\nAs it relates to the President's executive authority in accomplishing that goal, the President talked about this at his news conference that he convened three weeks or so ago today, in fact, to say that his focus right now is getting Congress to remove the obstacles that they have put in place of closing the prison. And I certainly wouldn't take any executive options that may or may not be available off the table.\nGardiner.\nQ: In Kuwait, the Saudi coalition has apparently used cluster bombs, which U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has suggested may amount to a war crime. The Yemeni government has also ejected the U.N. human rights representative. Do you have any reaction to either one of those things going on there?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of the U.N. announcement that you just referred to. I will just say that the -- as we've said for some time, the Saudis are justifiably concerned about the security situation in Yemen. They obviously share a border with Yemen. And they have legitimate concerns about that chaos having an impact on the security situation in their own country.\nAt the same time, the United States believes that diplomacy is what will lead to a satisfactory resolution of that situation. The U.N. has obviously been leading that effort. There were conversations in Switzerland back in December to try to advance a diplomatic initiative. And the parties to those talks are planning to reconvene next week, I believe. And we certainly are going to continue to encourage all sides to participate constructively in that process and try to bring the chaos and bloodshed in that country to an end.\nDevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I just want to go back to an earlier question on the incident in Philly. You said the President hasn't been briefed on this. But really, from seeing reports of it, it was just a terrible, scary incident caught on tape with the police officer ambushed; 13 shots point blank. And right before you came out, you didn't see it, but the chief said that this guy did it in the name of Islam. Can you just clarify, have the circumstances of this incident in any way reached the White House or the NSC? Is it on the radar?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Devin, I'll just say that I had not seen this before I walked out here. So as usually is the case, there are other people at the White House who are aware of this. It's just, given the tight turnaround here, it did not make its way to me.\nI can tell you that based solely on what you've described, it sounds like it is a good reminder of the debt of gratitude that we owe our men and women who serve in police departments all across the country. These are men and women who put on the blue uniform and put their lives on the line to try to keep our community safe. And the vast majority of them take that job very seriously. They do so with professionalism and courage. And we certainly owe them a debt of gratitude.\nQ: And thankfully, in this case, he survived. So some good news.\nMR. EARNEST: Excellent.\nQ: To follow on that, yesterday you referred to sort of a similar at the Paris police station as an \"attempted terror attack.\" You've just laid out you don't know the circumstances here, but how do you make that determination in an incident of this nature? And what goes into that? Can you just refresh what goes into how you would say that this is a terror -- attempted terror act?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, my understanding about the situation in France yesterday is that no one was harmed in that incident other than the assailant. And it was French law enforcement authorities that had said that based on what they knew about the situation, that it was a terrorist attack. And so that's what led me to say what I said yesterday. But obviously, once we have an opportunity to take a close look at these details, we'll let you know.\nQ: And if I could, on Hillary Clinton's emails, which has been an ongoing story -- as you know, overnight, the State Department released 3,000 pages at about 1:00 a.m. And one is getting some attention today; it's an email between Mrs. Clinton and her top aide, Jake Sullivan. And she's trying to receive some sensitive talking points via \"secure fax.\" And she writes, \"If they can't [fax them], turn into nonpaper [with] no identifying heading and send nonsecure.\" It's getting a lot of chatter from Mrs. Clinton's critics on this. But does the White House think it's appropriate to remove markings and send information in a non-secure format?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm just not aware of all the circumstances of what exactly transpired. But my guess is that the Clinton campaign has done some digging on this to try to understand the circumstances of this particular communication. So I'd refer you to them to get a better understanding of exactly what it says about the way that Secretary Clinton handled sensitive information.\nQ: But surely you'd say that removing markings that would -- on any document from anybody in the administration that was to be transmitted, to remove the marking of the classification of some kind would not be appropriate.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Devin, it is not uncommon for the administration, in pursuit of transparency, to release redacted information that if un-redacted were to otherwise be subject to some classification. So again, without knowing the details of what exactly was being discussed there, it's hard for me to comment on it.\nQ: Real quickly, the last thing. The organizers of the next Democratic debate have released their qualifying criteria today. And there has been some speculation that perhaps Martin O'Malley is sort of on the bubble. Mrs. Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and others have come out and said all three candidates should be on the debate stage. Does the President have a view? Should everyone be included in this next debate forum?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't talked to the President about this particular issue. Obviously, the President believes that a robust discussion among the Democratic candidates for President is good for the process, it's good for the party, and it's good for the country.\nObviously, the organizers of the debate, the DNC, and the media organization that's sponsoring the -- I don't know if it's an ABC debate or not -- but ultimately somebody -- ultimately those will be the parties that are involved in determining who should participate in the debate.\nRon.\nQ: It's an NBC debate.\nMR. EARNEST: Oh, okay. There you go. Tune in, everybody.\nQ: Just lastly, and I know it's late, but to follow up Jim's question about Syria and these terrible images of hunger -- the point of the reporting there, as I understand it, was that it's become identifiable how starvation is being used as a weapon in that war by both sides, a conscious military strategy, if you will. Given that, and given that the United States is a huge donor humanitarian aid and all that, yet this still happens, is there any -- does the President feel comfortable with this in the sense that there's no contemplation of a humanitarian mission to try and do more on a humanitarian if not military front to affect what's happening on the ground there? Because I know you've said repeatedly that you can't do safe zones, it's too many resources, so on and so forth. But clearly things are getting worse, not better.\nMR. EARNEST: That is true. Things have been -- the conditions inside of Syria for innocent civilians have been terrible for a long time and they're not getting better. And this is all -- the root of this failure goes back to the failed leadership of Bashar al-Assad. His willingness to carry out terrible acts of violence against his own people by dropping barrel bombs on innocent civilians has led this country to be torn apart at the seams. And we have seen extremist organizations like ISIL capitalize on that chaos to further the violence.\nAnd as is usually the case, innocent civilians are feeling the impact the most. And that is why you've seen such a robust response from the United States to be the largest donor of humanitarian assistance to put our credibility on the line to try to bring the international community together to try to find a -- to effectuate a political transition inside of Syria. Ultimately, Assad leaving power and a new credible government that reflects the will and ambitions of the Syrian people taking power -- that's an important way for us to start to end the chaos.\nThe President has also built an international coalition of 65 countries to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. And that kind of robust response is commensurate with the terrible humanitarian situation that we see inside of Syria.\nScott.\nQ: Josh, you spent some time this week talking about the auto sales in 2015. Yesterday, the University of Michigan told us that the average fuel economy of those cars were down from 2014, and in December it fell below 25 miles to the gallon. Is the White House concerned that your goal of doubling fuel economy by 2025 is moving in the wrong direction?\nMR. EARNEST: We still are confident that that is a goal that the U.S. fleet can achieve. I think what economists have observed is that seeing the prices at the pump, that more Americans are considering purchasing less fuel-efficient vehicles, like trucks and SUVs. I think what warrants mentioning is that those trucks and SUVs are much more fuel-efficient today than they were six or seven or eight years ago. And that is a response to the kinds of high standards that the President put in place.\nSo we do continue to see improvement, and there's more work to be done to meet the goal that the President set out. I think when the President is talking about this issue, he regularly encourages people to be mindful of the fact that the low gas prices that we're all enjoying and benefitting from now are not going to be there forever. And purchasing a fuel-efficient vehicle is -- when that's a legitimate option, is a good bet over the long term.\nBut ultimately we are making important progress when it comes to fuel efficiency, and a lot of that is due to the capacity for the American auto industry to innovate and put in place cutting-edge ideas that are bringing new technology that benefits the American people. And none of that would have been possible had the President not placed a really big bet on American auto workers and the American auto industry. And that big bet is paying off for those workers, for those companies, and most importantly, it's paying off for the country.\nLeslie.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I wanted to get back to the Hellfire missile that was found in Cuba. Senator Marco Rubio has sent a letter to the State Department calling it, \"astounding and inexcusable,\" that people are just finding -- members of Congress are finding out about it now, reading the newspaper. And he's asking a number of questions. And I'm wondering whether or not it came up --\nMR. EARNEST: My guess is he gets most of his information about what's happening in Congress through the newspaper, based on his attendance record.\nQ: Nevertheless --\nMR. EARNEST: Nevertheless.\nQ: I was wondering, he raises a number of questions and among them are whether or not -- I'm phrasing it a different way than he asks it, but whether or not the existence of the missile in Cuban hands was talked about during the negotiations in reestablishing diplomatic ties, and why it wasn't if it was not.\nMR. EARNEST: I actually don't have a lot of insight into that, so we can take a look at that for you. Right now, this is subject to an ongoing investigation by the State Department and the Department of Defense, so I'm very limited in what I can say about it.\nQ: Because it looks like it's something we wanted back. So would we have not brought it up when we were talking to them when we reestablished embassies?\nMR. EARNEST: All of that is unclear to me at this point. So I'm sorry I can't help you on that.\nPam.\nQ: Josh, I'm sorry if you've already said this before, but on closing Gitmo, you've said that a certain number of prisoners could not be released. What does the administration envision for them? Would they go to, like, supermax? Would they go to a domestic military base? What would happen to them?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, this is a question that is being considered by the Department of Defense. What we know right now is that continuing to house those individuals at the prison at Guantanamo Bay is prohibitively expensive and does significant damage to our national security. That's why the President is not the only national security expert to conclude that the prison at Guantanamo Bay should be closed. That's why people like President George W. Bush and other senior officials in the Bush administration who often don't agree with leaders in this administration about foreign policy issues, but in this case, they do agree that closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay is the right move because it makes us safer and it saves taxpayers money.\nSo what that means is it means that we should transfer those individuals that have been approved for transfer. So right now, the detainee population is 104. Let me try to put some figures on this. Forty-five of those individuals have gone through the process of having their case file carefully considered by the Periodic Review Board. And that Periodic Review Board has essentially ruled that, under the right circumstances, these individuals can be safely transferred to another country. Those circumstances often involve limitations on their travel, limitations on their communications, and other limitations that frankly are part of a range of security requirements. And so essentially you could almost cut the prison population in half by transferring those individuals. Obviously those kinds of transfers are the subject of protracted diplomatic engagements.\nBeyond that, there are 22 other individuals who have been referred for prosecution. So these are individuals in whom the -- either the Department of Justice or the United States military has concluded that they could build a strong legal case in one venue or another -- whether that's a military commission or an Article 3 Court. There are 27 individuals who are essentially in the category of continued detention, which means that they have not yet been cleared for transfer but their case is periodically reviewed by the Periodic Review Board. There are 10 other individuals who are facing criminal charges.\nSo at some point, these individuals -- most likely in the category of continued detention -- are likely to make up what some have described as an irreducible minimum at the prison there. And we're going to have to do something with them. And it is the view of the President's national security team that bringing them to the United States to a prison where they can be properly secured should not be an option that's automatically taken off the table. Because if not, it's not obvious where else they would go in a way that would satisfy the concerns that we have about our national security interests.\nSo this is part of what the Department of Defense has been working on for years, and this certainly is part of the plan that the Department of Defense is preparing at the request of the President and prepared to present to members of Congress.\nQ: But practically speaking, they would have to remain in the custody of the U.S. military at some place?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, there are a number of proposals that have been considered. I guess the other way I can talk about this is there have been public reports about visits that have been conducted -- site surveys that have been conducted by the Department of Defense personnel to detention facilities across the country. I know that they visited the Charleston Brig in South Carolina. They visited Fort Leavenworth in Kansas. And I know they visited at least one facility out in Colorado, as well.\nSo there are a number of potential facilities that could be used for this purpose. But ultimately, right now, Congress prevents that even being a realistic option.\nQ: Just now that we're in 2016 and a few days away from the State of the Union, how would you assess your ability to work with Congress on the issues that you think you might be able to get done, given the fact that you started off with an issue that's sort of angered some Republicans -- the gun measures -- and they've started off with the gutting of the Affordable Care Act and Planned Parenthood, resulting in a veto?\nMR. EARNEST: That's a good question. Last year, around this time, there were a lot of Republicans who -- Republican leaders in Congress who had suggested that the President had poisoned the well in being able to work with Congress by taking executive action to try to reform some elements of our broken immigration system. And this is something that Republicans vehemently disagreed with. But what the President's case was, was they said -- was he essentially said, we shouldn't allow a difference of opinion on one issue become a deal-breaker for all of the others. And that ultimately served as a useful way for us to work through a lot of these issues. There's no denying there's a lot more that we wish Congress had done last year. And there surely are a lot of things that we would like them to do this year that they're not going to do.\nBut the question is, are there things -- are there priorities that we share? Can we work together and build another bipartisan majority to ratify the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement? I hope so. There surely were bipartisan majorities in the Congress last year. Months after poisoning the well, Democrats and Republicans in both the House and the Senate came together and passed Trade Promotion Authority. We're hopeful that they'll do that again this year.\nI mentioned earlier that there has been a discussion about criminal justice reform. This is a priority of both Democrats and Republicans in the Congress, and the President is very interested in nurturing the bipartisan agreement that could lead to legislation that would make our communities safer and our criminal justice system more fair.\nSo if last year is any model, then we're hopeful that this will be a year where those areas where we agree, we'll be able to make some progress.\nBob.\nQ: Hey, Josh. Yesterday, Secretary of State Kerry indicated that Iran may be several days away from complying with the nuclear deal from last summer. Let me get the White House take on that by asking, is this the first moment of certification that they are complying with? I'm assuming there are, of course, long-range checks in this whole agreement. But are they complying? Is this the time to start removing the sanctions?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Bob, what we have said is that Iran has to comply with all of the sanctions *it's JCPOA commitments, and the IAEA has to verify that they have completed and complied with the sanctions *the commitments before Iran receives any sanctions relief. So the onus here, including on timing, is on the Iranians.\nQ: Are they days away?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I don't actually have a detailed assessment of sort of where things stand. We know that there are additional steps they need to take.\nThey did a couple weeks ago do something important. One key element of the agreement was seeing the Iranians reduce their stockpile of enriched uranium by 98 percent, and the Iranians did announce a week or two ago that they had completed the loading of 25,000 pounds of enriched uranium aboard a ship that was then sent to Russia. That was an important part of the progress that they need to make to comply with the agreement.\nBut there is more work to be done. And the agreement can only be implemented when the Iranians have finished their work and given the IAEA sufficient access to verify that that work has been completed. Then, and only then, will we begin implementing the agreement and giving the Iranians the kind of sanctions relief from the tough international sanctions that we know they deeply desire.\nQ: Any delay or stalling on their part, do you think?\nMR. EARNEST: I think, if anything, the Iranians have been working quite aggressively to take these steps so that they can get the benefits of the agreement. But it means that they've had to do some serious things. They had to slash their stockpile of enriched uranium by 98 percent. Right now Iran does not have enough nuclear material in Iran to make even one nuclear weapon.\nBut in addition to that, there are a range of steps that they needed to take to essentially gut the core of their heavy water reactor, plutonium reactor. There are a number of steps that pertain to unplugging centrifuges, and a number of steps that they need to take to ensure that the IAEA can do the kind of rigorous monitoring that is part and parcel of this agreement that gives us confidence that this agreement will succeed in preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\nSo those are all steps that need to be taken before Iran starts to get any of the benefits that are associated with the deal. Okay?\nQ: Thank you, Josh.\nMR. EARNEST: Tara, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: I wanted to ask about the irreducible minimum, because you talked about, with Guantanamo, about these prisoners that are going to be transferred maybe to the United States. You mentioned Fort Leavenworth. So I'm sure you know that people in Kansas have been complaining about this. They've been writing letters, some of the elected officials. So I'm wondering if you've tried to reach out to any of these places where the prisoners -- where the detainees might get transferred to.\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any sort of community-level outreach that's been done. Right now, Congress has in place significant obstacles that prevent the transfer from moving forward.\nWhat I can say is that at Fort Leavenworth there are already a number of very dangerous people who are being detained in that prison there, people who have been convicted of a variety of violent crimes. So the reason that is -- that Department of Defense officials even visited that community is because of the expertise that they have demonstrated in housing individuals in conditions that protect the country and even protect the community. So that's the reason that I mentioned it.\nLet's do a week ahead here. We should start first with the important event that will take place on Saturday. The Kansas City Chiefs, winners of 10 in a row -- (laughter) -- will take the field against the Houston Texans down in Houston. I will be rooting for the Chiefs to enjoy the first playoff victory in the NFL playoffs in I believe it's 22 years. Little-known fact -- I actually attended that playoff game. I was a freshman in college at the time. That's how long ago it was. But anyway, I don't know what the President is doing on Saturday; I'll be rooting for the Chiefs on Saturday. (Laughter.)\nOn Monday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.\nOn Tuesday, as you all know by now, the President will deliver his final State of Union Address at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. Of course, as usual, the Vice President, the First Lady, and Dr. Biden will all attend.\nOn Wednesday and Thursday, the President will travel to Omaha, Nebraska and then Baton Rouge, Louisiana. While he's visiting those two fine communities, the President will highlight the progress that's been made in each state since he took office and talk about how we can continue to take action in the next year to move the country forward. I know the President is looking forward to those visits.\nAs a part of both of those visits, the President will spend some time in smaller settings visiting with members of the community, in addition to addressing larger crowds in both of those communities. So like I said, we'll have more to say about that next week.\nAnd then on Friday, the President will be back here at the White House and attending meetings here.\nQ: Josh, are there any other stops on Wednesday and Thursday?\nMR. EARNEST: No, just those two communities before the President returns to the White House on late Thursday afternoon, I believe.\nAll right? With that, I wish you guys all a good weekend. And go Chiefs. (Laughter.)\nEND 2:22 P.M. EST", "timestamp": "2016-01-08", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}

The plan offers five commonsense principles that empower parents and support teachers. The plan is available for download here.\nDr. Carson's plan restores American exceptionalism in our schools by focusing on five key principles: provide school choice to families, empower local communities, encourage the innovative spirit of educators, reward good teachers and create a streamlined student loan process.\nGrowing up in dire poverty in the inner cities of Detroit and Boston, Dr. Carson knows education is the great liberator. His mother understood the value of education and was empowered to make decisions for her sons that changed the course of their lives. The Carson Education Plan provides families and school administrators with the tools necessary to improve the educational opportunities of their students.\n\"Dr. Carson's education plan returns America's education system to top tier global status by returning the power back to the people who know best: parents and local school systems,\" said Carson's Nevada State Director Jimmy Stracner. \"By contrast, ill-conceived liberal reforms like Common Core have worked to create a centralized education system that gives the federal government control over decisions and policies that should be made at the local level.\"\n\"The hallmark of Dr. Carson's education plan is empowering parents and local communities to make the best decisions for their children,\" said Carson's Iowa State Director Ryan Rhodes. \"Like Dr. Carson, I believe that parents in Cedar Rapids and Des Moines are better capable of improving educational opportunities for their students than bureaucrats in Washington.\"\n\"My mother had little education, but she understood the great power that education has in changing life for the better,\" said Dr. Ben Carson. \"My prescription for achievement takes politics and politicians out of education reform and puts it back in the hands of We the People.\"\n\"The plan not only empowers parents, but it also rewards effective teachers. A great teacher can make all the difference in a student's life. I've seldom met a successful person who can't point to a teacher who played a significant role in their success. The stakes are too high and we owe it to our children to restore our educational system to global preeminence.\"", "timestamp": "2016-01-08", "title": "Press Release - Dr. Ben Carson Announces Education Plan"}

{"author": "Jeb Bush", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=112383", "text": "The federal government continues to waste hard-working taxpayers' dollars while failing to help poor Americans rise out of poverty. The current welfare system is so broken that it not only fails those on welfare, but it contributes to a sense of unfairness among non-welfare recipients, who feel they work hard yet support a system that does not encourage work.\nUnder President Obama, the weakest economic recovery since World War II has only made matters worse. Today, 6.8 million more Americans live in poverty than when President Obama took office. Nearly one-in-five households worry that the food they can afford will run out before the end of the month.\nWorse, economic mobility — the hallmark of a successful economy and the backbone of the American dream — is woefully low for poorer Americans. Over 40 percent of children growing up poor remain poor as adults. That is a rate of economic mobility no better than half a century ago — before the 'War on Poverty' began.\nThe facts show that economic growth is the best anti-poverty program we have. Under President Obama, the \"new normal\" of 2 percent economic growth limits opportunities for poor Americans — and Secretary Clinton only offers more of the same. That is why Governor Bush has developed a pro-growth economic agenda to fix our nation's broken tax code, end burdensome regulations and develop an energy policy that will meet the needs of a growing economy. The result will be 4 percent economic growth — double President Obama's dismal record — rising middle class wages and 19 million new jobs.\nSustained, strong economic growth is only half of the equation for expanding opportunity and reducing poverty. To ensure all Americans have the right to rise, we must also develop policies that support the ingredients to permanently exiting poverty — work, family and education. Currently, our education system fails the poor and the nation's social safety net discourages work and weakens families. To fix our education system, Governor Bush has a forthcoming plan to close the opportunity gap and make sure all children have access to a quality education.\nLikewise, Governor Bush believes the nation's welfare programs need radical reformation. The only way forward is to start over and create a 21st century safety net. His empowerment agenda will fix the nation's safety net by:\n* Giving Control Back to the States — The current one-size-fits-all approach to welfare policy gives Washington D.C. too much power and fails to meet the needs of impoverished families. That has to change. Governor Bush will eliminate bloated, destructive welfare programs and give control back to the states through a block grant so they can better meet the needs of poor families.\n* Promoting Work — Too many of our safety net programs are based on the mistaken belief that simply writing bigger checks will increase opportunity and upward mobility. But we know that a job is the best way to improve the lives of poor individuals and families. Governor Bush's plan promotes work by ending program requirements that discourage work, requiring work for able-bodied welfare recipients and doubling working tax credits for childless filers (EITC). This will not only benefit welfare recipients, it will also ensure that hardworking Americans are no longer forced to subsidize those capable of work.\n* Cutting Waste and Abuse — The nation's safety net is subject to considerable waste, fraud and abuse. This is unfair to the taxpayers who fund the program and to the poor families who need help. Governor Bush's plan cuts the waste and abuse in welfare programs by doing more to verify recipients' income. His plan will also eliminate billions of dollars in wasteful spending by cutting federal administrative costs.\n* Strengthening Families — The most effective anti-poverty program is a strong, two parent family. But today our welfare programs not only fail to promote marriage and the importance of two active and consistent parents in children's lives, they also have reduced efforts to ensure that single parents receive child support from absent parents. As president, Governor Bush will ensure that safety net programs encourage marriage. His administration will end welfare programs that penalize marriage and instead support marriage and parenting improvement programs. Governor Bush will also reinvigorate our nation's child support enforcement system to ensure hardworking single moms get the support they deserve.\nFailing the Poor: The Current State of the Social Safety Net\nThe lack of economic opportunity for impoverished Americans comes at a time when welfare caseloads are at an all-time high. In 2000, 17 million Americans received assistance from the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly Food Stamps). Today, the number of beneficiaries has increased by nearly 30 million to over 46 million. In 2014, the federal government provided housing assistance for nearly 10 million Americans. And over 4 million Americans currently receive cash assistance through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, and related state programs.\nThe nation's failure to reduce poverty is a consequence of a confusing, poorly designed social safety net. Our welfare programs fail to encourage work, weaken families, are rife with waste and abuse, and do not work well together.\nProblem #1: Programs Discourage Work\nThere is no better way to eliminate poverty than through a good-paying job. A job provides money, as well as the necessary work and life skills needed to rise out of poverty. It sets an example for children, increasing upward mobility in the next generation. However, our social safety net shows a surprising disregard for getting people back into the workforce. This creates an unfair system where Americans not receiving assistance work hard to make ends meet, but those receiving assistance are not encouraged to work their way toward independence.\nSupplemental Nutritional Assistance Program — SNAP is the nation's largest food security program. While the program alleviates poverty and reduces food insecurity, it does so at a very high cost to recipients. SNAP includes an effective tax on working where every extra dollar in earnings above certain levels reduces benefits by 24 cents. SNAP is supposed to require able-bodied adults without dependents to engage in full-time work. However, states with high unemployment rates have been granted waivers from this requirement. In 2015 — more than six years since the official end of the recession — 28 states plus Washington D.C. still have statewide waivers and an additional 13 states have partial waivers. These waivers help explain why only 16 percent of the 4.5 million households with able-bodied adults without dependents receiving assistance report any earnings.\nTemporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) — TANF, the product of the bipartisan Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunities Reconciliation Act of 1996, was successful in reducing poverty and promoting independence through a renewed focus on work and temporary assistance. Over the years, though, the program has become less concerned with getting people out of poverty and into work. There are work requirements in TANF, limiting assistance to families who do not enter the workforce after a specified amount of time. But, these work requirements are often too weak to effectively encourage recipients to find permanent employment. In 2012, the official work participation rate for TANF recipients was only 34.4 percent.\nHousing Assistance Programs — Poor families may be eligible for rental subsidies or federally financed public housing programs. With few exceptions, federal housing assistance does not require work. Like SNAP and TANF, housing assistance creates an implicit tax on working. For every dollar of earnings, benefits typically fall by 30 cents. That is one reason why only half of the working age, able-bodied housing assistance recipients receive the majority of their income through work.\nProblem #2: Programs Undermine Families\nPoverty in the United States is heavily concentrated among single-parent families. Single-mother families are four times as likely to be impoverished as married couples. Over 60 percent of impoverished families are headed by single individuals, most of them women.[xiii] Yet, the nation's safety net programs fail to promote marriage and some actively discourage it.\nSingle parenthood has an impact on the economic mobility of children as well. After controlling for demographics, young men (age 28-30) from intact families earn $6,500 more than other young men, while young women from intact families earn $4,700 more. Children of intact families are more likely to graduate from high school, and they work more hours once they enter the labor force. Single-parent families are much more likely to use federal assistance programs than married families.\nToo many of our nation's federal and state welfare policies impose financial penalties on marriage. Economists Adam Carasso and C. Eugene Steuerle have written, \"Most transfer programs for low-income families with children contain mainly marriage penalties — the additional income introduced by a spouse generally reduces or even ends benefits received before marriage.\"\nWhile the welfare system discourages marriage, Governor Bush understands that marriage is not possible in every family. However, parents must still take responsibility for their children's well being. Single parents with custody of their children need financial support from the absent parent. Currently, too many hardworking single mothers are not getting the support they deserve.\nFor poor families especially, child support collections are an important resource making up a substantial portion of their income. But the percentage of custodial mothers who receive support has dropped significantly over the past decade. A growing number of single mothers in poverty are not being served by child support services and are not getting the financial support they and their children need. In Florida, Governor Bush led efforts to nearly double child support collections in the state.\nProblem #3: Programs Waste Taxpayer Dollars\nTaxpayers' money is too often wasted. In 2014, the Government Accountability Office estimated that 24 percent of the $60 billion in earned income tax credit (EITC) payments were improperly paid. Combined with housing assistance and SNAP, more than $18 billion in improper payments were made in 2014. This is unfair both to the hardworking Americans who deserve assistance and to the taxpayers who fund the program.\nThe abuses go beyond improper payments. Legislation has also made it easier for states to increase SNAP enrollment to individuals with assets above existing limits.[xix] This means more SNAP dollars are going to those who can provide for themselves, wasting taxpayer dollars and creating more dependency.\nProblem #4: Programs Are Not Coordinated\nThe nation spends over $400 billion annually on non-health related low-income assistance programs. Including health care programs, there are at least 82 different programs, and these programs often work against one another. This exacerbates the large work and marriage penalties found in many programs. Poor coordination also wastes taxpayer money by increasing opportunities for graft and abuse.\nPoorly-coordinated programs can be a barrier to rising out of poverty because \"benefit cliffs\" — situations where public benefits decrease very quickly when a person's income rises by a small amount — discourage work and increased earnings. Funds restricted for use in one way are used to treat the assigned symptom, but too often, these interventions fail to take a complete view of a person's individual needs or develop a new path forward.\nPoor coordination among programs also magnifies marriage penalties. One study that examined multiple safety net programs found large marriage penalties for families across the income spectrum. A couple with two children with a household income of $20,000 faces a marriage penalty ranging from $1,800 to $8,900, depending on the state and the division of earnings.\nEmpowering Families: Fixing the Safety Net\nThe nation's welfare programs are hopelessly broken. The programs fail to encourage work, hurt families and cost taxpayers billions of dollars in waste and abuse. We must do better. Governor Bush's empowerment agenda for the 21st century will end wasteful welfare programs, give power and money back to the states and empower recipients by focusing on work and families. His plan will create a safety net that protects hardworking Americans when they fall but no longer traps families in perpetual dependence. A safety net where work pays more than welfare, and power does not rest with Washington D.C.\nGiving Money and Control Back to the States\nGovernor Bush will replace the current major means-tested welfare programs with Right to Rise Grants to states. States will have the opportunity to develop programs and benefits that best meet the needs of their impoverished citizens. The grants will replace the following programs:\n* Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program\n* Temporary Assistance for Needy Families\n* Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers\n* Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance\n* Public Housing Programs\nThese programs amounted to nearly $130 billion in federal spending in FY2013, or 32 percent of the non-health anti-poverty budget. The grants will be given in proportion to how much a state and its residents currently receive from these assistance programs.\nRight to Rise Grants will give states more flexibility in how services and benefits are delivered. As the former governor of Florida, Bush understands first-hand that states are the laboratories of democracy. He implemented innovative reforms across the state's low-income assistance programs. For example, Florida received federal Medicaid waivers that allowed the state to increase choice and provide Medicaid recipients with more control over their healthcare. Providing states with more flexibility will open the door for transformative ideas to eliminate poverty and increase opportunity.\nAdditional flexibility will also allow states to better target assistance. Each poor family faces unique circumstances and challenges. This is especially true across different states. Poverty in California looks different than poverty in Ohio or South Carolina, but our nation's current safety net insists on a one-size-fits-all approach. Under Bush's plan, states will partner with local government and community organizations to tailor programs that best meet the needs of their citizens.\nThe grants will not be an open-ended entitlement to states. Instead, states will be required to meet several conditions before they qualify for the grants. States must:\n* Identify Benchmarks for Success — Too many federal and state welfare program bureaucrats measure the success of their programs by the size of their caseloads. Instead, states will develop quantifiable goals based on how well their programs get people back to work and out of poverty. In addition, states will be expected to develop outcome-based goals to reduce out-of-wedlock births and promote marriage. To measure their progress, states will be expected to develop improved and streamlined records.\n* Prioritize Assistance — These grants must primarily go to families living in poverty. States will not be permitted to redirect federal dollars to other projects unrelated to alleviating poverty. Likewise, states must not use these grants to offset existing state expenditures.\n* Institute Real Work and Time-Limit Requirements — States will adopt strong work requirements and reasonable time limits for able-bodied adults. To ensure a robust safety net for those who have severe employment barriers and challenges, such as especially low skill levels, states will be permitted to exempt a minority of beneficiaries from these requirements. The reform will provide additional funding in the event of an economic downturn.\nThe federal government will partner with states to ensure low-income families are not adversely affected during the transition to the new system. In addition, evidence suggests that residential mobility is important in expanding opportunities for low-income families.[xxiv] States will accordingly be encouraged to coordinate with each other to allow for greater portability of benefits.\nMost safety net programs were designed decades ago and have never been meaningfully reformed. Combined with Governor Bush's health care proposal, Right to Rise Grants will bring the nation's safety net into the 21st century. This holistic approach will encourage innovation among the states, allowing them to develop new technologies and approaches to eliminating poverty. The result will be a system better equipped to meet the immediate needs of recipients and improve economic mobility for low-income families.\nPromoting Work\nFull-time employment is key to permanently exiting poverty. That is why Right to Rise Grants will include real work requirements for able-boded adults. Emphasizing work among recipients, though, is only half the answer. The plan will also make sure work pays for low-income families and individuals. Hillary Clinton and other democrats argue that we can increase take-home pay by simply increasing the minimum wage, but this only makes it harder for low-income Americans to find a job. Instead, Governor Bush will increase take-home pay by lowering taxes for working Americans.\nGovernor Bush's tax plan will deliver immediate tax relief for working families. Under his plan, a married family of four earning under $40,000 will pay no income taxes. Single individuals will pay no income taxes on the first $15,000 earned. Businesses will have more incentive to invest and expand, ultimately leading to higher wages and more jobs.\nTo further increase take-home pay, Governor Bush will expand the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). The credit has been shown to be successful in getting people into the workforce. However, the credit currently offers meager work incentives for childless filers. Childless filers below age 25 are not eligible for the credit, and the benefit for childless filers ages 25 to 64 is capped at $503. Governor Bush will double the size of the credit for childless workers. This means childless workers will face a zero marginal tax rate when entering the workforce even after accounting for payroll taxes. The proposal will also expand the credit to younger filers who are not enrolled full-time in school.\nEliminating Fraud and Abuse\nGovernor Bush will also adopt reforms to reduce the waste in safety net programs. With more than $18 billion in improper payments in EITC, SNAP, and housing assistance programs, there is no doubt that reforms are needed in their own right, and also to protect the budget.\nThe EITC expansion will be paired with needed reforms to cut down on the waste and abuse of the credit. To ensure the credit is not abused, Governor Bush's tax plan will institute commonsense reforms, including:\n* Verify Income — Some filers overstate or understate their income to maximize their credit. Currently, the IRS will often give refundable tax credits before even receiving tax forms that would verify a filer's reported income (e.g. W-2, form 1099), in essence creating an honor system. Governor Bush's plan will require the IRS verify a filer's reported income matches W-2s and other forms reported by employers and vendors. This will reduce overpayment and ensure filers only receive the credit they are eligible for.\n* Check Other Assistance Programs — Records from other assistance programs can corroborate a tax filer's information. Evidence suggests that providing the IRS access to SNAP records could help identify filers who may have improperly claimed dependents. Under the Right to Rise Grants, states will be expected to maintain more detailed information on recipients. These records will be used by the IRS to further reduce improper EITC payments.\nAllowing SNAP and housing assistance to be eliminated will end the abuse and misuse of federal taxpayer money in these programs. By ending these programs and replacing them with Right to Rise Grants states will have the authority and incentive to eliminate the fraud and abuse endemic in existing programs. Taxpayer dollars are also wasted on expensive federal bureaucracies that administer these programs. By giving control back to states, Governor Bush will eliminate the need for these Washington D.C. bureaucracies — saving taxpayers money and furthering the governor's goal of cutting the federal bureaucracy by 10 percent.\nStrengthening Families\nGreater flexibility for states, as well as a much stronger emphasis on work, will go a long way toward improving our nation's anti-poverty programs, but Governor Bush believes even greater gains will come when we have reestablished a societal norm centered on the importance of two active and consistent parents in the lives of children.\nThere is a growing bipartisan consensus that a two-parent family is key to reducing poverty. A recent report by the American Enterprise Institute and the Brookings Institution made it clear: \"Marriage is more than an instrumental good; it is more than a mechanism through which households receive two incomes. Marriage matters.\"\nTwenty-five years of extensive research and evaluation have shown that marriage matters when it comes to reducing poverty and increasing opportunity. Children raised in married intact families do better than children raised in single parent families on a whole host of measures including graduation rates, criminal justice involvement and earnings as adults. But too often in discussions of poverty, this vital issue is left out of the discussion. It won't be in Governor Bush's Administration.\nIn addition to reducing marriage penalties in welfare programs, Governor Bush's approach will have three main components:\n* Promote Marriage — Governor Bush will promote marriage as the most reliable route to family stability and resources. As president, he will join with other political leaders, educators and civic leaders in being clear and direct about how hard it is to raise children without a committed co-parent. In the same way that leading institutions advise us to abstain from smoking, eat healthy foods, get plenty of exercise, read to our children, volunteer, and finish school, they should advise young people to postpone having a child until they have a stable partner and are ready to be parents.\n* Develop Parenting Skills — Governor Bush will encourage parenting skills and practices, especially among low-income parents. In recent years, evidenced-based programs have shown success at improving outcomes for children by enhancing the parenting skills and practices of their parents. States will be encouraged to use a portion of their Right to Rise Grants to support and expand these programs.\n* Invest in Future Fathers — Governor Bush will promote skill development, family involvement and employment among young men so that they can be better fathers. The governor recognizes that too often, our welfare programs have operated as if poor men and especially poor fathers were unneeded, or worse, unwanted. To reduce poverty through stronger families, Governor Bush will focus special attention on improving skills, labor force participation and parental involvement of young men so that they can be more reliable and effective fathers. This includes expanding the EITC to childless filers to promote work among young men.\n* Invigorate the Child Support Enforcement System — As president, Governor Bush will help single parents who currently do not receive child support payments from absent parents. He will refocus the child support enforcement system on its core mission: the collection of child support payments — set at levels commiserate with the income of the absent parent. He will also extend the reach of child support by ensuring that single parent recipients of benefits provided from Right to Rise funding are referred to, and expected to cooperate with, child support enforcement efforts.", "timestamp": "2016-01-08", "title": "Press Release - Empowerment Agenda for the 21st Century"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111393", "text": "To the House of Representatives:\nI am returning herewith without my approval H.R. 3762, which provides for reconciliation pursuant to section 2002 of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2016, herein referred to as the Reconciliation Act. This legislation would not only repeal parts of the Affordable Care Act, but would reverse the significant progress we have made in improving health care in America. The Affordable Care Act includes a set of fairer rules and stronger consumer protections that have made health care coverage more affordable, more attainable, and more patient centered. And it is working. About 17.6 million Americans have gained health care coverage as the law's coverage provisions have taken effect. The Nation's uninsured rate now stands at its lowest level ever, and demand for Marketplace coverage during December 2015 was at an all-time high. Health care costs are lower than expected when the law was passed, and health care quality is higher—with improvements in patient safety saving an estimated 87,000 lives. Health care has changed for the better, setting this country on a smarter, stronger course.\nThe Reconciliation Act would reverse that course. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the legislation would increase the number of uninsured Americans by 22 million after 2017. The Council of Economic Advisers estimates that this reduction in health care coverage could mean, each year, more than 900,000 fewer people getting all their needed care, more than 1.2 million additional people having trouble paying other bills due to higher medical costs, and potentially more than 10,000 additional deaths. This legislation would cost millions of hard-working middle-class families the security of affordable health coverage they deserve. Reliable health care coverage would no longer be a right for everyone: it would return to being a privilege for a few.\nThe legislation's implications extend far beyond those who would become uninsured. For example, about 150 million Americans with employer-based insurance would be at risk of higher premiums and lower wages. And it would cause the cost of health coverage for people buying it on their own to skyrocket.\nThe Reconciliation Act would also effectively defund Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood uses both Federal and non-federal funds to provide a range of important preventive care and health services, including health screenings, vaccinations, and check-ups to millions of men and women who visit their health centers annually. Longstanding Federal policy already prohibits the use of Federal funds for abortions, except in cases of rape or incest or when the life of the woman would be endangered. By eliminating Federal Medicaid funding for a major provider of health care, H.R. 3762 would limit access to health care for men, women, and families across the Nation, and would disproportionately impact low-income individuals.\nRepublicans in the Congress have attempted to repeal or undermine the Affordable Care Act over 50 times. Rather than refighting old political battles by once again voting to repeal basic protections that provide security for the middle class, Members of Congress should be working together to grow the economy, strengthen middle-class families, and create new jobs. Because of the harm this bill would cause to the health and financial security of millions of Americans, it has earned my veto.\nBARACK OBAMA\nThe White House,\nJanuary 8, 2016.", "timestamp": "2016-01-08", "title": "Message to the House of Representatives Returning Without Approval the Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act of 2015"}

Portman will serve as a National and Ohio Co-Chair of Kasich's campaign.\nPortman and Kasich served in the U.S. House of Representatives together and were both elected to statewide office in Ohio in 2010. They have worked together for more than two decades on behalf of Ohio and share a commitment to the conservative policies that create opportunities for all Americans to rise.\nPortman issued the following statement:\n\"I have decided to endorse Governor John Kasich for President because he is a leader who has a proven record of delivering results. John turned Ohio around at a tough time and I believe he can do the same for our country. I have known John for over 20 years and consider him a good friend. John inherited a mess from former Governor Ted Strickland. Under Governor Strickland, Ohio lost over 350,000 jobs and ranked 48th in job creation, as companies left Ohio for other states. Applying Ohio commonsense and conservative values, Governor Kasich worked with the Republican team to turn a record $8 billion shortfall into a $2 billion surplus, cut taxes by $5 billion, and added over 385,000 new jobs. Governor Kasich has done a great job leading Ohio's comeback, and I believe he is needed now to do the same for our country as the next President of the United States.\"\nKasich said: \"Rob is a tremendous asset for Ohio in the Senate and has played an important role in the recovery of jobs for our state. We worked together as I helped Ohioans recover from the mess left behind by my predecessor and Rob's opponent, Ted Strickland, and I'm very proud to have his endorsement. Rob is a rare voice for common sense in Washington and someone who delivers real results. I look forward to him returning to the Senate and working with him as President to advance the strategies that keep our economy strong and our country safe.\"\nDuring his career Portman has earned the respect of colleagues on both sides of the political aisle for his work on IRS reform, balanced budgets, drug prevention, land conservation, welfare reform and to tear down trade barriers to U.S. exports.\nAs a National Co-Chair of Kasich's campaign, Portman will join former U.S. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-MS), former U.S. Senator John E. Sununu (R-NH), conservative stalwart Gay Gaines and influential entrepreneur Larry Paul in helping guide the Kasich campaign's nationwide efforts.

As a U.S. congressman, Kasich said, he once fought against the Pentagon's request for 132 B-2 bombers to be built at a $1 billion apiece. He pushed for 13, and Congress ultimately agreed on 20.\n\"The Pentagon is inherently bureaucratic and wasteful. We build things we don't need, and it takes too long to get anything built,\" Kasich said. \"The dollars we have to put in the military are precious. If we blow it on red-tape bureaucracy, then we're cheating the men and women in the military, but we definitely need to spend the money.\"\n———\n\"The Republican Party is my vehicle and not my master,\" Kasich said to one of the biggest applauses of the afternoon. \"It's all respect.

Moreover, North Korea is more of a force for instability in the region, a crucial one with a number of close U.S. allies, than ever before.\nThis failure must be replaced with a policy of strength and clarity: Stop the giveaways, ratchet up the pressure on North Korea's leaders and their Chinese supporters, back up our allies in the region, restore critical funding to our missile defense programs, and promote human rights and access to outside information within North Korea.\nAs President, Marco will:Counter North Korean Aggression\n*  End the policy of rewarding North Korean provocations and nuclear blackmail with new rounds of concessions;\n*  Work with allies to disrupt North Korean nuclear and missile proliferation by interdicting ships or aircraft suspected of carrying material related to North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs;\n*  Impose crushing new sanctions on the North Korean regime, including freezing the overseas assets of the North Korean leadership, sanctioning international entities and individuals that continue to do business with the regime, and disrupting illegal sources of income, from drug smuggling to counterfeiting and illicit arms sales;\n*  Pressure China to stop propping up the Kim family by demonstrating to Beijing that continuing to do so will result in greater U.S. and allied presence around the peninsula;\n*  Deter North Korean hacking and cyberattacks against American companies and the government.\nRestore North Korea to the State Sponsor of Terrorism List\n*  Unless it ceases supporting state sponsors of terror like Iran and Syria, including through such entities as the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, North Korea would be re-designated a State Sponsor of Terrorism.\nBolster Deterrence\n*  Rebuild our nuclear deterrent and strengthen U.S. missile defenses and offensive capabilities in the region by coordinating with our allies to deploy the THAAD system to South Korea;\n*  Reestablish missile defense, especially homeland missile defense, as a national priority by fielding more interceptors, providing additional radar, and leveraging new technologies to intercept the most sophisticated missile threats;\n*  Enhance cooperation with and among regional allies, such as South Korea and Japan.\nPromote Human Rights and Democracy\n*  Provide support to North Koreans by helping them gain access to the outside world, bolstering counter-information efforts, and sanctioning North Korea for its brazen human rights violations;\n*  Declassify information about North Korea's apparatus of repression and highlight the specific North Korean leaders involved in human rights abuses;\n*  Ensure that human rights no longer take a backseat to concerns about North Korea's nuclear program and militarism.\nMarco has Taken Time off the Campaign Trail to Push for New Sanctions on North Korea: Read More HereOn Video\nOp-Eds and Speeches\nMarco Shines a Spotlight on North Korea's Horrors (National Review, April 14, 2014)", "timestamp": "2016-01-09", "title": "Press Release - READ: Marco Rubio Lays Out Detailed Plan to Stand Up to the Lunatic in North Korea"}

Bernie Sanders challenged Hillary Clinton to support his proposal to boost Social Security benefits and strengthen the retirement program for decades to come.\nUnder Sanders' plan, the wealthiest Americans who make more than $250,000 a year would pay the same share of their income into Social Security as everyone else. Current law now caps the amount of income subject to payroll taxes at $118,500.\n\"I hope that Hillary Clinton joins me because I believe that we've got to stand with seniors,\" Sanders told the crowd of 160 at the Jasper County Community Center. Clinton has said raising the cap is \"something we should look at\" but she has stopped short of endorsing the proposal. She also has left open the possibility that she would support raising the retirement age at which seniors become eligible for Social Security. \"I would consider it,\" she told a town meeting in New Hampshire last Oct. 28.\nSanders' proposal to lift the cap would raise taxes only on the wealthiest 1.5 percent of Americans. The new revenue would expand Social Security benefits by an average of $65 a month, increase cost-of-living adjustments and lift seniors out of poverty by boosting benefits for low-income beneficiaries.\nFor only the third time in 40 years, seniors on Social Security this year are not receiving a cost-of-living increase. Sanders' legislation would increase COLAs by accurately measuring the spending patterns of seniors. Under current law, the consumer price index used to calculate annual benefit adjustments does not accurately reflect how inflation in health care costs and prescription drug prices impact seniors.\nMore than 616,000 people in Iowa – nearly 20 percent of the population – receive about $9 billion annually through Social Security. The benefits go to more than 430,000 seniors, 78,000 people with disabilities and more than 38,000 Iowa children.\nSanders also detailed plans to lower prescription drug prices, which soared more than 12 percent in 2014, the biggest jump in a decade. He has introduced a bill in the Senate authorizing the U.S. Health and Human Services Department to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies. Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland introduced a companion bill in the House. The measures also would make it legal to import less expensive drugs from Canada and other countries.", "timestamp": "2016-01-09", "title": "Press Release - Strengthen Social Security, Rein in Drug Prices, Sanders Tells Iowa Seniors"}

Ted Cruz of Texas, the leaders in their party's field of candidates in Iowa and New Hampshire, according to a memo by Sanders' pollster Ben Tulchin.\nThe analysis of public polling on the White House race also yielded these key points:\n* Sanders is viewed more favorably by Americans than any other candidate for president from either party.\n* He is regarded as the most honest and trustworthy candidate of either party.\n* Sanders is popular with independents while Clinton fares poorly with that bloc of critical swing voters in general elections.\n* He is very popular with younger voters and can galvanize them to turn out, helping Democrats up and down the ticket.\n* Republicans favor Sanders far more than Clinton.\nSanders popularity is largely due to his positive reputation. \"Sanders enjoys the most positive profile of any 2016 contender and would begin a fall campaign with room to grow,\" according to Tulchin. His memo cites a new Field Poll in California which found Sanders' favorability was greater than Clinton's by a margin of 15 points.\nWhile most voters view Sanders as honest and trustworthy, two recent polls found that Clinton is distrusted slightly more than Trump. A December Quinnipiac University poll found Trump was distrusted by 58 percent of voters. Fifty-nine percent distrusted Clinton. The Economist/YouGov poll from the same time found Trump distrusted by 50 percent of voters and 52 percent distrusted Clinton.\nSanders also is the strongest Democrat against the leading Republican candidates. \"The main factor responsible for Sanders' superior performance against Trump is that the senator from Vermont performs much better with independents,\" according to Tulchin. The Quinnipiac University poll found Sanders beating Trump by 14 points with independents, while Clinton beat Trump by only 2 points with independents, a critical bloc in general elections.\nYoung voters remain a key to Sanders' strength. Notably, Tulchin wrote, Quinnipiac found that voters under age 35 view Sanders favorably by a 44-point margin (58 percent favorable to 14 percent unfavorable) while CNN found he was viewed favorably by voters in that age group by a 32-point margin (55 percent favorable to 23 percent unfavorable).\nIn a new Fox News poll released on Friday, Sanders is ahead of Hillary Clinton 50 percent to 37 percent among New Hampshire Democratic primary voters. Sanders lengthened his lead since November, when he was up by just one point (45 percent to 44 percent). Sanders outpolled Clinton in head-to-head matchups against the leading Republican candidates in another new poll in New Hampshire released on Friday by Public Policy Polling. Sanders averaged nine points better than Clinton in the general election match ups. He defeated Trump by 20 points.\nTo read the memo, click here.", "timestamp": "2016-01-09", "title": "Press Release - Polls Show Sanders Gives Democrats Best Chance to Win White House"}

In the case of Garland, Texas, Islamic terrorists could have taken unknown numbers of lives if it were not for the brave traffic officer who stopped their attempted attack.\"\nBelow is an excerpt and the full op-ed may be viewed here.\nOn Thursday evening, Edward Archer approached Philadelphia Police Officer Jesse Hartnett and proceeded to shoot at him 13 times. Friday morning, he professed to have done so in the name of Islam and it's reported that he has pledged his allegiance to ISIS.\nThis violent attempt to murder a law-enforcement officer is in keeping with ISIS's ongoing effort to attack those whose job it is to keep America safe, as we have seen in Fort Hood, Boston, and Chattanooga.\nYet in the wake of another attack in the name of radical Islamic terrorism, it is unfortunate that we have already seen so many officials bow down to political correctness rather than recognize the existential threat of radical Islamic terrorism to our very way of life.\nWe must defeat radical Islamic terrorism, and that starts by calling it by its name. And we must stand with law enforcement against those who seek to do us harm.\nThe same night that Officer Hartnett was shot in Philadelphia, terrorist suspects were arrested in Sacramento and Houston with the help of state and local law enforcement. These events underscore just how essential our officers are in keeping Americans safe and free.\nLaw enforcement forms a thin but powerful line protecting us not just from violent criminals, but from terrorists on our own soil. In the case of Garland, Texas, Islamic terrorists could have taken unknown numbers of lives if it were not for the brave traffic officer who stopped their attempted attack.\nWe must thank every officer for their service, not make excuses for the terrorists trying to kill them. Saturday is National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day (LEAD). It is an opportunity to stand emphatically with our police force and to express our gratitude for their bravery, especially in a national climate that has been hostile towards our men and women in blue.\nBy contrast, not only does President Obama refuse to call radical Islamic terrorism by its name, he has also perpetrated a national movement to vilify the very officers who keep our communities safe from this threat. He has nominated an individual to a top Department of Justice post who had represented and lionized a cop killer, and in 2015, he said \"There are some police who aren't doing the right thing.\" He continued, \"We can't just leave this to the police,\" suggesting that he should stand as the judge and jury in convicting police officers.\n...\nI am reminded of the memorial service I attended a few months ago in my hometown of Houston for Deputy Darren Goforth, an officer who was shot while he was at a gas station. At the service, thousands of officers dressed in blue filled the sanctuary. Dr. Ed Young, the pastor of Second Baptist Church, powerfully observed that in the Old Testament the Levites, the priests, wore blue. And he drew from the Lord's Prayer to describe the core mission of police, and in particular, one phrase in the Lord's Prayer: \"Deliver us from evil.\" That is the mission statement of our police — to deliver us from evil in the most horrifying moments of our lives.\nSo today, and every day, let us stand unequivocally with the brave men and women of law enforcement and thank them for their service. And let's ensure that we remain safe by honoring our blue heroes with the respect and gratitude they deserve.", "timestamp": "2016-01-09", "title": "Press Release - ICYMI: CRUZ: Law-Enforcement Officers 'Deliver Us from Evil'"}

Seven years ago, the American auto industry was on the brink of collapse. Plants were closing. Hundreds of thousands of workers were getting laid off from jobs that had been their ticket to a middle class life. And as the pain spread across the country, another 1 million Americans would have lost their jobs in the middle of the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes.\nSome said it was too late to turn things around. But I refused to turn my back on so many of the workers that I had met. Instead, I placed my bet on American workers. I placed my bet on American manufacturing. In exchange for help, we demanded responsibility. We said the auto industry would have to truly change, not just pretend that it did. We got labor and management to settle their differences. We got the industry to retool and restructure. Everyone had some skin in the game.\nOur plan wasn't popular. Critics said it was a \"road to socialism,\" or a \"disaster\" waiting to happen. But I'd make that bet again any day of the week. Because today, the American auto industry is back. Since our plan went into effect, our automakers have added more than 640,000 new jobs. We've cut the Detroit-area unemployment rate by more than half. The Big Three automakers are raising wages. Seven years ago, auto sales hit a 27-year low. Last year, they hit an alltime high. Later this month, I'll visit the Detroit Auto Show to see this progress firsthand. Because I believe that every American should be proud of what our most iconic industry has done.\nIt's not unlike what America overall has done these past 7 years. Our businesses are now on a 70-month streak of job creation, with more than 14 million new jobs in all. We've revamped our schools and the way we pay for college. We've made historic investments in clean energy and put ourselves on a path to a low-carbon future. We've brought more than 17 million Americans into our health care system, seen health care prices grow at the lowest rate in 50 years, and covered more than 90 percent of our people for the very first time. We've even cut our deficits by nearly 75 percent in the process.\nThe point is, America can do anything. Even in times of great challenge and change, our future is entirely up to us. That's been on my mind while I'm writing my final State of the Union Address. And on Tuesday, I'm going to talk about the choices we have to make to set this country firmly on an even better, brighter course for decades to come.\nThanks, and have a great weekend.", "timestamp": "2016-01-09", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}
{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111431", "text": "DICKERSON: We're going to get right to our lead guest, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is in Chappaqua, New York, this morning.\nGood morning, Secretary Clinton.\nI want to start with politics. We're going to talk about a lot today, but let's start with politics. A new NBC/\"Wall Street Journal\"/Marist poll says in Iowa it's 48-45, you over Sanders. You were once way ahead. So, what's happening?\nCLINTON: Oh, John, you know these polls go up, they go down.\nI stay pretty focused, as I think we all should, on what we have to do to build on the progress of the Obama administration, but go even further. And that's why I have outlined a very significant agenda to raise wages and to take on the gun lobby and to be making America safe in every way that I can.\nAnd those are some of the differences that I have with my primary opponents, and certainly very deep differences with all the Republicans running.\nDICKERSON: This week, another batch of your e-mails were released by the State Department.\nOne of them is a back-and-forth between you and a staffer about a secure fax that won't come through. And you directed him to -- quote -- \"turn into non-paper with no identifying heading and send nonsecure.\"\nAren't you ordering him to violate the laws on handling classified material there?\nCLINTON: No, not at all.\nAnd as the State Department said just this week, that did not happen. And it never would have happened, because that's just not the way I treated classified information. Headings are not classification notices. And so, oftentimes, we're trying to get the best information we can.\nAnd, obviously, what I'm asking for is whatever can be transmitted, if it doesn't come through secure, to be transmitted on the unclassified system. So, no, there is nothing to that, like so much else that has been talked about in the last year.\nDICKERSON: So, in no instance -- what is striking about that particular e-mail is it suggests you were very facile with how to do this, this process. You knew the instructions about how to get around the restrictions for sending classified information.\nSo you're saying there was never an instance, any other instance in which you did that?\nCLINTON: No. And it wasn't sent. So, I think this is another instance where what is common practice -- namely, look, I need information. I had some points I had to make. And I was looking for a secure fax that could give me the whole picture.\nBut, oftentimes, there's a lot of information that isn't at all classified. So, whatever information can appropriately transmitted unclassified often was. That's true for every agency in the government and who everybody does business with the government.\nBut the important point here is, I had great confidence, because I had worked with Jake Sullivan for years. He is the most meticulous, careful person you could possibly do business with. And he knew exactly what was and wasn't appropriate.\nAnd, in fact, as the State Department has said, there was no transmission of any classified information. So, it's another effort by people looking for something to throw against the wall, as you said in the beginning of the program, to see what sticks. But there's no there there.\nDICKERSON: Well, this one is a little different, since the FBI is investigating this specific question of whether a classification was meddled with.\nLet me ask you about another e-mail in this batch, which was one in which you seemed to express surprise that somebody e-mailed on their non-State Department personal e-mail, which is what you were doing. Why was that a surprise to you?\nCLINTON: Well, I e-mailed two people on their government accounts, because I knew that all of that would be part of the government system.\nAnd, indeed, the vast majority of all my e-mails are in the government system. So, that's how I conducted the business. I was very clear about e-mailing anything having to do with business to people on their government accounts.\nDICKERSON: On gun control this week, you have been pretty tough on Bernie Sanders, specifically on the question of legal protection to gun manufacturers.\nHe has now said that he would be interested in looking to changing the law to allow -- to go after gun manufacturers who act irresponsibly. So, isn't that what you want?\nCLINTON: No, that's not what I want. And that's not what the country wants. And that's not what President Obama called for. And I think he has been consistently refusing to say that he would vote to repeal this absolute immunity from any kind of responsibility or liability.\nIt's the only industry in our country where we have given that kind of carte blanche to do whatever you want to do with no fear of legal consequences. You know, President Obama and I and Senator Sanders were all in the Senate at the same time. Two of us voted against what the NRA says was the most important piece of legislation in 20 years for the gun lobby. Senator Sanders voted with them, and through this morning has been unwilling to join the president and me in saying that this should be repealed. That has to be the effort that we all are behind. And he often says, well, look, I'm from Vermont and it's different. It's not like being in New York City.\nWell, in fact, the other senator from Vermont, Senator Leahy, voted with President Obama and myself. So, I think that the excuses and efforts by Senator Sanders to avoid responsibility for this vote, which the NRA hailed as the most important in 20 years, points up a clear difference.\nAnd it's a difference that Democratic voters in our primary can take into account. Who is going to really stand up to the gun lobby, try to deal with the scourge of gun violence that takes 90 people's lives a day? I'm pretty clear on what I will do. And I support and will work hard to implement what the president has been advocating.\nDICKERSON: On Senator Sanders' response, this idea that he represents a state which there are lot of gun owners, you were a senator. You -- aren't you sympathetic to that? You said you represented Wall Street, and that's what shaped your views on certain Wall Street policy. And you have suggested that, as president, you would be different than you did as senator, when you were representing a state with a constituency.\nCLINTON: Well...\nDICKERSON: So, why isn't it fair for Bernie Sanders to say, as president, I would be different than I would as a senator representing a state with a lot of gun owners?\nCLINTON: Well, you know, I think you have really mixed up two important issues here.\nI have been consistent on gun lobby restrictions. In fact, I supported the Brady Bill. Senator Sanders voted against it five times. So, there is a very clear difference.\nAnd when it comes to Wall Street, yes, I represented New York. And I was proud to do so. And I took on Wall Street. I'm the person who came out against derivatives. I'm the person who came out calling for restrictions on CEO pay, which, thankfully, got into the Dodd- Frank bill.\nI'm the person who went to Wall Street and actually confronted them in 2007. I called them out on the role they were playing in the mortgage market. So, I do have a history of taking on what I consider to be the abuses that come from any industry, including Wall Street.\nAnd I will continue to do so as president. And the proposal that I have put forth about how we rein in the excesses of Wall Street, so we never again face what we did in 2008, has been judged as being more comprehensive, tougher, more effective by Barney Frank, by Sherrod Brown, my friend from Ohio who leads the banking efforts in the Senate, and by Paul Krugman. So, I have plan that will go after not just the big banks, because Dodd-Frank has given us the tools to do a lot of that, but to go after the so-called shadow banking industry.\nDICKERSON: Right.\nCLINTON: And I think I'm well-prepared. I know what needs to be done. It's kind of like Nixon going to China, John.\nDICKERSON: All right, Senator, let me ask you about a general election opponent you may face. That is Donald Trump.\nYou got into a pretty ugly exchange. You charged that he -- you charged him with sexism, and then he put out an Instagram video of your husband and Monica Lewinsky. Your reaction to that?\nCLINTON: Well, if he wants to engage in personal attacks from the past, that's his prerogative. You know, so be it.\nI'm going to draw the distinctions between where I stand and where he stands when it comes to equal pay for women, raising the minimum wage, which affects two-thirds of the women, who are the ones receiving the minimum wage, protecting a woman's right to make the most personal health care decisions.\nThat's why I'm so proud to have the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund that I received today in New Hampshire, because I'm going to fight as hard as I can against any efforts to defund Planned Parenthood, something that he supports.\nSo, there are very clear distinctions. He can say whatever he wants to about me. Let the voters judge that. But I am not going to let him or any of the other Republicans rip away the progress that women have made. It's been too hard-fought-for. And I'm going to stand up and make it clear there's a huge difference between us.\nDICKERSON: Secretary Clinton, what do you say, though, to those even in your own party who say that -- a discussion of that portion of your husband's career is fair game to talk about in an election?\nCLINTON: Well, it's been fair game going back to the Republicans for some years. They can do it again if they want to. That can be their choice as to how to run in this campaign. Didn't work before. It won't work again, because it is what people are focused on, not for the past, but for the future.\nWhat are we going to do to get wages rising? What are we going to do to create more good jobs? What are we going to do keep rights? What are we going to do to make sure that the Supreme Court has people on it who will defend women's rights, who will defend marriage equality, who will defend voter rights?\nSo, I can't run anybody else's campaign. They can say whatever they want. More power to them. I think it's a dead end, blind alley for them, but let them go. I'm going to talk about the differences between us, because I think that's what Americans care about. DICKERSON: Secretary Clinton, I'm afraid we're at a dead end ourselves and out of time. [laughter]\nDICKERSON: Thanks so much for being with us.\nCLINTON: Thanks.

Want your nation, your community, your home to be safer? Vote for a governor for president.\nSenators are talkers. They're philosophers and poets, dwelling in the abstract, dealing in words. The Republican talkers are Sens. Rubio and Cruz.\nRubio has his poetic lines down pat. But, as the Conway Sun said after a recent interview, Rubio is like \"a computer algorithm designed to cover talking points... It was like someone wound him up, pointed him towards the door and pushed 'play.' \"\nTed Cruz, is another whiz-kid on the soapbox. But that hasn't impressed his Senate colleagues. Of 53 fellow Republican senators, zero have endorsed him.\nTalkers make poor presidents, Barack Obama being a painful example. When Sen. Obama ran for president in 2008, his dazzling speeches — like those of Rubio and Cruz today — got rave reviews. Did glibness translate into greatness as president? No. Obama is not alone. Name the last great president who was a senator. Tough assignment, right?\nGovernors are doers by nature and necessity and make great presidents — or at least capable presidents. Ronald Reagan, a former governor, was a great president. Bill Clinton, a former governor, was certainly a capable president, though Republicans disagreed with his policies.\nThe Republican doers are Kasich, Christie and Bush.\nWhat about candidates lacking experience in government? Managing business is not the same as managing government.\nIf government and business were the same, the Founders would have founded America as a business, not a government.\nWith a CEO, it's my way or the highway. But the president of the United States works with a tough co-equal branch of government called the Congress — 535 individualists whom the president can't fire, bully or ridicule. With no experience in government, Donald, Carly and Dr. Carson would require training wheels for a couple of years.\nOur nation and families face great dangers. Has there ever been a more worrisome time in your memory? Bad news cascades upon us daily, much of it the result of poor leadership in the White House. To produce jobs and make our families economically strong again, we need a president who knows how to make government work. And to make our nation, our communities and our homes safe once again, we need a president with expertise in national defense, who has proven executive ability and can hit the ground running on Inauguration Day.\nBy this analysis, we're down to Gov. John Kasich and Gov. Chris Christie, as the only two currently serving governors. Which is better qualified?\nJohn Kasich, while chair of the House Budget Committee, balanced the budget four years running, paying down $560 billion of the national debt. You read that right. In your lifetime, the budget was b-a-l-a-n-c-e-d from 1998 through 2001.\nScout's honor. Kasich produced four surpluses, paying down 10 percent of the national debt. Christie never served in Congress, much less balanced the federal budget.\nKasich turned Ohio's $8 billion deficit into a $2 billion surplus, cutting taxes $5 billion along the way. Ohio has produced new jobs faster than the national average, with wages growing faster than the national average; its bond rating is strong and its pensions sound. That's called success.\nUnder Christie, New Jersey's bond rating has been downgraded nine times collectively by the three rating agencies, the state ranks dead last in the nation in funding its pensions, and it ranks 49th in private-sector job growth. Christier is not a successful governor.\nKasich served 18 years on the House Armed Services Committee. He's a national security expert. Christie has no experience in defense, except riding around with Barack Obama in a military helicopter. He would require several years of on the job training.\nTo read the full article, click here.\nGordon Humphrey is a former U.S. Senator from New Hampshire and served during the Reagan administration.", "timestamp": "2016-01-10", "title": "Press Release - OP-ED: Senators Talk, Governors Act"}

Specifically, the poll put Sanders 13 points ahead of Republican frontrunner Donald Trump here in Iowa. In New Hampshire, Sanders had an even bigger 19-point lead over the real estate tycoon. In contrast, Clinton led Trump by only 1 point in New Hampshire. Her 8-point margin over Trump in Iowa was much smaller than Sanders' edge.\nSanders also outpolled U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz in Iowa (up 5 points) and New Hampshire (up 19 points). Clinton lost to Cruz by 4 points in both states.\nClinton also was 12 points behind Sen.

I was so scared.\"\nAqualyn recovered from her stroke, but her health problems persisted.\nA few years later, she began experiencing what she thought was horrible stomach pain. It turned out that her gallbladder needed to be removed, and she ended up spending a week in the hospital.\nWhen her insurance company got the bill for her stay, she was dropped. Immediately.\nAqualyn says that even though the issue with her gallbladder was unrelated, her insurance company viewed her earlier health problems as a so-called \"pre-existing condition\"—which, at the time, was grounds for taking away her coverage.\nAqualyn was left without health care and responsible for paying the full bill for her week-long hospital stay. She tried to find a different company to cover her, but every time Aqualyn applied for coverage, she was rejected.\nWhat the insurance company did to Aqualyn was allowed—and shockingly common.\nNearly half of Americans have pre-existing conditions—something they consulted with a doctor about or were treated for before they got coverage. More than 400 diagnoses or medical conditions can be considered pre-existing—from depression to cancer to pregnancy.\nBefore the Affordable Care Act was signed, there were no rules against what Aqualyn's insurance company did. And it happened to hundreds of thousands of people.\nInsurance companies denied Aqualyn because her pre-existing condition made her too risky to cover. This was commonplace at the time: Between 2007 and 2009, the four largest health insurance companies in the country denied health care coverage to more than 600,000 people because of pre-existing conditions—and the percentage of applicants being rejected was rising sharply every year.\nAs first lady, Hillary Clinton fought against this kind of behavior from insurance companies.\nHillary believes that quality, affordable health care is a basic human right.\nIn the '90s, she fought hard to bring universal health care to the United States—and took on the insurance companies to do it.\nWhen Congress defeated health care reform, she refused to give up, going on to help create the Children's Health Insurance Program, which now covers more than 8 million children.\nAlmost two decades later President Obama finally won the battle for health care reform and signed the Affordable Care Act.\nHillary and President Obama celebrating when the Affordable Care Act was passed.\nThe Affordable Care Act didn't just bring health care to 18 million Americans: It stopped insurance companies from rejecting people with pre-existing conditions.\nOnce health reform was enacted, Aqualyn was able to feel secure in her health care for the first time.\n\"I felt like a huge burden had been lifted off of my shoulders,\" she says. \"My care was finally protected. I was so grateful that Secretary Clinton and the president were out there fighting to pass this law and speaking up for people like me,\" Aqualyn says. But a Republican president would repeal the Affordable Care Act, putting the health of millions of Americans in danger.\nJust this week, both the House and the Senate voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act and let insurance companies return to rejecting people with pre-existing conditions.\nWe can't afford to let Republicans undo all of President Obama's hard work.", "timestamp": "2016-01-10", "title": "Press Release - An Insurance Company Dropped This Woman Because She Had a Stroke—and It Wasn't Against the Rules"}

Three Americans die every hour we don't act. 90 die every day. 33,000 die every year. We cannot accept this as normal. Gabby and Mark certainly do not. Since being shot and partially paralyzed five year ago, Gabby has worked tirelessly for progress—founding Americans for Responsible Solutions, traveling across the country to tell her story and promote commonsense gun safety laws, launching a bipartisan coalition in New Hampshire to prevent gun violence, and fighting in support of President Obama's recent executive actions. Through it all, Mark has been by her side—as her partner, her champion, and her biggest fan. I am honored to join them in their fight for common sense gun reform.\n\"As President Obama said last week, we must hold our leaders accountable for continuing to put the interests of the gun lobby ahead of the safety of American families.

We need a president who will hold gun makers and sellers accountable, not provide them with sweeping immunity from lawsuits. We need a president who will keep guns out of the hands of dangerous felons, not create loopholes that allow shooters like the one in Charleston to buy guns.

Their stories – of struggle and success – highlight where we have been and where America is going in the future, building on the best of what our country has to offer. The guests personify President Obama's time in office and most importantly, they represent who we are as Americans: inclusive and compassionate, innovative and courageous.\nInformation about these guests and news about the State of the Union is available at WhiteHouse.gov/SOTU.\nA Vacant Seat for the Victims of Gun Violence\nLast week, the President took a series of commonsense steps to help reduce gun violence in America and make our communities safer.\nWe leave one seat empty in the First Lady's State of the Union Guest Box for the victims of gun violence who no longer have a voice – because they need the rest of us to speak for them. To tell their stories. To honor their memory. To support the Americans whose lives have been forever changed by the terrible ripple effect of gun violence – survivors who've had to learn to live with a disability, or without the love of their life. To remind every single one of our representatives that it's their responsibility to do something about this.\nSue Ellen Allen (Scottsdale, AZ)\nCriminal Justice Reform\nSue Ellen Allen knows the difficulties that formerly incarcerated individuals face after prison – both as the co-founder of a nonprofit helping inmates reenter society and as a former inmate starting over after her release in 2009. Her organization, Gina's Team, supports women in Arizona prisons and upon release, gives them the resources they need and teaches them how give back to the community. Named for her cellmate in prison who died in incarceration, Sue Ellen started Gina's Team with Gina's parents in an effort to provide women a path out of prison, back into the community and out of additional trouble with the law. She wrote the President to thank him for the launch of a new pilot program that enables incarcerated Americans to receive Pell Grants and to encourage a national dialog that includes women in prison reform. Sue Ellen is proud to be accompanied to Washington by Gina's mother, Diane, whose daughter gave her a renewed purpose in life.\nGloria Balenski (Schaumburg, IL)\nLetter Writer\nLike many American families during the Great Recession, Gloria and Norb Balenski faced real economic struggles: Gloria lost her job after 34 years at a major electronics company, the money they invested for their son's college dried up in the free-falling stock market, and Norb's job at Chevrolet was threatened when the auto industry cratered. But the actions the President took when he came into office to pull us away from the brink of depression and to secure quality, affordable health care for millions of Americans, helped safeguard Norb's job and his health insurance. And just in time as he suffered a major heart attack in 2012, racking up $400,000 in medical bills. Gloria and Norb wrote the President a letter last year thanking him for the economic priorities he pursued at a time of turmoil, which Gloria credits with helping her family to bounce back. Today, Gloria is retired, her husband has recovered, and her son recently married, has a job and purchased a new home.\nJennifer Bragdon (Austin, TX)\nCommunity College Student\nJennifer Bragdon's story showcases how community colleges can adapt to the needs of students. Jennifer, 42, and her husband, George, work full time to pay for bills and provide childcare for their one-year-old daughter, and Jennifer's other responsibilities restrict her to one class at a time. Even though she won't graduate for a few more years, she plans to complete her degree and become a middle school teacher. She enrolled in a new developmental math course at Austin Community College (ACC) after being out of a traditional classroom for more than 20 years, and has now successfully completed her college algebra requirements. In March, Dr. Biden met Jennifer at ACC and learned about the campus' high-tech learning lab that provides more than 600 computer stations for individualized learning and small group sessions, highlighting the ways community colleges are providing flexibility and support for students to stay on track to earn their degrees. Jennifer works as a massage therapist and lives in Austin, Texas with her family.\nEdith Childs (Greenwood, SC)\nGreenwood County Councilmember\nWhen then-Senator Obama visited a June 2007 campaign stop in Greenwood, South Carolina, a small group of 38 supporters captured the enthusiasm and drive that defined the election. And Edith Childs, a Greenwood County Councilmember, summed up the passion with a simple chant: \"Fired up! Ready to go!\" When she noticed Senator Obama's surprise at a fairly small gathering, she sought to energize the crowd calling out, \"Fired up!\" to which they replied \"Fired up!\" \"Ready to go!\" she countered. This call and response captivated larger and larger crowds, and became widely recognized as the unofficial slogan of the 2008 and 2012 campaigns. In December 2009, President Obama invited Edith to the White House for the first holiday celebration hosted by the Obamas in recognition of her ability to distill the enthusiasm that helped carry him to the White House. Edith lives in Greenwood with her husband, Charles. They have three children and six grandchildren.\nCynthia \"Cindy\" K. Dias (Las Vegas, NV)\nVeteran, Veterans Homelessness Advocate\nCynthia \"Cindy\" K. Dias is a Navy veteran who served during the Vietnam War in a hospital ship as a registered nurse. She managed care for wounded soldiers, and worked alongside the Chaplin as the designated official to provide notification and care for families of wounded and deceased officers. After her service, she worked as a registered nurse in Florida and Louisiana and eventually moved to Las Vegas, where she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress and lost her job before eventually also losing her home. She found a place to live at Veterans Village, a non-profit working with the city of Las Vegas to provide resources for homeless veterans. She now volunteers with Veterans Village, and she works to care and advocate for veterans in the city. In November 2015, Las Vegas announced it had housed every homeless veteran as part of the Administration's Mayors Challenge to End Veteran Homelessness. This challenge was launched in 2014 by First Lady Michelle Obama as part the First Lady and Dr. Biden's Joining Forces initiative.\nMark Davis (Washington, D.C.)\nSmall Business Owner\nA former basketball player in Washington, D.C., Mark Davis was inspired by the President's focus on climate change to do something to protect the planet and help his community. Mark took classes, got certified, and started a small business that trains low-income individuals to install solar panels and prepares community members for local green tech jobs. Mark's company, WDC Solar, is growing, profitable, and giving back. Since 2012, WDC has installed more than 125 solar systems in D.C. at no cost to homeowners with good credit through tax credits and private funds. One of Mark's proudest moments was working with D.C. Sustainable Energy Utility to start a low-income program that has provided funding to install panels on more than 300 homes. And once the panels are installed, the extra power results in a profit every month – money going back into the community he's working to transform. In 2016 he plans to implement similar programs in New York, Pennsylvania and Georgia.\nCary Dixon (Huntington, WV)\nMother, Opioid Reform Advocate\nIn October, Cary Dixon joined the President at a community forum in Charleston, West Virginia, on the opioid epidemic and spoke candidly about the struggles of having an adult child with a substance use disorder. Prescription drug abuse and heroin use have taken a heartbreaking toll on too many Americans and their families, while straining law enforcement and treatment programs. The President believes that resources should be put toward preventing substance use disorders from developing and getting effective treatment to those who need it. As many families have learned, substance use disorders do not discriminate and Cary has turned her experience into action, speaking up for those who are often too stigmatized to say anything. \"For too long, we've been silent,\" she told the panel. \"And I think that is holding us back. We need to open our voices so that people don't feel ashamed. This is a disease. It is a sickness.\"\nLydia Doza (Klamath Falls, OR // Anchorage, AK)\nCollege Student, STEM Advocate\nOriginally from Anchorage, Lydia Doza's upbringing in three Alaskan tribes – Inupiaq, Tsimshian, and Haida – as well as her grandmother Joanne's influence taught her the value of an education and the importance of mentorship. She discovered her passion for engineering early on through her high school robotics team, and, through her involvement with the Administration's Generation Indigenous initiative to support Native American youth, she's engaging with rural youth in disciplines across the STEM fields to apply their skills and education. Lydia, 24, is currently pursuing a degree in software engineering technology at Oregon Tech, where she's also an event organizer for Engineering Ambassadors, which focuses on outreach to kids as young as three years old through high school to encourage a career in engineering. After obtaining her bachelor's degree, Lydia hopes to work full time as a software engineer while continuing her involvement in the community to promote the importance of STEM and higher education. Lydia ultimately hopes to pursue a master's degree in data science and encourage more women to go into STEM. Lydia's mother, Maria Graham, and two brothers, Dorien and Leland, live in Wasilla, Alaska.\nRefaai Hamo (Troy, MI)\nSyrian Refugee\nGrowing up in Syria, Refaai Hamo lived what seemed to be the kind of life associated with the American Dream – the son of a farmer and housewife, he worked construction at night to pay his way through college on his way to a PhD, married his college sweetheart and built a family together. This life and happiness changed forever when a Syrian government anti-personnel missile tore through the complex Refaai designed and where his family lived; in total seven of his family members died, including his wife and one daughter. After the bombing, he fled to Turkey but couldn't make a living without a residence permit and was diagnosed with stomach cancer in a country where he couldn't seek treatment without insurance or health benefits. After two years in Turkey, he received refugee status to move to Troy, Michigan. Refaai's story was featured on the website Humans of New York, where he received an outpouring of support and sympathy – including from the President. The President wrote in response to his story, \"Welcome to your new home. You're part of what makes America great.\" Refaai arrived in Detroit with his three daughters and son on December 18, and like other families displaced from their homeland, they hope to find a new one in America.\nLisa Jaster (Houston, TX)\nMajor, U.S. Army Reserve, Ranger School Graduate\nMajor Lisa Jaster became the first female Army Reserve officer to graduate from the Ranger School, the elite leadership course of the Army. The 37-year-old engineer and mother of two is only the third woman to graduate from Ranger School, which began including female soldiers last year following an Administration directive to lift the ban on women in combat. Lisa graduated from the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York in 2000. She was on active duty for seven years and deployed in support of both Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom before leaving active duty in 2007 to work at Shell Oil Co. In 2012, Lisa returned to service, joining the U.S. Army Reserve, and took a leave of absence from Shell last April to pursue Ranger School. She is married to a Marine with whom she has two children, aged seven and three.\nMayor Mark Luttrell (Shelby County, TN)\nShelby County Mayor\nThroughout his career in public service, Republican Mayor Mark Luttrell has built partnerships with local, state and federal agencies, and his unique background has focused him on criminal justice reform. As mayor of Shelby County, Tennessee, he helped create specialty courts for drug, mental health, and veterans' cases to provide resources for effective rehabilitation instead of ineffectual incarceration. The county also put in place measures to reduce recidivism by streamlining and pooling resources to better provide formerly incarcerated individuals with the tools they need to re-enter society. Afterward, he was appointed as Director of Corrections for Shelby County, Tennessee and served there until he was elected Sheriff in 2002 and subsequently as Mayor in 2010. Mayor Lutrell and his wife, Pat, have three children and six grandchildren.\nGov. Dannel P. Malloy (Hartford, CT)\nConnecticut Governor\nCurrently in his second term as Governor of Connecticut, Dannel P. Malloy has pursued many of the progressive priorities that the President laid out to make America stronger. From his criminal justice reforms, including a \"Second Chance Society\" initiative that emphasizes successfully reintegrating individuals with nonviolent offenses into society, to common-sense gun safety laws following the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary, Gov. Malloy has balanced important social reforms with strong economic priorities: Connecticut led America as the first state in the country to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 and pass legislation guaranteeing paid sick leave. Gov. Malloy also oversaw the successful implementation of the Affordable Care Act, driving down the state's uninsured rate to historic lows and delivered the best job growth since the 1990s. Gov. Malloy and his wife, Cathy, have three sons, Dannel, Ben and Sam.\nBraeden Mannering (Bear, DE)\nLet's Move!\nAfter attending the White House Kids' \"State Dinner\" as part of Let's Move! and hearing the President and First Lady's challenge for kids to make a difference in their own communities, Braeden Mannering, 12, was inspired to act. Braeden started his own nonprofit, Brae's Brown Bags (3B), which provides healthy food to homeless and low-income individuals in his community. His mission is also to raise awareness about the problems of food insecurity and poverty, and to empower and inspire youth across the nation to become part of the solution. To date, Braeden has activated more than 2,600 volunteers, provided more than 4,500 \"brown bags\" of healthy food, and raised more than $52,000 for hunger relief. He co-hosted the first \"hunger conference\" in Delaware to include youth, and he continues to spread his mission in Delaware and other states, speaking at schools, conferences, and legislative sessions. Braeden is in sixth grade at Gauger-Cobbs Middle School and lives in Bear, Delaware with his mother Christy, stepfather Brian, brother Finnegan and sister Amelia. Braeden's father, Michael, his fiancйe Jennifer and their son Michael live in Middletown, Delaware.\nSatya Nadella (Bellevue, WA)\nMicrosoft CEO\nSatya Nadella is Chief Executive Officer of Microsoft, a position he's held since February 2014 at the company he joined in 1992. Microsoft has been a leader in expanding access to computer science in K-12 classrooms, and in Teach.org, a private public partnership to increase awareness of and support for the teaching profession. In September, the company announced a new $75 million effort to expand computer science education, including opportunities for engineers from Microsoft and other companies with teachers to team-teach computer science. In October 2015, under Satya's leadership, Microsoft increased its paid leave benefits by eight weeks and now includes 20 weeks of paid leave for new mothers and 12 weeks for non-birth parents. Originally from Hyderabad, India, Satya received a master's in computer science and a master's in business administration from the University of Wisconsin – Milwaukee and University of Chicago, respectively. Satya and his wife, Anupuma, have three children.\nJim Obergefell (Cincinnati, OH)\nActivist\nJim Obergefell was the named plaintiff in the landmark marriage equality case Obergefell v. Hodges, which ruled same-sex couples nationwide have the Constitutional right to marry. In 2013, Jim married his partner of 20 years, John, who was dying of ALS. Their marriage – performed in Maryland – wasn't recognized in their home state of Ohio, setting off a legal proceeding over whether the marriage should be recognized under Ohio law and listed on John's death certificate. While they won the initial legal battle, Ohio appealed, and their case eventually made its way to the Supreme Court, which declared marriage equality the law of the land. Jim considers himself an accidental activist, one who became entwined in a political statement larger than himself – a statement of equality and dignity that Americans have been fighting for since this nation's founding – and he now remains committed to ensuring the civil rights for all Americans.\nChief Kathleen O'Toole (Seattle, WA)\nPolice Chief, Community Policing\nSince 2014, Chief Kathleen O'Toole has led the Seattle Police Department in developing its approach to community policing, and her focus on improving officer morale, implementing new policies and optimizing department resources has received national attention. Under her leadership, the department tested a six-month pilot program for body-worn police cameras focused on public transparency, and the Department of Justice awarded the department a $600,000 grant to expand the program. Last year, the Seattle Police Department presented its policies at the White House Police Data Initiative as part of its renewed emphasis on accountability and transparency. Prior to Kathleen's role as Chief, she served as Chief Inspector of the Gardia Sнochбna Inspectorate in Ireland, responsible for developing best practices of the Irish police service and rose the ranks of Massachusetts law enforcement, finishing as the first female Boston police commissioner in 2004. Chief O'Toole is married to a retired police detective, Dan O'Toole, and they have a daughter, Meghan.\nRyan Reyes (San Bernardino, CA)\nActivist\nRyan Reyes's partner Larry \"Daniel\" Kaufman was one of the 14 victims of the December 2 terrorist attack at Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, California. Daniel was a job trainer for adults with developmental disabilities at the Coffee N More shop, and he was on his lunch break at the time of the attack. He is credited with saving the lives of four people when he warned others, urging them to safety, before being shot and killed in the attack. Since Daniel's death, Ryan, 32, has been vocal about the need for tolerance of all and rejection of the radicalized. \"I speak for both Daniel and myself when I say that this attack should NOT encourage people to treat Muslims any differently than they would anyone else,\" he wrote to media in the aftermath of the attack. \"The twisted actions and beliefs of a few should not be used to view the majority.\"\nRonna Rice (Greeley, CO)\nSmall Business Owner\nA family-operated company since 1924 across five generations, Rice's Lucky Clover Honey specializes in American raw and unfiltered honey for export globally. As CEO, Ronna Rice leads the business. The company has expanded across the U.S. and around the world, most recently in Japan, South Korea and China, allowing the company to grow domestically and hire more employees. Rice's Lucky Clover Honey has export sales per year of about $500,000, and the 15 jobs in the company are supported by those exports. The company is based in Greeley, Colorado, and Ronna runs the company with her husband Jim, their three children, their son-in-law and a family friend.\nCedric Rowland (Chicago, IL)\nACA Navigator\nCedric Rowland is the lead navigator for Near North Health Service Corporation in Chicago. Working with people to find the best plans available at a price they can afford, Affordable Care Act navigators help people across the country take advantage of the benefits of the Affordable Care Act, and are part of the success of the law. Since November 1, 2015, nearly 11.3 million consumers – more than 3 million of them new customers – have signed up for health care in this open enrollment alone. Our uninsured rate is at the lowest rate on record, coverage is affordable, and we're seeing a historic slowdown in the growth of health care costs. Cedric's role in this progress can be seen in the story of Stephanie Lucas. Stephanie has diabetes and no longer qualified for Medicaid, but with Cedric's help she transitioned to a Marketplace plan that met her needs and let her keep her doctor at a price she could afford – $62 a month after tax credits. Stephanie will watch the State of the Union from the White House. She thanks Cedric, and navigators like him, for helping Americans enroll in quality, affordable health care under the Affordable Care Act. Cedric is a new father of a baby girl.\nNaveed Shah (Springfield, VA)\nU.S. Army Veteran\nNaveed Shah, originally from Saudi Arabia, grew up in the Washington, D.C. suburb of Springfield, Virginia after immigrating to the United States with his Pakistani parents. Like many immigrants who arrive here as children, Naveed noted that his birth country felt foreign while America is home. The terrorist attack on September 11, 2001 marked the ultimate distortion of Naveed's faith – something he set out to combat, enlisting in the U.S. Army in 2006. He served our country for four years and deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Naveed returned to his hometown in 2010 for college and to work with veterans groups assisting in the transition between military and civilian life. When not volunteering, Naveed works as a real estate agent in Virginia and lives with his fiancй, Ashley, and 7-year-old son, Yusuf.\nEarl Smith (Austin, TX)\nVeteran\nEarl Smith first met then-Senator Barack Obama in February 2008 on the campaign trail at the Austin Hyatt Regency where he worked as the director of security. Encountering him in an elevator, Earl gave the Senator a military patch he had worn serving with an artillery brigade in Vietnam that sustained 10,041 casualties and received 13 Medals of Honor. Smith had held onto his patch for 40 years – from Vietnam, to his 1977 pardon after three years in prison for a wrongful conviction, to global work in the hospitality industry – before parting with it in the elevator that day. Then-Senator Obama carried the patch in his pocket for the rest of the campaign, but Earl had no idea of the impact his story had on the President until he heard it directly from him in the Oval Office in 2013. The patch will be archived in the Obama Library – a reminder of the people who made up the movement that led the President to the White House. Earl and his wife of nearly 35 years, Claudia, have two children.\nSpencer Stone (Sacramento, CA)\nStaff Sergeant, U.S. Air Force\nWhile on a Paris-bound train with his childhood friends Anthony Sadler and U.S. Army Specialist Alek Skarlatos, Spencer Stone made headlines worldwide in August when the three Americans prevented a potentially catastrophic act of terrorism. Spencer, his two friends and a fourth British passenger subdued a gunman armed with a box cutter, a pistol, a can of lighter fluid, and an assault rifle with 300 rounds of ammunition as he tried to open fire aboard the crowded train. While restraining the suspect who repeatedly slashed with the box cutter, Spencer incurred injury to his neck and hand, nearly losing his finger, and upon return to the United States received a Purple Heart, the Airman's Medal, and a promotion to Staff Sergeant. The President invited the three friends to the White House where he thanked them in person for saving so many lives and for representing the U.S. with heroism and humility. The 23-year-old EMT hopes to continue his work in medicine and lives in Sacramento, California.\nOscar Vazquez (Fort Worth, TX)\nVeteran, DREAMer, STEM leader\nLike many DREAMers, Oscar came to the United States as a child in search of a better life. From age 12 when he moved from Mexico to Phoenix, Arizona, Oscar excelled in the classroom. He excelled as a STEM student at Carl Hayden High School and led an unlikely and inspiring story of a group of under-resourced Hispanic high school students who took on an MIT team in an underwater robotics competition and won. That opportunity led to a college education in the STEM field, earning a B.S.E. in mechanical engineering from Arizona State University in May 2009. But without legal status, he couldn't secure a job to provide for his new wife and newborn child. He returned to Mexico to apply for a visa, and with help from Sen. Dick Durbin, who spoke from the Senate Floor about Oscar's case, he was granted a green card in August 2010. Six months later, Oscar enlisted in the Army to serve the country he loves and calls home. Oscar served one tour in Afghanistan and is now a proud U.S. citizen. He now works for Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railways as a business analyst in a web app development team, and is a passionate advocate on behalf on expanding STEM opportunities for Latino and other under-represented youth.", "timestamp": "2016-01-10", "title": "Press Release - White House Announces Guests in First Lady's Box – State of the Union Address"}

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111548", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n12:57 P.M. EST\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Well, maybe we should -- apparently, this Royals mug is lucky for the Chiefs, as well. So certainly enjoyed the victory over the weekend. Well, Senator Cruz's hometown teams are now 0 and 2 against my hometown teams in the playoffs.\nQ: Ooooh --\nQ: Ouch!\nMR. EARNEST: The good news is that Calgary Flames can rest easy because Kansas City doesn't have a hockey team.\nQ: You're liking the sports --\nMR. EARNEST: I'm excited. It's the Monday before the State of the Union. A little fired up, ready to go! (Laughter.) But I don't have an opening announcement, so we can go straight to questions.\nKathleen, do you want to start?\nQ: Well, I'm not going to start with the State of the Union. I guess we'll get to that. I wanted to start with Sean Penn's interview with El Chapo.\nMR. EARNEST: -- made a little news this weekend, too.\nQ: Can you just tell us whether or not the President has read it?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't spoken to the President about the Rolling Stone interview. I have read a little bit about the interview, but I haven't actually read the interview myself. Obviously this is -- the capture of Mr. Guzman has been a high priority both for Mexico and the United States. Mexican authorities have been aggressive about looking for Mr. Guzman and bringing him into custody. We obviously commend the Mexican authorities for their success and we obviously salute the law enforcement officials in that country that have spent a lot of time and worked quite bravely to ensure that he can be brought to justice.\nBut we're going to continue to work with Mexico and other partners around the world to respond to the threats that are posed by transnational criminal organizations.\nQ: And there's a report this actually may take up to a year. Is that an acceptable time period?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I would refer you to the Department of Justice for sort of the tick-tock on how the process works. I can't speak about any specific case. What I can tell you is that the standard operating procedure is that if there is an individual who is facing charges in the United States that is arrested overseas, then the extradition process commences. Obviously Mr. Guzman is facing some serious charges here in the United States. But for details about sort of where things stand in that process or what that process looks like, I'd refer you to the Department of Justice.\nQ: And on the reports that the Mexican government will be investing Sean Penn about the interview -- do you have any details on that?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any details about that. But you can obviously contact Mexican authorities about that.\nQ: And then I wanted to ask you -- you talked a little bit about the deportation raids that happened over the holiday weekend. Obviously there are a lot of Democratic lawmakers on the Hill that are very upset about this. They're going to ask the administration to grant temporary protective status for some of these people. I'm wondering what your reaction is to that. It sounded like you're not inclined to change the policy in any way.\nMR. EARNEST: That's correct. At this point, our policy will remain the same. But I do think that given the sensitivity of this issue, it's worth me spending at least a little time here just reminding people what our policy is. When the President put in place -- used his executive authority to try to reform as much of the immigration system as he could, using only his executive authority, that included the Department of Homeland Security implementing some prosecutorial discretion, some guidance that would be used to prioritize for removal those individuals who don't have the legal basis for remaining in the country but yet are accused of crimes. We've also prioritized for removal those individuals who have only recently crossed the border. And the idea here is that we should prioritize felons -- the deportation of felons over the separation of families. And given the limited law enforcement resources that we have to work with, that's a rather common-sense proposition.\nThe individuals who were involved in some of the operations that have gotten a lot of attention fell into the category broadly -- fell into the category of people who'd recently crossed the border.\nNow, what's also true is even for those individuals that are prioritized for removal, those individuals, though, are still given access to the justice system and given access to due process. And the administration is committed to that process. In fact, part of our response to the surge that we saw at the border about a year and a half ago was to actually increase the amount of resources that are devoted to that justice process. So this is a system of due process that we take quite seriously. And it was only after individuals had exhausted the legal remedies available to them to claim asylum or to be granted some other form of humanitarian relief, only then was the decision made to remove them.\nQ: How would you describe the White House's level of involvement in that decision -- in these specific operations?\nMR. EARNEST: These are enforcement operations, so this is consistent with the kind of prosecutorial guidance that's been put in place by the Department of Homeland Security. But obviously executing these enforcement actions are the responsibility of law enforcement professionals.\nQ: So no one at the White House was notified that this was going to happen in advance? Or, I mean, was there some notification?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I can't speak to any sort of communication that takes place between the Department of Homeland Security and the White House. But for decisions like this and decisions to move forward with operations, those are obviously decisions that are, appropriately, made by law enforcement professionals.\nQ: And just lastly, is it accurate then to describe this as part of the broader attempt to prevent another crisis like we saw in 2014?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think our desire to make clear that individuals should not embark on the dangerous journey from Central America to the Southwest border, that's the case that we've tried to tell in a variety of ways, including by saying publicly that people shouldn't attempt this journey and they certainly shouldn't entrust their children into the hands of unscrupulous human traffickers to make that journey.\nThe administration has also cracked down on human traffickers that have preyed upon people who are in a rather desperate situation. The administration has also invested in trying to enhance the resources that are available to governments in Central America like Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, to help them better account for the security situation in their own country.\nIn fact, the administration sought a billion dollars in funding that could be used to work with the governments down there to address this situation. Congress did appropriate $750 million for that task. We obviously were pleased to see that commitment from Congress to this effort.\nThere also has been an effort underway to establish alternative paths for those individuals that have legitimate humanitarian and asylum claims that they can -- essentially we wanted to establish a process that would make it easier for these individuals to have those claims heard without them embarking on this dangerous journey.\nThe real tragedy here is that there are far too many men, women and children that have attempted this journey. Many of them have been killed. Others have been victimized in terrible ways when they have sought to embark on that journey. And so that is what we are trying to prevent. And there are a variety of ways in which we've tried to confront this challenge. And those efforts only attract some attention, I think, when there's a surge at the border or there are some enforcement actions. But I can assure you that since the summer of 2014, this is something that has been part of an intense focus by the Department of Homeland Security.\nAyesha.\nQ: Going to the State of the Union, the White House has said repeatedly that it won't be a laundry list of proposals, but will the President lay out any concrete legislative goals for the year? And what should the American people kind of read into that? Should they not expect any big legislative accomplishments this year?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Ayesha, traditionally, the State of the Union is an opportunity for the President of the United States to speak before the Congress and the American people about all that's been accomplished and all that the President hopes to accomplish in the year ahead. And you certainly will hear some of that from the President tomorrow. But the President's main focus will be on the opportunities and challenges that are facing the country not just in the year ahead, but what's critical are the kinds of decisions that we make now will have a significant impact on not just the next generation of Americans but future generations of Americans.\nSo there is certainly a lot that we have to get done over the course of the next year. That includes criminal justice reform. We've seen that there is strong bipartisan support for criminal justice reform on Capitol Hill, and the White House has worked hard to try to nurture the bipartisan agreement that will be required to pass that legislation.\nWe are hopeful that Congress will take steps to ratify the Trans-Pacific Partnership. This was an agreement that was reached by the United States and 11 other countries in the Asia Pacific. This is an agreement that we spent years negotiating. We were pleased to see this agreement completed. And now we need to see Congress vote to ratify it. There is a process, though, of public consideration and public comment, so we're not calling on Congress to vote for it now, but we are hopeful that they will move in a timely fashion to vote to approve that legislation. That obviously is going to require bipartisan support there, too.\nThose are just two examples of some high-priority items that the President is hopeful this Congress can act on before the end of the year.\nQ: Moving on to the -- in light of the North Korean nuclear test, the U.S. and South Korea have been discussing the deployment of more strategic weapons in the area, and also there was a flyover of a B-52 bomber, I believe, over the weekend. And so China has raised some concerns, calling for all sides to avoid escalating the situation in the region. So I was wondering, did the U.S. talk to China at all before they did the flyover? And are there any concerns, when you're discussing deployment of more strategic weapons, about possibly escalating the situation or making the situation worse?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me tell you a little bit about -- let me say a couple of things. The United States has obviously been closely consulting with our partners and allies in the region in terms of putting together a response to the provocative actions that we saw from the North Koreans last week. Secretary Kerry and Secretary Carter have been in touch with a number of their counterparts in the region. Even President Obama called his counterparts in Japan and South Korea in the aftermath of North Korea testing this nuclear device. So we have been consulting quite closely with our partners and allies. And I didn't even mention the Security Council meeting at the United Nations. So we are committed to preserving the international unanimity of opinion when it comes to confronting North Korea. And that will only strengthen our hand in this effort.\nThat said, we have indicated that there are a variety of appropriate responses, and we're going to continue the work to develop those responses. We also, however, are committed to this safety and security of our close allies in South Korea. And there obviously are men and women of the United States military who are deployed to South Korea. They are, I think, the most graphic representation of that -- or manifestation of that commitment. There are also resources that are deployed through the Asia Pacific that are critical to protecting the United States homeland. And this is technology that can be used to counter North Korea's ballistic missile program. And we certainly will take the steps that we believe are necessary to protect the country.\nJustin.\nQ: I had a couple of things following off that. One is North Korea announced today that it had arrested an American citizen on espionage charges. There seemed to be some debate about whether or not he is, in fact, a citizen. But I'm wondering if you can confirm that, and if you guys are taking any steps to try to work towards his return?\nMR. EARNEST: Justin, as you've heard me say before, this is report that we have seen, but it's not a report that I can comment on. Talking publicly about possible cases of detained Americans can complicate our efforts to try to secure their freedom. So there's just not much I can say about these reports.\nAnd if there is a point where there is more that we can say, we'll keep you posted.\nQ: Secretary Kerry is going to meet with his Russian counterpart, presumably to discuss North Korea, among the litany of other issues that the U.S. and Russia have kind of going on. I'm wondering -- are there any plans for the President to call President Putin? If not, why not, since he's reached out to the leaders of Japan and South Korea?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not aware of any calls like that that are on the agenda in the short term at least. If that changes, we'll obviously let you know. As you point out, there are a variety of other U.S. officials that have been in touch with the relevant parties here. And if it's determined that President Obama needs to communicate with President Putin about this, then he won't hesitate to pick up the phone and call.\nQ: What's the administration hoping for out of that conversation between Secretary Kerry and Secretary Lavrov?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have the rundown on their agenda. Presumably, there are a number of things that they will discuss, including efforts to advance the long overdue political transition inside of Syria. Obviously, Russia has got an important role to play there. We welcome their constructive contribution to that effort thus far, and we hope that that will continue.\nObviously, there is some ongoing work to implement the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Russia has been a constructive supporter of that process. So for a more detailed rundown on the agenda, though, I'd encourage you to check with State Department.\nQ: Because you mentioned Iran, last week you said you didn't have an update on Iranian sanctions relief, but President Rouhani said today, kind of echoing Secretary Kerry, that he expects sanctions relief to begin in the next few days. So I'm wondering if that's an accurate timeline, and if this is something that's you guys are preparing, or if you have any update on that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, the pressure is on the Iranians to deliver at this point. What we have said is that the international community and certainly not the United States, we're not going to provide relief from sanctions to the Iranians until they have taken the steps that are described in the agreement to dismantle large portions of their nuclear program.\nIn addition, we're not just going to take their word for it. We actually will have international inspectors who can verify that Iran has followed through in carrying out the actions that they've committed to carry out.\nIran has made some progress, to their credit. A couple weeks ago, they shipped 25,000 pound of enriched uranium out of the country. That is consistent with the commitment that they have made to reduce their uranium stockpile by 98 percent. There are also specific requirements around the heavy-water reactor that they operate around Arak. They are required to remove the core of the reactor and fill it with concrete to ensure that it can be rendered -- to essentially render it harmless. This would shut down the plutonium path to a nuclear weapon that we believe Iran had been pursuing. But there are whole steps related to centrifuges and other things.\nOnce Iran has taken all those steps, and once the international community, through the IAEA, has been able to verify Iran's compliance with the agreement, then, and only then, will Iran begin receiving the sanctions relief that we know they seek.\nQ: Well, is that verification possible in the next few days, the next week? Or is that something that you're envisioning still months away?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, it's going to depend on Iran and when they complete implementing the provisions of the agreement. Obviously we have a robust infrastructure in place to verify their compliance with the agreement -- not just at the beginning, but on an ongoing basis. And I'd refer you to the IAEA for a better assessment of how long that process will actually take.\nOlivier.\nQ: I actually didn't have a question.\nMR. EARNEST: Oh, I'm sorry. I saw your hand up earlier. I was just trying to move it around here.\nQ: Since you called on me, though, I'll dredge up two. (Laughter.) One is, it's been a little weird to watch television today and see all this coverage of the Powerball jackpot as large as it is. Does the President -- how does the President feel about the message that Americans really should go out and buy these tickets? That's the unmistakable takeaway from the cheerleading on TV for this giant lottery jackpot.\nAnd the other is, of course, the passing of David Bowie -- any reaction from you or the President? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: There you go.\nQ: Justin asked my Iran question, so I got to go with something else.\nMR. EARNEST: These are just the two topics on your mind today, huh? (Laughter.)\nQ: Just back from vacation. I can't help it. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware that the President has purchased a Powerball ticket.\nQ: So I guess I didn't win on Saturday. (Laughter.) But you know what I mean about the policy aspect of this, right? This is a voluntary but regressive tax on Americans. How does he feel about this as a matter of public policy?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, this is a decision that states make. And there are a number of states who benefit from participating on these kinds of games and it's a source of revenue that they benefit from. And obviously, the American people can decide sort of how best to spend their money. Obviously, the odds are long of winning, but people can sort of make up their own minds about whether or not it's a good way to spend their hard-earned dollars.\nAs it comes to David Bowie, I think the way that his loss will be felt I think is illustrated by the pretty broad outpouring of reaction to his death. There are a number of people all across the globe who talked about they had been inspired by his life and his work. And I haven't spoken to the President about whether or not he was a David Bowie fan, but there's no denying the impact of his contribution to art and music and film not just here in the United States but around the world.\nJon.\nQ: First, a quick follow-up to something on Friday, the attempted assassination of the police officer in Philadelphia. Does the White House consider that a terrorist attack?\nMR. EARNEST: Jon, this is something that is still being investigated by the Philadelphia Police Department and they have not concluded that it actually is an act of terrorism. But given some of the circumstances of the event, obviously that is something that we're all wondering right now. And I'm confident that as the Philadelphia Police Department investigates the shooting of one of their own this is something they will consider -- that's specifically the motivation of the individual who carried out this heinous act of violence.\nWe obviously are pleased to hear reports that the condition of the police officer is improving. And again, it is a timely reminder of the way that hundreds of thousands of police officers across the country put on their uniform and leave home every day prepared to put their lives on the line to protect the communities they're sworn to serve and protect. And the overwhelming majority of those individuals carry out that important work with courage and with professionalism. And we obviously owe them a debt of gratitude.\nQ: And a question on the state of the Union, literally. The President has said he's never been more optimistic going into a new year. How do you square that with where the American public is on that question? The most recent poll from NBC had just a fifth of the country saying the country was on the right track, 70 percent saying that the country is going on the wrong track. Why, if the President is so optimistic about the state of the Union, why did the overwhelming majority of the American public believe that things are seriously off the rails?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think part of that, Jon, is obviously attributable to the avalanche of negativity that we've seen from the Republican candidates for president, the kind of -- the willingness of those candidates to exploit people's fears and insecurities and anxieties has infected the political debate. That's surely part of it.\nI think it's perfectly reasonable, as the President discussed in his interview with Steve Inskeep before the end of the year, that there are a lot of Americans who are feeling insecure about the economy. Obviously, given the terrorist attack that we saw in San Bernardino at the end of last year, people are understandably concerned about national security and it sort of reawakened people's concerns about that. So there's certainly reason for people to be concerned.\nThe President's reaction to that, though, is that he has never been more confident about our ability to confront successfully those challenges, but also never been more confident about our capacity to capitalize on the opportunities that exist for this country.\nQ: I guess I want to ask you -- so you have the President saying he's never been more optimistic, and Denis McDonough, yesterday in his interviews, struck a similarly optimistic tone about where things stand right now. Donald Trump says the state of the Union is a mess. It seems that the vast majority of the American people think that Trump is right on that question and not the President. Why is that? Is it really just because of what Republican candidates have been saying in a primary? You think the American people have been fooled by that?\nMR. EARNEST: I think that's certainly had an impact on the nature of the political debate in this country. But again, I also think that there are justified concerns about the impact of the global economy on middle-class families here in the United States. And I think there is a justified concern about the ability of ISIL to use social media to carry out acts of violence against Americans.\nThe bottom line, though, when it comes to the President's thinking about all of this is he's got a lot of confidence that betting on America is going to be a good bet, both in terms of confronting those challenges but also in terms of capitalizing on those opportunities.\nAnd the President is hopeful that he'll have an opportunity in the speech to not just talk about the kind of political rhetoric that is on display from Republicans leading up to the next election but to actually talk about how these issues are going to affect the next generation of Americans. And that's what leadership is about. That certainly is consistent with the kind of leadership that the President campaigned on in 2007 and 2008, and I think it's consistent with the kind of leadership that the President has shown since he took office for the first time in January of 2009.\nApril.\nQ: Josh, following on Olivier, on Powerball -- (laughter) -- no, but I mean, it's a serious question, and going back on -- okay, let me hit Powerball first. (Laughter.) No, seriously. Granted, it's gambling, but it's over $1 billion -- the jackpot is over $1 billion. And lotteries were typically sanctioned by governments -- well, approved by governments for infrastructure projects, facilities, and state projects. I mean, does that say something that -- granted, a lot of people are gambling, looking to get this big jackpot so they don't have to go to work anymore -- or work anymore, but there could be a benefit. I mean, does the White House look at it as a possible boon for states and localities that do have Powerball in that location?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it's not clear to me what sort of impact this particular game will have on state budgets across the country. I think a lot of Americans are talking about this because it's fun. I don't think they do it because they expect that they're going to win and they're not going to have to show up to work the next day. I think they do it because they think it's fun. And a lot of state governments see this as an opportunity to try to make a little money -- yes, to augment funding for infrastructure projects, or education, or other priorities that they've identified. And I haven't heard the President express a particular objection to that. So I guess that's all I've got to say.\nQ: Do you think there needs to be --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess you'd have to ask state governments about that. And I think what they would tell you is that this is helpful in helping them fund the kinds of priorities that they've identified, particularly in this era of fiscal belt-tightening.\nQ: And now on to the State of the Union. Could you give us a little tick-tock as to how many drafts, how long will it take?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have a metric to share with you in terms of the number of drafts that the President has gone through. I know that the President, in addition to a round a golf, devoted a significant portion of his weekend to working on the speech. I can tell you that the President's schedule has been left pretty flexible today so that he can spend ample time working on it again. And I would anticipate that there will be even more work that's done tonight and tomorrow. The President typically is working on the State of the Union pretty close -- up to the last minute, and i would anticipate that that will be true this year, as well.\nQ: Now, when the President delivers the State of the Union, talking about the state of the union -- it's either strong or he's optimistic or what have you -- typically, every year, when a President does this, it's a statement of optimism, resilience, and strength. And then you have people like Donald Trump saying it's a mess. But when any President delivers a State of the Union, isn't there positives in the country and negatives? What would you say to this State of the Union as you have Republicans saying it's a mess and looking at the negatives when this administration is tallying positives as well as the negatives?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I think the President has ample reason to be quite optimistic about the capacity of the American people to confront the significant challenges that we're facing. The President's optimism about the country is not because he isn't concerned about the future. His optimism about the country is characterized by his confidence in the American people and our country to overcome those challenges, and, just as importantly, to capitalize on the opportunities that exist.\nThere is no country in the world that is better positioned to capitalize on the kind of opportunities we see -- whether it relates to our national security or it relates to our economy -- than the United States of America. And you'll get the opportunity tomorrow to hear directly from the President about why exactly that is.\nQ: And last question. Since this is more of a visionary statement, we're at a time where we're seeing some very divisive words about race. We're seeing it from Justice Scalia, in many people's opinion. We're seeing it from the Governor of New Hampshire just in the last couple of weeks. Will the President address these --\nMR. EARNEST: You mean the Governor of Maine.\nQ: Excuse me, I'm sorry -- yes. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Forgive me, I've been on vacation. Yeah, but we're seeing it from -- seeing these words from officials who lead or judge in some shape or form in this United States system. Will the President speak to that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, stay tuned.\nQ: Can you give me more than that?\nMR. EARNEST: Not today.\nByron.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Congress is considering a package of changes to the Freedom of Information law, which would basically codify the presumption of openness and strengthen the office responsible for oversight of FOIA issues. It has bipartisan support. Does it have the White House's support?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Byron, we'll obviously take a close look at the legislation. There's one thing that I'm confident they could do that would strengthen this proposal -- you think you know what I'm going to say?\nQ: Include themselves?\nMR. EARNEST: Exactly. And I would expect that the press corps that spends so much time covering Congress and covering government and demanding transparency would have those same kinds of questions for Congress. Congress is the one writing the rules. And right now they're writing the rules in such a way that they don't have to play by them. I don't think that's particularly a, frankly, American way to pursue this.\nPart of our government is about making sure that we're all playing by the same set of rules. And the basis of this legislation is that the American people have a right to know more about what's happening inside their government. I don't understand why Congress doesn't think the American people don't have a right to understand exactly what's happening in the Congress. So we certainly would encourage them to consider adding that to their proposal.\nWhen it comes to the administration's views on this, we feel like we've got a pretty strong record. I'll just walk through a couple of highlights. In fiscal year 2014, the administration processed 647,142 FOIA requests. That number of letters doesn't get responded to unless you're serious about trying to fulfill your responsibility to run the most transparent government in history.\nMore than 91 percent of the FOIA requests that were processed by the administration resulted in the person making the request receiving some or all of the requested information.\nBut part of our commitment to transparency is actually reflected in our efforts to put out information before we're even asked about it. And if you visit data.gov -- which I'm sure all of you have done -- there are more than 180,000 data sets and collections that have been made available on data.gov. And consistent with our commitment to transparency, the administration has said that that information should be presented in machine-readable format so that when you're considering those data sets, you can slice and dice the numbers and actually help the American people learn a little bit more about what's happening in their government and in their world.\nAnd so these are some of the reasons that we obviously are quite proud of the work that we have done to make government more transparent and more accessible, and wish that Congress, while they're writing these rules, would follow suit.\nQ: A House panel concluded -- a Republican-led House panel concluded in a recent report that the entire FOIA process is \"broken,\" and I think we've seen some really high profile incidents of this at the State Department, for example, over Secretary Clinton's record and the fact that there are I think a couple dozen lawsuits against the agency over that. But there have also been questions raised about transparency at other agencies and parts of the federal government. Has -- you rattle off some statistics -- but as a philosophical question, has access to information gotten better during the Obama administration? Have these agencies lived up to their responsibilities and the standard you set as the most transparency administration in history?\nMR. EARNEST: There is no denying that we have made improvements in a way that have led people to have a better understanding of exactly what's happening in their government and making their government more transparent. And that includes releasing a whole lot of information even before we're asked. And that is -- let me give you another example of that. On a regular basis, the White House puts out a list of just about everybody who visits the White House. I'll remind you that the previous administration went to the Supreme Court to try to prevent the release of that information. And this is something that we release on a voluntary basis on a regular schedule. So, yes, our record on this is good and transparency has improved.\nLet me also state that the commitment to transparency means constantly working to improve that process even more. And I'm confident that those of you who are advocates for transparency believe that there is a lot more that we can and should be doing to provide more information and we certainly do strive to live up to the goal that the President -- the ambitious goal that the President set at the beginning to ensure that he's presiding over the most transparent White House in history, and that those kinds of -- that that commitment to transparency also extends to a variety of government agencies.\nAnd when it comes to the State Department, yes, there have been some disputes about this. But again, I would encourage you to take a look at the results, which is that you have the former Secretary of State releasing all of her work-related emails, consistent with the FOIA process. So, again, I think the outcome here is evidence of the kind of commitment to transparency that the President has championed.\nJim.\nQ: Josh, you mentioned visits to the White House. Yesterday Denis McDonough said that Senator Sanders had had a visit with President Obama. What can you tell us about that?\nMR. EARNEST: It was a private meeting, so not very much.\nQ: When was it -- you know when it was?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have details about when the meeting took place, but the President has had an opportunity -- has had multiple opportunities, both in private, one-on-one interactions, as well as in interactions with the broader Senate Democratic caucus, to visit with Senator Sanders. And I certainly wouldn't rule out future sit-downs in the future.\nQ: And why did Denis -- and I think you did this a little bit on Friday -- why are you guys taking credit for Senator Sanders' movement on gun control? And do you also believe that Secretary Clinton has maybe moved in your direction a little bit because of the President's actions on guns over the years?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess the reason is that when the President published an op-ed suggesting that he would only support candidates who share his commitment to common-sense gun safety laws that we saw Senator Sanders' office indicate that Senator Sanders has said that he was more open to those kinds of laws than he had been in the past. It's not a direct quote, but I think that's consistent with the spirit of what they have said.\nQ: And you think they did that because of the op-ed, because of the concern that maybe President Obama would not campaign for Senator Sanders in the future?\nMR. EARNEST: You'd have to ask him about that. I think the point --\nQ: Do you think he would need President Obama's assistance up in Vermont were he running for reelection for a Senate seat, for example?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again -- I don't have to tell you this -- he's not running for reelection as senator, he's actually running for President of the United States. And I'm confident that whoever the Democratic nominee is, they're going to be pretty eager to have President Obama's support. So I can certainly understand why this is something that Senator Sanders is talking about quite a bit.\nQ: Do you think it was necessary movement on his part? Is the President pleased that Senator Sanders has moved in his direction since the publication of that op-ed?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we saw some pretty direct comments from Senator Sanders over the weekend. I understand he did a town hall meeting or some sort of public event in Iowa where he noted that he supports changing laws that currently allow gun manufacturers who have acted irresponsibly to avoid accountability. And the President believes that the opposite should be true, that gun manufacturers should be held accountable for their products and for their business practices, and we obviously were pleased to see Senator Sanders's comments. And that's consistent with the kinds of values and priorities that you'll see from candidates that the President is prepared to campaign for next year -- or later this year.\nQ: Is he trying to help Hillary Clinton a little bit?\nMR. EARNEST: No.\nQ: There's a lot of discussion about it on the Sunday talk shows.\nMR. EARNEST: It sounds like I spent the last like 90 seconds talking -- saying good things about Senator Sanders's commitment to common-sense gun laws, so I have a feeling I'm more likely to hear from my friends in the Clinton campaign than my friends in the Sanders campaign right now.\nQ: I bet the folks in the Clinton campaign would probably like it if you were saying that we're glad we got Senator Sanders to move in our direction a little bit.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'll just say that we were pleased to see his comments over the weekend and they are certainly consistent with the kinds of priorities that we would expect candidates who are seeking the President's support to prioritize on the campaign trail. And the President is quite serious about this. If there are Democratic candidates who aren't willing to walk the walk and live up to a commitment to advancing common-sense gun laws, then they should look elsewhere for support for their campaigns.\nQ: And let me ask you about this last State of Union. Are you concerned that after the State of Union, the public's focus will shift away from the White House and to the campaign trail, and folks aren't going to pay attention to what you're doing anymore and that sort of thing? And how are you planning to deal with that? You're still working for the President of the United States, so you got that going on for you.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, that's certainly true. (Laughter.)\nQ: Is that a concern? Is that a concern?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, I got a lot of people asking me this question back in November of 2014, after Democrats had been beaten badly in the midterm election. And there were a lot of questions about whether or not the President was going to be able to, A, stay relevant; and B, advance his agenda. And I think when you take a look at all that we accomplished over the course of the last year -- reaching an international agreement on climate change; reaching an international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and Republicans not being able to even muster a vote of disapproval in the Congress. We advanced the President's ability to negotiate trade agreements that we believe will have long-term positive consequences for our economy. We passed a budget agreement that included an additional $50 billion over and above sequester levels to ensure we're adequately funding our economic and national security priorities. We've reauthorized the Export-Import Bank. We finally long overdue reform of the IMF through. We got a transportation bill done that guaranteed five years of funding. We believe there's more funding that should be done, but getting a five-year commitment to that funding is important. We reformed the \"No Child Left Behind\" law so we can make sure that students aren't facing too much testing.\nAnd all of that happened since many pundits were prepared to say the President was irrelevant and unable to advance his agenda.\nQ: And on the -- you made this announcement earlier about SnapChat.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes.\nQ: What's the President going to be doing on Snapchat? (Laughter.) Is he going to Snapchat with Hillary Clinton? (Laughter.) The messages disappear.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, sir. (Laughter.) I missed a good one. What did I miss?\nQ: She made that remarks in the past that the messages disappear.\nMR. EARNEST: I'll check the tape.\nQ: That's what she likes about Snapchat.\nMR. EARNEST: I see. I see. Look, we have unveiled the White House Snapchat function. And we certainly are hopeful that people will take a look at it and follow the White House. It is just another tool for us to try to communicate with the American public about what's happening here at the White House.\nAnd apropos of Byron's question, I am confident that we will ensure that even though the Snapchat messages disappear, that they are properly recorded for posterity's sake. (Laughter.)\nQ: They will be archived.\nMR. EARNEST: They will be.\nQ: Okay. And Snapchat is aware of that, I guess.\nMR. EARNEST: We've been able to work this out with them. I'm not sure exactly how, but we have.\nQ: I don't know how it works either.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay, good.\nQ: Thanks.\nMR. EARNEST: Margaret.\nQ: Josh, I want to go back to what you said earlier about GOP candidates were shaping the mindset of some Americans with an \"avalanche of negativity.\" Does the President see the State of the Union tomorrow as his chance to burnish his legacy and set the stage for a Democrat to follow him?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President sees this as an opportunity to talk to the country bluntly about the challenges that we face and the opportunities that are there for the taking, and if we're going to successfully confront these challenges, it's important that we understand exactly what they are. So you will hear the President talk about that.\nYou'll also hear the President talk about why he is so confident about our ability to meet those challenges. And when it comes to the opportunities that are available for the taking for the United States, no country in the world is better positioned to capitalize on those opportunities than the United States.\nAnd that ultimately is the essence of the message that the President wants to deliver, precisely because the next president needs to understand that and the American people need to understand that. They need to have an accurate assessment of what our challenges are, what the risks are out there, but also have an adequate understanding of what opportunities are available so that we don't miss them.\nAnd we are at a critical juncture in our history. We've spent seven years digging out of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. And thanks primarily to the grit and determination of the American people and American entrepreneurs and American innovators, we've made a lot of progress -- such that the United States' economy is now the envy of the world.\nAnd the question is, where do we go from here? What do we do to make sure that we can lock in prosperity for future generations of Americans, but also make sure that that prosperity is shared not just with those at the top, but with middle-class families and those families that are working really hard to try to get into the middle class.\nSo that's the essence of the message that the President wants to deliver. But I'm confident he'll deliver it much more articulately than I just have.\nQ: But given the \"avalanche of negativity,\" as you said, and given the approval ratings of where they are, would you say the President feels like he needs to be on the offensive?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President feels like this is a good opportunity, when you have the attention of the Congress and the American people, to help people understand this case. Look, if the President wanted to give a speech about what the President has been able to do over the last seven years, we'd have plenty to talk about. But the President is delivering a speech that's not about him; it's about the American people and about the future of our country, and about how our kids and their kids are going to fare.\nAnd he understands quite clearly that the kinds of decisions that he will make over the course of the next year and that the next president will have to make during their tenure in office will have a substantial impact on whether or not we pass on a country to the next generation of Americans that is as strong, that is as secure, that is as prosperous and is as fair as the United States has ever been. That is a tremendous opportunity that we have, but it is directly contingent on the kinds of decisions that we make right now.\nSo the stakes are high, and, frankly, the stakes are higher than any one president or any one Congress. But they will have a long-term impact on the kind of country that we pass on to future generations of Americans.\nQ: This will be Paul Ryan's first State of the Union as Speaker.\nMR. EARNEST: I'm sure he'll enjoy the view from the great front-row seat that he'll have.\nQ: Well, does the President see this as sort of a fresh start with Congress? Or is one of the reasons why he's not walking in with this laundry list of legislative items because he knows he can't really get anything done, regardless of who the Speaker is with the Congress he's facing now?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there's a lot that we've been able to get done just since Paul Ryan entered his office a couple of months ago. Many of the things that I talked about in answering Jim's question related to IMF reform and reauthorizing the Ex-Im Bank, and a budget agreement that includes a bunch of the priorities that we've long championed -- a transportation deal, \"No Child Left Behind\" legislation -- all of that was work that we were able to do by trying to find common ground with Paul Ryan.\nWe certainly don't agree with him -- President Obama doesn't agree with him on every issue. I'm not even sure we agree on most issues. But there is common ground that can be found. And by seizing that common ground we can do something good for the American people. And so the President is optimistic that we'll be able to continue to work constructively with Speaker Ryan in the year that remains in the Obama presidency.\nQ: Do you expect that the President will once again pledge and promise that he will shut down Guantanamo Bay? Today I believe is the 14-year anniversary. He hasn't succeeded in doing so at this point.\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know exactly how the President will discuss this in his speech. To go back to April's question, I anticipate that there will be more than one draft between now and 9:00 p.m. tomorrow night. But regardless of how the President talks about this in the speech, I can tell you that the President's commitment to achieving that national security priority is as strong as ever.\nAnd it often gets lost in the political debate, but the President's view that closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay is in our national security interest is a view that is shared not just by Democratic foreign policy experts, but even by Republican foreign policy experts that served the previous President, and include the previous President. So this is something the President is going to keep fighting for over the course of the next year.\nQ: There's been three detainees released over about the past week to 10 days. So is this chipping away at the detainee population the most the President can get done at this point?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, this chipping away at the population -- that included the announcement from the Department of Defense just this morning that an additional Gitmo detainee had been transferred to Saudi Arabia -- certainly is what we can do right now. And we have made some progress in reducing the population at the prison at Guantanamo Bay. But ultimately, to accomplish the goal of closing it, we're going to need Congress to remove some obstacles that have prevented it thus far.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. And congrats on your Chiefs.\nMR. EARNEST: Thank you, sir.\nQ: I want to begin by asking about Officer Hartnett in Philadelphia. Has the White House in any way reached out to him directly? Has the President been in contact with him at all, and is there a plan to do so?\nMR. EARNEST: I can tell you that White House officials have been in touch with officials in Philadelphia. I'm not aware of any personal contact with the officer at this point. Last I heard, he was still in the hospital. But we certainly are closely monitoring this case, and Officer Hartnett has certainly been on the hearts and minds of everybody here at the White House, including the President and the First Lady.\nQ: You mentioned earlier that because the Philadelphia Police Department and others are still working on this that you couldn't make necessarily a terror designation meaning, despite the fact that this particular perpetrator claimed to be a devotee of ISIS. Has that changed at all? Are you not feeling like that is something that would push you closer to making the declarative statement that this was obviously something that was terror related?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, obviously those reports lead us to worry that this could be an act of terrorism. And I'm sure that's part of the ongoing investigation that's being led by the Philadelphia Police Department right now.\nThe FBI has been supporting that investigation and there obviously is keen interest in trying to understand what may have motivated this individual to carry out this deplorable act of violence. And it is relevant whether or not this individual was motivated by demons inside of his own mind, or by demons that he encountered through social media. And either way, we want to make sure that we are mindful of the steps that we can take to mitigate the risk that is posed by this individual or others like him across the country.\nCertainly one thing that we can do is to keep guns out of the hands of people like him. And somebody who is planning to carry out a terrorist act or somebody who has significant mental problems is something who shouldn't be able to so easily get their hands on a gun. And so we're pretty mindful of that as well.\nQ: I want to ask you, speaking out about the State of the Union, could you maybe give me three words to describe -- I know it's a bit of a preview -- the President's intentions in this year's State of the Union?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't know if I can shrink it down to three words, but I can certainly tell you that the President intends to use this opportunity to convey his optimism about the future of the country and to convey his optimism about the ability of this country to confront the challenges that are ahead of us, but also to capitalize on the opportunities that are there for the take.\nQ: Would you expect him to acknowledge some of the promises that have not yet been fulfilled, as well, including closing the prison at Guantanamo, including ending the war in Afghanistan, maybe even comprehensive reform on immigration?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, some of those things that you mentioned are things that haven't happened because they were specifically blocked by members of Congress, and at least one of them was something that was blocked by Republicans in Congress. So I'm not sure the President can be held accountable for that.\nBut surely the President -- well, I'll let you watch the speech tomorrow and conclude for yourself.\nChris.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I understand that you say that this is not a political document, but do you deny that part of the aim, at least, is to help whoever the Democratic candidate is?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Chris, I think what is clear is that those who are closely following this election -- presumably that includes all of you, but also includes many Americans -- will take in the President's speech in the political context in which he's giving it. And there's no denying that. But the President is actually going to try to do something tomorrow that he regularly challenges Washington politicians to do, which is to look beyond the next election and actually consider the fate of the next generation of Americans. That's what's really on his mind.\nWill there be candidates in either party -- some Republican candidates trying to use this to advance their campaigns? Will there be Democratic candidates for President trying to use the President's message to advance their campaigns? I'm sure that will happen. And I'm not even sure that's inappropriate. But that's not what's motivating the President of the United States right now. What this President has the opportunity to do -- because he's not on the ballot for the next election -- he's got an opportunity to lay out for the American people the longer-term challenges that we face, but also the longer-term opportunities that exist.\nAnd if our goal really is to pass on an America that is stronger, more secure, and more prosperous to not just the next generation of Americans but to the kids of the next generation of Americans, then the decisions that we make today matter. And that's what the President is mindful of every day in the Oval Office. And tomorrow will be an opportunity for giving the American people the opportunity to get a little behind-the-scenes look at the President's thinking on this.\nQ: He's not on the ballot, but his legacy is. And he's got this -- you've all stated and he has stated that your goal is to get a Democrat elected so that his policies will not be under threat; that some of the important things that you feel that have happened over the course of the last seven years will continue. So at least in that context, is this a political speech?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I am not confident that -- the President certainly does want a successor who has the same set of priorities that he does and is interested in trying to build on the important progress that we've made over the last seven years. That certainly is something that the President is interested in. But again, the speech the President will give tomorrow will be focused less on the next election and much more on the interests of the next generation of Americans.\nQ: Can I ask you about the humanitarian crisis in the Syrian town on the Lebanese border and the concern by some humanitarian groups about what is causing that? Doctors Without Borders now says at least in one of their clinics, 28 people, including six babies, have been killed. And the suggestion has been made that part of what's motivating it is, frankly, a failure of international powers who have been looking to get the warring factions to come to the negotiating table and, as a result, are kind of ignoring international law. Are you concerned that the efforts to end the war there are actually contributing to the humanitarian crisis? And what are the White House's thoughts overall about what's happening there?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, first of all, the situation that we see in these graphic images and what you've just described are no less than heartbreaking. And these are innocent Syrians who are caught in the middle of terrible chaos and terrible violence.\nMany of the people that are in the towns that are actually getting some humanitarian relief today are people who live in towns that have been besieged by the Assad regime for years. And some of these communities are actually communities where the Assad regime had claimed to implement a ceasefire months ago, but yet it's still a dangerous place. And again, it's just the latest example of the terrible conduct of the Assad regime and the willingness of the Assad regime to use violence against the people that they're supposed to be governing and looking out for.\nThere are some estimates that there are about 400,000 people inside of Syria that are still besieged right now. And that is precisely why we are working so aggressively in the international community to try to bring about this political transition that's long overdue inside of Syria. It's ultimately this failed political system which is the direct result of Bashar al-Assad's failed leadership that has led to this problem. And so the sooner we can bring about that political transition, the sooner we can start to address these challenges at their root.\nQ: So do you reject the idea that perhaps inadvertently international efforts to intervene there are exacerbating the problem?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I will admit I'm not entirely familiar with the argument that some are making here. Our view is that we should be doing as much as we can to provide humanitarian relief to those who are suffering. And the United States has done more than any other country to provide the kind of relief both to other countries in the region who are housing refugees, but also to those relief organizations that are providing humanitarian relief inside of Syria. And we know that there are a number of U.N.-affiliated agencies in the Red Cross that are doing heroic work to respond to this situation, and the United States has been providing financial support to those efforts. They matter.\nBut, ultimately, to solve this problem, we have to bring about a political transition inside of Syria. President Bashar al-Assad has lost legitimacy to lead that country. We believe he should leave and a government that is prepared to unite Syria and to govern consistent with the will and ambition of the Syrian people should take power. And that's not going to happen overnight. This is painstaking work. And we have been focused on this for a long time, and a lot of people have died while we've been trying to solve this problem. There's no denying that either. But we're working as aggressively as we can because we're mindful of the very real human toll that this situation is having on a whole lot of innocent people.\nQ: And just a real quick one, if I can, on El Chapo. And you praised the Mexican officials for what they did in the capture. And at least one Mexican official has been pretty widely quoted as saying that they knew about the meeting between him and Sean Penn. And I just wonder if you can give us any background leading up to this -- how closely the White House was following it, if the President was being briefed on it, and if the United States knew -- if you know if the United States knew about this meeting.\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have a lot of information about what exactly led to Mr. Guzman's capture. This is obviously an effort that was led by Mexican authorities, that they'd been working basically around the clock on since he escaped. And this is not just a priority of the Mexican government. It had been a priority of the U.S. government, too. So we're obviously pleased to see the success that they've had in bringing him into custody and placing him under arrest. But for sort of the tick-tock of all this, I just don't have a lot of details for you.\nGregory.\nQ: Josh, is the State of Union address still as relevant as it used to be?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, that's an open-ended, philosophical question, I guess. I guess, thinking about it for four seconds, the answer to that question is yes. I think in a political environment in which there is so much debate and so many opportunities for various candidates and others with a political agenda to make their views known on whether it's Snapchat or something else -- that having a moment that we all acknowledge that for an hour, one day a year, the President of the United States, whoever it is, will command the attention of the United States Congress, a majority of Supreme Court justices, just about the entire Cabinet, and the television viewing audience during prime time is an important moment.\nAnd this year's speech, like every State of Union that takes place in an election year, will be taking place in a political environment. But ultimately this is an opportunity for the American people to hear from their President about the condition of the country and what that President's vision is for the future of the country. And I think that is -- even in the midst of the swirl of television ads and YouTube videos, tweets, and everything else -- that having a moment where everybody is focused on one speech I think is probably a pretty good thing both for the country but also for the political debate.\nQ: But fewer people are focused on it. We've got more channels now. It used to be when you and I were growing up, there were three channels and you pretty much had to watch the State of Union address. Now you can watch \"Desperate Housewives\" if you --\nMR. EARNEST: Yes.\nQ: You're also speaking to a more polarized Congress, half of which is going to sit on their hands for a lot of what the President says and the other half is going to get up and applaud. It's a different environment than it used to be. And so I guess my question is geared to trying to get at, do you acknowledge that reality? And how are you adjusting the communications strategy for this speech to acknowledge that new communication reality of YouTube, Twitter and Snapchat that you just alluded to?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess I would say there's no denying that this exercise has changed, but I don't think that makes it any less important. In some ways, I guess the case I'm trying to make is that it might be even more important than in an era where there was just less political communication because the technology at the time in the form of printing presses couldn't accommodate a whole lot of more political debate.\nBut obviously the situation is different now. And I actually think that that makes this one moment where the country sort of acknowledges that the President gets an hour to assess the condition of the country and to offer up a prescription for confronting the challenges and capitalizing on the opportunities is as important as ever.\nAnd we're surely going to use these new avenues for communicating that message to the American people. There will be more Snapchats. There will be more YouTube videos. Even Amazon is going to be running the State of Union address as a video-on-demand piece. So we're looking for new ways that we can capitalize on these tools to broadcast the State of Union even more broadly.\nBut again, in an era where the political debate is chock-full of arguments, having a moment where everybody focuses on what the President has to say is I think an important part of keeping the country together, and continuing and advancing a political debate that is up to the challenge of responding to the will of the people.\nAlexis.\nQ: Josh, I want to ask you a State of Union question, but first I want to follow up on your answer to Jim's question about Senator Sanders. You were describing the White House's pride in being transparent about visitors. So either the President met with Senator Sanders in the last week or he met with him last year -- because the President has been away and Senator Sanders has been busy campaigning. So can I ask you again, when did that meeting take place?\nMR. EARNEST: It didn't take place in the last week. It was at some point last year, but I don't know when.\nQ: So was it a one-on-one meeting?\nMR. EARNEST: As I've mentioned to Jim, they've both had a one-on-one meeting and met in settings that included more than just the two of them.\nQ: And was it the meeting that the President desired to have with the Democratic candidate?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know who invited him.\nQ: Now I guess my State of Union question -- the State of Union -- in your answer to the question that Margaret asked you about the speech, you know that there are many Americans from both parties who are concerned about Washington being broken and the dysfunction, so what extent does the President want to use this speech as a chance to talk about his use of executive power to try leap over the body that he'll be speaking to?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Alexis, I recognize that that's how our critics often characterize executive actions. But the fact is we have been clear at every stage that the President taking an executive action does not in any way absolve Congress of their responsibility to take action. The President didn't take action to keep guns out of the wrong hands as a way to go around Congress. He did that because he wanted to use every element of his authority to try to keep our communities and our kids safe -- or at least make them safer.\nAnd we are just as convinced as we were the day before the President announced these actions that Congress needs to pass legislation -- common-sense steps that would, for example, close the gun show loophole, or close the no-fly, no-buy loophole that currently allows somebody who is on the no-fly list to buy a gun. We certainly believe that there is legislation that could be passed to ensure that gun manufacturers are actually held accountable both for their business practices and for their products.\nSo the President's executive actions are not at all a substitute for congressional action. The same is true when it comes to minimum wage. The same is true when it comes to immigration reform.\nI recognize that there are some members of Congress who are hoping that this gets them off the hook, that they can somehow use the President's action as an excuse not to act. But they're learning the wrong lesson if that's the case they want to make.\nQ: One other quick follow-up. Is Mr. Buffett going to be in Omaha with the President?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not sure what Mr. Buffett's schedule is.\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know. Again, I don't know what his schedule is. But we'll let you know, obviously, when we get to Omaha.\nCheryl, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I wanted to talk about State of Union. And over the weekend, the White House put out a release that it's going to be using this Genius app to annotate the speech. Is that going to be where maybe more detailed descriptions of policy proposals are going to be?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think there are a variety of places that you can go. You can surely check the White House website for more details about the President's State of Union speech after he gives it. But there are a variety of ways in which we are hoping to help people understand exactly what the President's ideas include.\nAnd you've touched on another of them. This is a platform online, Genius, that allows people to essentially annotate documents to provide more information. Actually, I learned about this a little over the weekend. Apparently, this is a tool that actually was used to annotate rap lyrics, but has been appropriated for a variety of different topics. And in this case, it's been appropriated to help people better understand what's included in the State of Union. So, just another example of the kind of interesting tools that we're hoping to use to give people a sense of the President's thinking about the State of Union.\nAll right, thanks, everybody. Tune in tomorrow.\nEND 2:09 P.M. EST", "timestamp": "2016-01-11", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}

Russell, R-OK, and 62 cosponsors)\nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3662, the Iran Terror Finance Transparency Act, which would prevent the United States from implementing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) by tying the Administration's ability to fulfill U.S. commitments under the deal to unrelated, non-nuclear issues.\nH.R. 3662 includes provisions that connect the United States' JCPOA commitment to provide sanctions relief by delisting certain Iran-related individuals and entities, including banks, to non-nuclear issues outside of the scope of the JCPOA. In addition, certain provisions would effectively preclude delisting of individuals or entities on Implementation Day of the JCPOA - the day on which the International Atomic Energy Agency verifies that Iran has completed key nuclear-related steps that significantly dismantle and constrain its nuclear program - based on activity that may have taken place and ended long before Implementation Day and involving persons or activity that will no longer be sanctioned post-Implementation Day. By preventing the United States from fulfilling its JCPOA commitments, H.R. 3662 could result in the collapse of a comprehensive diplomatic arrangement that peacefully and verifiably prevents Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. Such a collapse would remove the unprecedented constraints on Iran's nuclear program that we achieved in the JCPOA, lead to the unraveling of the international sanctions regime against Iran, and deal a devastating blow to America's credibility as a leader of international diplomacy. This would have ripple effects, jeopardizing the hard work of sustaining a unified coalition to combat Iran's destabilizing activities in the region, calling into question the effectiveness of our sanctions regime and our ability to lead the world on nuclear non-proliferation.\nThe Administration has consistently made clear that the purpose of the nuclear negotiations, and ultimately the JCPOA, was to address one issue only - the international community's concerns over Iran's nuclear program and to verifiably prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. The JCPOA is the mechanism through which the United States was able to garner international support for our sanctions and achieve a diplomatic resolution.\nAs we address our concerns with Iran's nuclear program through implementation of the JCPOA, the Administration remains clear-eyed and shares the deep concerns of the Congress and the American people about Iran's support for terrorism. Powerful sanctions targeting Iran's support for terrorism, its ballistic missile activities, its human rights abuses, and its destabilizing activities in the region remain in effect. Anyone worldwide who transacts with or supports individuals or entities sanctioned in connection with Iran's support for terrorism or development of WMD and their means of delivery, including missiles - or who does the same with any Iranian individual or entity who remains on Treasury's Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List - puts themselves at risk of being sanctioned.\nThe President has made it clear that he will veto any legislation that prevents the successful implementation of the JCPOA. If the President were presented with H.R. 3662, he would veto the bill.", "timestamp": "2016-01-11", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 3662 - Iran Terror Finance Transparency Act"}

Mooney, R-WV, and 34 cosponsors)\nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 1644, which would delay for at least three years updated regulations, known as the Stream Protection Rule, to protect streams from the effects of destructive surface coal mining practices. Such a needless delay of these important safeguards would impact the communities and economies that depend on clean water and a healthy environment.\nThe current stream protection requirements governing surface mining activities are more than 30 years old and do not incorporate significant advances in scientific knowledge and mining and reclamation techniques. An arbitrary three year restriction to block the updated modern, science-based regulations would significantly impair the ability of the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) to accomplish the mission and responsibilities the Congress laid out in the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, including preserving clean water, human health, and the environment.\nH.R. 1644 would prevent the restoration of hundreds of streams, result in deterioration of water quality for thousands of stream miles, and create sustained regulatory uncertainty, as well as public health impacts for downstream communities. In addition, the bill would impose arbitrary requirements and unnecessary processes that would seriously impede OSMRE's ability to use the best available science to protect public health and the environment.\nIf the President were presented with H.R. 1644, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.", "timestamp": "2016-01-11", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 1644 - STREAM Act"}

Larry Ross as communications director; Colonel Christopher Bourne, USMC, Retired, as director of policy; and Jason Osborne as senior communications strategist.\nA. Larry Ross\n\"I am privileged to welcome Larry Ross to lead our communications team,\" said Carson. \"Larry has an incredible track record as a communications professional with proven results and a staunch commitment to the Christian values I hold dear.\"\nRoss is a veteran senior corporate and agency communications professional, with more than 39 years experience in strategic mainstream and Christian media and public relations. He is president of A. Larry Ross Communications, a full-service agency he founded in 1994 to provide crossover media liaison at the intersection of faith, culture and social concerns. Following several years as field representative for The General Motors Corporation and later working in financial PR with a New York firm handling media messaging for baseball great Joe DiMaggio, Ross served as personal spokesperson for evangelist Billy Graham, beginning in 1981.\n\"I am humbled by Dr. Carson's confidence and trust in asking me to serve as communications director and excited to join his team in a leadership role to execute communications strategy at this critical juncture in the campaign,\" said Ross. \"Dr. Carson is a man of renowned integrity, authenticity and transparency, whose message transcends politics, offering practical — often spiritual — solutions to the problems we face, from the bottom up.\"\n\"We are in a battle for the soul of our nation, and I am motivated by Dr. Carson's vision and passion to equip and empower each individual to move out of a culture of entitlement and dependency by taking responsibility and seizing opportunities, as each individual does his or her part to renew America,\" Ross added. \"As demonstrated by the recent overflow crowds he has encountered on the campaign trail, the response to Dr. Carson's character and message has created a wave that has yet to peak in the days ahead as we countdown to Iowa and beyond.\"\nColonel Christopher Bourne, USMC Retired\n\"I'm also excited to welcome Col. Bourne as head of our policy staff,\" Carson continued. \"Chris is an experienced defense and strategy professional with an impressive military resume to match.\"\nBourne's 25 years of service in the U.S. Marine Corps included extensive strategic leadership in Washington, D.C. and diverse operational experience in Iraq, Afghanistan and the Pacific Theatre.\nBourne's broad national security proficiency includes leadership of the Joint Chiefs of Staff planning in the inter-agency process for a Presidential Initiative on Peace Operations, an initiative on the War on Terror and U.N. Security Council resolutions on peacekeeping and Iraq. Col. Bourne led the first conventional unit into Afghanistan after 9/11, and is currently president of Bourne Executive Strategies, LLC in Greenville, South Carolina. He was previously a foreign policy advisor of the campaign.\n\"I am honored that Dr. Carson has asked me to assume this responsibility as we begin a new chapter within the Carson campaign,\" said Bourne. \"As a former Marine Corps officer, I value genuine leadership and Dr. Carson is the type of leader and man I am proud to support.\"\nJason Osborne\n\"I'm further pleased to announce the promotion of Jason Osborne,\" Carson added. \"In his previous roles, Jason provided our team with exemplary results and I have been thankful to work side-by-side with him as we continue to campaign in Iowa and other primary states.\"\nOsborne has previously served as the Carson campaign's deputy senior strategist and director for the U.S. Territories and Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). Osborne is a seasoned professional with more than 20 years of experience in politics. He served as campaign manager for two successful CNMI gubernatorial candidates in 2014 and 2009.\nIn 2012, Osborne was the Director of External Affairs for the 2012 Republican National Convention, and in that role served as the primary political point of contact for the Convention. Additionally, he previously served as a senior advisor to political parties and campaigns throughout Asia and as a senior federal liaison for the National Rifle Association.\n\"This promotion is an honor; I have thoroughly enjoyed serving the Campaign in my previous positions and I am even more excited to be working extensively with the communications team,\" said Osborne. \"Dr. Carson has an incredible message for Americans and I feel privileged to be a part of this vital aspect of his campaign. I have no doubt that he is the man to lead our nation.\"\nCarson confirmed that these staff appointments reflect a stronger, more action-oriented campaign, under the leadership of campaign chairman General Bob Dees, focused on policy and execution heading into the primary season.\n\"I am running for president because I believe in our great nation, but we currently face grave challenges at home and abroad,\" Carson concluded. \"I have the experience and wisdom for fighting radical Islamic terrorism, defending the homeland, reviving our economy, fixing our healthcare system and restoring faith in our country and in each other. I am grateful that Larry, Chris and Jason have joined my campaign, and I am confident they will provide the seasoned leadership necessary for conveying my vision of hope and healing to the American people.\"", "timestamp": "2016-01-11", "title": "Press Release - Dr. Ben Carson Strengthens Campaign Leadership and Announces New Senior Staff Members"}

{"author": "Marco Rubio", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=113717", "text": "January 11, 2016\nAs prepared for delivery in Sarasota, Florida:\nThank you all for being here.\nEvery time an election rolls around, the media becomes obsessed with polls. But oftentimes they obsess over the wrong ones. Today I want to tell you about a poll the media is ignoring, but that should be the talk of this entire election.\nIt's a recent poll that asked, \"Is the American Dream alive or dead?\"  Almost half of millennials, meaning young Americans, replied that the American Dream was dead. Other polls have shown even higher numbers, across all generations.\nThis is a warning sign for America — a sign that what's at stake in this election is our identity as a special nation. That identity has long been tied to the belief that here, anything is possible. That here, you don't have to come from wealth or privilege to provide a comfortable life for your family. That here, anyone who works hard can leave their children better off than themselves.\nThat is the real American Dream. But today, it is dying. It's not dying because our people have changed. They haven't. It's dying because both parties in Washington have let us down.\nIt's dying because Barack Obama has abandoned the economic principles that made us the most prosperous nation in the world. It's dying because Congress has spent us into unprecedented debt. And it's dying because, while our economy is pushing the boundaries of the 21st century, our leaders are stuck in the 20th.\nThey fail to grasp the way technology and globalization have transformed our economy. They raise taxes and grow government even though it's costing jobs and making America globally uncompetitive. They shrug off the rising importance of trade and foreign policy on our household budgets. They seem bewildered when market turmoil in Beijing triggers market turmoil in New York.\nTo confront new realities, we need new leaders — leaders who will apply the free market principles of our founding to the economic realities of our time — who will once again place Washington's faith in our economy, rather than forcing our economy to place its faith in Washington.\nThe purpose of my presidency will be to restore the American Dream. And I will start by re-embracing free enterprise, because it is the greatest economic system in history — the only system where poor people can become richer without rich people becoming poorer. The only system where everybody can be better off.\nHere's what Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton don't understand about free enterprise: In a free enterprise system, the president does not run the economy. The president's job is to ensure policies are in place that allow the private sector to succeed, because it is the private sector that creates jobs and opportunity.\nToday, we don't have those policies in place. Under Barack Obama, Washington borrows an average of more than a trillion dollars a year. It forces our private sector to spend almost two trillion dollars a year to comply with regulations. It imposes the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world. It thinks its job is to make your health care decisions, to bailout big businesses, and even to control the weather.\nAs president, I will put Washington in its place. It will once again stand behind our people, not in their way.\nI will repeal and replace ObamaCare before it repeals and replaces any more American jobs. I will shred Obama's job-killing executive orders. I will cap the amount regulations can cost our economy. And I will end Washington's addiction to wasteful spending. Because by the time our next president takes office, America will already be $20 trillion in debt.\nIt's difficult to even fathom how much that is. So think about it this way: If you were to count 20 trillion dollars by hand, at one dollar per second without stopping, it wouldn't take a year or a decade or even a century to finish counting. It would take you over 600,000 years.\nThat's how much money we will owe when Barack Obama leaves the White House. The debt will have almost doubled since he took office. Much of it we'll owe to China. And make no mistake: if we change nothing, we are going to have a debt crisis in this country. It is going to destroy jobs. It is going to disrupt the function of our government. It is going to threaten our national security.\nThis is the most predictable crisis in American history. But every time the alarm starts blaring, signaling we're reaching the debt ceiling, Washington hits the snooze button and goes back to sleep. Under our last three presidents, the debt ceiling has been raised more than 20 times without serious spending reforms.\nI will stop this irresponsible spending and solve our nation's debt crisis.\nFirst, I will have the political courage to reform the main drivers of our debt, which are Social Security and Medicare. If we do nothing to save these important programs, they will bankrupt themselves and our nation. I will save them for future generations by placing them on fiscally sustainable paths.\nBut that alone will not avert a debt crisis. Because history backs up the following fact: If you don't have laws in place to keep politicians from spending money they don't have, they will borrow money and spend it. And since Congress refuses to pass a law restricting itself, we are left with only one option.\nWe must do what our founders gave us the power to do: we must call a convention of states to amend the U.S. Constitution. We must pass amendments limiting the size and scope of the federal government, forcing Congress to balance the budget, and imposing term limits on Congress and the Supreme Court.\nAs president, I can promote such a convention, but I cannot make it happen without the American people. That's why I'm asking for your help today. To any American worried about the debt we're leaving our children: Join me in this effort. Press your state representatives to convene a convention of states.\nThe third and final step to solving our debt crisis is growing the American economy. That will happen by making America the best place in the world to own and operate a business. If you want to know how to do this, talk to our job creators.\nI don't know of a single job creator who is looking for more taxes or more regulations, yet that's exactly what some candidates for president are proposing.  Hillary Clinton's answer to every problem is to raise taxes and create a new government program. And it's not just her, or the avowed socialist running against her. Believe it or not, multiple Republican candidates for president support new taxes on the American people.\nSome even support imposing a new tax that generations of conservatives have fought against, called a Value Added Tax — also known as a VAT.  The VAT being proposed in this election works by taxing businesses at each stage of the production process. It falls squarely on profits and wages. That means it punishes businesses for earning money, and it punishes your boss for giving you a raise.\nThe VAT is also intentionally sneaky. It attempts to trick people into believing their taxes are being lowered, when in reality they're simply being shifted to employers — meaning everyday Americans would feel its impact through higher prices and lower wages. This would be especially harmful to the poor and senior citizens with fixed incomes.\nThe VAT makes for a dangerous expansion of Washington's power, especially when stacked on top of an income tax. In most European countries where a VAT has been implemented, government has grown in size. It's no wonder that fans of the VAT include Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama, who called it a \"novel\" idea.\nAnd opponents included Ronald Reagan, who said the Value Added Tax, quote, \"gives a government a chance to blindfold the people and grow in stature and size.\"  And he was right. No candidate who supports this tax can claim to be in favor of \"abolishing\" the IRS. Reagan's Treasury Department estimated it would need 20,000 new agents just to administer a VAT.\nRepublican candidates today try to hide their support for the Value Added Tax by renaming it a \"Business Flat Tax.\" But don't be fooled. If it acts like a VAT, taxes like a VAT, and grows government like a VAT — it's a VAT.\nThis isn't the only anti-free market idea being offered up by Republicans in this race. Other Republicans running for president support an Internet sales tax that could subject businesses to audit from almost 10,000 jurisdictions around the country. The Internet is the marketplace of the 21st century and it's unacceptable that anyone who claims to be a conservative would join the liberal call for an online tax.\nLet me be clear: I do not support new taxes of any kind, because what our country needs is economic growth, and there is no new tax that leads to economic growth.\nI have offered a plan to simplify and reduce taxes on both individuals and businesses. My plan is pro-growth and pro-family. It will lower the corporate tax rate to be globally competitive, it will level the playing field between big businesses and small ones, and it will make it easier for your boss to give you a raise.\nIt will also allow families to keep more of what they earn. Today it is more expensive than ever to raise a child, and our tax system is making it even costlier. With four children of our own, Jeanette and I live this every day in our house. As president, I will raise the per-child tax credit so parents can keep more of their money to spend on food, clothing, school supplies, and all the other daily costs of raising children.\nI will also end the marriage penalty that leads to couples being taxed more than individuals. Nothing has the ability to improve a child's future more than being raised in a loving two-parent home, and it's time our tax code recognizes that.\nThrough tax reforms, I will also strengthen family leave policy so fewer parents have to choose between providing financially for their children and being there for them in times of crisis. Instead of raising taxes and growing government to solve this problem, as Hillary Clinton just proposed last week, I will solve it by cutting taxes for all businesses that offer between four and twelve weeks of paid leave.\nFrom the individual to the business side, my free market reforms will yield a tax code that makes it easier for Americans to find jobs and easier for businesses to create them. They will help everyone succeed and create millions of new jobs.\nAs president, I will recognize that what makes America great is not that we have rich people. Every country has rich people. What makes America great is that we have millions of people who are not necessarily rich, but who have a job that pays a comfortable wage, that enables them to do the activities they enjoy with the people they love, to retire with dignity, and ultimately to leave their children better off than themselves.\nThat has been possible in America because of the choices generations before us have made.\nAlmost every other country in the world has chosen to have government dominate the economy. In those countries, those who can influence government keep winning, and everybody else stays the same. The employee never becomes the employer, the small business can never compete with the big business, and no matter how hard your parents work or how many sacrifices they make, if you weren't born into the right family, there's only so far you can go.\nAmericans before us have chosen something very different. They chose individual liberty. They chose a limited government that exists to protect our rights, not to grant them. They chose a free enterprise system designed to provide equality of opportunity, not compel equality of results.\nAnd yet, there are still people who cling to the belief that America is better off adopting the economic policies of nations whose people immigrate here. There have always been these voices in American politics. But seven years ago, one of them was sworn in as president.\nSince then, his ideas have sent the message to our people that becoming better off requires someone else becoming worse off — that the only way to climb up the economic ladder is to pull someone else down — that government is the best hope for those in search of a better life.\nBut his big government ideas have failed us. Our people hear him talk about how well the economy is doing, but they don't feel it in their lives. And as a result, we are now at risk of seeing an entire generation of Americans lose hope in the fundamental promise of our country: the promise that hard work and perseverance will lead to a better life.\nSeven years of Barack Obama have left us a nation in decline. But we can still pull out of the dive. Because we are not a weak country, we just have a weak President.\nBut the time to act is now.\nWe cannot afford to elect Hillary Clinton, because America cannot afford another four years like the eight before it. And we cannot settle for just any Republican, because this election is not just a choice between two parties, it is a generational choice about our identity as a nation.\nWe did not become an exceptional nation by accident. For over two centuries, each generation before us did what they needed to do to make this the greatest nation on earth.\nAnd now, the time has come for us to do our part.\nIf you elect me president, we will return to the principles that made America great, we will put the false promise of big government behind us and embrace the power of a free people in a free economy to create a more prosperous nation. In doing so, we will not only save the American Dream, we will expand it to reach more people than ever before.\nAnd the 21st Century will not just be as good as the 20th century, it will be better.\nIt will be a New American Century.", "timestamp": "2016-01-11", "title": "Press Release - TRANSCRIPT: Marco's Address on Growing the Economy Without New Taxes"}

And to me that's just another reason why voters are expressing their visceral hatred for all things Washington in poll after poll.\nAs President, I want to fix the hate and encourage Americans to dream big again, tackle tough problems and get things done. After seven years of Obama, we've lost the ability to do any of these things. Our politics are small and petty and our nation is declining before our eyes.\nLet me be clear, talking about fixing Washington, isn't a political calculation for me and let me explain why. A nice couple in Iowa this morning asked me why I was running for President and I got choked up. I went on to talk about my grandkids and how much they mean to me and how their future means more than my own. The thought of my leaving behind a declining America to my children and grandchildren is unacceptable to me. And I won't.

We need to reform mandatory minimum sentences and support mental health and drug treatment programs so that low-level, nonviolent offenders who stay clean can avoid prison.\n\" When people see that respect and trust are two-way streets, they're more likely to work hand-in-hand with law enforcement.\"\nPolicing has to be constitutional to be effective. Period. That's why Hillary is calling for smart policing strategies that will help rebuild trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve, like:\nHillary believes police body cameras will go a long way to improve transparency and accountability on both sides of the lens.\n\" African American men are far more likely to be stopped and searched by police, charged with crimes, and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men—10 percent longer for the same crimes in the federal system.\"\nWe need to end to racial profiling once and for all—and prohibit law enforcement from relying on race in routine stops and investigations where there is no information linking a person to a crime.\nHillary will make new investments to ensure law enforcement officials are properly trained on issues like implicit bias, conflict resolution, and use of force so they're equipped to protect their own safety and the safety of others.\nWe need to reform mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines that keep nonviolent drug offenders in prison longer than they need to be. Hillary will give judges more discretion over sentencing, cut the mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders in half, and eliminate the disparity between sentences for crack and powder cocaine possession.\nOur prison system is the federal government's responsibility—and shouldn't be contracted out to private corporations. As president, Hillary will close private prisons and immigrant detention centers.\nMany job and housing applications require people to check a box if they have a criminal record. That closes opportunities for former prisoners. As president, Hillary will \"ban the box\" so that applicants for jobs with the federal government and federal contractors have an opportunity to demonstrate their qualifications before being asked about their criminal records.\nFixing our criminal justice system isn't enough—we have to address the underlying challenges that families face, like finding affordable child care and quality schools. That's why Hillary is fighting to raise incomes, make college affordable, and provide better economic opportunities for every American.\nHillary has fought inequality throughout her career. As a young attorney working for the Children's Defense Fund, she saw first hand how our legal system can sometimes fail those who need it most. And she has been been working to change that ever since.", "timestamp": "2016-01-11", "title": "Press Release - 9 Things You Should Know About Hillary Clinton's Plan To Reform Our Criminal Justice System"}

When the next president is sworn into office, three of the current justices on the bench will be over the age of 80.\nRight now, the court is hearing arguments for Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, a case that could harm unions and undermine the foundation of collective bargaining rights. The decision in this case will directly impact millions of American workers.\nAnd in this term, the Supreme Court will also rule on the future of voting rights, women's health, affirmative action, and immigration. The fate of America's most fundamental rights may depend on the person (or people) our next president chooses.\nIn an op-ed for the Boston Globe, Hillary Clinton lays out why the stakes are so high:\nThese aren't hypothetical scenarios: These cases will be in front of the Supreme Court this term and in the years to come. And one new conservative justice would be enough to tip the scales, because many important Supreme Court cases are decided by just one vote—including the case that made marriage equality the law of the land.\nThe Republican presidential candidates each have a vision for who they will appoint to the Supreme Court—and it's terrifying.\nThey want to stack the court with justices who will put constitutional rights in jeopardy. If the next president is a Republican, Americans could lose access to affordable health care, reproductive rights, and same-sex marriage in just a few short years.\nHillary understands the court's power to review and interpret our laws—but unlike the Republicans, she won't appoint justices who will move our country backwards.\nA Republican president could stack the Supreme Court with justices who will rip away all of the progress we've made as a nation.

That's why we're fighting for a Congress and White House that stand up to the corporate gun lobby's intimidation and bullying. And that's why, today, we are endorsing Hillary Clinton for president.\nFor far too long, the gun lobby has had a stranglehold on Washington. Members of Congress and even some of our presidents have been intimidated into inaction. Bipartisan action has been blocked. Loopholes in our laws that let dangerous people get guns have been fiercely protected. Lies have been spread, fears have been stoked, and a dangerous, unacceptable status quo has been furthered, all while gun sales have skyrocketed.?\nThroughout all of this, the corporate gun lobby has moved further and further away from the gun owners they claim to represent.?\nMost of the people running for president talk a lot about how tough they are. But most of them have shown they aren't tough enough to stand up to the gun lobbyists.\nTake it from me: Talk is cheap.\nIn fact, a lot of the people running for president seem downright terrified to even have a rational conversation about the problem of gun violence in America. We've listened closely to all of them, and we've looked at all of their records.Only one candidate for president has the determination and toughness to stand up to the corporate gun lobby—and the record to prove it. That candidate is Hillary Clinton.\nTime and time again, Hillary has done and said what is right, not what is politically expedient. That's why Mark and I are supporting her for president of the United States.\nAs a United States senator, Hillary voted for laws that keep guns out of the wrong hands and make our communities safer places to live. She voted against protecting gun manufacturers at all costs and insisted on putting the safety of our communities over manufacturers' bottom lines. And we believe that as president she will continue working to respect the rights of law-abiding gun owners like us while working to achieve practical solutions like a reliable background check system that prevents dangerous people from getting guns, closing loopholes to protect women and families by keeping guns out of the hands of abusers and stalkers, and cracking down on the illegal gun trade.?\nHillary and I share a proud tradition of women leading on issues that impact all Americans and getting things done. We have taken on tough races, relied on other strong women to have our backs—and we have never, ever shied away from a tough fight or a tough vote.\nToday, Mark and I are proud to have Hillary's back, and to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with her to, once and for all, break the stranglehold the corporate gun lobby has had on American politics—and American families—for too long.?\nSpeaking is still physically difficult for me. I do hours and hours of speech therapy.

Pursuant to section 506A(c)(1) of the 1974 Act, I have determined that South Africa is not meeting the requirements described in section 506A(a)(1) of the 1974 Act and that suspending the application of duty-free treatment to certain goods would be more effective in promoting compliance by South Africa with such requirements than terminating the designation of South Africa as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country.

{"author": "Rebuttal Speech", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111392", "text": "Rebuttal Delivered by Governor Nikki Haley of South Carolina\n[The President's speech of which this is a response, can be found by clicking this link.]\nGood evening.\nI'm Nikki Haley, Governor of the great state of South Carolina.\nI'm speaking tonight from Columbia, our state's capital city. Much like America as a whole, ours is a state with a rich and complicated history, one that proves the idea that each day can be better than the last.\nIn just a minute, I'm going to talk about a vision of a brighter American future. But first I want to say a few words about President Obama, who just gave his final State of the Union address.\nBarack Obama's election as president seven years ago broke historic barriers and inspired millions of Americans. As he did when he first ran for office, tonight President Obama spoke eloquently about grand things. He is at his best when he does that.\nUnfortunately, the President's record has often fallen far short of his soaring words.\nAs he enters his final year in office, many Americans are still feeling the squeeze of an economy too weak to raise income levels. We're feeling a crushing national debt, a health care plan that has made insurance less affordable and doctors less available, and chaotic unrest in many of our cities.\nEven worse, we are facing the most dangerous terrorist threat our nation has seen since September 11th, and this president appears either unwilling or unable to deal with it.\nSoon, the Obama presidency will end, and America will have the chance to turn in a new direction. That direction is what I want to talk about tonight.\nAt the outset, I'll say this: you've paid attention to what has been happening in Washington, and you're not naive.\nNeither am I. I see what you see. And many of your frustrations are my frustrations.\nA frustration with a government that has grown day after day, year after year, yet doesn't serve us any better. A frustration with the same, endless conversations we hear over and over again. A frustration with promises made and never kept.\nWe need to be honest with each other, and with ourselves: while Democrats in Washington bear much responsibility for the problems facing America today, they do not bear it alone. There is more than enough blame to go around.\nWe as Republicans need to own that truth. We need to recognize our contributions to the erosion of the public trust in America's leadership. We need to accept that we've played a role in how and why our government is broken.\nAnd then we need to fix it.\nThe foundation that has made America that last, best hope on earth hasn't gone anywhere. It still exists. It is up to us to return to it.\nFor me, that starts right where it always has: I am the proud daughter of Indian immigrants who reminded my brothers, my sister and me every day how blessed we were to live in this country.\nGrowing up in the rural south, my family didn't look like our neighbors, and we didn't have much. There were times that were tough, but we had each other, and we had the opportunity to do anything, to be anything, as long as we were willing to work for it.\nMy story is really not much different from millions of other Americans. Immigrants have been coming to our shores for generations to live the dream that is America. They wanted better for their children than for themselves. That remains the dream of all of us, and in this country we have seen time and again that that dream is achievable.\nToday, we live in a time of threats like few others in recent memory. During anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices. We must resist that temptation.\nNo one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws, and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country.\nAt the same time, that does not mean we just flat out open our borders. We can't do that. We cannot continue to allow immigrants to come here illegally. And in this age of terrorism, we must not let in refugees whose intentions cannot be determined.\nWe must fix our broken immigration system. That means stopping illegal immigration. And it means welcoming properly vetted legal immigrants, regardless of their race or religion. Just like we have for centuries.\nI have no doubt that if we act with proper focus, we can protect our borders, our sovereignty and our citizens, all while remaining true to America's noblest legacies.\nThis past summer, South Carolina was dealt a tragic blow. On an otherwise ordinary Wednesday evening in June, at the historic Mother Emanuel church in Charleston, twelve faithful men and women, young and old, went to Bible study.\nThat night, someone new joined them. He didn't look like them, didn't act like them, didn't sound like them. They didn't throw him out. They didn't call the police. Instead, they pulled up a chair and prayed with him. For an hour.\nWe lost nine incredible souls that night.\nWhat happened after the tragedy is worth pausing to think about.\nOur state was struck with shock, pain, and fear. But our people would not allow hate to win. We didn't have violence, we had vigils. We didn't have riots, we had hugs.\nWe didn't turn against each other's race or religion. We turned toward God, and to the values that have long made our country the freest and greatest in the world.\nWe removed a symbol that was being used to divide us, and we found a strength that united us against a domestic terrorist and the hate that filled him.\nThere's an important lesson in this. In many parts of society today, whether in popular culture, academia, the media, or politics, there's a tendency to falsely equate noise with results.\nSome people think that you have to be the loudest voice in the room to make a difference. That is just not true. Often, the best thing we can do is turn down the volume. When the sound is quieter, you can actually hear what someone else is saying. And that can make a world of difference.\nOf course that doesn't mean we won't have strong disagreements. We will. And as we usher in this new era, Republicans will stand up for our beliefs.\nIf we held the White House, taxes would be lower for working families, and we'd put the brakes on runaway spending and debt.\nWe would encourage American innovation and success instead of demonizing them, so our economy would truly soar and good jobs would be available across our country.\nWe would reform education so it worked best for students, parents, and teachers, not Washington bureaucrats and union bosses.\nWe would end a disastrous health care program, and replace it with reforms that lowered costs and actually let you keep your doctor.\nWe would respect differences in modern families, but we would also insist on respect for religious liberty as a cornerstone of our democracy.\nWe would recognize the importance of the separation of powers and honor the Constitution in its entirety. And yes, that includes the Second and Tenth Amendments.\nWe would make international agreements that were celebrated in Israel and protested in Iran, not the other way around.\nAnd rather than just thanking our brave men and women in uniform, we would actually strengthen our military, so both our friends and our enemies would know that America seeks peace, but when we fight wars we win them.\nWe have big decisions to make. Our country is being tested.\nBut we've been tested in the past, and our people have always risen to the challenge. We have all the guidance we need to be safe and successful.\nOur forefathers paved the way for us.\nLet's take their values, and their strengths, and rededicate ourselves to doing whatever it takes to keep America the greatest country in the history of man. And woman.\nThank you, good night, and God bless.", "timestamp": "2016-01-12", "title": "Republican Party Response to President Obama's \"Address Before a Joint Session of the Congress on the State of the Union\""}

{"author": "Jeb Bush", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=112590", "text": "With alarming regularity, foreign-intelligence services, terrorist groups like ISIS, rogue hackers, and common thieves are conducting attacks against computer networks belonging to the US government and private companies, and against critical infrastructure like power companies, hydroelectric dams, and water-treatment plants.\nIn the face of this threat, we can be certain of one thing: We can't trust someone as our next president who didn't take cybersecurity seriously when she was secretary of state.\nSensitive US military networks have been targeted. Federal agencies have been hit. Local governments have been attacked. Voter databases have been compromised. Multinational companies, banks, casinos, health insurers, Hollywood movie studios, pharmaceutical manufacturers, Silicon Valley titans, online and brick-and-mortar retailers — the list goes on and on.\nIt is said there are two types of companies: those that have been hit by a cyberattack, and those that don't yet realize they've been hacked.\nVirtually every aspect of our way of life in the 21st century depends on data stored in or communicated via the Internet; failure to secure it will harm all of us.\nRecent high-profile cyber attacks are another reminder that we are not keeping up with the growing threat, and there are thousands of more attacks that go unreported and unnoticed by the general public. I have a plan to address this growing threat.\nCybersecurity is not solely the responsibility of the federal government, but the next president must harness an array of tools to confront this challenge. Without meaningful presidential leadership, there is little chance the US government, private sector, and international partners will coordinate effectively to secure the Internet. As president, I will ensure the private sector is provided the most current threat information, the best practices and standards to protect systems and critical infrastructure, and a legal framework that better allows it to defend itself.\nAs with national security generally, cybersecurity has been undermined by a lack of leadership and by massive cuts to the US military and intelligence community imposed by Obama and Congress. The backbone of US intelligence efforts and frontline defense against cyberattacks are the talented intelligence professionals and law enforcement officers who work tirelessly in the shadows to identify, deter, and respond to cyber-attacks. They do not deserve to be demonized by the political class in Washington, but rather praised and provided with the capabilities and authorities needed to keep America safe.\nAlthough our military and intelligence community are often ahead of the cyberthreat curve, the rest of the government clearly lags behind, as thetheft of millions of documents from the Office of Personnel Management demonstrates. If it is to lead the way in addressing these threats, the federal government must put its own house in order, prioritizing to reflect the urgency and importance of protecting key databases and communications.  Agency chiefs who fail to prioritize cybersecurity and poorly performing IT managers must be held accountable.\nGood cybersecurity is not just about technological solutions and physical improvements to firewalls, perimeters, and data links, but about the cultural and behavioral aspects of security. Just as preventative maintenance keeps our cars running, so too must we use best practices and vigilance to keep our networks secure and our data safe. The government has a role to play in promoting, and adopting, these best practices, and in helping to change the culture of complacency that makes us vulnerable.\nThe average time lag between a cyber attack and when the attack is detected is roughly 200 days. We need to adapt our approaches to cybersecurity so we are more likely to detect an intrusion before it its too late. This means more regularly scanning networks, applying new technological tools to detect intrusions, and better sharing of threat signatures so an attack on one does not lead to an attack on many. Recently passed legislation to increase information-sharing between the government and private sector, and within the private sector, is a step forward but more needs to be done.\nDeterring attacks in the first place is as important than detecting them. We must increase the cost to those who are stealing our nation's intellectual capital and personal information. Exposing, sanctioning, prosecuting, and in some cases retaliating against these attackers will help deter other would-be attackers.\nPresidential leadership will be needed to encourage international partners to join us in writing international rules of the road and legal frameworks to facilitate prosecution of cybercriminals, who rarely operate solely within the physical boundaries of United States.\nWe should pursue negotiations with foreign governments who have been known to conduct cyberattacks, as the Obama administration has done to discourage China hacking, but it would be naпve to believe these countries will abide by such agreements unless we are willing to impose meaningful consequences. (Indeed, public reporting already suggests that Chinese industrial espionage has continued in spite of this recent agreement.)\nEffective cybersecurity is essential for our national and economic security. The next president will have to marshal public and private capabilities to ensure our critical infrastructure, networks, and communications are defensible and defended. In my administration, this will be a strategic priority, not a talking point. We will maintain our technological edge and return to a position of unparalleled leadership in the world.\nOriginally Posted on Business Insider", "timestamp": "2016-01-12", "title": "Press Release - Jeb: Here's My Plan to Address the Monumental Threat of Cyber Attacks"}

I am proud to support a bill, just like I have every year since joining the Senate, that would require an audit of the Fed and allow Congress to examine its activities like they do other government institutions.\nEspecially since the financial crisis, the Fed has taken an outsized role in the American economy, purchasing over $4 trillion in bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and other assets. Its balance sheet is now larger than the GDP of Germany.\nThis overreach has created an unhealthy, Fed-centric economy that leaves businesses and investors hanging on the arbitrary, unpredictable decisions of a few central bankers. Unwinding the current situation, as everyone knows is necessary, will come with even more new risks.\nThe Fed should never be a substitute for the sound regulatory, fiscal, and tax policies that America desperately needs. Instead of eliminating harmful regulations and enacting pro-growth pro-family tax reform, both of which would stimulate healthy and lasting growth, the Obama Administration has been able to use the Fed's policies as a crutch — one we lean on with more weight now than ever before. Instead of holding the Fed accountable for its mistakes, the Obama Administration gave the Fed even more power with the disastrous Dodd-Frank law.\nIt's time the American people have a chance to hold the Fed accountable.

The Governor has had five great Iowa events today, with one more planned for tomorrow. Then he's off to join Ms. Janet, who's been campaigning hard in South Carolina...BIG THANKS to Congressman Trent Franks for a glowing editorial filled with BIG praise…U.S. Senator Mike Rounds is in Spearfish, S.D. (where it's probably too cold to catch fish) but he took some time to go 'on the record' and share why he's supporting Gov. Huckabee. (A message from our sponsors: Please talk to your doctor about blood pressure medicine before listening to the President's speech tonight.) Some excerpts from the road….\n-------\nCongressman Trent Franks: ''No greater pro-life champion than Huckabee\"\nLeading pro-life social conservative, Rep. Trent Franks, published an editorial in Western Journalism supporting Gov. Mike Huckabee as \"the most inspirational and Reaganesque speaker in the field\" and a warrior who \"first entered politics as a pro-life activist.\" \"Deeply committed pro-life, pro-family conservatives all know that Mike Huckabee is truly one of us,\" said Franks, who is considered one of the biggest social conservative officials in Washington. The Arizona Republican is author of numerous pieces of pro-life legislation, including the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. \"Whether I'm in New York or Iowa, I will never apologize for protecting life and defending marriage,\" said Huckabee.\n\"A conversation with Sen. Mike Rounds continues\"\nSPEARFISH, S.D.— U.S. Senator Mike Rounds stopped by...to weigh in on issues facing the nation...Pioneer: Who would you like to see as the Republican candidate for president? Rounds: \"Mike Huckabee...I think Mike would be a great president. I think he's solid. I think he's got the right temperament for it. He's outside of Washington, yet, at the same time, he's had experience as a governor. People know who he is. He's been in the public eye long enough to know there aren't skeletons there. Me, personally, I know him. And I think he makes the right decisions for the right reasons. So I'm a Mike Huckabee fan.\"\nFort Madison Daily Democrat, \"Huckabee targets caucus goers\"\nKEOKUK, Iowa — It was 8 a.m. and 16 degrees Monday when presidential candidate Gov. Mike Huckabee rolled into the parking lot of The Hawkeye restaurant in Keokuk… \"In three weeks you will be caucusing,\" Huckabee said. \"This is winter in Iowa. It may be snowing. It may be sleeting. But don't let anything stop you from caucusing for me. However, if you plan to caucus for someone else, it is winter in Iowa, after all, so stay home\"…..Huckabee compared being president to being a pilot. \"Somebody has to be in the cockpit who knows how to fly the plane,\" Huckabee said. \"They need to know how to get through the turbulence and land safely. This is not about the glamour and glitz that comes with the election. It's about who has the competence to sit at that desk from day-one and get the job done\"….Huckabee said he felt there are several issues not being discussed enough - like the U.S. tax code. \"I believe if you have the type of economy were people are working everything changes. The mood of the people changes,\" he said. Huckabee said one of the reasons the U.S. has lost 5,000,000 factory jobs since 2000 is that the country has a tax system that punishes people who work. \"When you have a type of system that chases people away, they leave,\" Huckabee said. \"I want to change the tax system so we can bring the jobs back to the United States and become competitive again.\"\nBam!

He called the state \"the human resources manager of America,\" weeding out unqualified applicants before submitting the final candidates to the rest of the country...During the speech he called for increasing the size of the American military. He said the military is too small and too outdated for 21st century needs. \"The B52 is a model that is older than me,\" said Huckabee, to chuckles in the audience...A social conservative, Huckabee said neither the nation's economy nor the military needs to be rebuilt as urgently as national morality. He criticized what he sees as the effort to impose human law over divine law, saying the country is based on a Constitution that reflects the founders' understanding of \"the sinful nature of man\"...Provoking particular ire was the U.S. Supreme Court's rulings allowing same-sex marriage and abortion, the latter of which Huckabee said results in 4,000 abortions per day. He said without a president who understands that he is subordinate to god and a congress with the spine to fight a president who doesn't, the nation is left \"to the tyranny of … unelected lawyers.\"\nThe Hawkeye, \"Mike Huckabee courts Iowans three weeks out from caucus night\"\n\"Three weeks from caucus night, candidates are picking up the pace on the Iowa campaign trail and compiling their endorsements….Former Arkansas Gov.

I learned how to use tools in my own back yard and by working for Habitat.

Ted Cruz. \"But I don't think American needs a good lawyer right now, it needs a good leader. My question to you would be can you name me what efforts (Cruz) has been a leader in ... He's been a senator. He's been a lawyer and a lobbyist … What has Ted Cruz done in his life that prepares him to be president of the United States?\"\nHuckabee's comments came during a 12-minute exchange with Joseph Brown, pastor of Marion Avenue Baptist Church in Washington, Iowa. Brown, who started a coalition of Iowa pastors who support Cruz, began the conversation with a question about why the candidate has said Cruz tailors his comments about same-sex marriage to the audiences he addresses.\n\"He's saying the same things you are saying,\" Brown said.\nHuckabee politely disagreed.\nCruz has said \"he would leave marriage issues up to the states and therefore would not support a federal marriage amendment,\" Huckabee said. \"He knows, like good lawyers do, how to say things that sound almost the same as something else.\"\nDuring a question-and-answer session with New York donors in December, Politico reported Cruz as saying, \"People of New York may well resolve the marriage question differently than the people of Florida or Texas or Ohio. ... That's why we have 50 states — to allow a diversity of views.\" The comments were recorded and provided to Politico.\nHuckabee supports passage of a constitutional amendment that defines marriage as a union between one man and one woman.\nHuckabee rarely criticizes his Republican rivals by name.\nBut in front of about 25 people gathered at The Coffee Corner, Huckabee pressed Brown several times to explain when Cruz has been a leader. Brown cited Mojave Memorial Cross, a case Cruz argued before the U.S. Supreme Court. \"He fought and won that issue,\" Brown said. \"He's stood up for the Second Amendment.\"\nReplied Huckabee: \"Sounds like he'd be a great lawyer ... I'm asking you, what has he done that gives you reason to believe he would be a great executive, which is a very different job than a lawyer.\"\nAnswered Brown, who caucused for Huckabee in 2008: \"That's what I like about you — you've been an executive for 10 years.\"\nAfter the exchange, Huckabee and Brown shook hands and talked privately for about 5 minutes.\nHuckabee said later he didn't know whether Brown had been swayed. But while many Iowa pastors support Cruz, he said, many continue to support him.\n\"Some of the most prominent pastors are still with us and a lot of the rank and file people still are,\" he said.\nThis story ran in the Des Moines Register as well as USA Today.", "timestamp": "2016-01-12", "title": "Press Release - Huckabee On Cruz: Country Needs A Good Leader Not A Lawyer"}

Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans: Tonight marks the eighth year that I've come here to report on the State of the Union. And for this final one, I'm going to try to make it a little shorter. I know some of you are antsy to get back to Iowa. [Laughter] I've been there. I'll be shaking hands afterwards if you want some tips. [Laughter]\nNow, I understand that because it's an election season, expectations for what we will achieve this year are low. But, Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the constructive approach that you and other leaders took at the end of last year to pass a budget and make tax cuts permanent for working families. So I hope we can work together this year on some bipartisan priorities like criminal justice reform and helping people who are battling prescription drug abuse and heroin abuse. So, who knows, we might surprise the cynics again.\nBut tonight I want to go easy on the traditional list of proposals for the year ahead. Don't worry, I've got plenty—[laughter]—from helping students learn to write computer code to personalizing medical treatments for patients. And I will keep pushing for progress on the work that I believe still needs to be done: fixing a broken immigration system, protecting our kids from gun violence, equal pay for equal work, paid leave, raising the minimum wage. All these things still matter to hard-working families. They're still the right thing to do. And I won't let up until they get done.\nBut for my final address to this Chamber, I don't want to just talk about next year. I want to focus on the next 5 years, the next 10 years, and beyond. I want to focus on our future.\nWe live in a time of extraordinary change, change that's reshaping the way we live, the way we work, our planet, our place in the world. It's change that promises amazing medical breakthroughs, but also economic disruptions that strain working families. It promises this education for girls in the most remote villages, but also connects terrorists plotting an ocean away. It's change that can broaden opportunity or widen inequality. And whether we like it or not, the pace of this change will only accelerate.\nAmerica has been through big changes before: wars and depression, the influx of new immigrants, workers fighting for a fair deal, movements to expand civil rights. Each time, there have been those who told us to fear the future; who claimed we could slam the brakes on change; who promised to restore past glory if we just got some group or idea that was threatening America under control. And each time, we overcame those fears. We did not, in the words of Lincoln, adhere to the \"dogmas of the quiet past.\" Instead, we thought anew and acted anew. We made change work for us, always extending America's promise outward, to the next frontier, to more people. And because we did, because we saw opportunity with a—where others saw peril, we emerged stronger and better than before.\nWhat was true then can be true now. Our unique strengths as a nation—our optimism and work ethic, our spirit of discovery, our diversity, our commitment to rule of law—these things give us everything we need to ensure prosperity and security for generations to come.\nIn fact, it's in that spirit that we have made progress these past 7 years. That's how we recovered from the worst economic crisis in generations. That's how we reformed our health care system and reinvented our energy sector. That's how we delivered more care and benefits to our troops coming home and our veterans. That's how we secured the freedom in every State to marry the person we love.\nBut such progress is not inevitable. It's the result of choices we make together. And we face such choices right now. Will we respond to the changes of our time with fear, turning inward as a nation, turning against each other as a people? Or will we face the future with confidence in who we are, in what we stand for, in the incredible things that we can do together?\nSo let's talk about the future and four big questions that I believe we as a country have to answer, regardless of who the next President is or who controls the next Congress. First, how do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in this new economy? Second, how do we make technology work for us and not against us, especially when it comes to solving urgent challenges like climate change? Third, how do we keep America safe and lead the world without becoming its policeman? And finally, how can we make our politics reflect what's best in us and not what's worst?\nLet me start with the economy and a basic fact: The United States of America right now has the strongest, most durable economy in the world. We're in the middle of the longest streak of private sector job creation in history. More than 14 million new jobs, the strongest 2 years of job growth since the 1990s, an unemployment rate cut in half. Our auto industry just had its best year ever. That's just part of a manufacturing surge that's created nearly 900,000 new jobs in the past 6 years. And we've done all this while cutting our deficits by almost three-quarters.\nAnyone claiming that America's economy is in decline is peddling fiction. Now, what is true—and the reason that a lot of Americans feel anxious—is that the economy has been changing in profound ways, changes that started long before the great recession hit, changes that have not let up.\nToday, technology doesn't just replace jobs on the assembly line, but any job where work can be automated. Companies in a global economy can locate anywhere, and they face tougher competition. As a result, workers have less leverage for a raise. Companies have less loyalty to their communities. And more and more wealth and income is concentrated at the very top.\nAll these trends have squeezed workers, even when they have jobs, even when the economy is growing. It's made it harder for a hard-working family to pull itself out of poverty, harder for young people to start their careers, tougher for workers to retire when they want to. And although none of these trends are unique to America, they do offend our uniquely American belief that everybody who works hard should get a fair shot.\nFor the past 7 years, our goal has been a growing economy that also works better for everybody. We've made progress, but we need to make more. And despite all the political arguments that we've had these past few years, there are actually some areas where Americans broadly agree.\nWe agree that real opportunity requires every American to get the education and training they need to land a good-paying job. The bipartisan reform of No Child Left Behind was an important start, and together, we've increased early childhood education, lifted high school graduation rates to new highs, boosted graduates in fields like engineering. In the coming years, we should build on that progress, by providing pre-K for all and offering every student the hands-on computer science and math classes that make them job-ready on day one. We should recruit and support more great teachers for our kids.\nAnd we have to make college affordable for every American. No hard-working student should be stuck in the red. We've already reduced student loan payments by—to 10 percent of a borrower's income. And that's good. But now we've actually got to cut the cost of college. Providing 2 years of community college at no cost for every responsible student is one of the best ways to do that, and I'm going to keep fighting to get that started this year. It's the right thing to do.\nBut a great education isn't all we need in this new economy. We also need benefits and protections that provide a basic measure of security. It's not too much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in America who are going to work the same job, in the same place, with a health and retirement package for 30 years are sitting in this Chamber. [Laughter] For everyone else, especially folks in their forties and fifties, saving for retirement or bouncing back from job loss has gotten a lot tougher. Americans understand that at some point in their careers, in this new economy, they may have to retool, they may have to retrain. But they shouldn't lose what they've already worked so hard to build in the process.\nThat's why Social Security and Medicare are more important than ever. We shouldn't weaken them, we should strengthen them. And for Americans short of retirement, basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything else is today. That, by the way, is what the Affordable Care Act is all about. It's about filling the gaps in employer-based care so that when you lose a job or you go back to school or you strike out and launch that new business, you'll still have coverage. Nearly 18 million people have gained coverage so far. And in the process, health care inflation has slowed. And our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law.\nNow, I'm guessing we won't agree on health care anytime soon, but—[laughter]—a little applause back there. [Laughter] Just a guess. But there should be other ways parties can work together to improve economic security. Say a hard-working American loses his job. We shouldn't just make sure that he can get unemployment insurance, we should make sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business that's ready to hire him. If that new job doesn't pay as much, there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bills. And even if he's going from job to job, he should still be able to save for retirement and take his savings with him. That's the way we make the new economy work better for everybody.\nI also know Speaker Ryan has talked about his interest in tackling poverty. America is about giving everybody willing to work a chance, a hand up. And I'd welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all support, like expanding tax cuts for low-income workers who don't have children.\nBut there are some areas where—we just have to be honest—it has been difficult to find agreement over the last 7 years. And a lot of them fall under the category of what role the Government should play in making sure the system's not rigged in favor of the wealthiest and biggest corporations. And it's an honest disagreement, and the American people have a choice to make.\nI believe a thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy. I think there are outdated regulations that need to be changed. There is redtape that needs to be cut. [Applause] There you go! Yes! See? But after years now of record corporate profits, working families won't get more opportunity or bigger paychecks just by letting big banks or big oil or hedge funds make their own rules at everybody else's expense. Middle class families are not going to feel more secure because we allowed attacks on collective bargaining to go unanswered. Food stamp recipients did not cause the financial crisis; recklessness on Wall Street did. Immigrants aren't the principal reason wages haven't gone up; those decisions are made in the boardrooms that all too often put quarterly earnings over long-term returns. It's sure not the average family watching tonight that avoids paying taxes through offshore accounts. [Laughter]\nThe point is, I believe that in this new economy, workers and startups and small businesses need more of a voice, not less. The rules should work for them. And I'm not alone in this. This year, I plan to lift up the many businesses who have figured out that doing right by their workers or their customers or their communities ends up being good for their shareholders. And I want to spread those best practices across America. That's part of a brighter future.\nIn fact, it turns, out many of our best corporate citizens are also our most creative. And this brings me to the second big question we as a country have to answer: How do we reignite that spirit of innovation to meet our biggest challenges?\nSixty years ago, when the Russians beat us into space, we didn't deny Sputnik was up there. [Laughter] We didn't argue about the science or shrink our research and development budget. We built a space program almost overnight. And 12 years later, we were walking on the Moon.\nNow, that spirit of discovery is in our DNA. America is Thomas Edison and the Wright Brothers and George Washington Carver. America is Grace Hopper and Katherine Johnson and Sally Ride. America is every immigrant and entrepreneur from Boston to Austin to Silicon Valley, racing to shape a better future. That's who we are.\nAnd over the past 7 years, we've nurtured that spirit. We've protected an open Internet and taken bold new steps to get more students and low-income Americans online. We've launched next-generation manufacturing hubs and online tools that give an entrepreneur everything he or she needs to start a business in a single day. But we can do so much more.\nLast year, Vice President Biden said that with a new moonshot, America can cure cancer. Last month, he worked with this Congress to give scientists at the National Institutes of Health the strongest resources that they've had in over a decade. Well—so tonight I'm announcing a new national effort to get it done. And because he's gone to the mat for all of us on so many issues over the past 40 years, I'm putting Joe in charge of mission control. For the loved ones we've all lost, for the families that we can still save, let's make America the country that cures cancer once and for all. What do you say, Joe? Let's make it happen.\nNow, medical research is critical. We need the same level of commitment when it comes to developing clean energy sources. Look, if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change, have at it. [Laughter] You will be pretty lonely, because you'll be debating our military, most of America's business leaders, the majority of the American people, almost the entire scientific community, and 200 nations around the world who agree it's a problem and intend to solve it. But even if the planet wasn't at stake, even if 2014 wasn't the warmest year on record—until 2015 turned out to be even hotter—why would we want to pass up the chance for American businesses to produce and sell the energy of the future? Listen, 7 years ago, we made the single biggest investment in clean energy in our history. Here are the results. In fields from Iowa to Texas, wind power is now cheaper than dirtier, conventional power. On rooftops from Arizona to New York, solar is saving Americans tens of millions of dollars a year on their energy bills and employs more Americans than coal in jobs that pay better than average. We're taking steps to give homeowners the freedom to generate and store their own energy, something, by the way, that environmentalists and Tea Partiers have teamed up to support. And meanwhile, we've cut our imports of foreign oil by nearly 60 percent and cut carbon pollution more than any other country on Earth. Gas under 2 bucks a gallon ain't bad either. [Laughter]\nNow we've got to accelerate the transition away from old, dirtier energy sources. Rather than subsidize the past, we should invest in the future, especially in communities that rely on fossil fuels. We do them no favor when we don't show them where the trends are going. And that's why I'm going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet. And that way, we put money back into those communities and put tens of thousands of Americans to work building a 21st-century transportation system.\nNow, none of this is going to happen overnight. And yes, there are plenty of entrenched interests who want to protect the status quo. But the jobs we'll create, the money we'll save, the planet we'll preserve—that is the kind of future our kids and our grandkids deserve. And it's within our grasp.\nNow, climate change is just one of many issues where our security is linked to the rest of the world. And that's why the third big question that we have to answer together is how to keep America safe and strong without either isolating ourselves or trying to nation-build everywhere there's a problem.\nNow, I told you earlier all the talk of America's economic decline is political hot air. Well, so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker. Let me tell you something: The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth. Period. [Applause] Period. It's not even close. [Applause] It's not even close. It's not even close. We spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined. Our troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the world. [Applause] All right. No nation attacks us directly, or our allies, because they know that's the path to ruin. Surveys show our standing around the world is higher than when I was elected to this office, and when it comes to every important international issue, people of the world do not look to Beijing or Moscow to lead. They call us. So I think it's useful to level set here, because when we don't, we don't make good decisions.\nNow, as someone who begins every day with an intelligence briefing, I know this is a dangerous time. But that's not primarily because of some looming superpower out there, and it's certainly not because of diminished American strength. In today's world, we're threatened less by evil empires and more by failing states.\nThe Middle East is going through a transformation that will play out for a generation, rooted in conflicts that date back millennia. Economic headwinds are blowing in from a Chinese economy that is in significant transition. Even as their economy severely contracts, Russia is pouring resources in to prop up Ukraine and Syria, client states that they saw slipping away from their orbit. And the international system we built after World War II is now struggling to keep pace with this new reality. It's up to us, the United States of America, to help remake that system. And to do that well, it means that we've got to set priorities. Priority number one is protecting the American people and going after terrorist networks. Both Al Qaida and now ISIL pose a direct threat to our people, because in today's world, even a handful of terrorists who place no value on human life, including their own, can do a lot of damage. They use the Internet to poison the minds of individuals inside our country. Their actions undermine and destabilize our allies. We have to take them out.\nBut as we focus on destroying ISIL, over-the-top claims that this is world war III just play into their hands. Masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks, twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages, they pose an enormous danger to civilians; they have to be stopped. But they do not threaten our national existence. That is the story ISIL wants to tell. That's the kind of propaganda they use to recruit. We don't need to build them up to show that we're serious, and we sure don't need to push away vital allies in this fight by echoing the lie that ISIL is somehow representative of one of the world's largest religions. We just need to call them what they are: killers and fanatics who have to be rooted out, hunted down, and destroyed.\nAnd that's exactly what we're doing. For more than a year, America has led a coalition of more than 60 countries to cut off ISIL's financing, disrupt their plots, stop the flow of terrorist fighters, and stamp out their vicious ideology. With nearly 10,000 airstrikes, we're taking out their leadership, their oil, their training camps, their weapons. We're training, arming, and supporting forces who are steadily reclaiming territory in Iraq and Syria.\nIf this Congress is serious about winning this war and wants to send a message to our troops and the world, authorize the use of military force against ISIL. Take a vote. [Applause] Take a vote. But the American people should know that with or without congressional action, ISIL will learn the same lessons as terrorists before them. If you doubt America's commitment—or mine—to see that justice is done, just ask Usama bin Laden. Ask the leader of Al Qaida in Yemen, who was taken out last year, or the perpetrator of the Benghazi attacks, who sits in a prison cell. When you come after Americans, we go after you. And it may take time, but we have long memories, and our reach has no limits.\nOur foreign policy has to be focused on the threat from ISIL and Al Qaida, but it can't stop there. For even without ISIL, even without Al Qaida, instability will continue for decades in many parts of the world: in the Middle East, in Afghanistan and parts of Pakistan, in parts of Central America, in Africa and Asia. Some of these places may become safe havens for new terrorist networks. Others will just fall victim to ethnic conflict or famine, feeding the next wave of refugees. The world will look to us to help solve these problems, and our answer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet-bomb civilians. That may work as a TV sound bite, but it doesn't pass muster on the world stage.\nWe also can't try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis, even if it's done with the best of intentions. That's not leadership; that's a recipe for quagmire, spilling American blood and treasure that ultimately will weaken us. It's the lesson of Vietnam; it's the lesson of Iraq. And we should have learned it by now.\nNow, fortunately there is a smarter approach: a patient and disciplined strategy that uses every element of our national power. It says America will always act, alone if necessary, to protect our people and our allies, but on issues of global concern, we will mobilize the world to work with us and make sure other countries pull their own weight. That's our approach to conflicts like Syria, where we're partnering with local forces and leading international efforts to help that broken society pursue a lasting peace. That's why we built a global coalition, with sanctions and principled diplomacy, to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. And as we speak, Iran has rolled back its nuclear program, shipped out its uranium stockpile, and the world has avoided another war.\nThat's how we stopped the spread of Ebola in West Africa. Our military, our doctors, our development workers—they were heroic; they set up the platform that then allowed other countries to join in behind us and stamp out that epidemic. Hundreds of thousands, maybe a couple million, lives were saved.\nThat's how we forged a Trans-Pacific Partnership to open markets and protect workers and the environment and advance American leadership in Asia. It cuts 18,000 taxes on products made in America, which will then support more good jobs here in America. With TPP, China does not set the rules in that region, we do. You want to show our strength in this new century? Approve this agreement. Give us the tools to enforce it. It's the right thing to do.\nLet me give you another example. Fifty years of isolating Cuba had failed to promote democracy. It set us back in Latin America. That's why we restored diplomatic relations, opened the door to travel and commerce, positioned ourselves to improve the lives of the Cuban people. So if you want to consolidate our leadership and credibility in the hemisphere, recognize that the cold war is over. Lift the embargo.\nThe point is, American leadership in the 21st century is not a choice between ignoring the rest of the world—except when we kill terrorists—or occupying and rebuilding whatever society is unraveling. Leadership means a wise application of military power and rallying the world behind causes that are right. It means seeing our foreign assistance as a part of our national security, not something separate, not charity.\nWhen we lead nearly 200 nations to the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change, yes, that helps vulnerable countries, but it also protects our kids. When we help Ukraine defend its democracy or Colombia resolve a decades-long war, that strengthens the international order we depend on. When we help African countries feed their people and care for the sick, it's the right thing to do, and it prevents the next pandemic from reaching our shores. Right now we're on track to end the scourge of HIV/AIDS. That's within our grasp. And we have the chance to accomplish the same thing with malaria, something I'll be pushing this Congress to fund this year.\nThat's American strength. That's American leadership. And that kind of leadership depends on the power of our example. That's why I will keep working to shut down the prison at Guantanamo. It is expensive, it is unnecessary, and it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemies. There's a better way.\nAnd that's why we need to reject any politics—any politics—that targets people because of race or religion. Let me just say this. This is not a matter of political correctness, this is a matter of understanding just what it is that makes us strong. The world respects us not just for our arsenal, it respects us for our diversity and our openness and the way we respect every faith.\nHis Holiness Pope Francis told this body from the very spot that I'm standing on tonight that \"to imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place.\" When politicians insult Muslims, whether abroad or our fellow citizens, when a mosque is vandalized or a kid is called names, that doesn't make us safer. That's not telling it what—telling it like it is. It's just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals. It betrays who we are as a country. \"We the People.\" Our Constitution begins with those three simple words, words we've come to recognize mean all the people, not just some; words that insist we rise and fall together, that that's how we might perfect our Union. And that brings me to the fourth and maybe most important thing that I want to say tonight.\nThe future we want—all of us want—opportunity and security for our families, a rising standard of living, a sustainable, peaceful planet for our kids—all that is within our reach. But it will only happen if we work together. It will only happen if we can have rational, constructive debates. It will only happen if we fix our politics.\nA better politics doesn't mean we have to agree on everything. This is a big country: different regions, different attitudes, different interests. That's one of our strengths too. Our Founders distributed power between States and branches of government and expected us to argue, just as they did, fiercely, over the size and shape of government, over commerce and foreign relations, over the meaning of liberty and the imperatives of security.\nBut democracy does require basic bonds of trust between its citizens. It doesn't work if we think the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice. It doesn't work if we think that our political opponents are unpatriotic or trying to weaken America. Democracy grinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise or when even basic facts are contested or when we listen only to those who agree with us. Our public life withers when only the most extreme voices get all the attention. And most of all, democracy breaks down when the average person feels their voice doesn't matter, that the system is rigged in favor of the rich or the powerful or some special interest.\nToo many Americans feel that way right now. It's one of the few regrets of my Presidency: that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better. I have no doubt, a President with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide, and I guarantee, I'll keep trying to be better so long as I hold this office.\nBut, my fellow Americans, this cannot be my task—or any President's—alone. There are a whole lot of folks in this Chamber, good people, who would like to see more cooperation, would like to see a more elevated debate in Washington, but feel trapped by the imperatives of getting elected, by the noise coming out of your base. I know; you've told me. It's the worst kept secret in Washington. And a lot of you aren't enjoying being trapped in that kind of rancor.\nBut that means if we want a better politics—and I'm addressing the American people now—if we want a better politics, it's not enough just to change a Congressman or change a Senator or even change a President. We have to change the system to reflect our better selves.\nI think we've got to end the practice of drawing our congressional districts so that politicians can pick their voters and not the other way around. Let a bipartisan group do it.\nI believe we've got to reduce the influence of money in our politics so that a handful of families or hidden interests can't bankroll our elections. And if our existing approach to campaign finance reform can't pass muster in the courts, we need to work together to find a real solution. Because it's a problem. And most of you don't like raising money. [Laughter] I know. I've done it.\nWe've got to make it easier to vote, not harder. We need to modernize it for the way we live now. This is America: We want to make it easier for people to participate. And over the course of this year, I intend to travel the country to push for reforms that do just that. But I can't do these things on my own. Changes in our political process—in not just who gets elected, but how they get elected—that will only happen when the American people demand it. It depends on you. That's what's meant by a government of, by, and for the people.\nWhat I'm suggesting is hard. It's a lot easier to be cynical; to accept that change is not possible and politics is hopeless and the problem is, all the folks who are elected don't care; and to believe that our voices and our actions don't matter. But if we give up now, then we forsake a better future. Those with money and power will gain greater control over the decisions that could send a young soldier to war or allow another economic disaster or roll back the equal rights and voting rights that generations of Americans have fought, even died, to secure. And then, as frustration grows, there will be voices urging us to fall back into our respective tribes, to scapegoat fellow citizens who don't look like us or pray like us or vote like we do or share the same background.\nWe can't afford to go down that path. It won't deliver the economy we want. It will not produce the security we want. But most of all, it contradicts everything that makes us the envy of the world.\nSo, my fellow Americans, whatever you may believe, whether you prefer one party or no party, whether you supported my agenda or fought as hard as you could against it, our collective futures depends on your willingness to uphold your duties as a citizen. To vote. To speak out. To stand up for others, especially the weak, especially the vulnerable, knowing that each of us is only here because somebody, somewhere, stood up for us. We need every American to stay active in our public life—and not just during election time—so that our public life reflects the goodness and the decency that I see in the American people every single day.\nIt is not easy. Our brand of democracy is hard. But I can promise that a little over a year from now, when I no longer hold this office, I will be right there with you as a citizen, inspired by those voices of fairness and vision, of grit and good humor and kindness, that have helped America travel so far. Voices that help us see ourselves not, first and foremost, as Black or White or Asian or Latino, not as gay or straight, immigrant or native born, not Democrat or Republican, but as Americans first, bound by a common creed. Voices Dr. King believed would have the final word: voices of \"unarmed truth and unconditional love.\"\nAnd they're out there, those voices. They don't get a lot of attention; they don't seek a lot of fanfare; but they're busy doing the work this country needs doing. I see them everywhere I travel in this incredible country of ours. I see you, the American people. And in your daily acts of citizenship, I see our future unfolding.\nI see it in the worker on the assembly line who clocked extra shifts to keep his company open and the boss who pays him higher wages instead of laying him off. I see it in the dreamer who stays up late at night to finish her science project and the teacher who comes in early, maybe with some extra supplies that she bought because she knows that that young girl might someday cure a disease.\nI see it in the American who served his time, made bad mistakes as a child, but now is dreaming of starting over. And I see it in the business owner who gives him that second chance. The protester determined to prove that justice matters and the young cop walking the beat, treating everybody with respect, doing the brave, quiet work of keeping us safe.\nI see it in the soldier who gives almost everything to save his brothers, the nurse who tends to him till he can run a marathon, the community that lines up to cheer him on. It's the son who finds the courage to come out as who he is and the father whose love for that son overrides everything he's been taught.\nI see it in the elderly woman who will wait in line to cast her vote as long as she has to, the new citizen who casts his vote for the first time, the volunteers at the polls who believe every vote should count. Because each of them, in different ways, know how much that precious right is worth.\nThat's the America I know. That's the country we love: clear eyed, big hearted, undaunted by challenge. Optimistic that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word. That's what makes me so hopeful about our future. I believe in change because I believe in you, the American people. And that's why I stand here as confident as I have ever been that the state of our Union is strong.\nThank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2016-01-12", "title": "Address Before a Joint Session of the Congress on the State of the Union"}
{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111432", "text": "CAMEROTA: Secretary Clinton, thanks so much for sitting down with us here in Iowa.\nCLINTON: Thank you, Alisyn.\nCAMEROTA: We are in Ames, Iowa --\nCLINTON: Yes.\nCAMEROTA:—where the temperature as we speak is one degree.\nCLINTON: Uh-hm.\nCAMEROTA: And I know that you have been going to countless campaign events here and I'm wondering when you get up in the morning in Iowa if there are ever times you question your life choices?\nCLINTON: Absolutely, no. You know, I grew up in Chicago. I'm used to cold weather. It doesn't bother me. In fact, I'm somewhat reassured that there is a real winter, that we are actually seeing snow and lower temperatures. But I get up every day whether I'm in Iowa, in New Hampshire, wherever I am in the country and I really look forward to the day because I find the opportunity to go out and listen to people, hear their stories, give them my views about what I think the next president should do very energizing and very, you know, reinvigorating all the time.\nCAMEROTA: So, let's talk about the tightening race between you and Bernie Sanders. Bernie Sanders is speaking to reporters on Monday night here in Iowa. And he said that your campaign is in, quote, \"serious trouble.\" Is that how you feel?\nCLINTON: Not at all. In fact, I have always known that if you are going to run to be president, particularly in the Democratic Party, it's a long, hard, challenging road. And so I've been in these elections before. They always tighten up as people begin to make up their minds, as they look at the candidates, totally predictable. I feel really, really good about the campaign organization that I have. A caucus is different from a primary. It takes a lot of intensive work to convince people to come out on a cold Monday night, spend a couple of hours in order to stand up for your candidate, but I'm asking Iowans if they'll stand up for me on caucus night. I will be standing up for them all through my presidency.\nCAMEROTA: There is a new Quinnipiac poll out just about one hour ago in which Bernie Sanders is now beating you in Iowa. It is 49 percent to 44 percent. It is the first time that this has happened that he's been beating you in Iowa since September. We are 20 days out. Does he have more momentum than you?\nCLINTON: Well, the funny thing Alisyn is, after that poll came out about an hour later there was a PPP poll where I was leading him by the same margin about six points up. I don't pay any attention to this. I don't feel that it's a good reflection about who will actually come out on caucus night. I can only tell you that the energy, the enthusiasm, the excitement of my volunteers, my organizers, the voters who come, who sign up on commit to caucus cards is just building. That's my experience. So I'll let people poll and try to figure out who is going to show up. I'm looking at people who are showing up, making up their minds and trying to, you know, convince them to come out and caucus for me.\nCAMEROTA: Why don't you feel that the polls are good reflection of what's going to happen in the caucus?\nCLINTON: Because they are so unpredictable. And it's gotten increasingly difficult to poll. And I think you would have to add a degree of difficulty to polling for a caucus. So, that's been my experience. I've watched this a long time. I've had a prior election where I campaigned in Iowa. So, I just put that aside. I'll let pundits and others worry about who's up and who's down. I just get up every day like we were saying, going out there, making my case, drawing the contrast because I have the highest regard for my two opponents, but there are real differences. And we need a spirited debate. Because after the first of the year, a lot more people start paying attention. And now I know it's, you know, the make or break time, people make up their minds.\nCAMEROTA: Bernie Sanders is also winning in New Hampshire. Not surprising. He is from a neighboring state. Have you considered what would happen if he wins in Iowa and New Hampshire what your plan is?\nCLINTON: I don't think about that. I'm going to do everything I can to win as bigger margin as possible in the caucus and then go to the primary. But this is a national campaign. We've been organizing in South Carolina, in Nevada, a lot of the March 1st states, the March 15th states. Remember, I campaigned all the way into June last time. And I have always thought that given the unpredictability and the, you know, changes in people's concerns going into this election, that we wouldn't know exactly how the outcome would be for, you know, a couple of cycles of these primaries and caucuses. So, I'm going to do my best to convince more Iowans to come out and caucus for me. And even though as you say, Senator Sanders as a neighbor and a neighbor never lost in New Hampshire, I'm going to take that challenge on and do the best I can to get people in New Hampshire to support me, as well.\nCAMEROTA: Vice President Joe Biden offered his thoughts to CNN on why he thinks Bernie Sanders is resonating. He said that he thinks it's about Senator Sanders' positions on income inequality. And the Vice President said, quote, \"It's relatively new for Hillary to talk about that. That's been Bernie's. No one questions Bernie's authenticity on those issues.\" What's your reaction?\nCLINTON: Well, the Vice President who I deeply respect and regard as a friend, went on to say as I recall. But, you know, Hillary Clinton has a lot of very good economic policies that are thoughtful and on and on. Look, I have been working toward closing the gaps between people, poor people and well-off people primarily all my adult life. I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund. I helped to reform the education system in Arkansas. I was a legal services lawyer defending poor people. I went to work to try to make sure that we got health care in the beginning of my husband's administration because of so many people who were left out and were uninsured.\nI have been on this issue in many different ways. How do we make education more equal? How do we make health care more equal? Of course that's tied to income equality, but there is also a broader range of issues that I have a long record of addressing. And when I was in the Senate I took on corporate executive pay. A lot of the abuses that I thought were there. I took on these derivatives and credit default swaps that contributed to the collapse of the economy and the great recession. I stood up to Wall Street. I called them out. So I have a very long record. I have a broader agenda. It's not the only thing I talk about because I think you have to view equality of opportunity and how we deliver that in the 21st Century for many different perspectives and that's what I tried to do.\nCAMEROTA: And since you have been devoting much of your career to talking about this, why do you think the Vice President would say, it's more in Bernie's wheelhouse and it's about his authenticity?\nCLINTON: Oh, I don't know. But you know, I have a lot of regard for the vice president. And I think today he clarified what he said and said he was talking about me when I was Secretary of State. Well, when I was Secretary of State, I couldn't talk about domestic policy. There is an unwritten rule, you do not meddle in domestic policy when you are secretary of state or for that matter, secretary of defense. So yes, for four years, despite a long career both in and out of public service where I have been relentless in talking about these issues, there were four years when I did not. I talked about how we were going to get Iran to the negotiating table and try to prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon, how we're going to, you know, deal with a rising China, what we're going to do about women's rights, something that goes to the heart of inequality. So, I had a different agenda because I had a different job.\nCAMEROTA: So, you didn't take Biden's comments as a slight?\nCLINTON: No. Not at all.\nCAMEROTA: OK. You are introducing your tax plan. One of the headlines is that you would impose a four percent surcharge on incomes over $5 million. And I believe that that would raise about $150 billion over ten years. Does that go far enough in addressing income inequality?\nCLINTON: Well, we've got a variety of proposals. Not only the four percent surcharge which I call the fair share surcharge. The so-called Buffet Rule which would have a minimum tax rate for people making more than $1 million, limiting deductions to 28 percent with a charitable exception. Going after a lot of the subsidies that, for example, still subsidize the oil and gas industry about $6 billion a year while we have to move toward a clean renewable energy future. So I have put forth plans, paid family leave, tuition, debt-free tuition for public colleges.\nCapping prescription drug costs and much more. And it would cost about $100 billion a year, all of which I pay for. In contrast, Senator Sanders has some very big ideas, but he hasn't yet told anybody how he would pay for them. And he had promised that he would roll out his tax plans before the Iowa caucus on February 1st. Well, if you wait too long, nobody will have a chance to see them or analyze them. And so I am very clear about what I would do and how I would pay for it.\nCAMEROTA: Another point of conflict between you and Senator Sanders is on gun policy.\nCLINTON: Uh-hm.\nCAMEROTA: We just watched this very emotional event this morning.\nCLINTON: Yes.\nCAMEROTA: That you were involved in where this mom who lost two children --\nCLINTON: Right --\nCAMEROTA:—to gun violence got up and spoke. And it was really heartbreaking to hear her. It sounds like she lost her children to criminals.\nCLINTON: Yes.\nCAMEROTA: So, how would you stop that?\nCLINTON: This is a very big difference in this campaign. Because as you saw, I received the Brady campaign endorsement today and both the woman Delfin Cherry who introduced us to the stage and the head of the Brady campaign had lost family members. It was really hard standing up there because I have held the hands of and listened to countless people who have lost family members to gun violence. And I agree completely with the President about us having to take action now. We lose on an average 90 people a day. It has to stop, Alisyn. I've been in this campaign advocating for comprehensive background checks, closing the gun show loophole, closing the online loophole, closing what's called the Charleston loophole.\nYou know, there was a loophole, my opponent voted for it, Senator Sanders, that at the end of three days, business days, you get that gun whether they have finished the background check or not. The killer in Charleston who bought that gun, if there had just been a little more time, it would have been discovered he should not have been able to buy the gun because he had a federal record. We have saved a lot of lives. I can't put an exact number on it. But because of the Brady bill which Senator Sanders voted against five times, more than two million people, the Brady campaign says, 2.4 million purchasers have been stopped from buying guns.\nSo, we are talking about violent criminals. We are talking about domestic abusers. We are talking about the dangerously mentally ill. We are even talking about terrorists because the Republicans won't close the loophole so that people on the no fly zone can buy guns. I feel passionately about this. And the cumulation from Sandy Hook to the community college in Oregon, the fact that we have so many mass killings in the last few years, I think it certainly motivated the President, and I am so proud to support him and I want to make this a voting issue in this campaign.\n[break]\nCAMEROTA: I want to talk about an issue Donald Trump wanted to make an issue in this campaign, that is—are allegations from your husband's past. He is going further actually than that. He is making it about you. He is saying that you are an enabler of bad behavior and of sexual assault.\nWhat's your response to Donald Trump?\nCLINTON: I have no response. I'm going to let him say whatever he wants to say. He can run his campaign however he wishes. I'm going to keep talking about what the next president will have to do starting January 20th, 2017.\nI have deep disagreements with what he's proposing. His tax plans would cut trillions of dollars of taxes from the wealthy and corporations. He doesn't believe in equal pay. He thinks that American workers are already making too much.\nSo, I'm going to draw the contrast with him that I think the American people are interested in seeing.\nCAMEROTA: But when someone accuses you of being an enabler of sexual assault, don't you need to respond to it? I mean, particularly since this is an issue you wanted to talk about on the campaign trail. Can't this sexual assault—you say survivors need to be believed and they need to be heard.\nSo, when he's accusing you of doing something that is the antithesis of what you want to talk about, don't you need to address it?\nCLINTON: I'm going to let the American voters decide what's relevant and what's not relevant in their decision as to who they're going to support.\nCAMEROTA: I have a few more questions. Donald Trump was on \"The Tonight Show\" and asked about the possibility of you two running against each other, if that's how this all plays out in November. He said that would be, quote, \"an amazing thing.\" [laughter]\nCLINTON: Yes, it would be amazing. I would look forward to it.\nLook, I think this is serious business. Campaigns always have some great stories and great characters. That's part of the political process. This is really serious business, who the next president is. We are either going to build on the progress that we've made or we're going to see it ripped away. We are either going to defend human rights and civil rights and women's rights and gay rights and voting rights and workers' rights and all the rest that is at stake, or we are going to turn the clock back.\nAnd that's why I have tried to very clearly explain where I stand on all of these issues because the stakes are so high. And if I'm fortunate enough to get the nomination, I will run hard against whomever the Republicans' nominee, because they represent a brand of politics and policies that I think would hurt our country. I don't want to see that happen.\nCAMEROTA: Let's say you get the nomination. Let's say you win the presidency.\nCLINTON: Yes, let's say that.\nCAMEROTA: Let's say it.\nAnd on day one, you walk into the Oval Office, what's the first phone call you make?\nCLINTON: Well, I think the very first phone call would be to whoever I've asked to be the chief of staff of the White House. Let's get a meeting together, let's get our agenda together. There's a lot we have to get going. The earlier we start, the better we'll be off and we'll get more accomplished.\nBecause I want to really think hard if I do get the nomination, right then and there, how we organize the White House, how we organize the cabinet. What's the legislative agenda?\nYou know, the time between an election and inauguration is short. You can't wait. I mean, you can't take anything for granted. You have to keep working as hard as you possibly can, but I think it's important to start planning because we know what happens if you get behind in getting your agenda out and getting your appointments made. You lose time. And you're not doing the work that the American people elected you to do.\nCAMEROTA: Before I let you go, I definitely want to ask you about your granddaughter. You talk about her on the campaign trail. Today is I believe or recently, Chelsea is making her first appearance on the campaign trail.\nCLINTON: Yes.\nCAMEROTA: She said she believes that you becoming a grandmother is a driving force behind your campaign. How so?\nCLINTON: Well, she's right, because I feel very fortunate. I like to point out I'm the granddaughter of a factory worker who came to this country as a young immigrant. Went to work in the lace mills in Scranton, Pennsylvania.\nSo, here I am three generations later asking people to vote for me to become their president. And we have this amazing 15-month-old grandchild with another on the way next summer. And so, I think a lot about the future, but I think not just about her future because we're going to do everything we can to make sure she has the best opportunities life can offer, but I think about what kind of country she'll become an adult in and what kind of world is going to be waiting for her.\nI want to make sure—it's not just our grandchild, but every child who has the opportunity to go as far to fulfill their God-given potential as possible. And a lot of that depends on the kinds of decisions that our presidents make. It's not, you know, you have to have family support, you have to have community support.\nI wrote a book called \"It Takes A Village.\" I understand that. Do you kids have health care? That's why I created the children's health care insurance program, because too many didn't. Your kids have good education, that's why I'm for early childhood, because too many kids come to school unprepared. How about college affordability? Too many kids are weeded out because they can't afford to start or stay.\nI go through the list of what is really dampening the opportunities that young people in our country have right now. And I want to be the president who unleashes that potential again.\nCAMEROTA: And when you think about your grandchildren's future, are you worried or hopeful?\nCLINTON: I'm always hopeful, Alisyn. I'm always hopeful. I think this is the greatest country.\nWhen I listen to the negative comments made about our country on the campaign stage predominantly by the Republicans, I mean, look at what we've come back from. It was a Republican administration under which we had the Great Recession. That is just a fact.\nPresident Obama inherited an economy that was losing 800,000 jobs a month. I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for digging us out and getting us standing again. So, I know that choices really matter in politics, but I am absolutely committed to the belief, the conviction that I have that our country is resilient, we're strong, we're smart.\nGiven the right leadership, we can do anything. That's why I actually am quite optimistic and confident about the future.\nCAMEROTA: Secretary Clinton, thank you so much.\nCLINTON: Thank you, Alisyn.\nCAMEROTA: Great to talk to you.\nCLINTON: It's great to see you.", "timestamp": "2016-01-13", "title": "Interview with Alisyn Camerota of CNN"}

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111546", "text": "Aboard Air Force One\nEn Route Omaha, Nebraska\n1:39 P.M. EST\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome aboard Air Force One as we make our way to lovely Omaha, Nebraska. The President is looking forward to the visit to highlight a couple of things.\nObviously, you had the opportunity to hear his State of the Union speech last night where the President indicated a desire to spend more time over the course of his last year in office talking directly to the American people, looking for more informal settings where he can talk to the public both about his agenda -- he has a vision for where we should take the country -- but also to hear more from people firsthand about some of the challenges facing the country, but also some of the opportunities that they see for themselves, their families, for their communities to capitalize on the future.\nSo when we arrive in Omaha, the President will be spending some time with a woman from the Omaha area who wrote the President a letter last year, and he'll do that before he addresses a larger group of Nebraskans at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. So the President is really looking forward to this stop.\nOver the course of his remarks, which you'll obviously see, one of the things the President is going to talk about is how strongly Nebraska has bounced back from the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. The unemployment rate in the state of Nebraska is below 3 percent, and it's clear the people in Nebraska are doing something right when it comes to their economy. So you certainly can expect to hear the President talk a little bit about that.\nTwo other things I want to mention before I get to your questions -- obviously you saw that the President had the opportunity to visit briefly with King Abdullah of Jordan prior to boarding the aircraft. The President only spent a couple of minutes with him, but it was an opportunity for the President to greet him. Yesterday, the Vice President sat down and had breakfast with King Abdullah of Jordan. I also note that the King, over the course of his visit, also had the opportunity to meet with other senior members of the President's national security team, as well.\nObviously, Jordan is an important partner when it comes to our collective efforts to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. Jordan also is assuming a significant burden in terms of caring for the basic humanitarian needs of hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees who are fleeing violence in that country. The United States has offered significant support to Jordan as they have borne that burden, and this is an indication of the important and enduring relationship between our two countries.\nPrior to leaving the White House today, the President also had the opportunity to speak on the telephone with President Putin of Russia. We'll get you a more formal readout of that conversation -- that will be distributed by my colleagues at the White House -- but as usual, they spent a significant portion of their time discussing the need for the Russians to live up to the commitments that they made in Minsk to end their support for the separatists that are destabilizing Ukraine right now.\nThere was some discussion of other issues, including the ongoing efforts to try to reach a -- bring about a political transition inside of Syria. Both the United States and Russia have a vested interest in seeing that occur. And we previously complimented Russia for the constructive role that they played in this rather painstaking process. And the two leaders had the opportunity to discuss that.\nBut as I mentioned, there will be a more -- slightly more detailed readout that will come from my colleagues back at the White House on paper later today.\nSo, with that, I can go to your questions.\nQ: Can you give us a little bit more of a tick-tock about what happened with the sailors? And has the President spoken with his -- with any of them, or with his senior advisors about this today? Can you give us a little insight into that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I can tell you the President has been updated on a regular basis by members of his national security team about that situation. And we're obviously pleased that the Iranians followed through on their commitment to promptly allow our sailors to continue their journey.\nWe're appreciative of the key role that Secretary Kerry played in securing this outcome. I do think it underscores the value of the diplomatic line of communication that's been opened between Secretary Kerry and his counterpart. It certainly has not resolved the long list of concerns that we have with Iran's behavior. That list includes threatening Israel, developing ballistic missiles in violation of a variety of United Nations Security Council resolutions, and supporting terrorism. But today's outcome is a good reminder that this kind of diplomatic engagement -- that has been the target of some criticism -- actually does advance the interests of the United States and enhances our national security.\nQ: Is the President satisfied with how Iran handled it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess -- let me answer the other part of your question, which is that there is more work being done to understand exactly how the situation came about. And that work is underway. So there's not a whole lot more that I can share with you in terms of the details of this situation. But we're obviously gathering more information -- the Department of Defense is gathering more information, so we can get a better picture of what exactly led to these individuals ending up -- these sailors ending up in Iranian custody. And we're certainly going to want to understand more about how they were treated and what transpired while they were in the hands of the Iranians. So there's not that much that I can say about that now, principally because we're still understanding exactly what transpired.\nQ: Do you know if the President saw the photos or video of them being arrested or detained, or whatever term you want to use? And did he have a reaction to them?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know if he's seen the photos, to be honest with you.\nQ: In an interview, the Vice President said this morning that the U.S. did not apologize in order to get their release, but do you know if the idea of having the U.S. apologize was ever discussed, or was that ever something that Iran wanted?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware that the prospect of the United States issuing a formal apology was ever discussed. It certainly did not occur.\nQ: -- think the sailors should have been detained in the first place?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what we have been focused on primarily is the safety of our soldiers -- of our sailors. We obviously were pleased that they were released promptly and allowed to continue their journey. We've received assurances from the Iranians that that is what would happen, and it did.\nAs it relates to the details of the circumstances that led to them being taken into custody by the Iranians and what exactly transpired while they were in custody, we're still trying to learn more about how exactly that all happened. And so that's why I'm reluctant to say much more about it at this point.\nQ: Can you tell us whether President Obama saw Governor Haley's response to his State of the Union address or is aware of what she said, and what he thinks about it? I mean, not the part where she criticized him, but the part we all care about -- the rest of it. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: The President did not get a chance to watch it live. We were still traveling back from the Capitol while she was delivering the response. The President has read news accounts of it, so he certainly is aware of her response.\nLook, I think at the White House we took note of it for the same reasons that you did. She was willing to do something that a lot of other Republicans -- leading Republicans have been unwilling to do, which is to actually articulate a commitment to some core American values that some leading Republican presidential candidates are speaking out against, or at least speaking in a way that contradicts those values. And her willingness to stand up and speak out against that took some courage, and it was rather conspicuous, given the willingness of a lot of other leading Republicans to either ignore it or to try to sweep it under the rug. In some cases, we've seen leading Republicans be totally coopted by it.\nLook, that doesn't mean that we agree with Governor Haley on everything; we surely don't. But her willingness to stand up for some important principles was noted, and it took courage. And for that, she deserves credit.\nQ: Back to the Omaha portion of this. You mentioned Nebraska's economic situation being much better than in many parts of the country. To what extent can you tie that to the administration's policies? And then, also, does he have any plans to do anything with Warren Buffett while he's in town?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm certainly no expert on Nebraska's economy. I think there are a number of things that have contributed to the kind of durable economy in Nebraska that we've seen. A couple of things come to mind. The first is, we're producing more oil and natural gas in the United States than we ever have before. I think that is consistent with the kind of approach that we have seen to energy policy that the President has pursued. There also clearly is a growing renewable energy industry in Nebraska, and that's the kind of energy future that the President envisions for our economy and for our country.\nAnd I think a state like Nebraska is a pretty good indication of how communities all across the country can benefit from smart investments in wind energy production, in particular. We've seen rural communities all across the country actually be pretty strong when it comes -- under the President's leadership, as a result of the President's policies. Nebraska is also a state that would benefit significantly from the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement that the administration is seeking to negotiate.\nSo despite the kind of economic strength that we already see in Nebraska, the President believes that there's more that we can do that would make the people of Nebraska even more prosperous. And the President is pursuing policies that are consistent with that.\nYou asked about Mr. Buffett. I don't know Mr. Buffett's schedule today. The President obviously knows Mr. Buffett pretty well, and I think if there's an opportunity for the President to visit with Mr. Buffett today, I'm sure the President will take advantage of it.\nQ: We reported on this meeting with the families of the slain police officer. Can you tell us any more about what's going to happen with that meeting?\nMR. EARNEST: I know that meeting will occur, but I don't have a lot more details for you now. Why don't we touch base after the meeting has transpired, and we'll see if I can get you some more information.\nQ: -- the police officer's family also? The police officer's family, which has been reported --\nMR. EARNEST: Yes. That's what he asked about.\nQ: Back to Iran and the detaining of U.S. sailors -- why didn't the President mention it in the State of the Union address? And you did tick off quite a few concerns that the administration continues to have with Iran. Is this the latest in a series of moves that would consider the trustworthiness of Iran as you go forward with the Iranian nuclear deal, which I assume is going to be finalized as the JCPOA is finalized this weekend, I hear.\nMR. EARNEST: As it relates to the address last night, at the White House we reached the conclusion that further elevating the situation by including it in the State of the Union address would not be the most effective way for us to assure the safe return of our sailors. And I think the outcome, which is the release of the sailors just hours after the President completed his address is a pretty powerful endorsement of that strategy.\nAt this point, I would not have any reason to think that this incident would have an impact on the implementation of the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. As we've discussed earlier, the timing of when this so-called implementation day will occur is dependent primarily on the Iranians, because we have been resolute about the fact that the Iranians will not benefit from sanctions relief unless and until they have fulfilled every single commitment that they made in the context of the joint agreement. And we are going to require that they provide sufficient access to international inspectors so that those steps can be independently verified prior to any sanctions relief being offered to the Iranians.\nSo that means that we're still waiting on Iran to take all the steps that they are required to take, and for international experts to confirm that those commitments have been fulfilled consistent with the agreement. And only after both of those things have transpired will we move forward with formalizing our part of the bargain, which is offering Iran relief from the sanctions that were put in place as a result of their nuclear program.\nAs we've discussed previously, this agreement won't have any impact on the existing sanctions that are related to some other aspects of Iran's nefarious behavior, including their support for terrorism and their new development of their ballistic missile program.\nQ: Josh, would the President have delivered a different address if Donald Trump were not the leading candidate, or one of the leading candidates for President on the Republican side?\nMR. EARNEST: Let me try to answer your question this way. For those of you who have been covering the President for a while now -- and as I sort of look around the group here, I think many of you have -- I think you can draw a pretty straight line from the speech that the President delivered at the Democratic Convention in Boston in July of 2004 through the address that the President delivered eight years and two weeks ago in Des Moines, Iowa, on the night of the Iowa caucus, through to his first and second inaugural addresses. In each of those high-profile addresses, the President offered up a fundamentally optimistic vision for the country. And he delivered those addresses -- at least a couple of those addresses at times when people had reason not to be feeling particularly optimistic.\nAt least one of those addresses -- I have the first inaugural in mind -- was delivered in the depths of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. And even looking at that address, you sensed the kind of optimism and possibility that the President senses about this country's future.\nAnd I do think that last night's speech was a reiteration of that vision for the country. And the vast majority of those speeches were delivered before several of the current Republican candidates for president walked across the national political stage -- not just Mr. Trump, but even people like Senator Cruz and Senator Rubio.\nQ: It's hard not to connect some of his comments with Mr. Trump.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it's hard not to see the stark contrast in approach -- I would readily acknowledge that. I think that was pretty obvious even to people who are only sort of paying attention to politics. And I think the President alluded to that last night, that elections are about making choices, and the American people will ultimately have the opportunity to make their own choice. And I feel confident that, while Democrats pride ourselves in having a big tent party and representing and incorporating a lot of different views into our party, that the core values and principles of what it means to be a Democrat are consistent with the optimism that the President articulated last night.\nAnd that does stand in stark contrast to the core message that's being delivered by basically all of the Republican candidates for president. I don't think that's much of an exaggeration. I know that Mr. Trump gets most of the attention, but again, we're seeing all of the Republican candidates make a rather overt appeal to people's anxieties and fears and insecurities about the future.\nAnd I'm not in a position to talk about the strategy that that they're pursuing for their campaign, but I am in a position to note that the kind of vision that they have for the country is quite different than the kind of vision and leadership that the President has been talking about for more than a decade now.\nQ: What do you think about the Republican Party that they tapped someone who they knew would come out swinging against Donald Trump to be their response?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, you guys have written about how -- that there seem to be a number of differences of opinion inside the Republican Party right now. What consequences that has to the election, that's something for you guys to analyze in advance and for us all to consider after Election Day has occurred.\nBut, look, what the President did yesterday was -- last night was to articulate a vision for governing the country. And it was not rooted in opposition to another person or another politician, or even another politician's views. What the President laid out yesterday reflects what he thinks is the best about this country and what he thinks is the most effective approach any American President can take to leading the greatest country on Earth.\nThis issue of Republicans in Congress, too -- they seem to be struggling in terms of putting together and articulating their own vision of a government -- or a governing agenda that is something other than opposing the President's agenda. There is no better example of that than citing what House Republicans did just within the last week. They voted for like the 60th time to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They haven't voted on their own affirmative health care proposal even once. And in some ways, that is actually the clearest illustration of the challenge that's facing the Republican Party.\nAnd the reason that that's a challenge for them is -- the whole reason that we have a political debate in this country is that people have the opportunity to put forward their ideas; they defend them in the public square; they advocate for them; they marshal evidence; they present data to try to persuade people that the vision that they're offering up is in the best interest of the country. And Republicans seem to be struggling rather mightily right now in articulating their own coherent agenda for how they would lead the country.\nBut again, that is a challenge that is facing not just Republicans who aspire to the White House; this is a significant challenge for Republicans that right now are entrusted with majorities in both the House and the Senate.\nQ: As you well know, Omaha is practically within shouting distance of Iowa. I think it's an Iowa media market. Is the President's visit -- did that factor into today's visit in terms of trying to influence the debate in Iowa? And is this indicative of how he'll try to influence the political debate over the course of the year, as he talked about doing last night?\nMR. EARNEST: I think I would describe the geographic circumstance as an appealing side benefit of this trip. I'm confident that -- the President wanted to travel to a state that demonstrated his commitment to talking to people other than just his supporters. And going to a state like Nebraska that didn't give him any electoral votes in 2012, gave him a single electoral vote in 2008, I think is a pretty good way for the President to start that effort.\nAnd that means not just giving a speech before large audiences -- although that's a valuable way to give as many people as possible the opportunity to see the President makes a trip -- but it also should include a conversation, a real conversation with somebody local. And so the President is going to do both of those things on this trip.\nI don't know how much of an impact it will have on the ongoing political debate across the river. But, look, if that is -- if that geographic circumstance is a reason for more people to pay attention to what the President has to say today, then we obviously welcome it.\nQ: I think there is a bid to put the 2nd District back in the Democratic column in 2016 and try and do the \"blue dot\" again for the Democrats.\nMR. EARNEST: That will be -- I'll just say that it was a point of pride to those of us who worked on the Obama campaign in 2008 that we did succeed in winning that electoral vote. I suspect, though I don't know, that when we get to the general election that whoever the Democratic candidate is would be similarly proud to earn the support of that congressional district. But that's something that somebody else is analyzing -- but probably not yet. We'll wait until the general election before we do that.\nQ: He talked last night about one of the few regrets that he has is that the polarization, the division hasn't gotten any better; maybe worse. If you contrast his visit from 2008 when there was kind of this soaring message of unity to today, and you look at 2008 when he did carry the district -- 2012, much different story -- any reflections on kind of how you see that in Omaha, the kind of division that has deepened over time?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, what the President was really talking about was more about the political division and debate in Washington. It's more profound there. You could probably make a case that some of the partisan divisions and rancor has grown more significant across the country, too, but it's been much more pronounced in Washington, D.C., at the core of our system of government, in the United States Congress. That's primarily what the President was referring to.\nBut, look, the President did acknowledge that that situation has worsened under his presidency. And the President did acknowledge that that was the source of some regret. And he acknowledged that a different President with greater skills, like somebody like President Lincoln or President Roosevelt, might have been more effective in bridging that divide. But the President also said that in his remaining year in office that he was actually going to try to be better, that he was going to try to do more and be more effective in trying to bridge that divide. And we obviously would welcome that kind of sentiment from leaders on the other side of the aisle, too.\nThat might have been part of what Governor Haley was articulating. But I hope she's not the only one.\nQ: -- he's going to, do you know what the subject of her letter was, what she wrote to say to the President in the letter?\nMR. EARNEST: Let me pull together some more information on this. I don't want to over-promise on what we can provide, because we're trying to walk the fine line of protecting this woman's privacy, but obviously we're going to her house, right? So let me just figure out where we're going to draw that line, but, yes, I will get you some additional information.\nQ: On that Putin call -- I know you're doing a readout later, but is there anything important we should ask here? How long it lasted, or any agreement on a timeline, anything like that?\nMR. EARNEST: Not that I know of.\nQ: Back to King Abdullah for a moment. Is there something that the administration wants him to do beyond what he's doing, especially, perhaps, committing ground troops inside Syria?\nMR. EARNEST: I know there were a number of discussions that the King had while he was in D.C., not just with the Vice President, but also with Secretaries Kerry and Carter. I don't have a specific readout of those conversations. Let me just say that we obviously value the contribution that the Jordanians are already making to our counter-ISIL campaign. The President himself has said that we're going to spend some time talking to all of our partners in that coalition about what more they can do to reinforce our efforts against ISIL, not just militarily, but in terms of other aspects of our campaign -- counter-finance, countering their radical online strategy.\nI will tell you that the President's brief conversation with King Abdullah was not in pursuit of any specific request like that. The President's visit with King Abdullah was largely social. We heard that King Abdullah was here at the airport at the same time that the President was, and so the President wanted to go by and say hello.\nSo for more details for any specific asks that were made of the King while he was visiting the United States over the last couple of days, I think you should check with my colleagues at the National Security Council who can give you more details about all of the conversations the King had while he was here.\nQ: Do you know whether there was some discussion of committing to retake Palmyra --\nMR. EARNEST: I know that there has been a variety of discussions about how to enhance the ground forces with whom our coalition can partner to more effectively push back ISIL. But I don't know if that entailed any specific asks of the Jordanians. It might have, but I just don't know.\nQ: On Medicaid, is there a Medicaid announcement coming up? And is that going to be -- presumably that's what Louisiana is all about.\nMR. EARNEST: -- initiatives being discussed in both states. We're traveling to Nebraska. There are a number of -- the Republican governor of Nebraska has indicated his strong opposition to expanding Medicaid. However, there are a number of Republican state legislators who do believe that expanding Medicaid in Nebraska would be beneficial to the state.\nQ: You just happen to have a list. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: I happen to have some statistics. If Nebraska were to expand Medicaid, an additional 42,000 people who do not currently have insurance would be able to get health care coverage if Medicaid were expanded in Nebraska.\nAnd that would actually have a significant positive impact on the lives of 42,000 Nebraska citizens. But it would also have a positive impact on the Nebraska economy and a positive impact on the Nebraska budget. Right now you've got a state budget that has to bear that burden. And again, the benefits of Medicaid expansion is that the federal government is currently promising to take on the vast majority of that cost -- 90 percent of that cost.\nSo that's why most states have concluded it's a no-brainer for states to make this decision, that there are important economic benefits, there are fiscal benefits to the state, and it can make a significant difference in the lives of tens of thousands of people.\nThat's a good transition because that's obviously why we were pleased to see the announcement from the Governor of Louisiana just yesterday, I believe, the newly-elected Democratic Governor of Louisiana has said that he would use his executive authority to expand Medicaid in Louisiana. And the number of people in Louisiana who will benefit from this is significant.\nQ: You've got that number right there.\nMR. EARNEST: I do. In fact, it's so significant I've committed it to memory. (Laughter.) The Governor's office says that about 300,000 people in Louisiana would benefit from this decision. And that's why -- yes, just in Louisiana alone. And that's why the Governor's office has said that they want to work as aggressively and as quickly as they can to implement this expansion.\nI haven't touched base with my HHS colleagues to determine exactly what sort of timeline would be realistic, but we are obviously going to join them in working hard to try to implement this as quickly as we can. And we obviously are pretty excited about that decision from Governor Edwards.\nQ: Will the Governor be at the event tomorrow?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know yet, actually, but I'll try to find out in advance of tomorrow.\nQ: On the Nebraska Governor, he originally said that he was not going to be able to make the welcoming event, but apparently he was able to fit it into his schedule. So any comment on -- are you guys pleased that he was able to rearrange things?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know the details of his schedule or what changed in his schedule that allowed him to participate in one form or another today. We're obviously pleased that he'll be at the airport to greet the President. I know that the President is looking forward to meeting him.\nAgain, traditionally, when the President travels across the country, he is met at the airport by a local leader, often the governor, whether that person is in the President's party or not. And we're obviously pleased that -- I think Governor Ricketts is pursuing the kind of political tradition that Nebraskans have long adhered to, that regardless of political party that when you're the governor of the state and the President of the United States is coming to visit, then you extend to him a courteous and proper Midwestern welcome.\nAnd so, again, Governor Ricketts I'm sure would be the first to say that there are a lot of -- plenty of things he disagrees with the President about, but, look, you've got to give credit to Governor Ricketts for putting aside those differences and extending the kind of courtesy to the President of the United States that I think the vast majority of Nebraskans would expect.\nGood. Thanks, guys. It will be a fun trip.\nEND 2:15 P.M. EST", "timestamp": "2016-01-13", "title": "Press Gaggle by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}

Issues have become the center of campaigns across the country, as voters everywhere try to find the candidates who they agree with most. While I tend to look at the issues, I also consider the experience necessary to be the next commander in chief of the United States, and John Kasich is the candidate who has that experience.\nGovernor Kasich's resume is unmatched by any candidate in either party. He represented Ohio in the House of Representatives for eighteen years, serving on the Armed Services Committee throughout that time. He also chaired the House Budget Committee in 1997 and was a chief architect of the deal that balanced the federal budget for the first time since 1969.\nServing as Governor of Ohio since 2010, he has helped turn around a state in a recession, creating well over 300,000 private sector jobs, and closing an eight million dollar budget shortfall without raising taxes. Governor Kasich won re-election in Ohio in 2014 winning 64 percent of the vote. Ohioans have continued to be pleased with him as an October poll showed he has a 62 percent job approval rating. Shouldn't we elect a president who is well liked in his own state?\nAnyone can discuss the issues, but only one candidate in either party has both the experience in Congress and as an executive needed to be the next president of the United States. Our nation is too important to have a president receiving on the job training. Support a candidate who has proven he can lead and join me in caucusing for Governor Kasich on February 1st.", "timestamp": "2016-01-13", "title": "Press Release - Iowa State Daily Letter: Kasich for President"}

He is a constitutional scholar who has argued before the U.S. Supreme Court, testified before Congress on constitutional issues, and won three recent landmark First Amendment and religious liberty cases. Texas Lawyer named Shackelford one of the 25 greatest Texas lawyers of the past quarter century. He is a frequent speaker and commentator on national news.\n\"For me, the number one issue is religious liberty, and on that issue the choice is easy,\" Shackelford said. \"Ted Cruz not only believes in religious liberty, he champions it. I have fought alongside him and watched his willingness to sacrifice for our first freedoms. His brilliance, his understanding, and his proven commitment — not just words — are unequalled in this race. I don't have to worry about what he will do: I've watched him do it in battle. As someone who has been committed to fighting for religious liberty for over 26 years, I wholeheartedly endorse Ted Cruz for President.

Cruz galvanized support for the Houston pastors subpoenaed by their mayor in 2014 and authored an amicus brief defending Hobby Lobby in January of that year. He introduced and successfully passed two amendments to the NDAA in the US Senate to protect the religious liberty of service members.\nIn Iowa in August and in South Carolina in November, Shackelford praised Cruz for championing religious liberty rights at two rallies for religious liberty hosted by Cruz in the early-voting states.", "timestamp": "2016-01-13", "title": "Press Release - Kelly Shackelford: \"Cruz is Number One on Religious Liberty\""}

Huckabee walked away from his income this year to do this presidential race, he said. Nobody is taking care of any of his expenses; he just had to save up enough with the hope he can make it through the elections. \"I think a person who is going to run for office and hold an office should resign the job they have to focus on their election,\" Huckabee said. Huckabee offered many ideas on what a president's qualifications and skills should be before entering office. \"Why would we put someone in the chief executive position of the United States who had never held a chief executive office before and hope he could learn it once he got there?\" Huckabee said. \"You hire people to do a job they are prepared to do and are qualified to do. To be president, I believe it's a tough job and needs skill to do the job.\" Huckabee also believes in rebuilding the military and the country's moral compass. \"We have to rebuild this country morally as well,\" Huckabee said. \"We came from the roots of people who believed in this country.

{"author": "Mike Huckabee", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116375", "text": "By Carrie Sheffield, OpportunityLives.com\nThe war on poverty isn't fought and won with a monthly check from the government. In discussing the war on poverty at the Kemp Forum last week, Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee spoke of the emotional and psychosocial deprivation that comes when government crowds out the family, a key variable in preventing poverty.\nHuckabee cited statistics showing how a child born to married parents who have finished high school and are working has an 88 percent chance of never entering poverty. Reverse those variables, the former Arkansas governor said, and there is a 91 percent chance that child will experience poverty.\n\"The reversal is dramatic,\" Huckabee explained. \"We sometimes are even pilloried, those of us who say marriage matters, family matters, stable marriages and stable families matter. And it sounds like we're coming at it just from trying to tell people how to live.\"\n\"It's an economic issue,\" he continued. \"You want to eliminate poverty? We can eliminate most of it by instilling in people the idea that there is a virtue. And I know that virtue is a politically incorrect word. But it is based on what this country is founded on, the idea that some things are right, some things are good and wholesome and virtuous and we should elevate and uphold them.\"\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.), who moderated the conversation, said that while government can provide supply lines in the war on poverty, it should not be on the front lines. By spending trillions of government dollars on anti-poverty measures, Ryan said this effectively crowds out civil society leaders, who are better able to take a holistic approach.\n\"The reason we speak about family, the reason we speak about marriage is because that is a beautiful support structure that is there for a person to teach them, to connect them, to equip them with the skills so that, and this is what we do as parents, so that when your kids get up they have the tools they need to succeed,\" Ryan said.\n\"But that's missing in so many parts,\" he added. \"And this isn't something that just hits people of certain income groups, whether it's heroin or alcohol or drugs, it hits everybody. And it's breaking families.\"\nRyan asked Huckabee to discuss how Huckabee's time as a pastor had influenced his time in government.\n\"Government can give you a sandwich, but government cannot give you a hug. Sometimes people need affirmation,\" Huckabee said.\n\"We've made the huge mistake in this country that we should create this huge separation between faith and government, and we cannot function as a society,\" he said.\nHuckabee, who served as governor of Arkansas from 1996 to 2007, spoke of how he was able to bring reforms to welfare in the mid-1990s to his state. State autonomy was crucial.\n\"We were given a lot of flexibility of how we did it, and it worked because we knew our demographics,\" Huckabee recalled. \"We knew our people and we moved over half the people who had been on welfare, not just off welfare — that's easy, you can just cut off the funds — but to get them to transition where they're going to work every day. That's the challenge, and we did that.\"\n\"Government can give you a sandwich, but government cannot give you a hug. Sometimes people need affirmation\"\nHuckabee spoke of what Ryan referred to as the \"poverty trap,\" where families have little or no incentive to work and lift themselves out of poverty and instead hover around the basic threshold of government-subsidized living expenses that allow them to scrape by but not thrive. He said that structuring programs that way from a distant federal bureaucracy is harmful to working families.\n\"There is an industry of poverty that is built around the organizations, that if we have organizations and the advocacy groups, that that will resolve poverty,\" Huckabee said. Referring to the federal War on Poverty that President Lyndon Johnson launched in 1964, he argued, \"We didn't really do much to move the needle. Part of the reason was we didn't really attack some of the fundamental purposes and that's the reason people can't get out of the hole.\"\nHuckabee said beyond properly structuring work and assistance programs, broader tax reform could help bring back jobs for working families.\n\"I believe that there is an incredible opportunity for us in this country to reclaim that spirit of America, where people are rewarded for their work,\" Huckabee said. \"And when that happens and we give them opportunities, we'll see the growth, not just of our economy, but the growth of our people being able move upwardly.\"\n\"But I just think sometimes the government policies that we've created are created people who never spent a day poor,\" he said. \"And they don't understand. And it's one of the reasons why we need a new vision, a new approach.\"", "timestamp": "2016-01-13", "title": "Press Release - Huckabee Stresses Importance of Stable Families in Combatting Poverty"}

{"author": "Bernie Sanders", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123321", "text": "ROBERTS: Joining me now from the capital is presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders. Sir, thanks for your time today and I want to get right to this because I need to point out that this week's NBC news polling still has you trailing in Iowa by three points. But say you win in Iowa and you get a lock in New Hampshire, do you have the campaign infrastructure and the support from the DNC to take this all the way?\nSANDERS: Well, maybe not the support from the DNC, but we have the support from the American people. Thomas, as you know, we have raised more individual campaign contributions than any candidate in the history of the United States of America. 2.5 million contributions averaging $27 a piece.\nSo we are getting small contributions from the middle class, from working families. Not only do we have enough money to wage a very strong campaign in Iowa and in New Hampshire, we are working hard in Nevada, in South Carolina, and in many other states as well.\nSo to answer your question, I think the American people are tired of establishment politics, establishment economics. They want to see leadership stand up to the billionaire class. Our message is resonating all across this country. And yes, we have the energy, we have the funding to take this to the convention.\nROBERTS: I want to talk about the legal battle with the DNC coming up in a moment, but first the next Democratic debate is this Sunday on NBC News and recently Hillary Clinton hit you on the issue of guns and health care. I want to play you what she told NBC's Savannah Guthrie about those points. Take a look.\n[begin video clip]\nHILLARY CLINTON: One of the big ones, as you're aware, is on gun safety where Senator Sanders has been a pretty reliable vote for the gun lobby and I have been standing against them for a long time.\nWe have a difference on health care. I want to build on the Affordable Care Act. We have to make some changes because we have to improve it. He's been talking very generally about a single payer system. He's introduced legislation nine times that have laid out a very specific plan to take everybody's health care and roll it into great big bundle and hand it to the states.\n[end video clip]\nROBERTS: So, let's start with guns on this issue...\nSANDERS: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Let me just start off by saying that Secretary Clinton is really quite inaccurate on both of those charges. I have a D-minus - D-minus...[crosstalk]\nSANDERS: ... voting record from the NRA.\nROBERTS: Correct.\nSANDERS: In 1988 I probably lost a congressional election because I said maybe we should not have assault weapons being sold in America. So, to say that I'm kind of a supporter of the NRA is really a mean spirited, and unfair and inaccurate statement.\nROBERTS: Then do you regret or apologize for voting to give gun manufacturers immunity protection from lawsuits?\nSANDERS: There were things in that bill that I supported, there are things in that bill that do not make sense and are wrong. And as I have said for the last several months, I am willing to absolutely take a look at the onerous parts of that bill.\nBut let me also say, you know, I have asked Secretary Clinton, and let me repeat it right now, in 2008 when she was running against Senator Barack Obama, he proposed expanding -- extending the life of Social Security by lifting the cap on taxable income. We've taken that idea. And we say that we should expand benefits so that people in this country who are trying to get by on $12,000, $13,000 a year, elderly people, disabled vets, should see an increase in their Social Security benefits by lifting the cap above people making $250,000 a year or more.\nI am waiting to hear whether Secretary Clinton has changed her views from 2008 and whether or not she will support an expansion of Social Security benefits for millions of elderly people who just cannot make it on $12,000 OR $13,000 a year.\nROBERTS: Senator Sanders, let me ask you, though, about the issue with the ACA, and Obamacare and the fact that you'd like to rip that up and get back to the beginning.\nSANDERS: Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.\nROBERTS: A single payer public health care system, correct?\nSANDERS: Well, you know what, yes. Medicare for all single payer system. You know, it's funny, Thomas. Again in 2008, you may recall that then Senator Clinton was attacking then Senator Barack Obama because she supported universal health care, health care for everybody.\nWell, I support that as well. And I believe that the most effective way to provide health care to every man, woman, and child in a cost effective way is through a Medicare for all singer payer system. Now she's attacking me because I support universal health care. In 2008 she was attacking Obama because Obama was attacking her because she supported universal health care.\nI would hope that Secretary Clinton will tell the American people does she support universal health care. Is she prepared to end the absurdity of the American people paying far, far more per capita on health care...[crosstalk]\nROBERTS: We know that she's on the stump talking about the fact that you'd like to rip up Obamacare, which would...\nSANDERS: It's not rip it up.\nROBERTS: ... make one assume that she supports it and would let the ACA stand if she were elected.\nSANDERS: But the ACA...\nROBERTS: How would you pay for it?\nSANDERS: First of all, we would pay for it obviously through increased premiums. Right now the American people are spending $3 trillion a year on health care, and a lot of that money is going into the private insurance companies and the drug companies which is why we pay far more per capita than do the people of any other country.\nWhen you get rid of the private insurance companies, when you force the drug companies to lower their prices, you can provide health care for a middle class family and save thousands and thousands of dollars compared to the outrageous cost of health care today.\nSo, yes, we will take away and do away with private health insurance premiums and move that to public health insurance premiums. Health care is not free, but we can do a lot better in lowering the cost of health care for a middle class family than is currently the case.\nROBERTS: Sir, I want to talk to you, though, when it comes to money, we had the vice president recently praise your efforts regarding income inequality. But he also said that Clinton was, quote, \"relatively new to that fight.\" Do you take that as a bit of an endorsement for your style on that issue from the vice president?\nSANDERS: Well, you know, I have known Joe Biden for many, many years. He comes from a working class background as I do. And both of us understand that it is totally absurd that the top one-tenth of 1 percent today in America own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent.\nThat is disgraceful. I have been a leader in the fight to end income and wealth inequality. Joe Biden has been strong on that issue and I'm very, very glad that he has noticed that this is an issue that I have been leading on for many, many years.\nROBERTS: When we look at the race on the right, and we just had Donald Trump on. He sends you his warmest regards.\nSANDERS: I'm sure that he does.\nROBERTS: He does. But if it were a match up between the two of you, and the fact that he's gotten very asymmetrical with his campaign attacks to Hillary Clinton over her husband's past indiscretions, is it any sign to you that you're not being attacked...\nSANDERS: Well, let me just say this...\nROBERTS: ... by an asymmetrical way and that they think you could be a weaker contender in the general?\nSANDERS: Well, I would suggest that Mr. Trump take a look at all of the recent polling that's been out there, not just the polling in New Hampshire and the polling in Iowa, which in match ups between Trump and myself I defeat him and defeat him very handily.\nI think, Thomas, that the last New Hampshire poll had me defeating him by 19 points in New Hampshire. The last national Quinnipiac poll had me beating him 13 points nationally. I would love to run, frankly, against Donald Trump. His views on so many issues and his attitude toward minorities in this country is so different than mine. It would give me great joy not only to run against him, I think we would beat him by a pretty significant margin.\nROBERTS: You bring up New Hampshire. Yesterday Chelsea Clinton made her debut there campaigning for her mom. She was on the attack about you. Do you think that she's a powerful voice among her mother's campaign?\nSANDERS: Well, you know, all I will say, I can't give a statement on that, I don't know. But I think what she said was wrong. And one of the points that she made is that a Medicare for all single payer system, which would guarantee health care to all people, her point was, well, in states where we have Republican governors, that plan would not be implemented. That is factually incorrect. And I hope the Clinton campaign stops saying that.\nThe way the legislation that we have introduced in the past was written, and obviously is what we believe in, is that if a Republican governor doesn't want it, it will be implemented by the federal government. This is a plan for 50 states. Bottom line here is, we are the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people. 29 million people still have no health insurance. We pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs and we end up spending far, far, far more per capita on health care than do the people of any other country. That's got to change and I do believe strongly in universal health care through a Medicare for all single payer system.\nROBERTS: Senator Bernie Sanders, sir, I'm going to let you get back to work because I know you have a busy day ahead of you, but I do appreciate your time and I hope to speak to you again soon. Thank you.\nSANDERS: Thank you very much, Thomas.\nROBERTS: Absolutely.", "timestamp": "2016-01-13", "title": "Interview with Thomas Roberts of MSNBC"}

Buffett, chief executive officer and chairman, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. He also referred to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) terrorist organization.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111473", "text": "The President. Hello, Omaha! Thank you! Oh! Thank you. Thank you. Well, thank you so much. Thank you, Omaha. That's so nice, thank you. Well, thank you so much. Go Mavericks! This is quite a place you got here. It's still got the new arena smell. [Laughter] A perfect spot for your hockey team to stage another run to the Frozen Four.\nI want to start off by thanking Lisa for the wonderful introduction and her hospitality in her living room. Give her a big round of applause. She did a great job. Before I came here I stopped over at Lisa's place, with her husband and her 1-year-old. And he was fired up and ready to go. [Laughter] He was bouncing around, and I was getting tired just watching him. [Laughter]\nI also want to thank Dr. Hank Bounds, the President of the University of Nebraska; Dr. John Christensen, Chancellor here at UNO. We've got Lieutenant Governor Mike Foley here; your former Senator, Ben Nelson; your Congressman, Brad Ashford. And all of you are here. This is a pretty good crowd!\nAudience member. Love you!\nThe President. I love you back. I do. I do. I do. This is so nice. What a wonderful welcome. Those of you who have seats, though, feel free to sit down. It's okay. [Laughter] But if you want to stay standing, that's fine too.\nLast night I gave my final State of the Union Address. And I promised that it was going to be shorter, and then it ended up just being, like, I think, a minute shorter. [Laughter] So, technically, it was shorter, but it wasn't, like, as short as I was planning. But today I'm definitely going to be shorter.\nAudience members. No!\nThe President. Yes. No, the—[laughter]. But whenever I give a State of the Union, I want to get out of Washington and talk to people out in the country. And so the first place I decided to visit was Omaha. Part of the reason I wanted to come here is I've got a lot of friends, like Brad and others, and I had not been here in a while. So the last time I was here for an event in Omaha was 2008. And that year, in the primary, I won the Nebraska caucus. And there were people—I saw some signs—who called the city \"Obamaha.\"\nAnd then, in November of 2008, Joe Biden and I won one electoral vote here, which was—I was pretty excited about. And then, 4 years later, I got whupped all across this State. [Laughter] It was not pretty. It was not pretty. But I love Nebraska anyway. There's something about the Midwest and its people and the way that folks pull together and the degree to which, in this State, the kind of politics I talked about last night has always been there. There's a civility and people treating each other with respect.\nAnd so that's part of the reason why I wanted to come back here today, because as I said last night, America is at its best when we see each other as one people: not Democrat first, not Republican first, but Americans first. That's our priority. And that's harder to do during political season. I understand that. And you hear a bunch of folks right across the river—[laughter]—and I don't know if the TV ads drift over here—[laughter]—but they're kind of depressing. [Laughter] I mean, I was—I like talking about hope and all the good stuff that was going on, and then you look at some of these ads, and it's some doom and some gloom. [Laughter]\nAudience member. Four more years!\nThe President. It's like everybody is running around and saying America is in decline, and everything is scary, and let's find somebody to blame. And the point I wanted to make, the core thing I wanted to say last night was, that's not the spirit that brought America so far. That's not how we traveled so far. And it's not what I see every day. That's not what I see in communities and neighborhoods all across this country.\nNow, what's true is, we're all living through a time of extraordinary change, and that's always a little bit unsettling. And that's what Lisa wrote to me about—at 4:00 a.m., which I wanted to tell Lisa, you should get some sleep. [Laughter] But when you have a 1-year-old, that's what happens. [Laughter] But you heard Lisa talk about, she was wondering whether the world she grew up in would be just as prosperous and secure for her new baby as it was for her.\nBut I want everybody to remember, America has been through big changes before. And each time, we overcame our fears, and we overcame our challenges. Each time, we made change work for us. And each time, we emerged stronger and better than we were before. That's what we do as Americans. I mean, we go through war and depression and all kinds of social and economic changes, but each time, we've ended up better than we were before.\nNow, here's the thing, progress is not inevitable. You've got to work for it—somebody is stealing my lines up here. [Laughter] It's the result of the choices that we have to make together. And we've got to make some choices. Do we respond to these changes with fear and do we turn on each other, or do we face the future with confidence in who we are and what we stand for and all the incredible things we can get done together?\nSo I just want to repeat the four big questions that I think we have to answer as a country. And this is true whether you're a Democrat, whether you're Republican. You should think about—and we have to have good answers for—these four questions, regardless of who's President, regardless of who controls Congress.\nNumber one, how do we make sure that this new economy works for everybody and not just some people? That's question number one. Number two, a related question: How do we make sure that the spirit of innovation is used to solve some of our biggest challenges? Number three, how do we keep America safe and lead the world without becoming the world's policeman? Number four, and maybe most important, is how do we have a politics that reflects the best in us and not the worst?\nSo, on the economy, the first thing I try to remind people is, is think about where we were 7 years ago. We were—because people forget, and some of you were in grade school, and I had no gray hair. [Laughter] So just to refresh your memory here for a second, we were in the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes. I was going back to look at my first State of the Union Address, where I had to basically remind everybody that the money in their banks were safe. I had to tell folks that that was—that it was going to be okay. That's how fragile things were.\nBut to paraphrase something that a friend of mine—who, I guess, people know around here—named Warren Buffett once said, no one ever benefited by betting against America. And because of the grit and the resilience of the American people, because of hard work, because businesses got going, and because, frankly, we made some pretty good policy decisions, we now have the strongest, most durable economy in the world.\nWe're in the midst of the longest streak of private sector job creation in history: 14 million new jobs, around 40,000 right here in Omaha and the surrounding areas. Our national unemployment rate has been cut in half; it's down to 5 percent. It's below 3 percent here in Nebraska. So our starting point has to be, things are not terrible if your unemployment rate is at 5, and here in Omaha, it's below 3.\nNow, that does not mean that things haven't been changing in profound ways. And that's also what I had to talk about. Look, it's changed to the point where even folks who have jobs, and even when the economy is growing, it's harder for hard-working families to pull themselves out of poverty. It's harder for young people to start out on their careers, especially if they've got too much student loan debt. It's tougher for workers to retire when they want to. And there's more inequality, and upward mobility has stalled. And that offends our fundamental American belief that anybody who works hard can get ahead.\nSo people agree that real opportunity in the new economy requires everybody gets a great education and the training they need to land a good job. And we've been working on that. Over the past 7 years, we've increased early childhood education; we've boosted high school graduation rates. We've—we're training and graduating more engineers and folks in other fields that we need to grow the economy. And—but we've got to build on that progress.\nWe've got to create opportunity for every child, which means pre-K for everybody. It means hands-on computer classes and math classes for the jobs of the future. It means we should recruit and support and lift up great teachers who are doing great things for our kids. And it means that no student should be priced out of a college education or loaded up with crippling debt.\nSo one of the things—I didn't try to list all the proposals I would like to see happen this year. That's why you go to the website: whitehouse.gov—[laughter]—which now works, I promise. [Laughter] But we should guarantee 2 years of community college at no cost for every responsible student. That's what real opportunity looks like in the new economy.\nAnd then, once we've made sure everybody has a great education, as folks move throughout their lives, we've got to pair real opportunity with real security. Basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything else is today.\nI was talking to Lisa's dad and mom. They were there, and mostly they just wanted to talk about their adorable 1-year-old grandson. [Laughter] But they've been married for 44 years. And dad had worked at a company that produces cement and ships it around the country, and he had worked there for 40 years, and he's still working there. And mom had been a nurse, and she'd retired. But that kind of career path, where somebody is at one place for that long, with good benefits, that—pension, health care—that's not going to be the pattern for most of the young people who are here today.\nAnd so the idea is, how do we make sure that even if you're in this new economy where you're changing jobs, you're retraining, you're starting your own business, you have some basic security? And that's what the Affordable Care Act, by the way, is all about. That's what it's all about. The goal wasn't to replace employer-based care. If you've got health care on the job, that's great. But if you lose your job or you have to go back to school or you want to start a new business or you're starting a new job and you've got a preexisting condition, you should have health care options. You should have health care options.\nThe same is true for some of the other programs that we have that haven't been adapted to this new economy. So I mentioned unemployment insurance right now. When folks lose their jobs, unemployment insurance right now is not available for a lot of folks who had been working part time or were temporary workers. And if you take a job that doesn't pay as much, sometimes, you get penalized. There should be a system of wage insurance so that you can still pay the bills and make up some of the difference as you transition into a new career.\nAnd if we update the unemployment insurance system, that will encourage more folks to retrain for new, better paying jobs. And when they change jobs, you should be able to save for your retirement even though you didn't stay in one job for 30 years. There should be a way for you to take your retirement savings with you.\nSo, now, having said all that, somebody here said folks need bigger paychecks. And part of what's happened in this new economy is workers, frankly, just have less leverage, because companies move more. It means that they can offshore, they can move to a new State. It means that a lot of times they're under more severe competition. And that gets a lot of folks frustrated.\nBut part of what I've been concerned about as I've been listening to some of the political rhetoric is, let's make sure that we don't blame people who had nothing to do with the fact that wages aren't growing. Let's try to solve the problem, but not misidentify the problem.\nSo, for example, let's agree that working families will not get a bigger paycheck by us eliminating all the reforms that we made on Wall Street or by letting Big Oil and hedge funds make their own rules. That's not going to help working families.\nNow, as I said last night, families on food stamps did not cause the financial crisis. We've got to reform our broken immigration system, but immigrants are not the reason wages haven't gone up. Those decisions were made in boardrooms around the country. You guys aren't the ones who were—I don't think you've got offshore accounts that allow you to dodge paying your taxes. [Laughter] If you do, then the IRS wants to talk about you. Might want to—[laughter].\nBut in this new economy, I believe workers, startups, small businesses, they need more of a voice, more of a say, not less. The rules should work for working Americans. And I'm going to spend some of the time this year lifting up a lot of companies who figured out if they pay good wages, provide good benefits, treat their customers well, are environmentally responsible, they can also make really good profits. And it's good for everybody. It's good for their shareholders and customers and communities.\nAnd a lot of our best corporate citizens are our most creative. Which brings me to the second question that I raised yesterday: How do we make sure that we continue to be an innovation economy, and how do we use innovation to meet some of our biggest challenges?\nSome of you heard me talk about our space program. Sixty years ago, the Russians beat us to space. And how did we respond? We didn't go, \"Oh, my God, America is in decline, and we're doomed.\" [Laughter] We didn't say, \"Ah, that's not actually a spaceship up there, that's a comet.\" [Laughter] We didn't argue about the science, we didn't shrink our R&D budget. We built a space program almost overnight. Twelve years later, we were walking on the Moon. Right? I think my favorite movie last year was \"The Martian.\" And I like space, but there was one line Matt Damon delivered where he said, I'm just going to science the heck out of this. [Laughter] He didn't say \"heck,\" but you get the point. [Laughter] But that's the American spirit, right? \"Okay, let's solve the problem.\" Sometimes, they're tough problems, but we can figure this out. We can figure this out.\nThat's the spirit we need today. That's why I put Joe Biden in charge of us figuring out how to cure cancer. He's working with scientists and doctors, and obviously, with families who've been affected, because he knows what they've gone through.\nThat's why we've got to make sure that American businesses produce and sell the energy of the future. We should keep pressing forward with the clean energies that's going to be creating new jobs for decades to come and transition from dirty energy. We shouldn't be subsidizing the past, we should invest in the future. That puts us ahead of the curve.\nAnd that's how we're going to keep leading the world to combat climate change and protect this planet, Lisa's son, your kids, and your grandkids. There's nothing more important than making sure that future generations are able to enjoy the incredible bounty that God's given us.\nThird question: How do we keep America safe and strong without either isolating ourselves or trying to nation-build all over the world?\nAudience member. Keeping you as President!\nThe President. Oh, well, I can't do that. I can't do that because of the Constitution. And I can't do that because Michelle would kill me. [Laughter]\nBut look, just as all this talk about how the American economy is terrible is just not true, it's also not true when you hear folks talking about how America is so weak. We aren't just the strongest economy in the world, we are far and away the most powerful nation on the planet. Nobody can match our troops. Nobody can match what we can do to mobilize to solve problems around the world.\nAnd when I said that, by the way, last night, it was strange that some in the Chamber didn't agree and applaud with that. I mean, that's kind of a weird thing. I didn't say that it's the strongest in the world because of me. I mean, I understand why they wouldn't want to give me credit for it—which is true. [Laughter] It's because the United States of America, for 250, you know, years—[laughter]—has been working to make us the strongest.\nBut that should not be a controversial statement, right? I mean, we can all clap about that. But that's how crazy our politics has gotten sometimes. Right? That's how crazy our politics has gotten, where we now feel obliged to not root for America doing good.\nSo when you hear people peddling this fiction about our enemies getting stronger, America getting weaker; when you hear folks say we can solve challenges just by looking meaner and talking tougher or carpet bombing wherever we want—that's just hot air. It's bluster. It's not serious. [Applause] It's not serious. There's another word for it that starts with a \"B\"—it's baloney. [Laughter]\nNow, because we're the strongest nation, we've got choices to make about how we use our power. Priority number one is protecting the American people and going after terrorist networks. That's what we're doing with ISIL. And for more than a year, America has led a coalition of more than 60 countries. We're cutting off their financing. We're disrupting their plots. We're stopping the flow of terrorist fighters. We're stamping out their ideology. We've had 10,000 airstrikes. We're taking out their leadership, their oil, their training camps, their weapons. And they will learn the same lesson that terrorists before them have learned, which is when you come after Americans, we go after you. And it may take time, but our reach has no limits, and we will get you. [Applause] We'll get you.\nBut our foreign policy has to also have judgment and wisdom. And we can't try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into a crisis. So what I suggested last night is, we have to have a patient and disciplined strategy. It's got to use every element of our national power. It says America will always act, alone if necessary, to protect our people and our allies. But on a lot of world problems, from climate change to Ebola to Iran trying to get a nuclear weapon, we'll mobilize the world to work with us, and we make sure other countries pull their own weight so we're not ending up sending our troops and spending our money every time there's a problem around the world. That's not a lack of leadership, that's common sense.\nThat's how we led 200 nations to forge the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change. That's how we've gotten Iran to roll back its nuclear program. They're shipping out their nuclear materials right now.\nThat's how we dealt with the Ebola crisis. Our troops, our doctors, our development workers—all outstanding, great courage—they set up the logistics in West Africa so that other countries could then come in. You had Chinese planes who couldn't land before, because of our military setting up the landing strip, could then come in and support the effort to stamp out the spread of Ebola.\nAnd we couldn't be prouder of the doctors and nurses, including here at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, who heroically treated and cared for patients. They saved lives not just here, but their courage saved lives around the world, because they showed that, you know what, we can deal with this. It's a problem; it's serious. We're going to \"science the heck out of it.\" [Laughter] And as a consequence, hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of people's lives were saved. That's how America leads. That's the strength of our values. That's the power of our example.\nAnd that's why we have to reject any politics—any politics—that targets people because of their race or their religion. That we have to reject. [Applause] That we have to reject. That we've got no room for.\nAnd I want to be clear about this. This is not about being politically correct. Now, since I'm on a college campus, I'll tell you, sometimes, I understand the argument about political correctness. There are times where folks don't want to hear something and they just shut things down. If somebody doesn't agree with affirmative action, that's a legitimate policy difference. That doesn't mean they're racist. If somebody has a disagreement about my economic policies, we can have a discussion about that. There should never be a situation on college campuses, for example, where people can't speak at all. Right? The First Amendment is important. The First Amendment is valuable. So we do have to be cautious about suggesting that anytime somebody says something, we shut them down.\nBut let me say this. That doesn't mean that you go around insulting people and thinking that that is clever, or that is being honest, or telling it straight. No, that's just being offensive. And that's feeding some of our worst impulses. And that does not make us strong. That doesn't make us strong. And that doesn't help us fight terrorism, by the way. When politicians insult Muslims, including Muslim Americans—including Muslim Americans who are in uniform, fighting on our behalf—when a mosque is vandalized or a kid is bullied, that doesn't make us safer. It doesn't make us safer. The overwhelming majority of Muslim Americans and Muslims around the world, they're our greatest allies in fighting this scourge of terrorism. So it doesn't make us stronger. It doesn't help the effort. It is wrong. And it betrays who we are as a country: one people, who rise and fall together.\nAnd that is—and when I think back to the arc of my entire political career, that's one thing that I believe more firmly than anything: the fact that we are in this together. That's what makes America great.\nBrad—on the flight over here, Brad was telling me about his grandfather. So his grandfather was from Sweden. And there—here in the Midwest, we've got some folks of Swedish extraction. [Laughter] And he was telling me about how his grandfather helped to set up an organization that was pretty well known at the time, back in the thirties and forties, that was critical in fighting anti-Semitism and helping to bring Jews who were escaping Hitler and Nazi Germany. And I thought about Brad's grandfather as just one example of all the stories in the history of this country that have made us the envy of the world, that have made us that \"shining city on a hill.\"\nIt's not just that we've got a big military. It's not just that we've got a great economy. It's that, in fits and starts, we figured out that if you treat everybody with respect and you give everybody a shot and everybody is working together, everybody is better off, everybody is stronger, everybody's religion is protected. Everybody's point of view is heard. And that's what we have to remember.\nAnd that's the last question that we have to answer and the most important one: How do we infuse those principles into our politics? And I said this yesterday, and I meant it. I have really enjoyed being President, and I'm going to squeeze every last thing I can get out of it over this next year. But look, probably my only big regret is that our parties are even more polarized, our politics are even more rancorous than they were 7 years ago. Now, I'm going to keep on trying to do better to see if I can help break the fever here. But it's not going to happen unless the American people send a clear message to their elected officials that that's not the kind of politics we want.\nAnd there are some—and I can—[applause]. Look, I can say this as somebody who is never going to be on the ballot again—[laughter]—there are some institutional things we've got to fix. I think we have to end political gerrymandering, so that Congressmen aren't choosing their own voters. Because that divides people. If you've got a congressional district that's 80 percent Democrat or 80 percent Republican, then you don't feel obliged to talk to people who don't agree with you, and that's a problem.\nI think we have to end the just crazy amounts of money, much of it hidden, that is in our political system right now.\nI believe that there should not be a single State in which we're making it harder for people to vote instead of easier. That doesn't make any sense. I—we're not supposed to be a nation in which we discourage people from participating. This country works by encouraging people to have a voice in their government, which means that one of the things that I'm going to do over the course of this year is talk about why is it that we should have a single mom who's got—a nurse, let's say, just like Lisa's mom was—she might have to take public transportation, get up early, go to her job, fix breakfast, now she's got to pick up the kid or drop off the kid, come home. And she's got to vote on a Tuesday. Why wouldn't we want to make it so that she's got a little more time to vote? Why are we making it impossible for her?\nAnd a lot of States are doing it. A lot of States are doing it. But that's how it should be in every State. Because none of these things that I just talked about can happen just by a President saying so—any President. Whoever replaces me is not going to be able to get all that done unless the American people demand it; when we as citizens demand it.\nThat's what I said back in 2008. I didn't say, \"Yes, I can,\" I said \"Yes, we can.\" I asked you not to believe in my ability to bring about change, I asked to believe in your ability to bring about change.\nAnd as I said last night, I know it's hard. Sometimes, it's frustrating. But if we don't accept that responsibility and that privilege of citizenship and we accept the cynicism that says, ah, change can't happen, and politics is pointless, and our voices and our actions don't matter, then we're going to forsake a better future, and the void will be filled by folks with money and power and special interests. And they're going to gain more and more control over decisions about whether young people are being sent to war. They will be unfettered in pursuing policies that might lead to another economic crisis. They might roll back rights that generations of American fought to secure.\nAnd then, when people get more and more frustrated because things don't change, you start hearing voices that urge us to fall back into our respective tribes and start scapegoating our fellow citizens: people who don't look like us or pray like us or vote like we do or share the same background. We can't go down that path.\nSo, Omaha, whatever you believe—whether you are a Democrat or a Republican or you don't believe in political parties, whether you supported me or you didn't—our collective future depends on your willingness to uphold your obligation as citizens: to vote and to speak out and to stand up for others, especially those who are vulnerable, especially those who need help, knowing that we are only here because somebody else did that for us. That's how all of us are here.\nAnd when we do that, we will see the goodness and the decency and the optimism of people like Lisa reflecting itself in Washington. That's what we're fighting for.\nAnd I know it's there because I see it in the American people every day. I see it every day. I see it in all the students—first-generation college students—working hard and scrimping and saving and eating ramen—[laughter]—and then eating some more ramen, just to get ahead. And you've got teachers like Lisa, who come in early and are helping young people cultivate a passion or master a new skill that can change their lives. And then, you've got parents who are volunteering at local schools, not just to help out their own kids, but to help out their neighborhood's kids. And folks coaching Little League. And businesses who are doing the right thing by their employees. And folks who are fighting on our behalf halfway around the world and their families who are sacrificing alongside them. And folks working to help our veterans after they've been served. Big-hearted, optimistic people, they're everywhere: in coffee shops and churches all across Nebraska and in Louisiana and in New York and in Arizona and every place else. Folks whose spirit has built America.\nThat's why I'm hopeful about our future: because of you, the American people. Because of folks like all of you, I am absolutely confident that we're going to get to where we need to go and America will remain the greatest country on Earth. Thank you, everybody. God bless you.

He cited the significant decline we've seen in unemployment rate and the millions of jobs that have been created.\nWhat is your assessment of the economy right now? And I would like to hear from all of you on this one, beginning with Ms. Fiorina.\nFIORINA: Well, thank you. Good evening. If I may begin by saying how honored I am to be standing here with two former Iowa Caucus winners.\nGovernor, Senator.\nAnd how honored I am to be talking with all of you. You know, I'm not a political insider. I haven't spent my lifetime running for office. The truth is I have had and been blessed by a lot of opportunities to do a lot of things in my life.\nAnd unlike another woman in this race, I actually love spending time with my husband. [laughter and applause]\nI'm standing here because I think we have to restore a citizen government in this country. I think we have to end crony capitalism. The crony capitalism that starts with both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.\nYou know, Hillary Clinton sits inside government and rakes in millions, handing out access and favors. And Donald Trump sits outside government and rakes in billions buying people like Hillary Clinton.\nThe state of our economy is not strong. We have record numbers of men out of work. We have record numbers of women living in poverty. We have young people who no longer believe that the American dream applies to them.\nWe have working families whose wages have stagnated for decades, all while the rich get richer, the powerful get more powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected get more connected.\nCitizens, it's time to take our country back. [applause]\nSMITH: Governor Huckabee, same question to you. Where do you see the country right now?\nHUCKABEE: I wish I saw the country in the same place that the president presented it to be the other night in the State of the Union. He talked about how great the economy was doing. And I guess for the people he hangs out with, it's probably doing great.\nBut the president should've stood in the line at the layaway counter at Walmart just before Christmas. He would have heard a very different story about the economy of America.\nI wish I could introduce him the lady who cleans the building where our campaign headquarters is located in Little Rock. Her name is Kathleen. She works all day at a local hospital cleaning, and then she goes to the building where a bank, and our headquarters, and other offices are she spends another seven hours. She works 15 hours a day.\nI guarantee you she's not working 15 hours a day because she loves scrubbing toilets, and sweeping floors. She's working that many hours because that's what it takes for her to make it work.\nAnd, she's not alone. There are people all over this country who are working like that. Many of them working two jobs — and they used to have one job, and that would take care of them. But, because of wage stagnation, which we've had for 40 years, because the fact that they're punished for working harder if they work that many hours. The government gets more of their second shift than they do.\nAnd, as a result there are a lot of people who are hurting today. I wish the President knew more of them. He might make a change in the economy and the way he's managing it. [applause]\nREGAN: Thank you Governor Huckabee. Senator Santorum?\nSANTORUM: Well, all he has to do is listen to the Democratic debate and find out how bad the economy is. All they do is complain about the hollowing out of the middle of America, and how America is struggling so badly, and have to make these radical changes in Washington.\nBut they've been in control for the last seven years, and what have we seen? The most important jobs, I believe, in this country are the ones that fill the middle. For the 74% of Americans who don't have a college degree between the age of 25 and 65 are manufacturing jobs. Your governor, and your legislature, and your team here have done an amazing job of bringing manufacturing jobs back to South Carolina. [applause and cheering]\nRight here. Right here in Charleston, right down in the street in Boeing. You've done a great job, and what's happened? You've grown this economy, you've strengthened the center of your state, the middle. That's because you know that if you're really going to create wealth and opportunity, you got to get jobs, and good paying jobs for everybody.\nAnd, so what's happened? Two million jobs, manufacturing jobs, have left this country because of Barack Obama. Regulations, EPA, workplace regulations, things driving people off-shore all because of his number one priority, global climate change.\nWell, let me tell you this, Mr. President. For every dollar of GDP, China creates five times as much pollution as we do here. You want to — lower global climate change, bring those jobs back to America and let American workers do that job with less pollution. [applause]\nSMITH: Thank you, Senator Santorum. Thank you, candidates.\nMoving to the world stage. The middle east is on the brink of chaos. Iran continues to provoke the United States, North Korea claims it's tested a hydrogen bomb, and Afghanistan is in danger of falling back into Taliban hands. Critics of the administration say it's all due to lack of U.S. leadership.\nTo you, Mrs. Fiorina, how do you see America's role in the world today?\nFIORINA: America must lead because when we do not lead, when this exceptional nation does not lead, the world is more dangerous and a more tragic place.\nBarack Obama, Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, they all refuse to lead. Worse, they refuse to respond when this nation is provoked. Hillary Clinton famously asked what difference does it make how four Americans died in Benghazi?\nMrs. Clinton, here's what difference it makes. When you do not stand up and say the truth, that this was a purposeful terrorist attack, when you do not say the United States of America will retaliate for that attack, terrorists assume it's open season.\nWe have refused to respond to every provocation. The President wouldn't even mention the fact that Iran had taken two Navy boats and our sailors — hostage. He didn't mention the fact that they violated the Geneva convention. He didn't respond to the fact that Iran launched two ballistic missile just a short time ago, in direct violation of a deal they had just signed. We didn't respond to the fact that North Korea attacked Sony Pictures.\nWhen we refuse to respond over, and over to provocation and bad behavior, we will get more provocation and bad behavior. I know most of our allies personally. I have met many of our adversaries. I know our military and our intelligence capability, and I know this. When we will not stand with our allies, when we will not respond to our adversaries, when we do not lead in the world the world is a dangerous and tragic place. I will be a Commander in Chief who will lead. [applause]\nREGAN: Thank you. [applause]\nWell, since we've been talking about the Middle East, Senator Santorum, conflicts between Saudi Arabia and Iran have certainly escalated, amid accusations that Saudi Arabia bombed the Iranian Embassy in Yemen after the Saudi Embassy in Tehran was attacked.\nAs we confront an increasingly unstable Middle East, how will you, as president, navigate this administration's promises to Iran while standing by our historic allies in the region?\nSANTORUM: Well, the historic promises that we have made to — to Iran in this agreement need to be torn up on the first day in office of the next president. [applause]\nAnd let me tell you why, because Iran has already torn it up. Iran has not approved the agreement that President Obama has said that they have approved. They have approved a different agreement in their parliament.\nThe fact of the matter is they have violated this agreement. Carly just mentioned some of those violations.\nThey have launched ballistic missiles, tested them, in clear violation.\nAnd here's the pathetic part. The president announced that they were going to impose sanctions. And then President Rouhani went on Twitter and said there would be retaliation.\nAnd what did we do?\nWe backed down.\nLadies and gentlemen, there are 50 some Citadel cadets in this audience tonight. [applause] I would ask them to stand up if they will. And here's what I want to tell each and every one of them, as you stand. Here's what I want to tell them. [applause] Whether it's you're watching that movie this weekend that just came out when we abandoned our men and women in Benghazi, or whether it's we treat Iran, that gave courtesies to our sailors, as they made them record a hostage video, let me tell you this, if you choose to serve this country, I will have your back. I will not let America be trampled upon anymore by these radical jihadists.\nREGAN: Thank you, Senator Santorum. [applause]\nSMITH: Governor Huckabee, in Afghanistan, the Taliban is strengthening. Attacks are on the rise and thousands more civilians have been wounded or killed. Much of the Taliban surge can be attributed to the withdrawal of U.S. forces there.\nYou have expressed skepticism with the war there, saying you see no end game in sight.\nWhat, then, is your solution to the growing conflict there?\nHUCKABEE: Let me put that in context. When I went to Afghanistan, I saw a land that looked like the land of the Flintstones. It was desolate. It was barren. It was primitive.\nAnd it's been that way for thousands of years. They want to take the world back to be just like that.\nWe don't.\nWe need to make a clear goal as to why we want to be anywhere in the Middle East, and I'll tell you why we want to be and need to be, is to destroy radical Islam and everything that threatens civilization. It's not just a threat...[applause]...to Israel or to America, it's a threat to every civilized person on this Earth. And we need to be equipping not only the Kurds in Iraq, we need to be making sure that those who are willing to fight radical Muslims will do it, but we need to never ever spend a drop of American blood unless there is a clearly defined goal and we can't make sure we win unless we have a military that's the strongest in the history of mankind.\nWe've got to rebuild our navy. It's the smallest navy we've had since 1915, when my grandfather got on a destroyer in World War I when he was in the U.S. Navy. We've got young men in Air Force B-52s, one in particular, he's flying a B-52 that his father flew in the '80s and his grandfather flew in the '50s. Those planes are older than me.\nWe've got to have a military that the world is afraid of, use it sparingly, but when we do, the whole world will know that America is on their tail and they will be on their tail on the ground, never ever to rise up again. [applause]\nREGAN: Governor Huckabee, if I could just follow-up with that.\nDo we need to be in Afghanistan?\nHUCKABEE: Only if there is a concerted effort to destroy the advance of radical Islamists who are against us. As far as what are we going to make it look like. Frankly, I don't know what we can make it look like. You can't create for other people a desire for freedom and democracy.\nAnd frankly, that is not the role of the United States. The role of the United States military is not to build schools, it is not to build bridges, it is not to go around and pass out food packets.\nIt is to kill and destroy our enemy and make America safe and that is the purpose we should be there if we're going to be there.\nREGAN: Thank you Governor Huckabee. [applause]\nMs. Fiorina, nearly 600 women say they were attacked in a German city on New Year's Eve by men of Arab or North African descent and 45 percent of those alleged attacks were sexual assaults. Twenty-two of those 32 men arrested so far are asylum-seekers. Are you worried about similar problems in the United States?\nFIORINA: Of course I'm worried about similar problems in the United States. We can not allow refugees to enter this country unless we can adequately vet them and we know we can't. Therefore we should stop allowing refugees into this country. [applause] And by the way, we do not need to be lectured about why we're angry and frustrated and fearful because we've had an illegal immigration problem in this country for 25 years. [applause] And we have every right to be frustrated about the fact that politicians stand up in election after election after election and promise us to fix the problem and yet, it has never been fixed.\nI offer leadership that understands that actions speak louder than words, that results count. We must secure our border. We must fix our broken immigration system. We must enforce a pro-American immigration system that serves our interests, not the rest of the world. I understand what it takes to translate goals into results and that is what I will do as president of the United States. Of course, we should be worried, for heavens sakes.\nThis administration has now told us they don't know who has overstayed a visa. This administration has told us they don't even bother to check Facebook or Twitter to find out who's pledging allegiance to jihadis. We can do better than this, citizens. We need to take our country back. [applause]\nREGAN: I want to stay with you on this. The world shares a common enemy right now in the way of ISIS. Russia, the European Union, Saudi Arabia, Iran, China, we all agree ISIS is a threat and it must be stopped.\nDuring World War II, the world partnered with Joseph Stalin, who was arguably one of the most formidable — despicable figures of the 20th century. But they partnered with him to fight the Nazis.\nToday, everyone seems to agree we need some kind of coalition to fight ISIS. Do you agree with that? And if so, would your coalition include possibly, Russia and Iran?\nFIORINA: We need to be very clear-eyed now about who are our allies and who are our adversaries. In the fight against ISIS, Saudi Arabia is our ally. Iran is our adversary. And despite Donald trump's bromance with Vladmir Putin, Vladmir Putin and Russia are our adversary. We can not...[applause]...we can not outsource leadership in the Middle East to Iran and Russia. We must stand and lead. The Kuwaitis, the Jordanians, the Saudis, Egyptians, Bahrainis, the Emirates, the Kurds. I know virtually all of these nations and their leaders. And they have asked us for very specific kinds of support: bombs, material, arms, intelligence.\nWe are not providing any of it today. I will provide all of it. We have allies who will stand up and help us deny ISIS territory, which is what we must do to defeat them. We must deny them territory. They will help us do this. And yes, we need a coalition.\nBut only in the United States of America can lead such a coalition. I will lead it. But we must be clear-eyed through this fight. Iran is our adversary. Russia is our adversary. We can never outsource our leadership. Only the United States of America can lead to defeat ISIS. I will. [applause]\nREGAN: Ms. Fiorina, thank you.\nSMITH: All right, thank you, candidates. We're just getting started. Jobs, Homeland Security, gun rights, all those issues are coming up straight ahead. We're live from North Charleston and the Republican Presidential Debate. We'll be right back.\n[commercial break]\nREGAN: Welcome back, everyone, to the Republican presidential debate. On to the next round of questions — Sandra.\nSMITH: All right, let's get started. Senator Santorum, to you first. President Obama has urged technology leaders to make it hard for terrorists to use technology to escape from justice. Hillary Clinton says social media companies can help by swiftly shutting down terrorist accounts.\nThe companies say that they're already working with law enforcement and any proposed legislation would do more harm than good. Should companies like Facebook and Twitter be required by law to more actively — be more actively engaged in fighting terror?\nSANTORUM: I would just say that if we were doing a better job within the government, we wouldn't need the private sector to do the things that we're asking them to do. [applause]\nI've had a little experience in this in the private sector myself. And what I found was a government with layers and layers of bureaucracy, of people who had some technical expertise but they had no authority, number one.\nAnd one of the things I found out about in the bureaucracy is if a lot of people have authority, nobody has authority, number one. And number two, that if you don't do anything, you don't get fired.\nIt's only when you do something and something goes wrong, you get fired. So they do nothing. And that's what is happening in our Defense Department right now. We have a capability that they're trying to develop to play defense.\nWe have a lot of technologists that are very skilled. And they're trying to figure out how to play defense. But what we don't have is we don't have folks who are thinking about offense.\nWe don't have war-fighters. We have technologists. Technologists are not war-fighters. Technologists are thinking, how do I protect cyber-security, how do I secure, how do I protect? And we need to have a much more dynamic, how do we — how do we go after them? How do we respond?\nAnd we need leadership that's willing to make sure that when someone attacks us — and ladies and gentlemen, they're attacking us as we speak. They're attacking us all day every day, not just the government, but they're attacking private sector companies all day every day.\nThey have to learn that we're going to pay — they're going to pay a price when they do so.\nAnd then right now, just like in every other aspect of our national security, people who attack us are not paying a price. We need a leader who will make sure that they know when they mess with America, they're going to pay a price.\nSMITH: Senator, would you — would you require anything of those companies like Facebook and Twitter if you were president?\nSANTORUM: Look, Facebook and Twitter can teach us things. We can cooperate with them. We can share ideas and information. But this is a — and this is a very dicey area for the government to go in and require the industry to do its job.\nIt needs to develop that capability. We need to be — have responsible dialogue, but I don't think requirements are the order of the day.\nSMITH: Thank you, Senator. [applause]\nREGAN: Ms. Fiorina, the president has just issued an executive order to expand the gun laws and background checks. And none of you on stage agree with this.\nBut recent polls show the majority of Americans are in favor of universal background checks. [booing]\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not in this room.\nREGAN: It's the poll data.\n[crosstalk]\nFIORINA: And we all believe the polling data all the time, don't we?\nREGAN: So tell me...[applause]...why, in your view, is the president's proposal a problem?\nFIORINA: Oh, it's a problem for so many reasons.\nFirst of all, it is yet another lawless executive order. You see, he doesn't like the fact that Congress has rejected his ideas twice on a bipartisan basis, so he's decided he just gets to override them.\nSorry, Mr. President, not the way \"The Constitution\" works.\nSecondly...[applause]...secondly, he basically admitted in that speech that he hasn't been paying much attention to enforcing the laws we have. He said, gee, we need a few more FBI agents. That would have helped, perhaps, stop a tragedy here in South Carolina with Dylann Roof, a guy who clearly never should have been sold a gun.\nIn other words, Mr. President, you're right, we need to enforce the laws we have. Let's enforce the laws we have. There are criminals running around with guns who shouldn't have them. We don't prosecute any of them. Less than 1 percent.\nBut I want to go back to the technology issue for a moment, if I may, as well, because in this regard, I disagree with Senator Santorum. Look, I come from the technology industry and I can tell you there is one thing that bureaucracies don't know how to do. They do not know how to innovate.\nWe have come seven generations of technology since 2011. We have bureaucracies that are incapable of bringing in that innovation.\nSo, yes, there are some very specific things that we should ask the private sector to help us with, including making sure we have the latest and greatest in algorithms to search through all these databases so that we find terrorists before they attack us, not after it's too late.\nAnd, finally, when a president who understands technology in the Oval Office. Mrs. Clinton, actually, you cannot wipe a server with a towel. [applause]\nREGAN: Ms. Fiorina, you've said that was when you were CEO of HP, you actually worked with the government.\nFIORINA: Yes, and see...\nREGAN: — to try and combat some of these terrorist threats.\nFIORINA: As CEO of Hewlett Packard...\nREGAN: What did you do?\nFIORINA: As CEO of Hewlett Packard, I was asked very specifically for some very real help. The help I was asked to provide, this is now public information. So I am not revealing what — something that was — was classified.\nWe had a very large shipment of equipment, software and hardware, headed to a retail outlet. And I was called by the head of the NSA, who had an urgent need for that capability, to begin laying out a program to track terrorists.\nWe turned that truck around on a highway and it was escorted to the headquarters in San Jose.\nIn World War II, our government went to the private sector and said, help us do things that we cannot do.\nThe private sector has capabilities that the government does not have. There are some legal authorities that are required.\nThe Sony attack could have been detected and repelled, had legal authorities been passed in Congress allowing private networks and public networks to work together.\nThose legal authorities have not yet been passed.\nYes, I was asked to help. [bell rings]\nI know the technology industry. They will help again. But they must be asked by a president who understands what they have.\nREGAN: Ms. Fiorina, thank you. [applause]\nSMITH: All right, Governor Huckabee, you called President Obama's executive orders on gun control unconstitutional and completely insane. [laughter and applause]\nHUCKABEE: [laughing] Yes, I did.\nSMITH: You even told gun store owners to ignore the President's orders. [applause]\nYet, innocent people are dying from gun violence in cities like Detroit, Chicago, and Charleston everyday. Is there anything that can be done at the federal level to prevent guns from falling into the hands of criminals?\nHUCKABEE: Well, why don't we start by making sure the Justice Department never does an idiotic program like Fast and Furious where the U.S. Government put guns...[cheering]...in the hands of Mexican drug lords...[applause]...and end up killing one of our border agents. You know, they want to talk about law abiding citizens, I just find it amazing the President keeps saying the gun show loophole. There is no gun show loophole. I promise you I've been to more gun shows than President Obama.\nSMITH: [laughing]\nHUCKABEE: And, I've bought more weapons at them, and you fill out forms. The President also says things that it's easier to get a gun now than it is to grow trees. Again, I purchase guns, and I can assure you that it is much more difficult to purchase a firearm than it is to get the ingredients of a salad at the supermarket.\nWhat the President keeps pushing are ideas that have never worked. Ideas that would not have stopped San Bernadino, Sandy Hook, Aurora, and at some point you wonder if you keep retrying things that don't work, maybe we should just see if we could resell all those used lottery tickets that didn't work real well because that's the logic of just keep doing the same thing, but something that has failed. Of course, we want to stop gun violence, but the one common thing that has happened in most mass shootings is that they happened in gun- free zones where people who would have been law abiding citizens, who could have stood up and at least tried to stop it and we're not allowed to under the law. [applause]\nSMITH: Thank you, Governor Huckabee.\nREGAN: Governor Huckabee, an American in San Bernardino murdered 14 people while terrorists with Belgian and French passports murdered 130 people. Were facing a threat within our borders, and from outside the United States. Those European terrorists, they could have come here at any time given that we have a visa waiver program that enables people to travel back and forth. It exists within those countries, and 36 others.\nIn countries around the world, including many in Europe, cannot ensure that their citizens are not jihadists, why are we waiving the visa requirement at all?\nHUCKABEE: Well, we shouldn't be and that's one of the reasons that I think there a lot of voices in our country who are saying it's time to relook at the visa program. The European Union is a failure, it's not allowed for even the economic goals that they were trying to achieve.\nBut, what we're not seeing is that it's making Europe less safe, and it's proven not to be exactly what they all thought it was going to be.\nOur first and foremost responsibility in this country, and the first responsibility of the President of the United States is protect America, and protect Americans. We have a President who seems to be more interested in protecting the reputation and image of Islam than he is protecting us. And, I want to be very clear...[applause]...that this President. [cheering]\nMakes comments like he did the other night, that we have to be so careful because we don't want to offend Muslims. He needs to read his own FBI crime stats from last year which would show him that of the hate crimes in the country, over 5,500, about 1,100 were religious hate crimes. And, of those, 58% were directed toward Jews. Only 16% directed toward Muslims.\nMaybe what the President should have talked about the other night is how we ought to be more careful in the anti-semitic comments that are going toward American Jews than toward Muslims because by three times as many...[applause]...they're being targeted for religious hate crime.\nREGAN: If you get the visa waiver program, does that shut down international commerce?\nHUCKABEE: It does not shut down international commerce, but it may slow it down. And, you don't want to slowdown commerce that is making us safer. It's worth it. This lady who came and joined with the San Bernardino killer had passed three background checks, and that's why a lot of Americans didn't buy it when the President said we'll bring in Syrian refugees, but don't worry we'll check them out.\nWe have a lot of confidence in a president who told us that we could keep our doctor, we could keep our health insurance, and cost us less, and now the latest is if you like your gun you can keep it too, and frankly, we don't buy it. We don't believe it. He's lost his credibility, and his inept... [applause]...inability to work with Congress and pass legislation has led him to do what I never even imagined doing as a governor, and that's just going and doing it my own way.\nThat's why we elect a president, is to lead, is to be able to shepherd things through. And if I can do it with a 90 percent Democrat legislature in Arkansas, there is no excuse for any president not being able to lead in Washington if he knows what the heck he is doing when he gets there. [applause]\nREGAN: Thank you, Governor Huckabee.\nSMITH: Senator Santorum, many of our military leaders believe America's critical infrastructure is vulnerable to a terrorist attack. This is the power in our homes, the water we drink, the Internet and phone systems by which we stay connected.\nIf attacked, these essential services that underpin American society could come to a grinding halt. Do you have a specific plan to protect us from this type of attack?\nSANTORUM: Well, the most devastating attack that could occur is an electromagnetic pulse attack, and that would be an attack that would be triggered by a nuclear explosion in the upper atmosphere of our country.\nThe best way to stop that from happening is to make sure that those who contemplating and actually war-gaming and talking about using it, Iran, doesn't get a nuclear weapon so they can't explode that device. [applause] And the president of the United States has put Iran on a path to a nuclear weapon. And we have done nothing to do anything to harden our grid. There is actually a bill in Congress that would put money forward to try to put redundancy and harden our electric grid so it could actually survive an EMP.\nAn EMP is a devastating explosion that sends a pulse that knocks out all electric, everything, everything that is connected to any kind — that is wired, that has a circuit board gets fried out. Everything is gone. Cars stop. Planes fall out of the sky.\nThis is a devastating attack. And this president has done nothing, number one, to take the most probable person to — probable country to launch an attack and stop them, and has done nothing to try to defend us, particularly our electric grid. The bottom line is, I put the original sanctions on the Iranian nuclear program when I was in the United States Senate. I've been fighting for 12 years with one thing in mind, that we must stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. And...[applause]...because they're different than every other country. They do not want a nuclear weapon to defend themselves. They want a nuclear weapon to have theological ends to bring about their mahdi so they can control the world. And that is the most serious threat facing this country right now. [applause]\nSMITH: Senator Santorum, I want to stay with you on this, moving to jobs and the economy. In his State of the Union Address the other night, President Obama touted his record on jobs, citing more than 14 million new jobs and boasted of nearly 900,000 manufacturing jobs added in the past six years.\nDo you dispute his track record of creating jobs?\nSANTORUM: Well, the numbers just don't add up. I mean, they have not added manufacturing jobs. Manufacturing jobs have been lost in this country, 2 million of them. The bottom line is that this president has done more to take jobs away from the hard-working people who are struggling the most.\nAnd that's folks who are, as I said, the 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree. And they're out there talking about, well, we're going to provide free college for everybody. Well, who is going to pay for it? The 74 percent that don't have a college degree.\nThey're not — nobody is focused. Let's just be honest, nobody is focused on the people who are struggling the most in America today. We talk about immigration. Talk about the president's immigration plan. He wants to bring in more and more people into this country. Let people who are here illegally stay in this country.\nAlmost all of the people who are here illegally, and most of the people who came here legally over the last 20 years, they're working in wage-earning jobs. That is why wages have flat-lined.\nAnd we have unfortunately two political parties with most of the candidates in this field for some form of amnesty, some form of allowing people to stay here even though they're here illegally and for increasing levels of legal immigration.\nI'm someone who believes that we need to be the party that stands for the American worker. And when we say we need to send people back, I mean we send people back.\nAnd let me just make one point. I was in Storm Lake, Iowa, the other day, near a Tyson's plant, 91 percent of the kids that go to the elementary school there are minority kids. And they said, well, what are you going to do with all of these people, their families, they've lived here for a long time?\nI said, I'm going to give them a gift. I'm going to give them a gift of being able to help the country they were born in. And I'm going to export America, the education they were able to see. They learned English language. They learned about capitalism. They learned about democracy. You want to stop flow of immigrants?\nLet's send six million Mexicans, Hondurans, Guatemalans, El Savadorians...[bell rings]...back into their country, so they can start a renaissance in their country so they won't be coming over here anymore. [applause]\nREGAN: Senator Santorum, thank you.\nSMITH: Governor Huckabee, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Admiral Mike Mullen, has said the greatest threat to our security is our national debt.\nOur national debt is now on pace to top $19 trillion. Yet, you as well as Ms. Fiorina have laid forward no plan to reform entitlements. How can you say you're going to pay down our country's debt without cutting Social Security or Medicare?\nHUCKABEE: Well, first of all, let's just remember that Social Security is not the government's money, it belongs to the people who had it taken out of their checks involuntarily their entire working lives. [applause]\nFor the government to say, well it is fault of working people that we have a Social Security problem, no. It is the fault of a government that used those people's money for something other than protecting those people's accounts. So let's not blame them and punish them. [applause]\nBut here is a fact, and I sometimes hear Republicans say well, we're going to have to cut this and extend the age. You know what I think a lot of times when I hear people say, well, let's make people work to their 70. That sounds great for white-collar people who sat at a desk most of their lives. You ever talk to somebody that stood on concrete floor for the first 40 years of their working life? Do you think they can stand another five years or 10 years, many of them will retired virtually crippled because they worked hard. And we're going to punish them some more? I don't think so. Here's the fact. [applause]\nFour percent economic growth, we fully fund Social Security and Medicare. Our problem is not that Social Security is just too generous to seniors. It isn't. Our problem is that our politicians have not created the kind of policies that would bring economic growth.\nAnd I still support strongly that we get rid of the 77,000 pages of the monstrous tax code...[applause]...pass the fair tax, supercharge this economy with the rocket fuel that happens with the consumption tax and we don't have to cut Social Security to any senior who has worked their lifetime for it. [applause]\nREGAN: Thank you, Governor Huckabee.\nSMITH: OK. We're going to continue this conversation. We're taking a quick break and then coming up, the candidates' plans for strengthening the middle class. We're live in North Charleston with the Republican Presidential Debate. We'll be right back. [applause]\n[commercial break]\nREGAN: Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate live from North Charleston.\nWe want to jump right back in.\nSandra is kicking it off.\nSMITH: All right, thanks, Trish.\nWell, let's get started with Ms. Fiorina.\nToday, the middle class represents about 50 percent of the U.S. population, down from about 61 percent back in 1971. That's according to Pew Research. The same research revealed a widening income gap in America. The rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer.\nWhat will you do to strengthen a middle class that is no longer the majority?\nFIORINA: For decades, the professional political class in both parties has been talking about the middle class. For decades, Republicans in particular have been talking about reducing the size and scope of government, spending less money, reducing the complexity.\nAnd yet, for 40 years, the government has gotten bigger and more expensive.\nWe now have a 75,000 plus page tax code, although politicians have run for office for decades promising reform. And all the while, middle class incomes have stagnated.\nYou see, when government gets bigger and bigger, more powerful, the rich get richer, the poor get poorer and the middle class gets squeezed.\nWe need to understand who the job creators are in this country, because we need more jobs to grow the middle class and to grow the wages of the middle class.\nWho creates jobs?\nSmall businesses, new businesses, family-owned businesses. [applause] They create two thirds of the new jobs in this country and they employ half the people.\nI started out typing for a nine person real estate firm. My husband Frank started out driving a tow truck for a family-owned auto body shop. And we are crushing small businesses and destroying the middle class.\nSo here's my blueprint to take back America. Let us first actually reform the tax code from 73,000 pages down to three. There's a 20-year-old plan to do exactly that.\nAnd then let us begin piece by piece to focus on every single dollar the government spends, so that we will spend less overall and still have enough for our priorities. And that requires the government to budget the way you do at home — examine every dollar, cut any dollar, move any dollar. The fancy term for that is zero- based budgeting, but I call it common sense.\nCitizens, we've got to take our country back. [applause]\nSMITH: Thank you, Ms. Fiorina. [applause]\nREGAN: Governor Huckabee, you know it used to be you could graduate from high school and get a pretty good job at the local factory, enough to take care of your family and yourself. Those days seem to be gone. It's pretty hard to do that nowadays.\nBusinesses are increasingly turning to automation to increase their productivity levels. It's happening right here, in fact, at the Boeing factory in North Charleston.\nThe president says automation threatens workers' ability to get higher wages.\nDo you agree with that?\nAnd if so, do you have a solution?\nHUCKABEE: Let me go back to the reason so many people are having a hard time getting ahead. The tax system punishes them.\nThink about this. If you work really hard and you start moving up the economic ladder, you get bumped into a different tax bracket. So the government thinks it deserves more of your hard work than you do.\nAnd it's one of the reasons that no matter how many different reforms you have to a tax on people's productivity, you're still taxing their work, their savings. You're taxing their capital gains, inheritance, dividends, you're taxing everything that produces something.\nAnd it's way I really believe it's time to do something bold, not something minute. This is no time for a tap of the hammer, a twist of the screwdriver. It's time for something big. That's why the fair tax transforms our economy. [applause]\nAnd we don't punish workers. It's the only way we're going to get middle class people moving ahead again, because the harder they work, the more they keep. No payroll tax deducted from their checks. They get their entire paycheck. [applause]\nAnd, one of the most important parts, it's built on the common sense with which we raised our kids, and trained dogs. You reward behavior you want more of. And, you punish behavior you want less of. That's how I raise kids, it's how I trained our dogs, and folks, it's not that difficult.\nWe now punish the behavior we say we want more of by taxing it, and we reward the behavior that we say we want less of, so if you make a good investment, we punish you with a tax. If you make a bad investment you can write that off and the rest of the taxpayers will help subsidize you, and bail you out. [applause]\nREGAN: Thank you very much, Governor Huckabee.\nSenator Santorum, 40% of babies born today are born to single moms. That's twice as high as reported back in 1980, and it's 11 times as high as in 1940. Studies show that children are always better off economically, most often — and emotionally, with two parents in a household. From a policy perspective, should the government be doing anything to encourage family formation?\nSANTORUM: You know, we've had this debate about the economy, and we haven't talked the one issue now increasingly even the right, and even the are coming to agreement. I've run around doing 300 town hall meetings talking about a book written by a liberal Harvard sociologist, not a normal thing for me to be talking about, but I now name Robert Putnam who wrote a book called, \"Our Kids\".\nAnd, he wrote this book, I think, ostensibly to support the Democratic argument that the middle of America's hollowing out, and income gap is widening, and rich are getting richer. When he studied all the information as to what was going on, he realized that the biggest reason that we're seeing the hollowing out of the middle of America is the breakdown of the American family.\nThe reality is that if you're a single parent — a child of a single parent, and you grew up in a single parent family neighborhood, you went to that single parent family school, the chance of you ever, ever reaching the top 20% of income earners is 3% in America. At least — I don't know about you, but that's not good enough. And, we have been too politically correct in this country because we don't want to offend anybody to fight for the lives of our children. [applause]\nYou want — You want to be shocked? You read the first few chapters of Mr. — Dr. Putnam' book. He talks about Port Clinton, Ohio and growing up there in the 1950's, and how poor kids actually survived and did well, even though they were poor and disadvantaged. But, then he goes to the towns today and these kids are failing, and failing miserably. They don't even have a shot, and we won't even have the courage to have leadership at the federal level — not with legislation, but the most powerful tool a president have, the bully pulpit to encourage each and everyone of you, churches and businesses, and educators, and community leaders to let's have a national campaign to rebuild the American family, and give every child its birthright which is a Mom and a Dad who loves them.\nThat will change this economy. [cheering and applause]\nREGAN: Thank you.\nSMITH: Thank you, Senator.\nWe're not finished yet. More Republican Presidential Debate in North Charleston after this.\n[commercial break]\nSMITH: Welcome back, it's time for the closing statements. Candidates will each get one minute, starting with Senator Santorum.\nThank you very much, I want to thank the people of Charleston, which has become a little bit of a second home to me, because I am very privileged to have two young men who go to the Citadel here and they're here tonight, my son John and my son Daniel. [applause]\nSANTORUM: Ladies and gentlemen, America is frustrated and angry and looking for someone who's a fighter, but I also think they're looking for someone who's a winner. Somebody who can go out there and take on the establishment and make a difference. And take on someone who's going to be the person who's going to be between a Republican holding the presidency and that's Hillary Clinton.\nAnd there's one person on this stage, one person in the race who's done it and done it repeatedly. I've taken on Hillary Clinton on the issues you care about. Partial-birth abortion.\nGo and google Rick Santorum and Hillary Clinton and there you'll see a five-minute debate. I'll let you decide who won the debate. I'll tell you who won, because we passed the bill and I know I'm out of time but I'm going to take some of Rand Paul's time here for a second. [applause]\nIf you're looking for someone who fought Hillary Clinton on Iran's sanctions, she was one of four who voted — who's deciding vote who voted against Iran's sanctions, so we didn't get it in place as earlier as we should have.\nI've fought battles against her. In 1994, I ran against the Clinton machine. James Carville and Paul Begala, ran the race against me when I took on the author of Hillary care.\nAnd each one of those battles, I won. You want a fighter, you want a winner, I'd appreciate your vote. Thank you. [applause]\nSMITH: Thank you, Senator Santorum. Governor Mike Huckabee.\nHUCKABEE: Well, Rick, I'm pretty sure I did also fight the Clinton machine because every election I was ever in in Arkansas, I assure you, they were behind it, helping finance and campaign for every opponent.\nAnd I share with you the understanding that it's going to be a tough battle. But I spent the first half of my adult life in the private and nonprofit sector, raising a family, understanding how tough it is for people to make it.\nAnd that first half of my life is what led me to believe that America needs a different kind of leadership, not people who spent their whole life running from one office to the next, and living off the government dime. And I got involved because I got sick of what I saw.\nI also believe that there's got to be some leadership that not only addresses the monetary and military issues of this country, but the moral issues of this country. At the end of every political speech, most of us say, God bless America.\nBut how can he do that when we continue to slaughter 4,000 babies a day? [applause]\nAnd I want to be the president that treats every person, including the unborn, as a person. And protect them under the 5th and 14th amendments of the constitution. I close with this word from a gentleman in East Texas named Butel Lucre. He's 100 years old and I met him down in East Texas. And he said this to me. \"I sure wish, Mike, we had the days when The Ten Commandments were in all of our capitals and in every school, and we prayed again.\nYou know, he may be 100 years old, but I believe some of those old ideas to get this country back where we unapologetically get on our knees before we get on our feet might be the best solutions we've ever sought as a country. [applause] And I ask for your support and your vote.\nThank you. [applause]\nSMITH: Thank you, Governor.\nREGAN: Carly Fiorina?\nFIORINA: My husband Frank, that I mentioned, I love spending time with. He's down there. He was real excited the other day because in New Hampshire, he was introduced as my eye candy. [laughter]\nYou know, everybody out there watching knows this. You cannot wait to see the debate between me and Hillary Clinton. You would pay to see that fight. [applause] And that's because you know I will win. And that's important. We've got to start by beating Hillary Clinton.\nAll of my life, I have been told to sit down and be quiet. Settle. Settle. Don't challenge the system.\nThat's what the American people are being told now and we have been told that for way too long — sit down and be quiet about our God, about our guns, about the abortion industry, settle for illegal immigration that's been a problem for decades, as so many of our problems have festered for decades. Accept a system of government and politics that no longer works for us.\nI will not sit down and be quiet. And neither will you.\nSo I ask you to stand with me, fight with me, vote for me, citizens. It is time to take our future back, time to take our politics back. It is time to take our government back. Citizens, it is time. We must take our country back. [applause]\nREGAN: Thank you to all the candidates.

[bell rings] So let's get started. Candidates, jobs and growth — two of the biggest issues facing the country right now. In his State of the Union address earlier this week, the president said, quote, \"we have the strongest, most durable economy in the world.\"\nAnd according to our Facebook research, jobs is one of the biggest issues resonating across the country, including here in South Carolina. The president is touting 14 million new jobs and an unemployment rate cut in half.\nThe president said that anyone who claims America's economy is in decline is peddling fiction. Senator Cruz, what do you see that he doesn't?\nCRUZ: Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.\nLet me start — I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something. Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.\nIn that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran. President Obama's preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei. And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.\nBut the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage. [applause] And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America. [applause]\nNow, on to your substantive question. The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs. And you know, he's right. If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great. The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama. But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977. Median wages have stagnated. And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.\nThe reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.\nBARTIROMO: Thank you, sir. [applause]\nCAVUTO: Governor Kasich, we are not even two weeks into this stock trading year, but [inaudible] investors already lost $1.6 trillion in market value. That makes it the worst start to a new year ever. Many worry that things will get even worse, and that banks and financial stocks are particularly vulnerable.\nNow, if this escalates, like it did back when Barack Obama first assumed the presidency, what actions would you take if this same thing happens all over again just as, in this example, you are taking over the presidency?\nKASICH: Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs. And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt. And our economy was growing like crazy. It's the same thing that I did in Ohio. It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety. It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way. And if you tax cuts — if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the — in the world.\nBut in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline. We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget. And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.\nRight now, you don't have the — you have taxes that are too high. You have regulations — I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses. They are — they're in a position where they're smothering people. And I mean, are you kidding me? We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.\nThose three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise. You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy. And how do I know it? Because I've done it. I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici. And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.\nOur wages are growing faster than the national average. We're running surpluses. And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life. [applause]\nBARTIROMO: We know that recent global events have many people worried — Iran detaining American sailors, forcing them to apologize; North Korea and its nuclear ambitions; an aggressive China; and a Middle East that continues to deteriorate, not to mention ISIS is getting stronger.\nGovernor Christie, sometimes it seems the world is on fire. Where and when should a president use military action to restore order?\nCHRISTIE: Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world. Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama. And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know? [applause]\nThe fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess. The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world. And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.\nLots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood. And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.\nNext, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience. And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right. It's a — it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.\nThe president doesn't understand — and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton — and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight. If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.\nI will not do that. If I'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House. [applause]\nBARTIROMO: Just to be clear Governor, where and when would you use military action?\nCHRISTIE: MIlitary action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world. We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.\nAnd the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either. We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships. It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that. [applause]\nCAVUTO: Governor Bush, the president just told the nation two nights ago that America is back and that the idea that our enemies are getting stronger or that this country is getting weaker, well, it's just rhetoric and hot air. Now other Democrats go even further, sir, saying Republicans even suggesting such comments actually embolden our enemies. I guess they would include you. What do you say?\nBUSH: Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe. The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.\nThink about it. With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists. He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.\nIn the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient. [applause]\nI've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military. In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can't even project force. Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult — we're in a much different position than we should be.\nAnd for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well. Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.\nAs president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military. We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies. [applause]\nCAVUTO: So I take it from that you do not agree with the president.\nBUSH: No. And worse — worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.\nThink about it. She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have — that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess. And that is wrong.\nAnd you know what? Here's the problem. If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now. If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse. We need to stop that. [laughter and applause]\nCAVUTO: Senator Rubio, the president says that ISIS doesn't threaten our national existence like a Germany or a Japan back in World War II, that the terror group is nothing more than twisted souls plotting attacks in their garages.\nBut House Homeland Security Committee recently said that over 1,000 ongoing investigations of homegrown extremism in 50 states. So how do you define the threat? Germany then or dangerous nut cases now?\nRUBIO: Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton. She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States. [applause]\nSomeone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States. Ever. [applause]\nOn the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power. Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size. And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.\nHe doesn't understand the threat in ISIS. He consistently underestimates it but I do not. There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.\nWhen I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS. The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them. And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know. [applause]\nCAVUTO: Thank you, Senator.\nBARTIROMO: Dr. Carson, the president says he does not want to treat ISIS as a foreign army, but ISIS is neither a country nor a government. How do you attack a network that does not respect national borders?\nCARSON: Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on. I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came. [laughter]\nYou know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations. The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before. Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid. And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously. And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.\nI mean, just think about a scenario like that. They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse. They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs. Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point? He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.\nBut here's the real key. We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it. And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished. [applause]\nCAVUTO: Mr. Trump, at the State of the Union, the president pointed to a guest who was a Syrian refugee you might recall whose wife and daughter and other family members were killed in an air attack. Now he fled that country seeking asylum here, ultimately ended up in Detroit where he's now trying to start a new life.\nThe president says that that doctor is the real face of these refugees and not the one that you and some of your colleagues on this stage are painting; that you prefer the face of fear and terror and that you would refuse to let in anyone into this country seeking legitimate asylum. How do you answer that?\nTRUMP: It's not fear and terror, it's reality. You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over. [applause]\nYou look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a — the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow. They're very, very badly wounded. They will — some will follow. And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor — very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.\nThat could be the great Trojan Horse. It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction. When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women? It looked like very few women. Very few children. Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?\nYou look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized — they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15 — going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look — a good strong look and that's what we have. We are nineteen trillion dollars — our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders. We can't do it. [applause]\nBARTIROMO: Senator Cruz, the New York Times is reporting that you failed to properly disclose a million dollars in loans from Goldman Sachs and CitiBank. During your senate race, your campaign said, \"it was inadvertent.\" A million dollars is inadvertent?\nCRUZ: Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times. You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views. The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, \"Anybody But Cruz.\" Had that actually — that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, \"It Follows\" that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.\nSo you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships. Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate — unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars. When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars. He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I, we ended up investing everything we owned.\nWe took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks. And the entire New York times attack — is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing. But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other. But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.\nBARTIROMO: Thank you.\n[commercial break]\nCAVUTO: All right. Welcome back to the Republican presidential , right here in North Charleston, South Carolina. Let's get right back to the questions. And I'll start with you, Senator Cruz.\nNow you are, of course, a strict constitutionalist — no one would doubt that. And as you know, the U.S. Constitution says only natural-born citizens are eligible for the office of president of the United States. Stop me if you've heard this before. Now, you were born...[laughter]... you were born in Canada to an American mother. So you were and are considered an American citizen. But that fellow next to you, Donald Trump — and others — have said that being born in Canada means you are not natural-born, and that has raised questions about your eligibility.\nDo you want to try to close this topic once and for all tonight?\nCRUZ: Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening. [laughter and applause]\nYou know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there. There was nothing to this birther issue. [laughter]\nNow, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed. [laughter]\nBut the poll numbers have. [applause]\nAnd I recognize — I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa. But the facts and the law here are really quite clear. Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.\nIf a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen. That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.\nIf an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen. That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.\nAt the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on — some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.\nUnder that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified. [applause]\nUNKNOWN: Not me.\nCRUZ: Because — because Donald's mother was born in Scotland. She was naturalized. Now, Donald...\nTRUMP: But I was born here.\nCRUZ: ... on the issue — on the issue of citizenship, Donald...\nTRUMP: [inaudible]. Big difference.\nCRUZ: ... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.\nTRUMP: OK, good. Because it wouldn't work.\nCRUZ: You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country. [applause]\nCAVUTO: Mr. Trump...[crosstalk]...that you raised it because of his rising poll numbers.\nTRUMP: ... first of all, let me just tell you something — and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself — NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll — headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down. I mean, so don't — so you can't — you can't...[booing]...they don't like the Wall Street Journal. They don't like NBC, but I like the poll. [laughter]\nAnd frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you. So — you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls. [applause]\nYou don't have to say that. In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.\nNumber two, this isn't me saying it. I don't care. I think I'm going to win fair and square [inaudible] to win this way. Thank you.\nLawrence Tribe and [inaudible] from Harvard — of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this. OK? There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.\nHere's the problem. We're running. We're running. He does great. I win. I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride. I don't like that. OK? [laughter]\nThe fact is — and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field [inaudible]. See, they don't like that. They don't like that. [audience booing]\nNo, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me. [laughter]\nBut — if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit. You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running. And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office? So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide. And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...[crosstalk]\nCAVUTO: Why are you saying this now — right now? Why are you raising this issue now?\nTRUMP: Because now he's going a little bit better. No, I didn't care [inaudible]. It's true. No, it's true. Hey look, he never had a chance. Now, he's doing better. He's got probably a four or five percent chance. [laughter]\n[crosstalk]\nCRUZ: Neil... [crosstalk]\nTRUMP: The fact is, there is a big overhang. There's a big question mark on your head. And you can't do that to the party. You really can't. You can't do that to the party. You have to have certainty. Even if it was a one percent chance, and it's far greater than one percent because [inaudible].\nI mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run. If there was a — and you know I'm not bringing a suit. I promise. But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty. You can't have a question. I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.\nCAVUTO: Senator, do you want to respond?\nCRUZ: Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court. And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.\nTRUMP: You don't have to. Take it from Lawrence Tribe. [applause] [crosstalk]\nTake it from your professors...[crosstalk]\nCRUZ: The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero. And Mr. Trump is very focused...\nTRUMP: He's wrong. He's wrong.\nCRUZ: ... on Larry Tribe. Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is. He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore. He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter. And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...\nTRUMP: He is not the only one.\nCRUZ: ... wants to face Donald Trump in the general election.\nTRUMP: There are many lawyers.\nCRUZ: And I'll tell you what, Donald, you — you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P. slot. [laughter]\nI'll tell you what. If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P. So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.\nTRUMP: No — no...[laughter]... I think if it doesn't... [applause] I like that. I like it. I'd consider it. But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.\nCRUZ: Actually, I'd love to get you to build a wall.\n[crosstalk]\nTRUMP: I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.\n[crosstalk]\nRUBIO: Let me [inaudible]. I was invoked in that question, so let me just say — in that answer — let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV. [laughter]\nBut the real — but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about. OK? Listen, we — this is the greatest country in the history of mankind. But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America. He wants to change America. We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution. He undermines it. We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage. We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.\nThis election has to be about reversing all of that damage. That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders. When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military. And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world. When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.\nBARTIROMO: Thank you, senator.\nMr. Trump, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley in her response to the State of the Union address...[applause]...appeared to choose sides within the party, saying Republicans should resist, quote, \"the siren call of the angriest voices\". She confirmed, she was referring to you among others. Was she out of line? And, how would a President Trump unite the party?\nTRUMP: Okay. First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers. Actually a close friend. And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend. We're friends. That's good. [laughter] But she did say there was anger. And I could say, oh, I'm not angry. I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger. Our military is a disaster. [applause]\nOur healthcare is a horror show. Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it. We have no borders. Our vets are being treated horribly. Illegal immigration is beyond belief. Our country is being run by incompetent people. And yes, I am angry. [applause] And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry. And I say that to Nikki. So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended. She said the truth.\nOne of your colleagues interviewed me. And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she's right. I'm not fighting that. I didn't find it offensive at all. I'm angry because our country is a mess. [applause]\nBARTIROMO: But what are you going to do about it?\nCAVUTO: Marco Rubio. I'm sorry, it's the time constraints. You and Governor Christie have been exchanging some fairly nasty words of late, and I will allow the governor to respond as well.\nThe governor went so far to say, you won't be able to slime your way to the White House. He's referring to a series of ads done by a PAC, speaking on your behalf, that say quote,\"One high tax, Common Core, liberal, energy-loving, Obamacare, Medicaid-expanding president is enough. You think you went too far on that and do you want to apologize to the governor?\nRUBIO: You know, as I said already twice in this , we have a very serious problem in this country. [applause] We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...\nCAVUTO: That is not my question.\nRUBIO: Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil. He is — this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government. This president is undermining our military. He is undermining our standing in the world. I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core. [applause]\nWe can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control. This president, this president is more interested in funding — less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned — he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.\nChris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood. All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country. It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.\nBecause the damage he has done to America is extraordinary. Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America. We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.\nSo I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage. No one is a socialist. No one here is under FBI investigation. So we have a good group of people.\nCAVUTO: Is he a liberal?\nRUBIO: Our next president...\nCAVUTO: Is he a liberal?\nRUBIO: Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood. Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.\nCAVUTO: Governor? [applause]\nCHRISTIE: I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.\nIt appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too. [laughter]\nSo the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then. So let's set the facts straight. First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor. Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.\nThird, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban. I have vetoed a reduction this clip size. I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.\nAnd on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey. So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator. See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk. And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.\nWhen you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do. And the people of New Jersey, I've seen it. [applause]\nCHRISTIE: And the last piece is this. I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed. That was before he was running against me. Now that he is, he's changed his tune.\nI'm never going to change my tune. I like Marco Rubio. He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be. [applause]\nBUSH: Neil, my name was mentioned here. Neil, my name was mentioned as well.\nHere's the deal, Chris is totally right. He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.\nEverybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton. And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be — this is not being bad.\nThese attack ads are going to be part of life. Everybody just needs to get used to it. Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster. [applause]\nOur country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.\nAnd so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the — the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.\nCARSON: Neil, I was mentioned too.\nCAVUTO: You were?\nCARSON: Yeah, he said everybody. [laughter]\nAnd — and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we — and when I say we, Republicans — tore themselves apart.\nYou know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it. And we got to look at the big picture here.\nBARTIROMO: Governor Kasich...[applause]... Governor Kasich, Hillary Clinton is getting some serious competition from Senator Bernie Sanders. He's now at 41 percent in the latest CBS/New York Times poll. Vice President Biden sang his praises, saying Bernie is speaking to a yearning that is deep and real, and he has credibility on it.\nSo what does it say about our country that a candidate who is a self-avowed socialist and who doesn't think a 90 percent tax rate is too high could be the Democratic nominee?\nKASICH: Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee. That's not even an issue. But look...[applause]...and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States. So here's this — the situation, I think, Maria.\nAnd this is what we have to — I — I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise — and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years — it's very, very difficult for them.\nPart of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need. Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in — in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.\nPeople are upset about it. I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn. Do we have answer for that? We do. There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.\nI'll tell you what else people are concerned about. Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job. We got to do a lot about the high cost of high — higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay. [applause]\nLet me tell you that, in this country — in this country, people are concerned about their economic future. They're very concerned about it. And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to — keeping them from getting it.\nThat's not the America that I've ever known. My father used to say, \"Johnny, we never — we don't hate the rich. We just want to be the rich.\" And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.\nAnd we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America — and I mean everybody in America — having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.\nI'm president — look, I've done it once. I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes. The economy was really booming.\nAnd now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the — than the national average. A growth of 385,000 jobs.\n[bell rings]\nIt's not that hard. Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts. Get it done, because our — our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done. And, folks, we will. You count on it.\nBARTIROMO: Dr. Carson, one of the other candidates on this stage has brought Bill Clinton's past indiscretions. Is that a legitimate topic in this election? And what do you think of the notion that Hillary Clinton is an enabler of sexual misconduct?\nCARSON: Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means. But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore? Do we still have standards? Do we still have values and principles?\nYou know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society. You know, we have a war on virtual everything — race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars. Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.\nYou know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section — you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names. Where did that spirit come from in America? It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that. And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong. And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.\nThe majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great. They've been beaten into submission. It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in. [applause]\nCAVUTO: Well, we are not done. Coming up, one of the top things people are talking about on Facebook, guns. And you can join us live us on this stage in the conversation during this commercial break right from home. You can go to Facebook.com/[inaudible]. We will be streaming live and talking about how we think the  is going so far.\nWe're back in a moment in Charleston, South Carolina.\n[commercial break]\nBARTIROMO: Welcome back to the Republican presidential debates, right here in North Charleston. Let's get right back to the questions.\nGovernor Bush, gun rights, one of the top issues seen on Facebook with close to 3 million people talking about it in the past month. Right here in Charleston, Dylann Roof, who has been accused of killing nine people in a nearby church, reportedly had not passed his background check when he got his gun. What is the harm in tightening standards for not only who buys guns, but those who sell them?\nBUSH: First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the — [applause] — the Emanuel AME church killings. And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed. [applause] I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place. Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake. The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.\nWe don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job. Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not — would not have passed a background check. The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.\nThat's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is. It isn't law-abiding gun owners.\nLook, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away. You're going away for a long, long while.\nAnd that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities. Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.\nThe other issue is mental health. That's a serious issue that we could work on. Republicans and Democrats alike believe this. [applause] The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have. Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns. [applause]\nBARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.\nMr. Trump, are there any circumstances that you think we should be limiting gun sales of any kind in America?\nTRUMP: No. I am a 2nd amendment person. If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.\nIf even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead. So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.\nWe have a huge mental health problem in this country. We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money. We have to get back into looking at what's causing it. The guns don't pull the trigger. It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on. [applause]\nWe have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order. He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress. You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation. He just writes out an executive order. Not supposed to happen that way. [applause]\nBARTIROMO: Thank you sir.\nTRUMP: You get the Congress. You get the Senate. You get together. You do legislation. He just writes out an order, executive order. It's not supposed to happen that way. [applause]\nBARTIROMO: Thank you, sir. [applause]\nCAVUTO: Senator Rubio, you said that President Obama wants to take people's guns away. Yet under his presidency, gun sales have more than doubled. That doesn't sound like a White House unfriendly to gun owners.\nRUBIO: That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away. [applause]\nLook, the Second Amendment is not an option. It is not a suggestion. It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families. I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would. I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would. I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.\nI have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.\nHere's my second problem. None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive. You know why? Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show. They don't buy their guns from a collector. And they don't buy their guns from a gun store. They get — they steal them. They get them on the black market.\nAnd let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show. These...[laughter and applause]... his answer — you name it. If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control. Here's a fact. We are in a war against ISIS. They are trying to attack us here in America. They attacked us in Philadelphia last week. They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago. And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.\nWhen I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does. [applause]\nCAVUTO: But what fact can you point to, Senator — what fact can you point to that the president would take away everyone's gun? You don't think that's [inaudible]?\nRUBIO: About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns. He has never defended...[crosstalk]...I'll give you a fact. Well, let me tell you this. Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, \"These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion.\" That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.\nThis president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment. [applause]\nHe doesn't meet — here's the difference. When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not \"how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans.\" It's \"give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns.\" That will never happen when I am president of the United States. [applause]\nCAVUTO: Governor Christie, you, too, have criticized the president's recent executive action on gun control, saying it's unconstitutional, another step to bypass Congress. But hasn't your own position on guns evolved, sir? The New Jersey Star-Ledger reports that you signed several laws to regulate the possession of firearms, and that you argued back in August 2013, and I quote, \"These common sense measures will strengthen New Jersey's already tough gun laws.\"\nSo isn't that kind of what the president wants to do now?\nCHRISTIE: No, absolutely not. The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people. And the fact is that that's not a democracy. That's a dictatorship. And we need to very, very concerned about that.\nSee, here's the thing. I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident. I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat. I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.\nThe fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit. We have made it easier to do that, not harder. And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not by signing unconstitutional executive orders. This guy is a petulant child. That's what he is. I mean, you know...[applause]... the fact is, Neil, let's think about — let's think about — and I want to maybe — I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.\nMr. President, we're not against you. We're against your policies. When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate. You had only 21 Republican governors in this country. And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.\nThe American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it. That's not right. It's not constitutional. And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall. [applause]\nBARTIROMO: So what is the answer, Senator Cruz, to stop mass shootings and violent crime, up in 30 cities across the country?\nCRUZ: The answer is simple. Your prosecute criminals. You target the bad guys. You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do — done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?\nWell, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general. Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns. He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.\nHe launched Fast and Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials. And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters — the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.\nThere were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.\nAnd I'll note that California senator — Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, \"give me your guns, I'm rounding them up,\" she would.\nAnd let me make a final point on this. Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment. Unless you are clinically insane...[laughter]...that's what you say in a primary. But the voters are savvier than that. They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words. I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.\nThere's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race. There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...[bell rings]...and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans — we defeated that gun control legislation.\nAnd I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.\nBARTIROMO: Senator...[applause]... let me follow up and switch gears. Senator Cruz, you suggested Mr. Trump, quote, \"embodies New York values.\" Could you explain what you mean by that?\nCRUZ: You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are. [laughter]\nBARTIROMO: I am from New York. I don't.\nCRUZ: What — what — you're from New York? So you might not. [laughter]\nBut I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do. [applause]\nAnd listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York. But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.\nAnd — and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked — my friend Donald has taken to it as advance playing Bruce Springsteen's \"Born in the USA\", and I was asked what I thought of that.\nAnd I said, \"well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?\" And — and — you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.\nNot too many years ago, Donald did a long interview with Tim Russert. And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views he's describing now.\nAnd his explanation — he said, \"look, I'm from New York, that's what we believe in New York. Those aren't Iowa values, but this is what we believe in New York.\" And so that was his explanation.\nAnd — and I guess I can — can frame it another way. Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan. I'm just saying. [laughter]\nBARTIROMO: Are you sure about that?\nCAVUTO: Maria...\nTRUMP: So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand. [applause]\nAnd just so — if I could, because he insulted a lot of people. I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made — New York is a great place. It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people.\nWhen the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York. You had two one hundred...[applause] ...you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down. I saw them come down. Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction. I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.\nAnd the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death — nobody understood it. And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.\nAnd we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers. And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made. [applause]\nCAVUTO: Governor bush, for the third time in as many months, the Iranians have provoked us, detaining us, as we've been discussing, with these 10 Navy sailors Tehran had said strayed into their waters. The sailors were released, but only after shown on video apologizing for the incident. This occurring only weeks after Iran fired multiple rockets within 1,500 yards of a U.S. aircraft carrier and then continued to test medium range missiles.\nNow you've claimed that such actions indicate Tehran has little to fear from a President Obama. I wonder, sir, what would change if they continued doing this sort of thing under a President Jeb Bush?\nBUSH: Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military. Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again. It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.\nThe deployments are too high for the military personnel. We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment. The B-52 is still operational as the long range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman. The planes are older than the pilots. We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.\nWe have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.\nSecondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board. We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.\nThirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel...[applause]...and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.\nWe need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations. The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak. This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran. We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country. [applause]\nCAVUTO: Thank you, Governor. Governor Kasich, while everyone has been focusing on Iran's provocations, I'm wondering what you make of what Saudi Arabia has been doing and its recent moves in the region, including its execution of a well-known Shi'ite cleric and its move to dramatically increase oil production, some say in an effort to drive down oil prices and force a lot of U.S. oil producers out of business.\nSure enough, oil prices have tumbled. One brokerage house is predicting a third or more of American oil producers and those heavily invested in fracking will go bankrupt, and soon Saudi Arabia and OPEC will be back in the driver's seat. U.S. energy player Harold Hamrie similarly told me with friends like these, who needs enemies? Do you agree?\nKASICH: Well, let me — let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience. I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina. Let em also tell you...[applause]...that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense. And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems. So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.\nWith Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.\nWe're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country. And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.\nIn terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses. That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way. And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them. [applause]\nSo look, in foreign policy — in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool. You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go. And I'm going to tell you, that it — I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.\nI've seen so much of it – a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War. You see what the Saudi's — deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us. And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.\nThank you.\nCAVUTO: Thank you John.\nBARTIROMO: There's much more ahead including the fight against ISIS. More from Charleston, South Carolina when we come right back.\n[commercial break]\nBARTIROMO: We welcome back to the Republican Presidential , right back to the questions.\nCandidates, the man who made fighting ISIS the cornerstone of his campaign, South Carolina Senator, Lindsey Graham is out the race but he joins us tonight in the audience. [applause]\nHe says, \"the air-strike now in their 16th month have been ineffective.\" Dr. Carson ...\nCARSON: Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?\nBARTIROMO: The air-strikes.\nCARSON: OK.\nBARTIROMO: Now in their 16th month are ineffective. Dr. Carson, do you think Senator Graham is right in wanting to send 20,000 troops — ground troops to Iraq and Syria to take out ISIS?\nCARSON: Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.\nI think we need to do a lot more than we're doing. Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.\nThe way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, \"what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?\"\nOur decision is, then, do we give them what we need. I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.\nIn addition to that...[applause]...in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue. You know, some of these — these engagement rules that the administration has — \"we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it\" — give me a break.\nJust tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them. So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed. You know, that's so simple. [applause]\nAnd then we need to shut down — we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers. Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?\nWe know to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go. They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us. [applause]\nBARTIROMO: Thank you, sir. Senator Graham has also said that the U.S. will find Arab support for its coalition if it removes Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. And I quote, \"The now king of Saudi Arabia told us, 'you can have our army, you just got to deal with Assad.'\n\"The emir of Qatar said, 'I'll pay for the operation, but they are not going to fight ISIS and let Damascus fall into the hands of the Iranians. Assad has to go.'\"\nGovernor Christie, how important is it to remove Assad from power and how would you do it?\nCHRISTIE: Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot. You think about it — this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state — drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.\nHe used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing. In fact, he's done worse than nothing.\nThis president — and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer — she called Assad a reformer. Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?\nWe have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad. The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace — we are not going to have peace in Syria. We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.\nThe Syrians should stay in Syria. They shouldn't be going to Europe. And here's the last piece...[applause]...you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge. You're simply not. And so Senator Graham is right about this.\nAnd if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.\nAnd believe me, Assad is not worth it. And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.\nHillary Clinton cannot be president. It will lead to even greater war in this world. And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.\nThat makes the world less peaceful, less safe. In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.\nBARTIROMO: Thank you, sir. [applause]\nMr. Trump — Mr. Trump, your comments about banning Muslims from entering the country created a firestorm. According to Facebook, it was the most-talked-about moment online of your entire campaign, with more than 10 million people talking about the issue.\nIs there anything you've heard that makes you want to rethink this position?\nTRUMP: No. [laughter] No. [applause]\nLook, we have to stop with political correctness. We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the — with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.\nI just left Indonesia — bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.\nWe have to find out what's going on. I said temporarily. I didn't say permanently. I said temporarily. And I have many great Muslim friends. And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, \"Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it.\"\nAnd unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason. And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem. My Muslim friends, some, said, \"thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it.\"\nBut we have a serious problem. And we can't be the stupid country any more. We're laughed at all over the world. [applause]\nBUSH: Donald, Donald — can I — I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS. The Kurds are our strongest allies. They're Muslim. You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?\nThe other Arab countries have a role to play in this. We cannot be the world's policeman. We can't do this unilaterally. We have to do this in unison with the Arab world. And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria. [applause]\nSo I hope you'll reconsider. I hope you'll reconsider. The better way of dealing with this — the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the — Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.\nWhat we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder — make the screening take place.\nWe don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously? What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?\nCAVUTO: But you said — you said that he made those comments and they represented him being unhinged after he made them.\nBUSH: Yeah, they are unhinged.\nCAVUTO: Well — well, after he made them...[applause]...his poll numbers went up eight points in South Carolina. Now — now, wait...\nTRUMP: Eleven points, to be exact.\nCAVUTO: Are you — are you saying — are you saying that all those people who agree with Mr. Trump are unhinged?\nBUSH: No, not at all, absolutely not. I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically. I totally get that. But we're running for the presidency of the United States here. This isn't — this isn't, you know, a different kind of job. You have to lead. You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.\nEvery time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength. And so it was [inaudible] his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views. [applause]\nTRUMP: I want security for this country. OK? [applause]\nI want security. I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot. I want security for this country. We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam. We have a tremendous problem. It's not only a problem here. It's a problem all over the world.\nI want to find out why those two young people — those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them — people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them. I want to find out — many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment. Why weren't they vigilant? Why didn't they call? Why didn't they call the police?\nAnd by the way, the police are the most mistreated people in this country. I will tell you that. [applause]\nThe most mistreated people. In fact, we need to — wait a minute — we need vigilance. We have to find out — many people knew about what was going on. Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?\nThere's something going on and it's bad. And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it. That's all I'm saying. We need security.\nBARTIROMO: We — we want to hear from all of you on this. According to Pew Research, the U.S. admits more than 100,000 Muslim immigrants every single year on a permanent lifetime basis. I want to ask the rest of you to comment on this. Do you agree that we should pause Muslim immigration until we get a better handle on our homeland security situation, as Mr. Trump has said?\nBeginning with you, Governor Kasich.\nKASICH: I — I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees. And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them. But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.\nAnd I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago. If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states. We need Jordan.\nWe need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.\n[bell rings]\nIt was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again. And if we try to put everybody in the same — call everybody the same thing, we can't do it. And that's just not acceptable.\nBut I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.\nBARTIROMO: Thank you, sir, we want to hear from the rest of you,\nGovernor Christie, your take.\nCHRISTIE: Now Maria, listen. I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind. And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe. That's the end of the conversation.\nI can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue. Here's the way you need to deal with it. You can't just ban all Muslims. You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists. You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.\nThe only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.\n[bell rings]\nAnd this summer, we didn't do that. We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president. Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.\nBARTIROMO: Senator Rubio, where do you stand?\nRUBIO: Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this  and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue. Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.\nIf you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck. They are much more than that. This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.\nThis is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region. This is not some small scale group.\nThey are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world. So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president. If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America. [applause]\nBARTIROMO: Senator Cruz, where do you stand? Senator Cruz?\nCRUZ: You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.\nI think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism. What should we do? First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport. [applause]\nAnd secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...[bell rings]...that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory. Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.\nIf I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida. When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS [applause].\nBARTIROMO: Dr. Carson, where do you stand? Do you agree with Mr. Trump?\nCARSON: Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem. But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics. And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.\nThat is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that. And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place. They have infrastructure. All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.\nAnd that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November. Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.\nBARTIROMO: So, to be clear, the both of you do not agree with Mr. Trump?\nBUSH: So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies — that we need to build better relationships with? Of course not. What we need to do is destroy ISIS.\nI laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a \"No Fly Zone\" and \"Safe Zones\" to make sure refugees are there. We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria. We need to embed with — with the Iraqi military. We need to arm the Kurds the directly. We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.\nWe need the lawyers off the back of the war fighters. That's how you solve the problem. You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.\nBARTIROMO: Thank you governor.\nCAVUTO: Mr. Trump, sometimes maybe in the heat of the campaign, you say things and you have to dial them back. Last week, the New York Times editorial board quoted as saying that you would oppose, \"up to 45 percent tariff on Chinese goods.\"\nTRUMP: That's wrong. They were wrong. It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.\nCAVUTO: Well...\nTRUMP: They were wrong.\nCAVUTO: You never said because they provided that...\nTRUMP: No, I said, \" I would use — \" they were asking me what to do about North Korea. China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control — just about, of North Korea. They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.\nThey say, \" well, we don't really have control.\" Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat. China is ripping us on trade. They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies. Thousands of thousands — you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost — 50,000 because of China.\n[crosstalk]\nCAVUTO: So they've never said to put a tariff on their...\nTRUMP: We've lost anywhere between four and seven million jobs because of China. What I said then was, \"we have very unfair trade with China. We're going to have a trade deficit of 505 billion dollars this year with China.\" A lot of that is because they devalue their currency.\nWhat I said to the New York Times, is that, \"we have great power, economic power over China and if we wanted to use that and the amount — where the 45 percent comes in, that would be the amount they saw their devaluations that we should get.\" That we should get.\nWhat I'm saying is this, I'm saying that we do it but if they don't start treating us fairly and stop devaluing and let their currency rise so that our companies can compete and we don't lose all of these millions of jobs that we're losing, I would certainly start taxing goods that come in from China. Who the hell has to lose 505 billion dollars a year?\nCAVUTO: I'm sorry, you lost me.\nTRUMP: It's not that complicated actually.\nCAVUTO: Then I apologize. Then I want to understand, if you don't want a 45 percent tariff, say that wasn't the figure, would you be open — are you open to slapping a higher tariff on Chinese goods of any sort to go back at them?\nTRUMP: OK, just so you understand — I know so much about trading about with China. Carl Icahn today as you know endorsed. Many businessmen want to endorse me.\nCAVUTO: I know...\nTRUMP: Carl said, \"no, no — \" but he's somebody — these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this. If these are the kinds of people — we should use our best and our finest.\nNow, on that tariff — here's what I'm saying, China — they send their goods and we don't tax it — they do whatever they want to do. They do whatever what they do, OK. When we do business with China, they tax us. You don't know it, they tax us.\nI have many friends that deal with China. They can't — when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed. If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal — so we don't have an equal playing field. I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.\nI'm a free trader. I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate. I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine. I sell tens' of millions of [inaudible].\nI love China. I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.\nCAVUTO: So you're open to a tariff?\nTRUMP: I'm totally open to a tariff. If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed. You can't deal in China without tariffs. They do it to us, we don't it. It's not fair trade.\nKASICH: Neil, Neil — can I say one thing about this. I'm a free trader. I support NAFTA. I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China. And we do need China — Donald's right about North Korea.\nI mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials. But what he's touching — talking about, I think has got merit. And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...\nTRUMP: I'm happy to have him tonight...[laughter]\nKASICH: For too long — no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us. And guess what? The worker's out of a job.\nSo when they — be found against that country that's selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker? Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.\nI think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade. And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need — we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.\nAnd I want to just suggest to you. How do I know this? Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar. And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load. So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country. That's what I think we need to do. [applause]\nCAVUTO: All right.\nRUBIO: But on this point, if I may add something on this point. We are all frustrated with what China is doing. I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.\nChina doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff. If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there's a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.\nSo I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.\nIt begins with tax reform. Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world. Let's allow companies to immediately expense. [applause]\nIt continues with regulatory reform. Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.\nHow about Obamacare, a certified job killer? It needs to be repealed and replaced. And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger. That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.\nTRUMP: Neil, the problem...\nBARTIROMO: We're getting...\nTRUMP: ... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long. It would just — you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money. We just can't do it any longer.\nCAVUTO: He is right. If you put a tariff on a good, it's Americans who pay.\nBUSH: Absolutely.\nTRUMP: You looking at me?\nBUSH: Yeah.\nBARTIROMO: Prices go higher for...\nTRUMP: Can I tell you what? It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up. They're never going to let it happen.\nJapan, the same thing. They are devaluing — it's so impossible for — you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu. Kamatsu is a tractor company in Japan. Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu tractors now because they've de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can't buy a Caterpillar tractor. And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.\nAnd that's why we have to use Carl and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys. [applause]\nBUSH: Here's — apart from the — apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.\nBARTIROMO: Yeah.\nBUSH: So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes — the equivalent of it goes to China. Or how about Boeing right here within a mile? Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn't retaliate and start buying Airbus? Of course, they would. This would be devastating for the economy. We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.\nBARTIROMO: Real quick, Senator — go ahead, Senator Cruz. [applause]\nAnd then we have to get to tax reform.\nTRUMP: And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK? Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb — I tell you what, we don't need that.\nAUDIENCE: Boo.\nTRUMP: We don't need that. That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that. And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now. And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look. They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China. They don't want them made here. They want those planes made in China.\nBUSH: They're a mile away from here.\nTRUMP: That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.\nBARTIROMO: Thank you, Governor Bush. Thank you, Mr. Trump. Very briefly.\nBUSH: My name was mentioned. My name was mentioned here. The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China. You can — if you — you flew in with your 767, didn't you? Right there, right next to the plant.\nTRUMP: No, the new planes. I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.\nBARTIROMO: Thank you, Mr. Trump.\nBUSH: When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...\nBARTIROMO: Thank you, Mr. Trmup. Thank you, Governor.\nTRUMP: I'll check for you.\nBUSH: Check it out. [laughter]\nBARTIROMO: Senator briefly.\nCRUZ: Thanks for coming back to me, Maria. Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground. Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.\nYou know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere. They discussed how — how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers. They're protectionist.\nBut Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.\nSo the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...[applause]...and here's the critical point, Maria — the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.\nIt's tax-free — a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers — and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax. It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.\nThe business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...[bell rings]...tariffs that come against us. It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...\nUNKNOWN: Maria...\nCRUZ: ... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.\n[crosstalk]\nBARTIROMO: We've got to get to tax reform, gentlemen. We've got to get to tax reform, and we've got to get to the...\nUNKNOWN: Yeah, but I want to talk about taxes.\nBARTIROMO: ... we've got to get to the national debt as well. Coming up next, the growing national debt, the war on crime, tax reform. More from North Charleston, South Carolina, when we come right back.\n[commercial break]\nBARTIROMO: Welcome back to the Republican presidential  here in North Charleston. Right back to the questions. [applause]\nGovernor Christie, we have spoken much about cutting spending, given the $19 trillion debt. But according to one report, America needs $3.6 trillion in infrastructure spending by 2020.\nHere in South Carolina, 11 percent of bridges are considered structurally deficient, costing drivers a billion dollars a year in auto repairs. What is your plan to fix the ailing roads and bridges without breaking the bank?\nCHRISTIE: Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria. Here's — here's our plan. We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.\nIf you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world — and we double tax, as you know.\nAnd what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax. And who can blame them? They pay tax once overseas. They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.\nSo beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given — bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.\nBring the money — the $2 trillion — back to the United States. We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money. And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.\nIt would not necessitate us raising any taxes. It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about. And — and — and the last piece of this, Maria, is this. You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America. He's penalized — and doesn't understand. In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.\nYou've seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the Obama administration. That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country. We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.\nAnd remember this — I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history. We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.\nWe need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.\nAll of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.\nBARTIROMO: Thank you, sir. Dr. Carson...[applause]...it is true U.S. companies have $2 trillion in cash sitting overseas right now. That could be used for investment and jobs in America.\nAlso, several companies right now are pursuing mergers to move their corporate headquarters abroad, and take advantage of much lower taxes. What will you do to stop the flow of companies building cash away from America, and those leaving America altogether?\nCARSON: Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed. A flat tax for everybody — no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.\nYou know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money. You know, I — my — my mother taught me this. You know, she only had a third-grade education, but — you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.\nI mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car. In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation. But...[laughter]... you know, the — the — the fact of the matter is — you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations — because every regulation is a tax, it's a — on goods and services. And it's the most regressive tax there is.\nYou know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up — you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that. A rich person does not. Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.\nAnd everything is costing more money, and we are killing our — our — our people like this. And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.\nIt's not the evil rich people. It's the evil government that is — that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive. [applause]\nBARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.\nSenator Rubio...\nTRUMP: Maria — Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion. It's one of the biggest problems our country has. Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs — leave them behind.\nThey're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in. But they can't get along. They can't even make a deal.\nHere is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal. We have to do something. Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have. So many companies are going to leave our country.\nBARTIROMO: Which is why we raised it.\nSenator Rubio?\nThank you, Mr. Trump.\nTRUMP: Thank you.\nBARTIROMO: One of the biggest fiscal challenges is our entitlement programs, particularly Social Security and Medicare. What policies will you put forward to make sure these programs are more financially secure?\nRUBIO: Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes. [applause]\nHere is the one thing I'm not going to do. I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan. It's called the value added tax. And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.\nWhere basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.\nAnd that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said. Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.\nNow, you can support one now that's very low. But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors. Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job. And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.\nWhen I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax. [applause]\nBARTIROMO: Thank you senator.\nCRUZ: Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.\nBARTIROMO: Senator Cruz, yes. You were meant to. Yes, of course.\nCRUZ: Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat. A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.\nThis is a business flat tax. It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax. It goes away. It enables us to eliminate the death tax.\nIf you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone. We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes. And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.\nMine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent. Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent. My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS. Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity. We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...[bell rings]...the mandates and have a simple flat tax. The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan. I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.\nBARTIROMO: Thank you senator. [applause]\nRUBIO: But that's not an accurate description of the plan. Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax. Someone's going to be collecting this tax.\nIn fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found? That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.\nThe second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax. Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make. They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.\nSo there are people watching tonight in business. If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from? You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.\nAnd that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold. You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government. Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at. But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...[bell rings]...and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent. Now, you've got Europe.\n[crosstalk]\nBARTIROMO: Thank you senator. I have to get to a question for Mr. Trump.\nCRUZ: Maria...\nBARTIROMO: Yes.\nCRUZ: Maria, I'd just like to say...[crosstalk]\nCHRISTIE: Maria, I'd like to interrupt this  on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements. Do you remember that, everybody? This was a question on entitlements.\nAnd the reason — and the reason...[crosstalk]...no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it. Here's the thing. [crosstalk] The fact is, the reason why...\nRUBIO: If you'll answer the [inaudible] core question.\nCHRISTIE: ... the fact is — the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard. It's a hard problem. And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this — avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.\nBecause what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes. Bernie Sanders has already said it. And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.\nWe have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress — this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund. A Republican Congress did that.\nAnd the fact is it was wrong. And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security. We need to reform Social Security. Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.\nBARTIROMO: Thank you, Governor. Thank you, Governor. [applause]\nCARSON: Can I just add one very quick thing? And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan. And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best. Just want to get that out there, just saying.\nBARTIROMO: Thank you, Dr. Carson.\nComing up, how would the candidates protect America, and another terror attack, if we were to see it. But first, you can join us live on stage during the commercial break right from home. Go to facebook.com/foxbusiness. We'll be streaming live and answering your questions during this break next.\nMore from South Carolina coming up. Stay with us.\n[commercial break]\nBARTIROMO: Mr. Trump, your net worth is in the multi-billions of dollars and have an ongoing thriving hotel and real estate business. Are you planning on putting your assets in a blind trust should you become president? With such vast wealth, how difficult will it be for you to disentangle yourself from your business and your money and prioritize America's interest first?\nTRUMP: Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company. As you too know, I know I built a very great company. But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company. It's peanuts.\nI want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again. I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there. Run the company kids, have a good time. I'm going to do it for America.\nSo I would — I would be willing to do that.\nBARTIROMO: So you'll put your assets in a blind trust?\nTRUMP: I would put it in a blind trust. Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it. If that's a blind trust, I don't know. But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.\nBARTIROMO: Thank you sir.\nTRUMP: Thank you.\nCAVUTO: Governor Christie, going back to your U.S. Attorney days, you had been praised by both parties as certainly a tough law and order guy. So I wonder what you make of recent statistics that showed violent crimes that have been spiking sometimes by double digit ratings in 30 cities across the country. Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn said, \"most local law enforcement officials feel abandoned by Washington.\" Former NYC Police Chief Ray Kelly, says that, \"police are being less proactive because they're being overly scrutinized and second guessed and they're afraid of being sued or thrown in jail.\"\nWhat would you do as president to address this?\nCHRISTIE: Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey. He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan. He said, \"there's a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country.\" Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.\nThat's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president. Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to — remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time. This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.\nNow, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey. I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country. That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws. And this president turns his back — this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.\nAnd he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal. This president allows lawlessness throughout this country. Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General. I'd say, \"General, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively. Make our streets safe again. Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them.\"\nWe do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well. I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.\nCAVUTO: Thank you governor.\nGovernor Kasich, as someone has to deal with controversial police shootings in your own state, what do you make of Chicago's move recently to sort of retrain police? Maybe make them not so quick to use their guns?\nKASICH: Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat. She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.\nAnd they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.\nAnd they came back with 23 recommendations. One of them is a statewide use of deadly force. And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio. Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for — for training.\nBut let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police. Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not — not to lose their life. Their family is waiting for them.\nAt the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.\nSee, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions. But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong. And it has been a remarkable situation in our state. And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks. It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.\nAnd when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have. Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed. I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone. You've got to bring people together. You've got to give people hope.\nAnd together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America. And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren. [applause]\nCAVUTO: Thank you, Governor.\nBARTIROMO: Senator Rubio? [applause]\nUnder current law, the U.S. is on track to issue more new permanent immigrants on green cards over the next five years than the entire population of South Carolina. The CBO says your 2013 immigration bill would have increased green cardholders by another 10 million over 10 years.\nWhy are you so interested in opening up borders to foreigners when American workers have a hard enough time finding work?\nRUBIO: Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years. And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job. This issue is not about that anymore.\nFirst and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe. And here's why. There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system. And not just green cards. They're looking — they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances. They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.\nThey're looking — they're looking to manipulate our — the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States. So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States. So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.\nBARTIROMO: So your thinking has changed?\nRUBIO: The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago. Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally. They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.\nThe entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS. Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees. We know this for a fact. They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border. And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.\nThis issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.\nBARTIROMO: Thank you, Senator. [applause]\nCRUZ: But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida. We had Boko Haram. We had Hamas. We had Hezbollah. We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America. It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security. [applause]\nBARTIROMO: Thank you, Senator.\nCRUZ: It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees. It enabled him — the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.\nI think that's a mistake. That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it. And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries. I voted yes to suspend that. Marco voted on the other side. So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.\nRUBIO: Maria, let me clear something up here. This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration. Ted Cruz, you used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards, now you say that you're against it. You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it. You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it. You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.\nAnd by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it. I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason. [applause]\nThat is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation. When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant. Edward Snowden is a traitor. And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason. [applause]\nAnd one more point, one more point. Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it. Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz. In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.\nHere's the bottom line, and I'll close with this. If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond. [applause]\nBUSH: There's — look, there's —\nCAVUTO: Gentlemen, gentlemen —\nCRUZ: I'm going to get a response to that, Neil. There's no way he launches 11 attack —\nCAVUTO: Very quick, very quick.\nCRUZ: I'm going to — he had no fewer than 11 attacks there. I appreciate your dumping your [inaudible] research folder on the  stage.\nRUBIO: No, it's your record.\nCRUZ: But I will say —\nCAVUTO: Do you think they like each other?\nCRUZ: — at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false. They're absolutely false.\nAUDIENCE: Boo.\nCRUZ: So let's start — let's start with immigration. Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity. Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty. I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King. Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals. I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.\nAnd by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion. What he said, and he said it in the last, it's simply not true. And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.\nCAVUTO: All right, gentlemen, we've got to stop. I know you are very passionate about that. [applause]\nGovernor Bush, fears have gripped this country obviously, and you touched on it earlier since the San Bernardino attacks. Since our last , the national conversation has changed, according to Facebook data as well.\nNow this first graphic shows the issues that were most talked about right before those attacks and now after: the issues of Islam, homeland security and ISIS now loom very large. The FBI says Islamic radicals are using social media to communicate and that it needs better access to communication. Now the CEO of Apple, Governor, Tim Cook said unless served with a warrant private communication is private, period. Do you agree, or would you try to convince him otherwise?\nBUSH: I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators — back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.\nThe simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country. We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff —\nCAVUTO: Would you answer this question?\nBUSH: Oh, I'll talk about that, too. But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind. [laughter]\nCAVUTO: Fair enough. So Tim Cook — so Tim Cook says he's going to keep it private.\nBUSH: I got that. And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C. There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies. They understand that there's a national security risk. We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.\nWe need to make sure that we keep the country safe. This is the first priority. The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely. Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is — that is just shameful. 23 million files in the hands of the Chinese? So it's not just the government — the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.\nWe should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well. That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.\nCAVUTO: But if Tim cook is telling you no, Mr. President.\nBUSH: You've got to keep asking. You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue. If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship —\nCAVUTO: Do you ask or do you order?\nBUSH: Well, if the law would change, yeah. But I think there has to be recognition that if we — if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other — other technology companies outside the United States. And what we want to do is to control this.\nWe also want to dominate this from a commercial side. So there's a lot of balanced interests. But the president leads in this regard. That's what we need. We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.\nCAVUTO: Governor, thank you. [applause]\nBARTIROMO: When we come right back, closing statements. Stay with us.\n[commercial break]\nBARTIROMO: Welcome back.\nCandidates, it is time for your closing statements. You get 60 seconds each.\nGovernor John Kasich, we begin with you.\nKASICH: You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power. You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.\nBut all of my career, you know, having been raised in — by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English. You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.\nWhether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.\nLook, that's who I stand up for. That's who's in my mind...[bell rings]...And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future. Thank you. [applause]\nCAVUTO: Governor Bush?\nBUSH: Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer? Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.\nDetailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I've laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.\nCredibility counts. There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do. I've done it. I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America. [applause]\nBARTIROMO: Governor Chris Christie?\nCHRISTIE: Maria, Neil, thank you for a great  tonight.\nWhen I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week — the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.\nThey know that this country is not respected around the world anymore. They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn't understand their pain, and doesn't have any plan for getting away from it.\nI love this country. It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known. We need someone to fight for the people. We need a fighter for this country again.\nI've lived my whole life fighting — fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.\nBut here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.\nI am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote. [applause]\nCAVUTO: Dr. Ben Carson?\nCARSON: You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.\nWe're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics. The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people. And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity. Bencarson.com — we will heal, inspire and revive America for our children. [applause]\nBARTIROMO: Senator Marco Rubio?\nRUBIO: You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government. Our rights come from God.\nThat's why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world. That's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.\nBut now as I travel the country, people say what I feel. This country is changing. It feels different. We feel like we're being left behind and left out.\nAnd the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America. We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.\nAnd so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military. And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history. If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.\nBut if we elect the right person — if you elect me — we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been. [applause]\nCAVUTO: Senator Ted Cruz?\nCRUZ: \"13 Hours\" — tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them. I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.\nI want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.\nI want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter. This will end. It will end on January 2017.\nAnd if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back. [applause]\nBARTIROMO: Mr. Donald Trump?\nTRUMP: I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers. They're tough, they're strong, they're great people. Half of them had tears pouring down their face. They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.\nAnd Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads. It was a terrible sight. A terrible sight. And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion. If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.\nWe will make America great again. We will win on everything we do. Thank you. [applause]\nBARTIROMO: Candidates, thank you.\nCAVUTO: Gentlemen, thank you all. All of you. That wraps up our debate. We went a little bit over here.

EARNEST: I'll do two quick things, and then we'll go to your questions. First, as you may have seen in the President's Twitter Q&A today, the World Health Organization announced an end to the most recent outbreak of the Ebola virus in Liberia.\nAs the President said in the State of the Union, we'll continue to have a smart, patient and disciplined foreign policy that uses every element of our national power on issues of global concern to mobilize the world to work with us and make sure other countries pull their own weight. The heroic response of our military, our doctors, and our development workers set up the platform that allowed other countries to join in behind us and stamp out this epidemic. This collaborative work saved hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions of lives.\nNow, while we congratulate the West African nations of Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea on this considerable achievement, we will remain vigilant against potential future flare-ups of the disease. The United States will continue to demonstrate leadership on this issue, just as we have since the height of the epidemic, by working closely with our West African and international partners as they recover from this devastating disease.\nSecondly, as you may have seen, the Department of Defense announced today that they transferred 10 Guantanamo detainees to Oman. The transfer brings the population at Guantanamo, which previously held a total of 779 men at the facility, to 93. This is a significant milestone on the road to closing the facility. Prior to this transfer, each individual detainee had a rigorous review from our national security leadership. And consistent with the statutory requirements contained in the 2016 NDAA, the Secretary of Defense informed Congress of the President's intent to transfer these individuals and of the Secretary's determination that these transfers meet the statutory requirements.\nThe United States is thankful to all of our friends and allies that have stepped up and provided assistance as we work to close the detention facility. More than two dozen countries have repatriated their nationals or resettled detainees who could not be transferred back to their home country. In particular, we're appreciative of the two most recent detainees -- I'm sorry, the two most recent countries to resettle detainees, Ghana and Oman.\nQ: Which --\nTHE PRESIDENT: Ghana and Oman. Oman is the nation that took this most recent transfer of 10 detainees.\nWe'll continue to work diligently to reduce the prison population through safe and responsible detainee transfers to close the detention facility.\nSo with those two updates, I'll now take your questions.\nQ: The 10 were going where?\nQ: Oman.\nMR. EARNEST: So there are 10 that were announced today. All 10 of those were actually Yemeni detainees and they were transferred to Oman. Part of their transfer requirements was that they would be entered into this rehabilitation program that Oman operates. And this is a program that has previously accepted individuals who were detained at the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\nQ: Josh, how many have they accepted before?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know how many in total that they have taken, but it's a substantial number -- over and above the 10 that was just announced today.\nQ: You said 779, as if you guys did that. You didn't actually inherit 779. How many have you all brought it down to?\nMR. EARNEST: There were 242 when President Obama took office.\nQ: Of those 93 that are left, how many can still be repatriated versus will never be repatriated?\nMR. EARNEST: So there are another 34 of those 93 that have already been approved for transfer. So it means their case has been considered by the Periodic Review Board, and they've determined that, under the appropriate circumstances, it could be safe to transfer these individuals to other countries.\nSo there are a number of others in other categories. So there are another -- just doing the math in my head -- another 49 that are still eligible for consideration by the Periodic Review Board.\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nMR. EARNEST: Right. So 34 have been approved for transfer. Another 49 fall into a couple of categories that allow them to continue to be eligible for consideration by the Periodic Review Board. And then there are another 10 that are currently facing criminal charges.\nIt's confusing because they divide up the numbers in a variety of ways. But I think the most relevant number is that there are another 34 that are eligible for transfer; we just need to find the right place and the right conditions for the transfer.\nQ: So it's 10 permanent detainees that are going to Charleston or somewhere in the United States eventually when you do an order?\nMR. EARNEST: Not necessarily. These are 10 individuals who -- we're not in the process of trying to transfer them, because we've determined that they face -- that we could actually -- that we have the necessary evidence to bring criminal charges against them through either the military commission process or even the Article III courts. So again, they don't sort of break down cleanly along these different categories, but that's the case.\nQ: House Republicans today are complaining that the administration has a mad rush of -- their words -- \"mad rush\" to move detainees out, and are considering some legislation to call for more transparency in the process. What's your response to that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it is certainly true that the administration is working diligently to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, including by transferring detainees who can be placed in situations where we have confidence that the threat to the United States can be mitigated. In fact, before those transfers can occur, the Secretary of Defense has to personally attest that the proper conditions are in place to mitigate the threat that that individual can pose to the United States. And that certification has to be presented to Congress. In fact, that certification actually has to be presented to Congress 30 days before the transfer can occur. So there already is significant transparency into this process.\nSo, look, on this one there is a disagreement on the part of House Republicans who don't think that we should close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. The problem is, for those House Republicans, it's not a disagreement between them and a bunch of Democrats who are currently in the White House; they also disagree with the Republicans who were previously in the White House, who also believe that the prison at Guantanamo Bay should be closed and it's in our national security interest to close it. And the idea that we're spending $4 million per year, per detainee, to continue to operate the prison is not a good use of taxpayer dollars. There are much more effective ways that we can address the national security interests of the United States.\nQ: What is the status of the plan the administration is supposed to be sending to Congress for how to close Guantanamo?\nMR. EARNEST: The Department of Defense continues to work on that plan. And once they have a final -- a plan that they can present to Congress, we'll do that. We'll also share it with all of you so that you all understand exactly our thinking and the numbers behind our strategy. So this is obviously something that we look forward to discussing.\nI'll just say that I would not anticipate a lot of surprises. I think we've been quite transparent about what our strategy is for closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay. There are some additional numbers and some more information that we can provide, and we'll do that in the course of this plan. But you guys all have a good sense of how this strategy works.\nQ: Should we expect that to come in the form of legislation first, before an executive order?\nMR. EARNEST: The President has made clear that we want to work with Congress to try to achieve this national security goal. And that is the first order of business.\nQ: And is there any reason to think that that -- the anniversary of the order is coming up in about a week, the one that happened his first week in office. Is there any reason to expect that that legislation will come between now and that anniversary, as a benchmark, as a time mark?\nMR. EARNEST: I just don't have a good sense of the timing. I mean, look, we've been hinting since July that we would be presenting a plan soon. So as soon as we have a plan to present to Congress, we'll share it with all of you.\nQ: Can you talk a little bit about what's going on in Chicago today? They're going to release another one of these videos with a police shooting. Has the President been briefed on that? And has he been talking to Rahm Emanuel about the situation there? And what are his thoughts -- I guess his confidence level -- that Rahm is going to be able to pull Chicago out of everything that's gone on?\nMR. EARNEST: The President is certainly following the news about some of the challenges facing local law enforcement officials in his hometown. What is happening in Chicago, however, is not unique. There are a variety of other communities across the country that are struggling to strengthen the bonds of trust between the local police department and the communities they're sworn to serve and protect.\nBut Chicago's challenges are significant. The good news is that Mayor Emanuel has taken full responsibility for solving this problem. He's made some changes already, at the highest levels of the police department. He clearly is taking steps that he thinks are responsive to some of the concerns that have been expressed by leaders in the community in an effort to try to rebuild that trust.\nWhat's also happening in Chicago is they're dealing with the kind of gun violence that also is all too common particularly in large communities across the country.\nSo this is a difficult challenge. The view of the President -- and I also think it happens to be the view of Mayor Emanuel, and you can check with him -- that the ability of law enforcement in Chicago to address the gun violence that they're seeing in a variety of communities there will be enhanced if they can improve the police department's relationship with the community -- if they can strengthen the bonds of trust between the police department and these individual communities.\nThere is a sense among some that somehow improving relationships between law enforcement and members of the community is at odds with fighting crime. In fact, it's the opposite -- that improving the relationship between law enforcement and leaders in the community is actually going to enhance the ability of the police department to fight crime. And Mayor Emanuel understands that. That certainly is one of the reasons that President Obama has made this a priority.\nAnd when it comes to the President's confidence in Mayor Emanuel, obviously the President knows the mayor quite well, and they've worked together on a number of issues, particularly early in their term. But ultimately, it will be the voters of the city of Chicago, it will be up to them to decide whether or not the mayor has done enough to address this problem. The next election is not for another three years.\nSo the voters will have an opportunity to render their judgment about Mayor Emanuel's leadership. But, look, to his credit, he had done what good leaders do, which is take responsibility for solving what is clearly a significant problem. And he has accepted the fact that voters and the citizens of Chicago should hold him accountable for the success that he has in addressing this significant challenge. And he's obviously hard at work on that.\nQ: You said at the top that this wasn't something that was unique, that we've seen incidents like this across the country. And I think that's true. But what is unique about Chicago is that this doesn't seem to be dying down. There seems to be more coming out about this, more incidents and more questions about transparency and Rahm's administration. So does the President have any concerns that this is going to continue to snowball, and has he talked to Rahm about that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have any presidential conversations to tell you about. Again, I think this is something that Chicago has in common with other cities across the country, that there is greater awareness among more citizens in more cities that parts of their community have a real distrust of local law enforcement. And there is a responsibility of the leaders in those communities to step forward and offer constructive solutions and to make their voices heard in a peaceful, responsible way. But there's also a significant responsibility that is borne by city officials and by leaders in law enforcement to try to bridge those divides. And the ability of law enforcement to bridge those divides is only going to make law enforcement more effective and more successful in fighting crime. And that ultimately is our goal here.\nQ: The Medicaid proposal he talked about today -- the Medicaid proposal -- is there any reason to think Congress might actually approve that? Or is this just floating another idea that's not going to go anywhere with Republicans?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I know there clearly is Republican resistance to anything that would strengthen the Affordable Care Act and expand health care to people who need it. That's unfortunate. I think what's different about this dynamic, though, Peter, is that there are a lot of Republican leaders outside of Washington, D.C. who recognize that Medicaid expansion can have significant benefits for their state.\nSo let me give you one example. Governor Mike Pence, by all accounts a conservative Republican, even recognized by his former congressional colleagues as a conservative Republican, recently worked with the Obama administration just last year to expand Medicaid in his state. Congress passing the President's budget proposal would actually ensure that for the first three years, as they implement this proposal in Indiana, that the federal government would be picking up a hundred percent of the tab.\nSo it's not just the President that's going to be making the case that Congress should act on this proposal, conservative Republican Governor Mike Pence will be making the case that Congress should pass this proposal.\nQ: (Inaudible) Republican governor asked him to lobby?\nMR. EARNEST: We know that there are other Republicans who have indicated publicly their interest in trying to expand Medicaid who also will be advocates for this legislation. The Republican governor of Wyoming is an example of this. There are Republican legislators in Nebraska who are looking to expand Medicaid in their state. The Republican governor of the state is against it, but these Republican state legislators will certainly be advocating that -- for example, the two Republican senators from Nebraska in the United States Senate, they'll be advocating that they support this legislation.\nSo because of the way that Medicaid expansion doesn't break down cleanly along party lines outside of Washington, D.C., we actually find that Medicaid expansion across the country is something that tends to get some bipartisan support. And we tend to mobilize that bipartisan support outside of Washington, D.C. to pressure Congress to adopt this proposal.\nQ: The President did a Twitter Q&A today. How does that work? Does he type? Do you type? Who picks the questions? How does that work?\nMR. EARNEST: The President types. The staff will curate a broader pool of relevant questions that the President may want to answer, and so he'll look through those questions and decide for himself which ones he wants to answer.\nQ: Paul Ryan asked one question about closing Guantanamo, what authority the President had. Do you know whether the President -- whether that question ever got to the President from the curated pile? And did you consider answering Speaker Ryan on Twitter?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't think we -- we did not discuss whether or not to answer Speaker Ryan's questions. This was an opportunity for people across the country to ask a question of the President, and I think the President took a pretty broad cross-section of stuff, including some lighter questions, as well.\nQ: Josh, you guys were very pleased last week that he had questions at his town hall on CNN that were from people who disagreed with him, and you've talked about how you'd like to have more of that. You didn't have a lot of people disagreeing with him here yesterday. Are you disappointed by that? Or is there something you'd like to do to change that?\nMR. EARNEST: I think what it might reflect, Peter, is the difference in a media organization organizing the event and an event where the broader public is invited. In some cases, the audience is a little self-selecting. The President's most enthusiastic supporters are the people who are going to be most enthusiastic about standing in line and working hard to get the limited supply of tickets.\nSo I think you never really know what you're going to get in those kinds of town hall settings. And today it did happen to be almost exclusively supporters of the President who asked some questions. It's not because we chose the audience; I think it's because the audience chose themselves. And I think you did see the President make an attempt to call on a cross-section of people who attended the event -- men and women, young and old, white and black. But you never really know what you're going to get at these kinds of events.\nQ: Josh, I wanted to refer to Speaker Ryan. I know they've spoken on the phone a number of times, but is there a reason they still haven't sat down with each other yet, done some sort of longer, formal meeting?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let's just say the President is hoping that's something they'll be able to do relatively soon.\nQ: And I want to ask about \"Thirteen Hours,\" the Michael Bay movie about the Benghazi attacks. Is that something the President plans to see, wants to see? And we've seen cooperation in the past with \"Zero Dark Thirty,\" and movies like that. Was there any request for, or cooperation by any entity in the government?\nMR. EARNEST: That's a good question. I don't know if there was a request for information for the federal government to cooperate with the making of that film. I know that there's a wing at the Department of Defense that's actually dedicated to coordinating with movie studios in making those kinds of films to ensure that they're realistic. I don't know if that took place with regard to this movie.\nQ: Has he seen it?\nI don't think the President has seen it. And I don't know, frankly, whether or not he'll see it. It looks like an entertaining film, high-production values, and obviously Michael Bay is an action movie director who has made some pretty entertaining movies. So I wouldn't rule out that the President would see it.\nQ: Is there any concern about the political subtext of this? Obviously, it's an issue in the 2016 campaign with Secretary Clinton.\nMR. EARNEST: Not that much. I mean, I think that even Michael Bay would tell you that he was trying to put together a movie for entertainment value, not for historic value.\nQ: The President specifically ruled out Michelle Obama running for President. Does that denial include Senate or other elective offices? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't checked with him, but given the emphatic way in which he answered the question, I would assume it would apply to any elective office.\nQ: Can I ask about Jakarta, the attacks in Indonesia? This may be important for two reasons. One is that it's a major sort of moderate example of democratic governance in the Islamic world; and two, because of President Obama's own childhood years spent in Indonesia, an affinity for Indonesia. Have you spoken with him about the attacks? Does he have concerns both personally for a place this close to his heart, or because it's been sort of off-limits for now -- ISIS and related activities have been contained to different parts of the world. Do you have concerns about this potentially sliding toward Indonesia?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me start by saying that everyone at the White House offers our sincere condolences to those who were killed in today's heinous terrorist attacks. We saw an innocent loss of life from these violent terrorist attacks, and our thoughts and prayers are with those who were affected.\nThe government of Indonesia has developed a strong security and counterterrorism relationship with the United States, and that relationship has made the citizens of both of our countries safer. I would expect that that security relationship will only strengthen as we work together to fight the scourge of violent extremism.\nLook, as you point out, Indonesia is the world's largest Muslim country, and there is a long tradition inside of Indonesia of moderation and the acceptance of other faiths and of the variety of ways that people pursue the Muslim faith inside of Indonesia. That certainly contributes to the rich diversity that makes Indonesia such an interesting place.\nWhat's also true is that over the course of Indonesia's history, there have been spasms of violence. So I think that's what gives us confidence, and certainly even the President confidence, that the people of Indonesia will come together to confront this extremist threat.\nAnd we know that -- I'll defer to the Indonesian authorities who are investigating this matter about who precisely is responsible for this terrorist attack, but we know that there are extremist organizations like ISIL that are using social media to try to radicalize people around the world, including in Indonesia. And you'll recall, when the President traveled to Malaysia last fall, we had a discussion about how Malaysia is actually going to host one of these fusion centers that will organize our efforts online to combat extremism in the region by trying to counter the messaging of extremist organizations. And so we're obviously going to work with Malaysia in that effort.\nAnd so we're mindful of the strategy that these extremist organizations have used not just -- in Indonesia and around the world, and we're going to redouble our efforts to fight it. But there certainly is a responsibility that Muslim leaders have to stand up and speak out against ISIL's efforts to radicalize people online.\nQ: Iran -- again, has the President watched that video of the sailors with their hands on their heads? And is there any concern -- I guess, what does the White House, what does the President make of that? Because there are concerns growing online and other reports that this might violate the Geneva Convention and be some propaganda video from Iran.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kristen, we're still looking to determine what exactly were the circumstances that led to this particular incident. I can tell you the President has seen the pictures and he's obviously interested in learning more about the situation. Obviously our sailors have only been returned to U.S. hands in just the last 48 hours or so. And the Department of Defense is leading the investigation to find out what happened. The President certainly expects to get a briefing on what they're able to learn.\nBut, again, I think what this situation underscores is the value of the diplomatic engagement that Secretary Kerry has pursued with his Iranian counterpart and their ability to quickly enter into diplomatic discussions, what is critical to our ability to resolve the situation promptly.\nQ: That had to be a pretty scary situation for those sailors to be taken into Iranian custody. I mean, they're fairly young. Is there any chance that the President would, in the coming days, maybe call some of them to reassure them, or anything of that sort?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any plans to do so right now. But if something like that were to happen, we'll try to let you know. Obviously our men and women in uniform serve in dangerous places all around the world, and obviously operating a naval vessel, particularly a relatively small one, in the Persian Gulf entails significant risk. And it is a good reminder of how there are -- some of the finest men and women that our country has to offer on a daily basis put their lives on the line to keep us safe. And this is a reminder of what those risks entail. Fortunately, this particular incident did not result in any loss of life.\nAll right, thank you, guys.\nEND 1:42 P.M.

{"author": "Ben Carson", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111662", "text": "Alexandria, Va. - January 14, 2016 - Dr. Carson, retired neurosurgeon and 2016 GOP presidential candidate, continues to call for the U.S. government to conduct a full investigation into the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), a U.S. Muslim group. CAIR has extensive ties to foreign terrorist groups, such as Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood, and was once named by federal prosecutors as an \"unindicted co-conspirator\" in a plot to facilitate terrorist financing. CAIR has repeatedly and openly expressed support for terrorism, disdain for the U.S. Constitution and a desire for America to be ruled under Sharia law. Three Muslim countries, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia and Egypt, have designated the Muslim Brotherhood and its affiliates, which include CAIR, as terrorist organizations.\n\"CAIR has long hidden behind a thin veil of advocacy, using political correctness to attack anyone who would expose their extremist roots,\" said Dr. Carson. \"We can't let a fear of offending obscure domestic terrorists prevent us from subjecting CAIR to the full scrutiny of law enforcement. CAIR's ideals and activities do not represent the views of America's peace-loving and patriotic Muslim communities. We must investigate this organization immediately in order to safeguard the security of the American people.\"\nFacts and Questions About CAIR:\nCAIR and Domestic Terrorism: In the aftermath of the San Bernardino terrorist attack that left 14 dead and 31 wounded, many questions arose about the link between the attackers and local members of CAIR. Hussam Ayloush, head of CAIR's operations for Greater Los Angeles, has documented associations with Mustafa Kuko, the Director of the Islamic Center of Riverside, where the San Bernardino attackers worshipped. Yet instead of answering questions about how the terrorists became radicalized, CAIR has stood in the way of law enforcement's investigation, even at one point deflecting blame for the attacks onto U.S. foreign policy.\nCAIR and Terrorist Financing: CAIR was established by individuals with known ties to terrorism. The Holy Land Foundation (HLF), shuttered in 2001 for its ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and efforts to facilitate terrorist financing, provided the seed money for CAIR. Court documents show that CAIR was named by federal prosecutors as \"unindicted co-conspirators\" of the HLF plot, but the Obama Justice Department has refused to bring charges against CAIR.\nCAIR and Sharia Law: CAIR's terrorist links are merely the manifestation of its open desire to replace the U.S. Constitution with Sharia law. One of the most disturbing revelations of the HLF trial was the exposure of a Muslim Brotherhood document calling for \"Civilizational Jihad\" to eliminate and destroy Western civilization from within.\nCAIR has echoed such calls throughout its history. Most notably, co-founder Omar Ahmad has decreed, \"Islam isn't in America to be equal to any other faith, but to become dominant….The Koran, the Muslim book of scripture, should be the highest authority in America, and Islam the only accepted religion on earth.\"\nCAIR Designated as a Terrorist Group: Already, other countries have decided that CAIR is an organization they do not want on their soil. Three of America's partners in the Middle East, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, have designated the Muslim Brotherhood and its associates, which include CAIR, as terrorist organizations.\nCAIR and Its Nonprofit Status: In addition to openly espousing terrorism and working with terrorist groups, CAIR has brazenly violated IRS regulations governing nonprofit organizations. It has previously lost its tax-exempt status by failing to file federal taxes three years in a row. Last year, it demanded that Dr. Carson withdraw as candidate for the 2016 presidential race, even though the IRS prohibits tax-exempt organizations to intervene in a political campaign on behalf of — or in opposition to — a candidate. America's taxpayers should not be subsidizing the political activities of any organization, let alone one with such close ties to terrorism and anti-american ideologies. The IRS should review CAIR's tax exempt status and remove it.\n\"The American people are rightly concerned about domestic support for terrorism,\" explained Dr. Carson. \"After attacks like those in San Bernardino and Philadelphia, we need to examine every source of terrorism and extremism in America. CAIR has a history of extending support to Hamas and other radical Islamic terrorist groups, a history that they can't shield with claims of bigotry or political correctness. Instead of inviting CAIR members to attend the State of the Union, as some of our political leaders did earlier this week, we should be investigating their activities. We should also press the leaders of CAIR to explain their devotion to Sharia law and their eagerness to impose Islam on Americans. We cannot afford to remain wilfully blind to the threats posed by terrorist-affiliated groups in our own backyard. As president, I will fight terror aggressively, no matter how politically incorrect or difficult it may be.\"", "timestamp": "2016-01-14", "title": "Press Release - Dr. Ben Carson Continues to Call for Thorough Investigation of U.S. Muslim Group CAIR"}

{"author": "Marco Rubio", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=113327", "text": "As a Senator, Marco has heard stories of sexual assault on campus, and of schools badly mishandling allegations and investigations. He's heard from victims — both of assaults, and accusations gone wrong. He's also heard from campus administrators who feel stuck between conflicting statutes, shifting regulations, and damaging cultural forces. And he has four children — boys and girls — who are on their way to college some day.\nSo in 2014, Marco joined a bipartisan group of senators to co-sponsor the Campus Accountability and Safety Act, which aims to improve the handling of sexual assault on campus while protecting the rights of the accused. Republicans supporting the bill include Senators Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley.\nWe don't need to buy into the Left's overheated rhetoric and misleading statistics about campus sexual assault to believe something should be done. Of course, the government's role is also limited: Many of the problems of campus life are connected with broader cultural issues, weakened values, and the plague of substance abuse.\nIncidences of sexual violence are among the most serious and destructive crimes imaginable; they should be taken seriously whether they occur on campus or anywhere else in America.\nA few important principles should govern the handling of such a crime: Perpetrators of sexual violence should face the same system of punishment no matter who they are; those accused of sexual assault should have their due process rights respected; victims should get the support they need to heal; and wherever possible, the cases should be handled by the criminal justice system.\nThose are the main issues the bill tackles: It requires that every university enter into a Memorandum of Understanding with local police departments, so that law enforcement and campus personnel are best trained, prepared, and equipped to handle allegations of sexual violence on campus. The bill also requires that every school have a confidential advisor that a victim can speak to understand his or her options following sexual violence, including how to pursue a criminal complaint. These two measures together would help make it more likely crimes of sexual violence will be reported and prosecuted.\nSecond, the bill protect due process rights without more federal micromanagement: It simply requires that schools notify an accused student within 24 hours of the decision to move forward with a disciplinary proceeding, offering the details of the complaint, the process followed, and the due process rights of each party.\nThird, it includes an important prohibition against schools operating, in the case of sexual violence, any special campus disciplinary procedures for athletes, honor students, or any other favored subgroup.  Whatever policies universities have in this area must be uniform for everyone on campus.\nMarco has fought successfully to exclude the key items on the left's wish-list. The bill does not adopt \"affirmative consent\" (known as \"Yes-means-yes\") as a national standard for campus sexual assault. Nor does it legislate a \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard for campus disciplinary proceedings.\nThose ideas are an assault on notions of fair play and due process, and Marco would not stand for them. Opponents claiming that this bill includes or promotes them do are relying on guilt by association or simply no evidence at all.\nSexual assault can destroy lives, but so can false allegations of sexual assault. One need only review recent news reports to know that false allegations do, in fact, happen. Certainly, we should make additional efforts to protect due process on campus. Most importantly, as President, Marco would swiftly move to stop the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights's assault against due process rights.\nThe Campus Safety and Accountability Act is not a perfect bill. It is a compromise, but it is a step in the right direction on a pressing problem. Sexual assault should not be a partisan issue, and the modest steps forward under consideration will improve the situation for the millions of students and their families who've put their trust in universities and law enforcement.", "timestamp": "2016-01-14", "title": "Press Release - How Marco Rubio Has Fought to Reduce Sexual Assault on Campus -- and Protect Due Process Rights"}

My plan: break up the big banks, close the tax loopholes, and make them pay their fair share. Then we can expand health care to all and provide universal college education.\"\nSanders presented a sweeping plan to rein in the greed of the nation's biggest financial institutions a week ago during a major speech in New York. He pledged to break up the biggest banks and fight to establish a 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act which would restore a Depression-era law signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt designed to prevent Wall Street speculators from crashing the economy. He also said his administration will cap credit card interest rates and ATM fees, allow post offices to offer basic banking services and reform the Federal Reserve to focus on its mandate to promote full employment.\nHillary Clinton, another candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, recently claimed that her proposals were backed by \"everybody.\" In a Jan. 5 speech in Sioux City, Iowa, she asserted that \"everybody who's looked at my proposals says my proposals are tougher, more effective, more comprehensive.\" It wasn't true then, as The Washington Post reported, and it's not true now.\nIn reality, 170 economists and other experts have laid out the reasons why Sanders' plan is superior. They explained why in the letter signed by former Labor Secretary Robert Reich, University of Texas Professor James K. Galbraith, Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, DC., Brad Miller, former U.S. Congressman from North Carolina, and William K. Black, University of Missouri-Kansas City.\n\"Sanders' plan for comprehensive financial reform is critical for avoiding another 'too-big-to-fail' financial crisis,\" the letter said. \"The only way to contain Wall Street's excesses is with reforms sufficiently bold and public they can't be watered down. That's why we support Senator Sanders's plans for busting up the biggest banks and resurrecting a modernized version of Glass-Steagall.\"\nThe letter comes after Hillary Clinton claimed her approach was more comprehensive and more effective.\n\"Secretary Hillary Clinton's more modest proposals do not go far enough,\" the economists and financial experts write. \"They call for a bit more oversight and a few new charges on shadow banking activity, but they leave intact the titanic financial conglomerates that practice most shadow banking. As a result, her plan does not adequately reduce the serious risks our financial system poses to the American economy and to individual Americans.

As President Reagan showed—and before him, President Kennedy in the 1960s (average annual growth of 5.3%) and Presidents Harding and Coolidge in the 1920s (4.7% growth)—tax reform is a powerful lever for spurring economic expansion. Along with reducing red tape on business and restoring sound money, it can make the U.S. economy boom again.\nThat's why I'm proposing the Simple Flat Tax as the cornerstone of my economic agenda.\nIn constructing my plan, I had several requirements. The plan should: spur robust economic growth and job creation, while raising after-tax income for all Americans; be dramatically simpler, to allow working people to file their taxes with a postcard or phone app; and shrink Washington by getting rid of the rat's nest of complex tax requirements, credits and loopholes.\nWith these goals in mind, based on a structure suggested by President Reagan's tax adviser, Arthur Laffer, my Simple Flat Tax plan features the following:\n* For a family of four, no taxes whatsoever (income or payroll) on the first $36,000 of income.\n* Above that level, a 10% flat tax on all individual income from wages and investment.\n* No death tax, alternative minimum tax or ObamaCare taxes.\n* Elimination of the payroll tax and the corporate income tax, to be replaced by a 16% Business Flat Tax. This would tax companies' gross receipts from sales of goods and services, less purchases from other businesses, including capital investment. Simple, efficient, fair.\n* A Universal Savings Account, which would allow every American to save up to $25,000 annually on a tax-deferred basis for any purpose.\nToday, the U.S. taxes American producers that export goods, but it imposes no burden on imports. My business tax is border-adjusted, so exports are free of tax and imports pay the same business-flat-tax rate as U.S.-produced goods. By shifting to a territorial tax system that doesn't tax income earned overseas twice, my plan will reverse the incentive for U.S. companies to relocate overseas. Instead, businesses will be relocating to America.", "timestamp": "2016-01-14", "title": "Press Release - ICYMI: Cruz in Wall Street Journal Op-Ed: A Simple Flat Tax for Economic Growth"}

It's to kill and destroy our enemy and make America safe. That is the purpose.\"\n2nd Amendment... \"There is no gun show loophole. I promise you, I've been to more gun shows than President Obama. The president also says that 'it's easier to get a gun than it is to get groceries.' Again, I can assure you, it's much more difficult to purchase a firearm than purchase the ingredients for a salad in a supermarket…\"\nGun Free Zones...\"The one common thing in most mass shootings is that they happened in gun-free zones where law-abiding citizens, who could have stood-up and at least tried to stop it, were prohibited under the law.\"\nSocial Security... \"Remember, Social Security is not the government's money—it belongs to the people who had it taken out of their checks involuntarily their entire working lives...Our problem is NOT that Social Security is just too generous to seniors.

Huckabee met with about 70 people Wednesday at the Iowa Machine Shed, the 37th of 150 stops the campaign plans to make in the final month... Huckabee also was critical of rivals who he said are currently holding elective office, but are straying from them to campaign. \"I've never personally had a job that would pay me $174,000 a year where I didn't have to show up,\" Huckabee said. \"If you don't want the job, then have the integrity to resign from that job and go seek the job you want. But don't continue to let all of us in this room pay your paycheck.\"... highlighted his experience in the governor's mansion, as well as his fights with the Clintons, to bolster his argument for winning the GOP nomination. But in a year when politicians with resumes have fallen out of favor with some voters, Huckabee felt the need to tell the crowd Wednesday that he's never gotten a paycheck from Washington, D.C. ... In 2008, Huckabee won Iowa. And a Tipton man who backed him then and was at the Machine Shed on Wednesday said he'll support him again. \"I still believe in what he says,\" said Ernie Jennings, who is retired. Jennings said he had considered Cruz, but \"Gov. Huckabee seems a little deeper.\" He added the question of experience matters to him, too. \"I think they need a little more hair on their chest before they get into the race for president,\" he said.\n\"Mike Huckabee Campaigns in Davenport\" — OurQuadCities\nRepublican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee ... stopped in Davenport.

{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116699", "text": "The stakes are higher than you might realize.\nPresident Obama recently announced that he's going to take executive action to strengthen background checks and make it harder for dealers to sell guns to criminals. That's a commonsense step. And with more than 33,000 deaths from gun violence each year, it's a badly needed one.\nA year from now, a new president is going to walk into the Oval Office—and they can either keep working to prevent gun violence in America or rip away the progress that President Obama has made. And it's not just gun violence prevention measures that are at stake—here are eight other things at risk of being ripped away if our next president is a Republican.\nIn the absence of congressional action, President Obama has used executive authority to tackle the urgent threat of climate change. He announced the first-ever limits on the amount of carbon pollution emitted from power plants. And his leadership made the the new international climate agreement in Paris possible. Not only would the United States' commitment to cutting emissions be at risk if a Republican climate denier gets elected president—but the entire agreement could fall apart without active U.S. leadership and participation.\nWhen Congress failed to pass both the DREAM Act and a comprehensive immigration reform bill, President Obama took executive action to let DREAMers (undocumented immigrants who entered the United States as children) and parents of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents remain in the United States. These executive actions, known as DACA and DAPA, would keep millions of families together—and every leading Republican presidential candidate wants to end them.\nNearly 5 million new American workers are set to receive overtime pay, thanks to new rules that guarantees overtime pay to most salaried workers earning less than an estimated $50,440. That's a significant increase from the previous salary threshold of $23,660—a salary that's below the poverty threshold for a family of four.\nA historic nuclear deal will prevent Iran from ever obtaining a nuclear weapon—yet many Republican candidates have boasted they'll tear it up a year into implementation. A Republican president would set us down the very path we've worked hard to avoid. Iran would be poised to get nearly everything it wants without giving up a thing: No restrictions on their nuclear program, no real warning if Tehran suddenly rushes toward building a bomb, and no more economic consequences—because the international economic sanctions would fall apart along with the nuclear deal.\nHillary understands that's not leadership—it's recklessness.\nAs millions of Americans can personally attest, student debt and the high cost of college are holding too many people back. That's why President Obama acted to help millions of borrowers with direct student loans from the federal government by allowing them to cap their monthly payments at 10 percent of their income. And the Department of Education is currently changing its regulations to make a \"pay as you earn\" plan broadly available within the next year—which would benefit millions more. We need to do more to help students and their families afford higher education—not undo these important steps while the cost of college skyrockets.\nMarriage equality was a historic victory—but the fight for full equality for LGBT Americans isn't finished. President Obama has used executive authority to protect employment, housing, and health care for LGBT Americans—from adding gender identity to the federal anti-discrimination policy to prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in all federally funded housing programs. And if you think a Republican president would maintain this progress, remember this: Every Republican running for president opposed the Supreme Court decision affirming marriage equality.\nPresident Obama used an executive order to establish diplomatic relations with Cuba, change travel policies, and provide more opportunity and training for Cuba's growing private sector. But most Republican candidates for president would go back to a failed policy of the past that limits Cuban Americans' ability to travel to Cuba and support their family and friends and blocks American businesses that could help free enterprise take root on Cuban soil—a strategic error for the United States and a tragedy for millions of Cubans.\nPresident Obama has signed executive orders raising wages, strengthening equal pay laws, and requiring paid sick leave for federal contractors, which will give 300,000 American workers up to seven days of paid sick leave each year. Unlike the Republican candidates running for president, Hillary will defend these actions—because she believes that raising incomes is the economic challenge of our time.", "timestamp": "2016-01-14", "title": "Press Release - A Republican President Would Undo President Obama's Actions On Guns, Climate, and a Whole Lot More"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118118", "text": "On the occasion of the Vice President's attendance at the inauguration of President Jimmy Morales in Guatemala City, the Obama administration reaffirms its commitment to a multiyear effort to assist the governments of Central America to build a safer and more prosperous future for their citizens, including through supporting governments to become more transparent, accountable, and capable of providing basic services and upholding the rule of law.\nBuilding a Stronger Partnership\nFor Fiscal Year 2016, the Administration plans to provide up to $750 million to implement its Strategy in support of the Northern Triangle's Alliance for Prosperity Plan, and other regional priorities. This figure more than doubles U.S. assistance to Central America of $305 million in Fiscal Year 2014 and represents a thirty-four percent increase over the $560 million allocated to the region in Fiscal Year 2015. Under the $750 million approved by the U.S. Congress, the Administration is able to provide the region up to $299 million in Development Assistance, $222 million in International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement funding towards the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI), $184 million in Economic Support Funds for CARSI and regional prosperity, economic opportunity, and governance programs, $26 million in Foreign Military Financing, and $4 million in International Military Education and Training, in addition to funds for global health, demining, and other programs, including the Overseas Private Investment Corporation.\nThe new assistance from the United States to Central America will also place significant responsibility on the Northern Triangle governments to undertake needed reforms to receive U.S. funds in support of the Alliance for Prosperity Plan. To this end, the United States Congress required that 25 percent of assistance to the national governments of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras be withheld until the U.S. Secretary of State certifies and reports to Congress that each government is taking effective steps to:\n• Inform its citizens of the dangers of the journey to the southwest border of the United States.\n• Combat human smuggling and trafficking\n• Improve border security, and\n• Facilitate the safe return, repatriation, and reintegration of undocumented migrants\nThe Obama administration also notes that an additional 50 percent of U.S. assistance to the national governments of the Northern Triangle countries may only be obligated after the U.S. Secretary of State certifies that each government is taking effective steps to meet criteria such as:\n• Combat corruption and strengthen public institutions\n• Improve civilian jurisdiction and counter activities of criminal organizations\n• Protect human rights\n• Support programs to promote equitable growth\n• Implement effective civil society consultations, and\n• Increase government revenues.\nThe Obama Administration recognizes that the enabling environment for sustained growth, stability and prosperity for the region will require good governance, including support for democratic values, strengthening criminal justice systems and other legal institutions to combat impunity and promote the rule of law, and advancing rights and protections for civil society and journalists, as well as for vulnerable and marginalized groups. Only through measurable progress towards those objectives will the private sector, small business owners, and international investors have the necessary confidence in the security of their investment and assurances that business dealings are fair and legal. The United States is also partnering with Central American and Caribbean countries to identify concrete steps to advance energy sector reform, regional integration, and clean energy development.\nBolstering Cooperation to Protect Vulnerable Migrants Consistent with U.S. Law\nThe Obama Administration is deepening cooperation between the United States and Central America to ensure that fewer migrants embark on the dangerous journey to the United States. Those who do not qualify for refugee status will be returned consistent with U.S. law and values. The numbers of unaccompanied children and family units apprehended at the United States' southwest border have continued to increase through the fall and winter, a time when the numbers have historically decreased. Unaccompanied children and family unit apprehensions in November and December were significantly above the previous highest apprehension totals for these months, which occurred in 2014.\nAs the President and Vice President have made clear, recently arrived undocumented migrants who have been through the immigration court process, have been determined by a U.S. immigration judge to not qualify for asylum or other relief, and have received final orders of removal, are immigration enforcement priorities and should be removed. As part of the civil immigration enforcement priorities announced by Secretary Johnson in November 2014, the Department of Homeland Security is focused on removing individuals who, whether alone or with family members, have been apprehended while attempting to unlawfully enter the United States and individuals who have received a final order of removal on or after January 1, 2014.\nWhile securing our Southwest border and enforcing our immigration laws are top priorities for the U.S. government, the Administration understands that these actions alone will not address the underlying conditions that currently exist in Central America. Current push factors driving the recent migration spike include criminal violence, domestic and sexual violence, a debilitating drought, and a lack of economic opportunity. The U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America is intended to address many of underlying conditions driving migration. The Administration is working diligently to establish additional avenues for safe, legal, and orderly migration. Broadening access to protection for refugees from the Northern Triangle must be a shared responsibility of the United States, Central American governments, and the other countries of the hemisphere and around the world.\nThe United States plans to expand access to the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program for vulnerable individuals and families from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. This will:\n• Expanding access to resettlement for asylum seekers from the Northern Triangle.\n• Offer a legal alternative to the dangerous and unlawful journey many are currently taking in the hands of human smugglers.\n• Enable the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees and its nongovernmental partners in the region to identify persons in need of refugee protection\n• Better address the needs of those threatened by criminal gang violence and domestic violence, human rights defenders who have been targeted, and others.\nA Comprehensive Approach\nThe Obama Administration is dedicated to pursuing a comprehensive approach in Central America. This includes partnering with the region to advance good governance, prosperity, and citizen security, enforcing our domestic immigration laws, and working to provide services and assistance to migrants or intending migrants who may be at imminent risk of harm. The Obama administration believes that a safe, stable, and prosperous Central America is vital in order to achieve a future where the Western Hemisphere is middle class, democratic, and secure.", "timestamp": "2016-01-14", "title": "Fact Sheet: The United States and Central America: Honoring Our Commitments"}

For us it's a privilege to have you here and to have you having an interest in the nation. We have a lot of projects together, and that we have initiated in the past, and we want to continue. And there is a saying that you don't have what you haven't done.\nI will not ask anything for myself, but I will ask something for the Guatemalans. There is a petition -- it's a very difficult position -- but I want to give you this petition. It comes from 10 senators and 139 legislators (inaudible).\nFor the rest, we are (inaudible) responsibility, we want to work together. We want to work for Latin America. And excuse me for my bluntness, and for being so direct on this occasion, but this is something that we need to do for our (inaudible).\nVICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well, Mr. President, let me begin by saying congratulations -- President-elect, let me say congratulations. And I'm not going to present my list. (Laughter.) Because I don't want him to miss his inauguration.\nThe first time I visited your country several years ago to meet with your colleagues from El Salvador and Honduras, they made a request: Could I find a billion dollars? This is modest comparatively speaking.\nMr. President, I've engaged in the business of foreign policy for a long time. And I truly believe that the next great success story in this hemisphere can be the Northern Triangle -- Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.\nAs I told your colleagues for the last three years, the single biggest impediment for that success is corruption. And on behalf of the President and myself, I want to compliment you on your head-on commitment to take on corruption in your country and the region. It was not lost on the American people that thousands upon thousands of Guatemalans demanded change -- elected you and insist that you finish the job, which I'm sure you will.\nWe want to be your partner. I always say, Mr. President, to a foreign leader that I'm not going to presume to tell you what's in your interest. That's for you to decide. But I know what's in our interest. And I hope we can find our interest to be the same. We have to deal with corruption. We have to deal with the desperate need for more reliable energy in the region. We have to deal with the notion of providing a much better environment to conduct business and attract foreign capital. We have to deal with a whole range of things. But I believe they are within our power to do so.\nAt the President's request, he commissioned me to come up with a plan for the region. And with your predecessors, we spent a lot of time eye-to-eye, person-to-person agreeing on how we would proceed. And we set specific benchmarks that would have to be met. That allowed me to go to the United States Congress and say, ladies and gentlemen, give us the total of $750 million to help Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador meet the needs that they have identified that are holding their countries back. And so we are in this with you. As long as you continue to meet your commitments -- and you have thus far -- we are all in.\nI'll conclude by reminding you how we got to be involved. When I was a senator, and Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, I wrote Plan Columbia. And the region has been asking the United States for another Plan Columbia for the region. I was in the Middle East and I got a phone call from the President in 2014. He said, would I fly to Guatemala to meet with the regional Presidents because we have a rising crisis of -- referred to as unaccompanied children on the U.S. border and families?\nWe sat down and we worked out the way to deal with that issue. And as a consequence of that, it freed up my ability to go to the Congress and get approaching a billion dollars. It's a very difficult time around the world relating to migration overall, as well as specific issues that have existed for a long time in Central America.\nAnd we want to continue to work with you in a humane and decent way to deal with this issue. And the way to do that is to build your economy, build your security, build your country so p have no desire to take a dangerous journey with an organized gang in a difficult circumstance risking the lives of children and others.\nAnd with regard to your new request, which is not new -- your request, let me say I promise we'll take it under consideration. It's a matter of discussion as I speak in the United States of America. And we'll try our best to figure out a resolution with you.\nYou and I are public servants. We're elected officials. And we know public opinion matters a lot. The situation in our border deteriorates to what it was in 2014, there will be no possibility of this happening. You have a genuine case. Reality is real. It may get worse in 2016. I personally promise you I will work again on it, see where we can go. And I spend so much time in matters relating to this area, my constituents are beginning to think that maybe I should run for office here. (Laughter.) But I'm here to support you.

It was the right thing to do. And by the way, it will actually help the State's finances. And it shows you why elections matter.\nAnd right now we're hoping to encourage more States to do the right thing.

So I'm very—I'm just so proud of him, and I'm confident that he's going to do great work. [Applause] He's going to do great work.

I love Baton Rouge, but this is the first time I've been here as President. I've been trying to pack all my fun trips into my last year. And although I missed the Tigers beating Ole Miss last night, maybe I'll come back for football season.\nSome of you know I gave my final State of the Union Address this week. I focused on the fact that we're going through a time of extraordinary change. And that's unsettling. It can seem sometimes, especially during political season, where everybody is running around saying, \"Oh, everything is terrible, and let's find somebody to blame,\" that our politics won't meet the moment. But what I want folks to know—that's right, if you have a chair, go ahead and sit down. [Laughter] If you don't have a chair, don't sit down. [Laughter] I don't want you falling down. Good thing—whoever the first one was who did that, you're a leader. [Laughter]\nAudience member. We love you!\nThe President. Love you back. Thank you.\nBut what I want people to know is, is that we've been through big changes before. And America always comes out stronger and better, as long as we make decisions together that are designed to seize the future instead of run away from it. And we're uniquely positioned to do that. We've got the strongest economy in the world. We've gone through the worst economic crisis of our lifetime, and we have bounced back with 14 million new jobs, cut the unemployment rate in half. We're the most powerful country on Earth, capable of meeting any threat. Our commitment to science and education and entrepreneurship and our diversity make us a perfect match for what's needed in this new century.\nBut our progress is not inevitable. So we've got to answer some big questions. Number one, how do we make sure that we create an economy where everybody is benefiting, everybody feels secure, everybody has a shot at success, not just some? That's question number one. Question number two: How do we make sure we've got an innovation economy and we embrace science and reason and facts, instead of running away from it? Number three, how do we make sure that we keep America safe, not through trying to talk tough, but by being smart? Number four, how do we make sure our politics works, not in a way where everybody agrees—because in a big country like ours, people aren't going to agree on everything—but so that it is civil and so that it is constructive and so that we can work together to find solutions to the problems that are not just going to face us, but our kids and our grandkids? All right?\nNow, I tried to give you a sense of how I think we need to answer those questions going forward, but I promised I wasn't going to talk long because I want to have a chance to hear from you. I just want to make this point. We're pretty close to New Orleans, and I had a chance to go back and travel with Mitch as we were commemorating the anniversary of Katrina. And if you have any doubt about America's capacity to overcome anything, you just visit some of those neighborhoods, and you talk to some of those families, and you see the businesses that are thriving and the homes that have been built and the parishes that have pulled together.\nAnd it's just a reminder of the fact that when we work together, we cannot be stopped. We cannot be stopped. We work best as a team. And it is my ardent hope that, during the course of this year, as long as I have this extraordinary privilege to be your President, that I'm going to be able to encourage more and more of you to get involved and feel that optimism and confidence about where America is headed. All right?\nSo with that, let's start this conversation. And we—let me say this. We've got mikes in the audience. And we're going to go boy, girl, boy, girl, so it's fair. [Laughter]\nAudience member. [Inaudible]—girl, boy, girl, boy.\nThe President. And—or girl, boy, girl, boy. That's fine. See—[laughter].\nAudience member. Girl, girl, girl!\nThe President. [Laughter] She said, \"Girl, girl, girl.\" Now, that's not fair. [Laughter] Come on. [Laughter]\nSo what I'm going to do is, people just raise their hands, I will call on you. A couple things: Wait until the mike gets there. Number two, introduce yourself so we know who you are. Number three, if you keep your question relatively—or comment relatively short, then my response, I can't guarantee I'll keep it short, but I'll keep it shorter. And that way, we have a chance to hear from more people. All right?\nOkay, so let's see who's going to go first. Where's my mike? Here we go. All right, I'll—let's see. This is a good-looking crowd too. I'm—oh, I don't know who to call on. That young lady right there in the brown jacket. Right there. Yes, you.\nQ. I want to ask you—my name is Rachel——\nThe President. Okay, hold on. Wait for the mike. You didn't follow instructions. You're already—[laughter]—careful. Careful. She didn't go to McKinley, is that what happened?\nQ. No, I didn't. [Laughter]\nThe President. All right, go ahead, go ahead.\nQ. My name is Rachel. I'm from Texas. And my question—I don't have one—I just wanted to tell you thank you.\nThe President. Oh, okay, well, that's sweet. [Laughter] All right, the—well, she just—she didn't really have a question, so I'm going to go back to—I'm going to go to this young lady right here in the black-and-white jacket. Right there. Hold on a second. The mike is coming to you. It's just that we're so packed in, it may take—you can go ahead and pass her the mike. She looks like she'll give it back.\nThe President's Plans for His Post-Presidency\nQ. Hi, Mr. President. My name is Jasmine Elliott, and I am a 10th grade cheerleader here at McKinley High School.\nThe President. Yay, all right! Go Panthers!\nQ. And I love you—me and my family love you so much. And I want to thank you.\nThe President. Oh, that's sweet.\nQ. And as a future broadcast journalist, I would like to ask you two questions.\nThe President. Okay.\nQ. My first question is: What are your plans to do when you leave office?\nThe President. Okay.\nQ. And can you please give my grandmother a hug? [Laughter]\nThe President. See, now first of all, I know your grandma put you up to that. [Laughter] So I will give your grandma a hug because you did such a nice job asking the question.\nIn terms of my plans, look, I've got so much work to do this next year that, I—Michelle and I, we haven't had a chance to really step back and think about it. But as I said at the State of Union, when I get out, I'm still holding the most important job in a democracy, and that is the office of citizen. So I will continue to work on the things that Michelle and I care so deeply about. We want to encourage young people to get involved. We want to improve education. We want to make sure that our criminal justice system works the way it should. We want to make sure that we are promoting science education and learning. So—we want to work internationally to help other countries develop. So we're going to have a busy agenda, but I'm not overthinking that right now because I've got a whole bunch of stuff to do between now and next year. All right? But thank you for the question.\nAll right, it's a gentleman's turn. This man, because he's got such a sharp bowtie. Right here. Yes, all right. Go ahead.\nQ. Good morning.\nThe President. Good morning.\nQ. This is a pleasure, sir.\nThe President. Thank you.\nPolitical Polarization/Political Participation/Bipartisanship/Criminal Justice Reform/Tax Reform\nQ. My name Tremaine Sterling. I'm from Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Through your entire two terms as President, what would be your biggest regret and why?\nThe President. I think that is a great question. Although, had you been watching my State of Union on Tuesday—[laughter]—he might have known that I actually already answered that question. [Laughter] But that's okay. I'm sure there was a good ballgame on that night. [Laughter]\nNo, what I told the country—except for you—[laughter]—was that my biggest regret was the fact that politics has become more rancorous during my Presidency and more polarized than it was when I came in. And keep in mind, when I ran, my belief was that there were no red States and blue States. There wasn't a Black or White or Latino America. There was a United States of America. And that continues to be my belief.\nNow, I have, as President, obviously done soul searching about, what are things I could do differently to help bridge some of those divides? I think part of it had to with when I came in we had a real emergency and we had to act quickly. And people in Washington sometimes weren't always as focused on getting the job done as they were, how is this going to position us for future elections?\nAnd—but I—as I said at the State of Union, I have no doubt that there are things I could have done better. But what I also say is that, this is not something a President can do by him- or herself. When it comes to how we work together, the main impetus for a better politics is going to be the American people. They have to demand it.\nAnd so if we have voters who are not getting involved, then the people who tend to determine the agenda are the special interests or money or power or the loudest voices or the most polarizing voices, because a lot of folks—some of the best people—they're just sitting at home. And they're getting cynical about politics, and they don't get involved. And then, the people who do get involved end up being the folks who aren't willing to work together.\nIt's important for voters to insist that their elected officials are strong on principle, but also are willing to compromise with people who don't agree with them. And if you punish an elected official for even talking to the other side, then it's going to produce the kind of politics that we have seen in Washington too often.\nSo this is an area where I regret. I'm going to keep on working at it, try to see what more we can do to reach across the aisle to get things done. I said on Tuesday that I think at the end of last year, maybe we surprised the cynics by getting a budget done. And we extended tax cuts for working families that were due to expire. And we were able to continue funding for transportation. I know that your mayor was talking about how the interstate here narrows, and we may need to do something about it to relieve some traffic. And those things are not things that should be subject to a lot of Republican and Democratic argument. Maybe that's something that we can carry over into this year.\nOne area, for example, that there's been genuine bipartisan interest and support is the idea that we've got to reform our criminal justice system; that we have to be tough on violent crime, but also be smart when we think about, how can we prevent young people from getting into the criminal justice system in the first place? How can we provide alternatives for low-level, nonviolent drug offenders? How can we make sure that the sentencing is proportional? How do we make sure that we're training folks while they're incarcerated to get a skill that would allow them to be gainfully employed? How do we make sure that when they are released that there is a transition process for them? How do we lift up all the outstanding employers who are willing to give people second chances? So there's a whole slew of work that we could be doing there.\nAnd it—to their credit, we've seen some very conservative Republicans and some very liberal Democrats sitting down at the table and trying to work it out. And that's an example of where we see some promise.\nAnother area is—and I mentioned this at the State of the Union—some of you have heard of the earned-income tax credit. Now, this is a program historically that is supported by Democrats and Republicans. And it's a pretty simple idea. If you work, you shouldn't be in poverty. And so we should provide tax breaks to low-income working families so that they don't say, \"I might as well just be on welfare because I'll get more benefits than if I'm working.\"\nWell, the earned-income tax credit creates an incentive to say, you work hard, you're working full time, but it's, say, a minimum-wage job, we're going to give you a chance, if you've got kids, to raise that income level, get a tax break.\nThe problem is that it does not apply to individuals without children. And that means a lot of men in that category don't benefit and young people don't benefit. And one of the things we've been talking about is, if we expand that to reach workers who don't have children but are also working hard and are in poverty, that could be helpful.\nAnd these are areas where Cedric—who has—he's been a leader on criminal justice reform. He's working on this as well. I know that Mitch has been doing great work when it comes to the criminal justice system in New Orleans. These are the kinds of areas where just common sense can prevail if we've all got a spirit of trying to solve problems instead of just winning elections. Okay? All right.\nOkay, it's a young lady's turn. Okay. You know what, I'm going to call on that little young lady right there. Yes. She's in her daddy's lap. And my daughter—my oldest daughter is about to go to college next year. And I can't really talk about it a lot because I start to cry. [Laughter]\nCancer Research\nQ. My name is Noelle Remeny. And I'm in the fourth grade, and I'm 10 years old. And do you think there's going to be a cure for cancer?\nThe President. Well, there you go. Are you interested in math and science? Q. A little bit.\nThe President. A little bit? [Laughter] Well, I tell you what, it's going to be young people like you that are going to help cure cancer. So you better study up on your math and study up on your science.\nBut I do think that we are seeing medical breakthroughs right now that we have not seen in my lifetime. Part of the reason is because—some of you heard of the Human Genome Project. What happens is that we're now able to look at not just how cells work, but we're actually able to track how individual DNA and genetics operates. And when you do that, it turns out that a cancer cell that I have may be different than a cancer cell that John or somebody else has and may require different cures. And certain treatments might work better than other treatments. And because we're able to get into the really nitty-gritty of how our bodies work, in ways that we haven't before, we're starting to see more effective treatments.\nBut we have to make a big investment. And my Vice President, Joe Biden, who I love, suffered the kind of tragedy last year that is unbelievable. And he managed it with grace. His son Beau Biden was one of the finest men I knew. And so I thought it was entirely appropriate for Joe Biden, who has seen this and gone through it, to lead this effort like a Moon launch. We're going to double down on medical research. We're going to look at the best—we're going to gather the best researchers, the best scientists, and we are going to go after this thing.\nIt probably won't be cured in my lifetime. But I think it will be cured in yours. And that's why we've got to get started now. All right?\nOkay, it is a gentleman's turn. This gentleman back here. Right there. Yes, sir, the—you. [Laughter] Hold on. The mike is coming. The mike is coming.\nFirst Lady Michelle Obama\nQ. Mr. President, first of all, I'm Greg Gavins. I'm the proud father of one of your special, great Secret Service.\nThe President. Outstanding.\nQ. I have a question for you. Since you can't run again for another term, is there any way that we as a group can talk the First Lady into running?\nThe President. No. [Laughter] No, no, no. No, no.\nAudience member. I know that's right. I know that's right. [Laughter]\nThe President. Let me tell you, there are three things that are certain in life. [Laughter] Death, taxes, and Michelle is not running for President. [Laughter] That I can tell you.\nBut you know what, the First Lady, though—the work she's done around reducing childhood obesity, the work that she and Jill Biden have done on military families and making sure they get support, I could not be prouder of her. And I am certain that she's going to be really active as a First Lady.\nNot only is she going to be a very young ex-First Lady, but unlike me, she looks young. [Laughter] I was looking at a wedding picture—actually, we found the old video from our wedding. We've been married 23 years now. And so my mother-in-law had been going through some storage stuff and found the—our wedding video. And I popped it in—and I look like a teenager—and realized, boy, I sure have aged. [Laughter] Audience member. [Inaudible]\nThe President. I know that though. [Laughter] But Michelle looked—she looked identical. Looked identical.\nQ. We're proud of her.\nThe President. Well, I'm proud of her too, because most importantly, she's been an unbelievable mom, which is why my daughters turned out so well.\nSo, all right, it is a young woman's turn. This young lady right here. Go ahead. Yes, you. Yes, you've been raising your hand. [Laughter] Okay. But hold on, mike is coming. Go ahead.\nEnvironment/Climate Change\nQ. Hi, my name is Imani Maxberry. I'm a coastal environmental science major at LSU.\nThe President. Outstanding.\nQ. One, I want to say thank you for rejecting the Keystone pipeline. And two, I want to ask: While you've been in office, what environmental impact do you—what environmental issue do you think has impacted you the most and should be more brought to the public?\nThe President. Okay. The—that's a great question, and I'm proud that you're doing that work. That's important.\nFirst of all, it's important for us to understand how much environmental progress we've made in my lifetime. And the reason is, sometimes, when we talk about the environment, it sounds like something far away. But we don't realize—we don't remember what we've accomplished already.\nIn the 1970s, in California, there would be regular days where people did not go outside. When Ronald Reagan was Governor in California, there were regularly days where the smog was so bad, it was like it is in Beijing now. People just wouldn't go outside. And if you had asthma or some respiratory disease, you might die.\nI remember as recently as 1979, when I first started college—I started college in Los Angeles—and when I went running, the first week I was there, after about 5 minutes, I'd start feeling a burning in my chest. And it was just me sucking in soot and smog. And now you go there, and that smog isn't there. And the reason is because we instituted things like catalytic converters and unleaded gasoline. And we changed the technologies to reduce smog.\nIt used to be that places like the Cuyahoga River in—around Cleveland caught fire it was so polluted. Caught fire. No, this is no joke. And now you go there, and people are able to use it. Same thing with the Chicago River. Now people are kayaking and fishing.\nAnd so the point is, is that we actually can make progress when we make an effort because of our technology and our innovation. And a lot—every time we've made—taken a step to try to clean up our air or our water or our environment, there are all kinds of people who say this is going to kill jobs, we can't afford it, can't do it, it's going to cost too much. And then, after we do it, we look back and say, you know, that didn't cost as much as we thought, it happened quicker than we did. Our businesses figured out how to do it and to make money doing it at the same time. What a—that's what I mean when I say an innovation economy. We've got to be confident about our ability to solve any problem if we put our minds to it. So now, the answer to your question right now is, what I am very much concerned about is climate change. And I—there are folks who are still denying that this is a problem or that we can do anything about it. Look, if 99 doctors told you that you have diabetes—[laughter]—and you need to change your eating habits and get some exercise and lose some weight, you may decide not to do it because you're stubborn. But don't say they're wrong because the science in unsure. This is happening. And by the way, if you live in Louisiana, you should especially be concerned about this because you are right next to some water that has a tendency to heat up, and that then creates hurricanes. And as oceans ride, that means that the amount of land that is getting gobbled up continuously in this State is shrinking—the land mass—and it's going to have an impact.\nNow, we can build things, and we can fortify things, and we can do things smarter, and we can control how development happens, and we can restore wetlands. All those things make a difference. But ultimately, we've got to do something about making sure that ocean levels don't rise 4, 5, 6, 8 feet, because if they do, this State is going to have some big problems—bigger problems.\nSo what we've done is, we've gotten together with 200 other nations, American leadership, to say all of us have to start bringing down the carbon pollution that we send in the atmosphere. And here in the United States, there are two main ways we can do that. Number one is our power plants; we've got to start using cleaner energy. Number two, we've got to start promoting solar and wind, which create jobs. And we're a leader in this technology as long as we start investing in it.\nAnd that transition from old, dirty fuels to clean fuels, that's going to be tough. A lot of people make money in the coal industry, for example. A lot of people have worked there, historically. But now you actually have more people working in solar than you do in coal. Those communities that are reliant on coal, we should help them get a jump on making money in wind power and solar power. Those are hard-working, good people. Let's not have them stuck in old jobs that are going to be slowly declining. Let's get them in the new jobs that are going to be going up.\nAnd then, in our transportation sector, we need to continue to build on the things we've done since I've been President: doubling fuel efficiency standards on cars, promoting electric cars. All this stuff adds up. And the good new is, businesses can succeed, and we can make money doing it at the same time. But don't think that this is not a problem for all of us. This is the main message I have. We talked—that young lady was asking about curing cancer—well, we might cure cancer, but if temperatures have gone up 2, 3 degrees around the planet, 4 degrees, and oceans are rising, we've got—we're going to have more problems than medical science can cure. We've got to make that investment now. And we can do it.\nAll right. Good question. This gentleman right here. Hold on, I've got a mike right there. How you doing?\nQ. I can hold it.\nThe President. Go ahead.\nGovernment Efficiency/Department of Veterans Affairs/President's Legislative Agenda\nQ. I'm a big kid. [Laughter] Well, maybe I'm not a big kid. Okay. My name is Alan Tura, from near Youngstown, Ohio. You've been there many times in helping with the steel mills get back on track. That's all good. And in your defense, my business is doing good, making money, growing for the last 10 years. And I've got a lot of friends that have businesses; they're doing real well too. So for a lot of people that are complaining, there's a lot of people doing well. So I think if you hustle, you can make good.\nThe President. Absolutely.\nQ. But my question to you is, you're on your last year—is there any one big thing that you'd like to see happen before you leave the office?\nThe President. Good. The—well, first of all, what's your business?\nQ. Well, I've got a couple of businesses. I manufacture Halloween props, and I own a haunted house and hay ride in Lordstown, Ohio, which you've been there many times, to the car plant.\nThe President. I've been, yes.\nQ. It's called Fear Forest. Maybe if you make it back into Youngstown in October, you can come check it out. But I make Halloween props, and I like to scare people.\nThe President. [Laughter] So that's kind of interesting. That's fun. The—you sell a lot of Obama masks? [Laughter]\nQ. Hey, Obama is not scary. So——\nThe President. There you go, all right. I don't think so.\nI—the things that I talked about in the State of the Union are all things that I think are possible. Some of them I can get done on my own. So I'll give you a couple of examples.\nWe need to revamp how our information systems, our IT systems in Government work. This is one of the areas where we're—there's a biggest gap between Government and the private sector is—if you just want to order a pizza, you've got your smartphone and you just—and the pizza shows up. Yes, you want to buy an airline ticket, you punch in a couple things and suddenly if you go to the airport it's all printing out. And the systems in Government are really old.\nNow, that causes two problems. Number one is, they're less safe and secure than they should be because they're old. They're outdated systems. So it's easier for folks to try to hack into them, break into them, and we're constantly putting patches up.\nThe second thing is, it just means that things are slower for customers. And I want to make sure Government is in the 21st century, and we're systematically going agency through agency. If you want to get a small business loan from the SBA, I want you to be able to go to one website, in English, be able to figure out what you need to do, apply online, get that money, start that business, put people to work. And right now we're continually trying to streamline that process.\nAnd we've made some good progress. But that's an example of something that we can do administratively. The same is true, by the way, for the VA. You'll remember—we are so proud of our veterans and our young men and women who served. And we got some folks here looking sharp in uniform that we are grateful for their service. And we have put more resources and provided more support to—and increased budgets for the VA than any administration in history. We have cut backlogs. We included folks who had been affected by agent orange. We have boosted the resources available for folks suffering from PTSD. We are ending veterans' homelessness. We've made some huge investments, made really good progress. But you'll remember that story that came out last year, or a year and a half ago, in Phoenix, where folks were waiting so long to try to get an appointment that—and many of these were elderly, aging folks, and they were dying before they got an appointment. And it was unacceptable.\nWhen we did an investigation of what had happened—and what was worse was some of the administrators there were hiding what was going on and manipulating, sort of, records in ways that meant they had to be fired. But when you looked at what was going on, a lot of it had to do with the fact that they had a system where a veteran would call in trying to get an appointment, somebody was writing it down on paper, then they were tapping it into some 30-year-old computer system that would then print out something that then would get walked over to someplace, that then they'd have to match—it was a mess. And so we've had to make big investments in trying to clean up that whole process. So that's what we can do without Congress.\nSome things I think we can do with Congress, I've already mentioned. I think we can get criminal justice reform passed. I think that we can potentially do some work on what I just identified, the earned-income tax credit, that would help millions of people around the country who are working hard get out of poverty. And on the issue of medicine, I think that we're seeing some bipartisan work to try to bring together all the resources we have around these new medical breakthroughs that could potentially, not just affect things like cancer, but also Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, and a lot of diseases that people suffer from. It's a good story, and it's not as politically controversial as some other issues.\nNow, there are some things I'd love to do, like raising the minimum wage all—for everybody. I'd love to get immigration reform passed. But I'm realistic that Congress probably will not act on some of those more controversial issues. That's where people are going to have to make a decision in this election. That's what elections are about. You've got to decide which direction America needs to go in.\nOkay, let's see. These folks have been neglected, so I've got to pay them a little attention here. It's a young lady's turn. Well, you've got a beautiful dress on. Let's just call on you. There you go.\nCriminal Justice Reform\nQ. Mr. President, I'm Judge Trudy M. White, and I'm the district court judge here in the 19th judicial district court.\nThe President. Good to see you, Judge.\nQ. I am also the reentry court judge for our parish. And I did notice when you spoke at the State of the Union, you made your address, that the first issue that you did address was criminal justice reform. I'd like to know, as a reentry court judge, what incentives could you offer our Governor—our new Governor and Governors across the United States, that would provide opportunities for felons who are returning as they exit the criminal justice system?\nThe President. Well, Judge, you probably know more than I do. [Laughter]\nQ. Well, can my people get with your people to get those incentives down here? [Laughter]\nThe President. Absolutely. I'll have my people call your people. [Laughter]\nQ. All right. The President. But I will tell you what I know I've seen with my own eyes.\nI was in Camden with a fellow Federal district court judge who had taken—who had worked with the U.S. attorney there to supplement some of the reentry programs that were already there with some grants. And this judge, she's a wonderful woman, just like you. And she had this terrific lead probation officer. And together, what they had done is just made sure that anybody who got released, the day they were out, they were getting a call from the probation officer. And the probation officer was saying, all right, what do you need? Do you need clothes? What are you doing in terms of a place to stay? How are you going to think about getting your résumé together? Do you have an alarm clock? Just basic stuff. How are you going to get around?\nBecause so often, what happens is, these young people are getting released, and they're just dropped off in the neighborhood where they were. Oftentimes, part of the reason they got down a wrong path in the first place is the mom and dad might not have been there, or they might have moved by now, and so they're literally all alone.\nAnd so this young man who was there, who had gone through this process, he had been arrested when he was 17 and had a record that accumulated, then arrested at 27, spent 10 years in Federal prison, was released at 37. And he really decided, I want to change my life. He had a spiritual awakening. And he started just pounding the pavement and got a job at a fast food place. And he was describing what it was like. He had been doing this about 3 months, and he still didn't have enough money for rent, and the halfway house that he was staying at, it was about to kick him out because they only have a certain number of slots, and you don't stay there long enough.\nAnd he was saying how his old friends, the drug dealers and the gang bangers who he had used to run with, they would come up every once in a while, and he'd be sitting there in his uniform serving—flipping burgers and serving food, and they'd be talking to him: \"Hey, man, any time you're ready. That—those are the only clothes you got? Those are the same shoes we saw you in 10 years ago; these are the—this is the new style.\" And that temptation for him was powerful.\nNow, this is where a well-designed reentry program comes in, because what happened was, the judge, the probation officer, they worked with him, signed him up. The judge, unfortunately, because the program didn't have a lot of money, had to basically do a collection, dig into her own pocket. But they got the fees to have him go study at a community college to be an emergency medical technician. And he ended up graduating from this class, working for a private health firm, and then, by the time he was sitting next to me 3 or 4 years later, or maybe 5 years later, he's now working for the county as an EMT, fully trained, saving lives.\nBut the point is that it required intensive intervention and support and help, but what a smart investment that was. Because if we spent whatever it cost during those 1, 2, 3 years of transition to help that person get their life straight, we might have just saved ourselves another 10 years or 15 years or 20 years of incarcerating him on taxpayer expense.\nSo it made me realize that if we really want to be smart on crime—you've got, let's say, a maximum minimum sentence—mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years for some drug-related charge—if we reduced the amount of time that they're incarcerated, took all those savings and we took just some of that for 1, 2 years of reentry programs that are highly supervised, then we're going to get better results—safer streets, better citizens—because he's now paying taxes as an EMT instead of taking taxes as a ward of the State. Less violence. More hope. He's got an opportunity now to be a father, as opposed to an absent presence in a child's life. That's how we rebuild communities. And that's why this is such a promising area.\nAnd as I said, I want to make sure to acknowledge, this is an area where there's been some really powerful bipartisan, interesting coalitions. I think the evangelical community, because they have a lot of strong prison ministries, they care about this, they believe in redemption and second chances. And so they've gotten involved. And you've got libertarians who just don't like the idea of the State spending that much money on prisons. They've gotten involved. And so there's a lot of good work. And as I said, Cedric has been a leader in this process, so we've got to see if we can make this happen, all right? But \"my people get with your people.\"\nThat redhead right there. It's good having hair like that. You stand out in a crowd.\nEducation\nQ. My name is Martin Brown. I'm from Baton Rouge, Louisiana. And my question is about education. Education is one of the most important things in achieving equal opportunity. And in the past decades, we've seen desegregation orders lifted, and we've seen a resegregation in the South. Furthermore, there's huge disparities in resources for different students in different school districts and parishes. And I was wondering, what can the Federal Government do, what have you done, and what do you think should happen in the future to resolve these issues that we have been fighting for decades?\nThe President. Are you a teacher, by the way?\nQ. I'm not. I'm a student. [Laughter]\nThe President. The—where are you going to school?\nQ. LSU.\nThe President. Fantastic. What are you studying?\nQ. Math and economics.\nThe President. All right. Well, maybe you'll solve this problem. [Laughter] Well, thanks for the question. It's a great question.\nI talked about this at the town hall. In this—or in the State of the Union. This economy will become more and more knowledge based during the course of our lifetimes, our children's lifetimes, our grandchildren's lifetimes. There's no denying it. That is not going to change. And so when people talk about how the economy is changing and what—how come we can't have it the way it was back in the fifties and sixties, it used to be that if you were willing to work hard, you could drop out of high school, walk into the factory, say, \"I'm ready to work,\" and if you showed yourself to be a hard worker, you could actually build a middle class life on the factory floor. And that's great.\nBut if you go into a factory today, it's full of computers and robots. And if you don't know math and you don't know science, you can't get that job on the factory floor. And by the way, because of automation and technology, when I go to a car plant—and our—we sold more cars—U.S. automakers sold more cars last year than any time in history. It has come all the way back. It has rehired hundreds of thousands of folks. We created 900,000 manufacturing jobs. But you go into a plant, and it's just quiet and clean, and probably where—if you used to have a thousand people in that plant, now you've got a hundred, just because it's so automated. And the point is, you are not going to be able to build a middle class life in this society unless you have some education and skills that you can continually enhance and retool throughout your career. That's just—so, young people, I'm going to be honest—I'm not going to call him out, but if you're Ben Simmons, maybe you'll do fine not hitting the books, but—although he's a very fine student, I'm sure. But I—but my point is, unless you are one in a million, you'd better be working hard. You'd better be studying. And it's not going to stop.\nNow, the point you made is exactly right. How do we make sure everybody gets that opportunity? Because we know what the ingredients are. We know that early childhood education makes a huge difference, the kind of start that young people get. We know that poorer kids oftentimes are not starting off in school with the same vocabulary because they haven't heard as many words, which means that we've got to train parents, not just teachers, to help get kids rolling. We know that schools that have great teachers and high standards and are creative and have the best technologies and are—that are used the right way make a difference. That high expectations make a difference. So we know all these things.\nBut the way that education in America has been organized is, local school districts, local control, and local property funding as the primary way of supporting schools. And that has led to big disparities in every State in the country. So the Federal Government can't get at that. What the Federal Government has done and can do is, through programs like Title I funding, we provide additional money to school districts that have a high proportion of low-income kids to try to give them more resources. The Federal Government—what I've done during my administration is worked with States and local school districts to give them incentives to adopt best practices to help develop and train teachers to more effectively teach kids to make sure that we've got high expectations and high standards.\nWe just—I just signed, last year, a reform of No Child Left Behind, that had led to a lot of overtesting and stress among teachers, but had not necessarily improved learning. But ultimately, it's going to be up to States and local school districts to make a decision about how much do we care about equities in funding within States. That's not something the Federal Government can force States to do.\nThere was a case way back in the seventies that was brought before the U.S. Supreme Court making the argument that it was unconstitutional to have this property tax-based system of funding education. And the Supreme Court said it's not unconstitutional; it's up to States to make a decision on what they want to do. Some State supreme courts have said it's unconstitutional to fund education that way.\nBut if you don't have States making those decisions, the Federal Government can't force them to. We can help. We can give incentives. But Federal funding for education accounts only about for 7 percent of total education funding. The main thing we can do is hold up best practices, show people this is what works, this is what doesn't, and then the people of those communities have to determine, this is what we want to do to make a real serious change. All right?\nNow, one last point I'm going to make on education: Making sure folks like Che can afford college is critical. And if I had my wish about what I could get Congress to do—I mentioned a whole bunch of issues—one of them also would be the proposal I've put forward: 2 years of community college at no cost for responsible students.\nTennessee has already adopted this. Tennessee has already adopted this proposal. The city of Chicago is working to adopt it. So you've got Democrats and Republicans who have seen the wisdom of this. If young people can go to a community college for 2 years at no cost, that means they can get a lot of credits out of the way. They can then transfer to a 4-year institution. But they've cut their costs in half. And this is an affordable proposal. I mean, we proposed paying for it essentially by closing some corporate tax loopholes and some tax breaks for hedge funds. It's enough money to actually make sure that every young person has at least that baseline. And that's part of the reason why America became an economic superpower was because, earlier than anybody else, we said we're going to give everybody universal high school education. Now, the next step is, everybody in addition to high school education should be able to get that 2 years of postsecondary education as well.\nAll right? So how much time do I have? I've got to check with my people. One or two more questions. Okay, this young lady right there. You can stop jumping. [Laughter] Yes, I just called on you, but do you actually have a question, or were you just jumping? [Laughter] Just—all right, where is the mike? Right here. Right here. Yes, you. I don't know why you're surprised. [Laughter] She—you raised your hand.\nFirst Lady Michelle Obama/President's Advice for Young People\nQ. Thank you so much for taking my question. First off, my name is Angana Turner. I'm a law student at Tulane, in New Orleans, in the Big Easy.\nThe President. There you go.\nQ. I'm here with my little sister and one of my other friends from Tulane, who also went to Columbia for undergrad.\nThe President. Okay.\nQ. First off, I just want to say that we're very inspired by you and the First Lady.\nThe President. That's nice.\nQ. And you are our biggest inspirations. And we want to be just like you guys, so can you help us? Give us some tips? [Laughter]\nThe President. I'm sorry, what was the question? [Laughter]\nQ. The question is, can you help us be more like you and the First Lady and give us some tips to be——\nThe President. Some tips?\nQ. Yes.\nThe President. Well, look, I will say this. Michelle and I, we've been through an extraordinary journey. When we think about where we've come from, Michelle grew up on the South Side of Chicago. Her mom was a secretary. Her dad worked at the water filtration plant. Neither of them ever went to college. They lived on the second floor of her mom's sister's house, a little bungalow. She was—we were talking the other day, she was watching HGTV. She likes watching HGTV. And for those of you who don't know, Home and Garden TV. [Laughter]\nAnd I guess there was this show about this so-called movement or trend towards tiny houses, right? So people get these little, tiny—some of them they put on—hitch on the back of their car, some of them they're already there. She said, I didn't know this was a movement because we lived in a tiny house. [Laughter] I—we just thought that's how you live. We didn't know this was a—we were cutting edge. [Laughter]\nAnd so her—Michelle, her brother, her dad, her mom—her dad, by the way, had multiple sclerosis, so he's going to work every day. He had to wake up an hour early to get to work because it took a long time for him to just button his shirt and get in the car and then get out of the car and then get to his job.\nAnd in that second floor, with—and I know, because Michelle and I, right after we got married, we stayed in that same place before we were able to save up enough to buy our place. These two folks were able to raise these incredible young people, Michelle and her brother, who both ended up going to college and both had these extraordinary careers.\nNow, I say all that because Michelle would be the first to say—and I certainly would be the first to say—the only reason this happened was because there were people who invested in us. So there were park programs in Chicago, public park programs, where she could be part of dance classes and her brother could be in Little League. And there were accelerated programs at her public elementary school where she had teachers who really took extra time. And then, there was a magnet school that she was able to attend and that was able to get her prepared for college. And then, she got student loans and support in order to be able to go to college and go to law school. Although, she tells the story about how her dad, he couldn't really contribute much, but he insisted on writing something, a check, to help support that college education for her and her brother because he knew what it was worth.\nAnd so when you ask sort of the main tip I have—look, we benefited because somebody invested in us. The most important tip I would have is make sure not only are you working hard to deserve that investment, but that you're also investing in the next generation coming up behind you. If you do that—if you do that—then you're going to do great things. And your sister will do great things.\nAnd the one other young—the one other thing I tell young people all the time: Don't worry so much about what you want to be, worry about what you want to do. Worry about the kind of person you want to be and what you want to accomplish. And the reason I say that is because a lot of times people ask me, oh, I'm interested in politics, how can I get—I say, well, let me tell you, the people who are most successful in politics and business and whatever, they don't start off saying, I want to be President or Governor; they start off by saying, I want to give people a better education, or I want to make sure that folks have jobs, or I believe in justice under the law. And they pursue a goal. They're trying to get something done.\nA byproduct of that is that they may find themselves in positions of authority or power or influence. But even if you never get elected to something, if you're interested in the environment, you don't have to be the head of the EPA to make a difference. You might organize in a local community to clean up a site and plant gardens and make sure that the water is clean. And you can look back and then say, wow, what an amazing life I've had, and look at all the difference that I've made.\nAnd I'll tell you, the same is true in business. The most successful business people—if you talk to somebody like a Bill Gates, they don't start off saying, \"I want to be the second richest man in the world.\" They start off saying, \"I really want to figure out this computer thing.\" \"I want to make this thing work better.\" \"I'm excited or interested in how we can solve this problem.\" And then, because they're so passionate about it and they've worked so hard at it, it turns out, they make something really good, and they're—everybody else says, I want to be part of that. That, I think, is a good tip as well.\nAll right. I've only got time for one more question. It's a young man's turn, and he's right in front, and he looks very sharp. He's got his tie on and everything.\nHistorically Black Colleges and Universities\nQ. How you doing, Mr. President?\nThe President. How you doing? What's your name?\nQ. My name is Anthony King. And I am an 18-year-old mass communications major, and I go to the Southern University and A&M College. [Applause]\nThe President. All right, okay.\nQ. Mr. President, first, I would like to say thanks for being an inspiration, because I aspire to be where you are in the next 30 years, and I know I will be there.\nThe President. Okay.\nQ. But one of my main questions for you, sir, Mr. President—going to an HBCU institute such as Southern University, most times, I know when I go recruit off of high school students, most of the time, a lot of them say: \"Oh, I don't want to go to an HBCU because I feel like if I go to an HBCU, I won't get as many opportunities as a student at a university as LSU or Tulane.\" So what is your take of—or advice to students like me, thousands of students like me who go to HBCUs, and us finishing the course in order to be great leaders in this society?\nThe President. Okay. All right. [Applause] See, you've got some folks voting for you already.\nWell, first of all, the role of the Historically Black Colleges and Universities in producing our leadership and expanding opportunity—training doctors and teachers and lawyers and ministers who change the landscape of America—I hope most people know that story, and if not, you'd better learn it. Because it has been powerful and continues to be a powerful tradition.\nAnd I will tell you that if you have done well at an HBCU and graduated and you go to an employer and are making the kind of presentation you make or a Morehouse man makes or a Spelman young lady makes, you will do just fine. I don't think it's true that actually people don't take that—or discount that tradition. And you will be credentialed. You'll succeed.\nI do think that there's a range of challenges that HBCUs face. Some are doing great; some are having more difficulty. And some of that's good. Look—or some of it is the result of good things. We don't live in a society where African Americans are restricted in what colleges they can go to. And I want them to be able to go to an LSU or a Tulane as well as a Southern, as well as a Morehouse, as well as a Howard or a Spelman. That—so more opportunities open up. That's good.\nWe have been very supportive of HBCUs over the last several years. And to their credit, the previous administration had supported them as well. There are some HBCUs that are having trouble with graduation rates. And that is a source of concern. And what we've said to those HBCUs is, we want to work with you, but we don't want a situation in which young people are taking out loans, getting in debt, thinking that they're going to get a great education, and then, halfway through, they're dropping out. Now, some of it is, those HBCUs may be taking chances on some kids that other schools might not. And that's a positive thing, and that has to be taken into account. But we also have to make sure that colleges—any college, HBCU or non-HBCU—take seriously the need to graduate that student and not load them up with debt.\nEverybody needs a college education or a secondary education—an education beyond high school. Even if it's at a community college, if it's a technical school, if it's a training program, you're going to need more training as your career goes on.\nBut I don't want you taking out a Pell grant or a bunch of—not a Pell grant—like a Federal loan or a private loan, and you walk out with $50,000, $60,000, $100,000 worth of debt, and you didn't get your degree. So we are working very hard with every school, all colleges and universities, not just to reduce costs, but also to increase graduation rates, give students a better sense as they come in—here's what it's going to take for you to finish; here's why you've got to not lollygag and not take enough credits and think going to college is about partying, because it's actually about getting your degree. And we want students and parents to be better informed about that process ahead of time.\nAll right, listen, you guys have been wonderful. Michelle, Sasha, Malia, Bo, Sunny, they all send their love. But I want—before we go, I want to remind you of what I said. Our system of government only works when you are involved not just by voting, but by being informed and staying involved throughout the process. Your Governor, your mayor, your Congressman, they all want to do right by you. But there are going to be challenges. There are going to be folks who want to stop progress. There are going to be people who like the status quo. There's always going to be in this democracy countervailing pressures. And if you want to see change, you've got to help make it happen.\nWhen I ran for office in 2007, 2008, I did not say, \"Yes, I can.\" I said——\nAudience members. Yes, we can!\nThe President. Yes, we can, people. God bless you. Love you. Thank you, New Orleans. God bless America.", "timestamp": "2016-01-14", "title": "Remarks and a Question-and-Answer Session at a Town Hall Meeting at McKinley Senior High School in Baton Rouge, Louisiana"}

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111403", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n11:18 A.M. EST\nMR. EARNEST: Good morning, everybody. Happy Friday. I just want to do one quick thing at the top before we go to questions, and this is just in response to a number of questions that we've received over the last couple of weeks about the implementation of the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\nWe are aware that Iran has made important progress in fulfilling the obligations and commitments that they made in the context of that international agreement to dismantle significant portions of their nuclear infrastructure. There are important steps that they have committed to take, and they will not be receiving any sort of sanctions relief until the IAEA has been able to independently verify that those steps have been completed and the IAEA also, moving forward, will preserve significant capability to monitor Iran's nuclear program to verify their ongoing compliance with the agreement.\nSo just as a quick reminder, it seems useful to walk through very briefly the steps that Iran has committed to take before any sanctions relief will be provided. This includes essentially -- or completely shutting down every pathway that Iran has to acquiring enough fissile material to develop a nuclear weapon. That meant that Iran had to follow through with a commitment to eliminate 98 percent of their uranium stockpile. We do actually know that this is one element of their commitments that they did fulfill -- they shipped 25,000 pounds of enriched uranium out of the country over the holidays.\nThey also made a commitment to stop spinning thousands of centrifuges, and to remove and to place into storage 13,000 of those centrifuges. And those storage facilities will also be monitored by the IAEA to ensure that they remain there.\nAnd, most importantly, there will be ongoing monitoring by the IAEA of Iran's nuclear program. And that's critical because we do have the ability if we detect that Iran is not fulfilling all of their commitments that we can snap sanctions back into place. And that is written into the agreement, as well.\nSo I don't have an update for you on timing -- I think that is a key question, and there's obviously understandable interest in that -- I don't have an update for you on timing. But we know that Iran is making important progress. But ultimately, the limiting factors here are both Iran's completion of these tasks, and the ability of the IAEA to independently verify that those tasks have been completed. So that's essentially what remains to be done.\nAnd all of it underscores the significance of this agreement. And obviously critics of the agreement and critics of the administration note that Iran will get sanctions relief. The amount of that sanctions relief is often exaggerated by the critics. But somehow they fail to acknowledge that when President Obama took office, the world was quite concerned that Iran was racing to enhance their military -- or enhance their nuclear capacity so that they could build a nuclear weapon. And in fact, because of the tough and principled diplomacy that was advanced by President Obama, we've actually seen Iran dismantle so much of their nuclear architecture that we have blocked every pathway they have to building a nuclear weapon.\nAnd that's a substantial accomplishment. It certainly makes the world safer. It strengthens the security of our closest allies around the world, particularly Israel. And it enhances the national security of the United States, and that's why the President pursued it.\nQ: Question on that.\nMR. EARNEST: Sure.\nQ: When you say \"timing,\" do you mean waiting for the IAEA to issue a statement of verification?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't want to leave you with the impression that that's the only thing that we're waiting on; that we are both waiting for Iran to complete the steps that they said that they would take, and for the IAEA to independently verify that those steps have been completed.\nIt's important not to separate those two things because it may, in fact, be, Mark, that they have completed all of the steps that they need to take, but we're not going to take their word for it. We're actually going to make sure that we have independent verification by nuclear experts. So we see those two things -- they're two steps, but we see them as inextricably linked, primarily because we're just not going to take the Iranians' word for it if they've taken the steps that they've -- that they have taken the steps that they're supposed to take.\nQ: Well, that makes it sound like the IAEA is what you're waiting for.\nMR. EARNEST: I don't mean to leave you with that impression because it may be that Iran hasn't taken actually the steps that they're supposed to take. So these are just inextricably linked. But I think the leadership in Iran has made quite clear that they are working aggressively to fulfill their end of the bargain. And we certainly welcome the zeal with which they are pursuing the fulfillment of their commitments. But at the same time, Mark, we also want to make sure that they don't cut any corners. And that's why independent verification has been in some ways the key part of this agreement from the beginning because there is, based on their history, a lot of distrust about the way that Iran talked publicly about their nuclear program in particular.\nSo again, they are two steps, but they are inextricably linked.\nRon, did you have something on this, too?\nQ: Yes. You said that the amount of sanctions relief that they're going to get is often exaggerated. What is the accurate amount, or how would you describe what they are getting currently?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, my colleagues at the Treasury Department can give you a little bit more detail on this. The number that is often cited by critics of the deal is $150 billion, and our experts have indicated that that is, like I said, an exaggeration. The number that I have heard is that it's closer to $50 billion or $100 billion, not $150 billion. And the reason for that is, in part, that Iran has a lot of bills that have come due, and so much of the sanctions relief that they will receive will immediately be devoted to paying off debts that they have incurred.\nThe second thing that's important for people to understand is that the sanctions relief that they receive will merely allow them to get access to their own money that is currently in the international financial system. So it's not as if there's an impact on the taxpayers of the United States here. These are essentially sanctions that were designed by the United States, enforced by the world, to essentially limit or outright prevent Iran's access to their own money that was in the international system.\nQ: They're getting the growth on that money.\nMR. EARNEST: I'm sorry?\nQ: They're getting the growth on that money as well, plus debts.\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I'm not suggesting that Iran is not getting anything. I'm just suggesting that they're not getting any financial resources from the United States. It's their own money.\nSecond, it's worth being accurate about what the amount of money that is -- it's not $150 billion. For a more precise calculation I'd refer you to the Treasury Department. And the reason that I wanted to go through this exercise is it's often described by our critics as what Iran is getting, but they fail to note what the international community is getting and what the United States is getting, and what impact that has on our national security.\nAnd what we're getting is verifiable confirmation that Iran won't have a nuclear weapon. And as recently as five or six years ago, there was a real concern about what would happen to Israel and to our security interests in the Middle East because of Iran's aggressive pursuit of a nuclear weapon. It wasn't that long ago -- a year ago -- that the assessment of the United States' intelligence community that Iran was within three months -- that essentially they had a three-month breakout period.\nNow, we know that once this deal goes through and hopefully that will be soon, that breakout period will be extended to a year. And because of our verification measures, we'll know right away once they have begun to take those steps.\nSo again, the benefits for the United States, for Israel, for our other allies and partners in the region when it comes to our national security are significant, despite the fact they are often overlooked by our critics.\nQ: You mentioned Israel. Has there been any -- have there been any discussions, or is there a strategy to talk to Israel? Are there discussions going on as this becomes more imminent? I know there's that task force examining the overall aid package.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, exactly.\nQ: But is there something specific going on with the Israelis to reassure them now as we approach this implementation day?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, you touched on the main part of that, which is the work that is ongoing between senior officials here in the United States and senior national security officials in Israel to discuss the extension and expansion of the memorandum of understanding about U.S. military support to Israel.\nAnd the President has talked about how the commitment on the part of the United States to Israel's national security is unshakeable. And Prime Minister Netanyahu has himself observed that kind of assistance that's been provided by the United States under the leadership of President Barack Obama to Israel has been unprecedented. And we're seeking to further extend and deepen that kind of coordination and cooperation in the context of these discussions. And that is something that they're working on hard, too.\nLet me go back to Darlene. I don't want to skip Darlene, but I'll come back to you guys.\nQ: Thanks. The governor of Michigan has asked President Obama to issue an emergency disaster declaration over the crisis with lead in the drinking water in Flint. Do you have a sense of how quickly the administration expects to make a decision on that request?\nMR. EARNEST: There's a formal process at FEMA for considering these kinds of requests. That process is ongoing, and given the nature of the kinds of requests that are made in that system, those requests are considered expeditiously. Just a matter of course, this one will be as well.\nI think it's important to note, Darlene, there are already a number of things that the federal government has done to respond to this ongoing situation. There actually already are FEMA personnel that have been deployed to Flint to serve as a liaison between the long-term recovery committee that was established by the governor and the relevant federal agencies that may be able to assist with existing programs and funds. There also was FEMA staff that was deployed to Michigan to provide some logistical and technical support to the state and local officials who are on the ground responding to the situation.\nI also know that there has been some physical supplies that have been provided by FEMA to the state of Michigan to respond to this situation, specifically bottled water. FEMA has a regular process where they stockpile commodities for use in responding to emergency situations. And just as a matter of course, what FEMA will do is that when those commodities get close to their expiration date, they often will donate those resources to charity. But in this case, they had bottled water that was nearing its expiration date that they were prepared to donate to charity that has been redirected to this ongoing response effort in Michigan.\nSo there are a number of resources that have already been dedicated by the federal government to assist state and local officials who are responding to this situation.\nWhat I didn't mention is that both the EPA and the Department of Justice have indicated that they're taking a close look at this situation in terms of the science and in terms of the impact that it has had and could have on local populations. The Department of Justice is obviously taking a look at the decisions that led to this particular situation. So there's a lot that's already going on in Flint. But obviously the governor has made a request through the formal process, and it's a request that we'll consider expeditiously.\nQ: Is there a chance there could be a decision as early as this weekend?\nMR. EARNEST: The potential for that certainly exists. For an update on the timing, I'd actually refer you to FEMA.\nQ: And then, to follow up on the terrorist attack in Indonesia the other day, what does it say about the strength of the Islamic State that they've now carried a terrorist in Indonesia, which is kind of far away from some of the other places they have carried out similar attacks?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there are a couple of concerns when it relates to the ability of ISIL to spread their violence, mayhem and murderous ideology. The first is concern about foreign fighters. These are individuals who have traveled from around the globe to Iraq and Syria to take up arms alongside ISIL. The concern obviously is that these individuals could use their foreign passports to return to their home country and organize and carry out acts of violence.\nThere's a substantial number of individuals from Indonesia who have traveled to Iraq and Syria to take up arms alongside ISIL. And so the threat that is posed by foreign fighters is significant, one the Indonesians are keenly aware of.\nThis is also a concern that the President himself is keenly aware of. And that's why, almost a year and a half ago now, the President convened a meeting of the National Security Council -- or the United Nations Security Council to discuss how the international community could coordinate our efforts to combat foreign fighters, to share intelligence, to share information about individuals who are traveling. And that has enhanced the security of nations around the world. Obviously, there is more that we can do when it comes to information sharing to try to combat this effort.\nThe second source of concern, Darlene, is actually a concern that is acutely held here in the United States, too, which is the way in which ISIL has capitalized on social media to spread their ideology and to try to radicalize vulnerable individuals. And so there obviously is an effort -- an aggressive effort that we have mounted both here in the United States and around the world to try to combat their online radicalization efforts. And, in fact, when the President was in Southeast Asia -- he was in Malaysia -- he talked about how the United States was supporting the Malaysians as they established a regional fusion center that could be used to coordinate the effort to counter ISIL's online radicalization attempts.\nSo there are a variety of ways in which we are supporting the Indonesians as they counter this threat. I don't mean to leave you with the impression that we know exactly at this point -- or at least that we're prepared to talk publicly at this point about who carried out the heinous attacks that you referred to or how they were able to carry out those attacks. That's still under investigation by the Indonesians, and we have offered our support to them.\nAnd as I mentioned yesterday, it certainly bears repeating that our thoughts and prayers continue to be with those Indonesians who were affected by this terrible act of violence.\nJeff.\nQ: Josh, there's another big selloff on Wall Street today. How closely is the White House tracking this? Are you concerned about it, and is it any signal of maybe some other problems with the economy despite the President's optimism that he expressed earlier this week at State of the Union?\nMR. EARNEST: Jeff, I'm always reluctant to talk about day-to-day movements in the stock market. That reluctance continues today. I would note that most of the market indexes, indices, closed somewhat higher yesterday, and now they're down again today.\nObviously, these are market movements that are closely watched at the Treasury Department. They watch financial markets all around the world and are carefully evaluating what sort of impact they could have on the broader economy here in the United States.\nI don't know that the President has been briefed on today's movements at all, but I think they highlight -- I guess there are three things that come to mind.\nThe first is, there are a lot of other data points to indicate the strength and durability of the U.S. economy. We just got jobs numbers one week ago today that showed at the end of last year that 292,000 jobs were created just in December of 2015, and that was the continuation of the longest streak of private sector job growth in our nation's history -- 70 months now, north of 14 million jobs created over that period of time. That's an indication that the U.S. economy continues to be quite durable despite -- and this is the second point I wanted to make -- despite the kind of volatility that we see overseas.\nNow, there's no denying that weakness in other markets with whom we do extensive business is going to be a headwind for the U.S. economy. We're mindful of that. Particularly as the international economy becomes more integrated, we have to be sensitive to movements that we see in the economies of other countries.\nThe third thing I'll say is that's why the President continued to aggressively advocate in his State of the Union for additional policies here in the United States that would allow us to build on the momentum that we're already seeing in the job market, but also allow us to strengthen the U.S. economy particularly for middle-class families that could be vulnerable to some of the effects that we're seeing from weaknesses in other countries' economies.\nSo that's why the President has championed nearer-term solutions, like investments in infrastructure and raising the minimum wage, but also encouraging Congress to take the kinds of steps now that will position our economy over the long term to succeed. And these are investments in early childhood education and other policies that would open the door to a college education to more students and workers and their families.\nSo the President has obviously got a lot of ideas. And I think that even some of those who are concerned about the impact of the market volatility today on the U.S. economy should join the President in thinking over the long term about what we can do to better prepare the country to withstand that kind of volatility in the future.\nQ: On a separate topic, following up on Michigan, did the EPA drop the ball on this issue? This is something that they've been aware of. Is there any concern that they didn't fulfill their duties on this apparent crisis in Michigan?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Jeff, at this point, I'm quite limited in what I can say about attributing any sort of blame for this particular situation, primarily because the Department of Justice is taking a look at this question. The EPA has obviously been involved, and they're involved now in trying to respond to the situation. But in terms of who could be to blame, what actions state officials took both before this incident and its immediate aftermath are questions that ultimately are being investigated and will have to be answered by the Department of Justice.\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, back on the Iran deal. It's my understanding that the IAEA issues this report and the member states look at it, Secretary of State Kerry will review, sign off, and that triggers the process for sanctions being lifted. Does the President intend to read this IAEA report or be briefed on it before that happens?\nMR. EARNEST: I would anticipate that the President will get a briefing on the findings, but I also would not anticipate that the need to review the IAEA report would lead to a significant delay in moving forward. Part of that's because we're in ongoing communications with the IAEA about their work, so it's unlikely there will be any surprises, which I think would allow us to review that report without any significant delay.\nQ: You could do this all in one day, a matter of hours?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have an update in terms of what the timing would look like or how quickly we could turn it around. My colleagues at the State Department may be able to give you a better assessment of that. But I would not anticipate a lengthy delay once a final IAEA report has been issued, primarily because we continue to be in regular communication with them about their ongoing review.\nQ: Josh, when you heard from the Secretary of State this week, he stood up at a podium and said Iran poured concrete into their reactor at Arak. We had a press release saying they'd shipped out uranium. It seems the U.S. is independently verifying some of these things. So I know that technically we're waiting on this IAEA report, but, frankly, it seems that the U.S. is saying we are full speed ahead, going ahead with this deal, regardless of that IAEA report -- that's just a technicality.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I assure you that when this agreement was being negotiated, the important, independent work of the IAEA was considered to be much more than a technicality. As I noted earlier, getting the IAEA access to the information that they need to verify the initial steps that Iran is taking and be positioned and have the access they need to verify their compliance with the agreement on an ongoing basis was a critical part of the agreement. And primarily that's because there's ample reason to distrust what Iran says about their nuclear program. Their track record on this is less than stellar.\nAnd rather than be in a situation where we're quibbling with them about what we assess and what they claim to have done, we have basically created a system that will allow independent, international nuclear experts significant access into Iran and their nuclear program to verify their ongoing compliance with the agreement. And that was a critical part of these negotiations, and that's why we're going to rely on those international experts moving forward to ensure that Iran is living up to their commitments.\nQ: But you had not only the incident with the sailors this week -- it was quickly resolved -- but you also have Iran testing ballistic missiles in the past few months and, as you continue to note, Iran meddling elsewhere in the world. So when you hear from the administration implementation day is just days away, it seems like a sure thing, it seems like no matter what misbehavior you see with Iran right now, this deal is on.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we have been quite clear from the very beginning -- long before a deal was even reached -- that the negotiations were focused primarily on Iran's nuclear program. That was our number one concern. It's also the number one concern of our allies in Israel, as well.\nThe reason that the United States, Israel, and the broader international community was concerned about the possibility of Iran developing a nuclear weapon is that in so many other areas Iran is a pretty bad actor. Iran supports terrorism. Iran has an aggressive ballistic missile program that is under development. Iran regularly menaces Israel. That's the kind of country you want to be sure doesn't have access to a nuclear weapon. That's why we made it a priority. That's why our international partners made it a priority -- that includes the U.K., France, Germany, China, and Russia. They all made that their priority. And we have succeeded -- or hopefully will soon succeed in verifying that Iran has taken the necessary steps to block every path they have to developing that nuclear weapon.\nThat doesn't eliminate the long list of concerns we have with their other behavior, but I think it does help explain why we've made preventing them from getting a nuclear weapon a top priority.\nNow, there are a variety of ways that we're going to continue to impress upon the Iranians the need to address our other concerns, as well. And we've been pretty clear about the fact that Iran is potentially subject to significant sanctions as a result of the ballistic missile testing that has been reported. So we're going to continue to apply pressure to them.\nRon mentioned the enhanced support that we're going to provide to our allies in the region, and that includes the Israelis, but also our partners like Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf countries.\nBut I think the other thing that is notable from all of this is that the diplomatic engagement that has brought us quite close to this international agreement to prevent them from obtaining a nuclear weapon is also helping the United States in other ways. It's because of that established diplomatic channel that we were able to promptly resolve the situation of the U.S. sailors that ended up in Iranian territorial waters.\nQ: -- incentive of sanctions relief just days away.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, let me explain why I brought this up. There are a lot, again, of our critics who suggested rather rash and irresponsible reactions to this situation. One U.S. senator suggested that the United States should delay the State of Union address. There was one U.S. senator who was on television last night who was apparently suggesting that in response to the situation the President of the United States should have bombed or invaded Iran or both. It's unclear to me exactly how either of those proposed responses would have resulted in a better outcome, because the outcome, as we all saw, was that these sailors, 14 hours after they were picked up in Iranian waters, were released unharmed with their boats.\nSo I do think that the kind of diplomatic engagement that the President has aggressively pursued in the face of blistering criticism from our critics has I think quite clearly shown how it advances our national security interests to pursue the approach that the President has. And again, I think it is difficult for our critics to make an argument otherwise.\nQ: But you mentioned that Iran could be sanctioned for its ballistic missile testing. Are you saying that the U.S. can now sanction Iran for testing ballistic missiles once this deal goes through?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we have never taken off the table the ability of the United States to impose sanctions on Iran based on our other concerns about their behavior.\nQ: But you've delayed that action?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there has been significant discussion about the possibility that the United States could impose sanctions on Iran over their ballistic missile program. And I certainly wouldn't rule out that that's something that could be imposed here at any time. So that has always been an option on the table. And we talked about how the nuclear agreement would not resolve the long list of concerns that we have about their ballistic missile program or about their human rights record or about their menacing of Israel. We've also been clear that this nuclear agreement did not in any way impair our ability to hold Iran accountable for those kinds of nefarious activities, either.\nQ: Lastly, once this is -- the technicalities of all this are done, would you anticipate that the President might call President Rohani and perhaps personally ask for the return of the five American civilians -- at least five Americans who are still held in Tehran?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any presidential phone calls to preview for you, and I'm not aware of any current plans for the President to telephone his Iranian counterpart.\nAs it relates to those Americans who are currently and unjustly held by Iran, we have -- in the context of these nuclear negotiations, Secretary Kerry made clear that every time he met with his counterpart to discuss their nuclear program, he also made it a point to raise our ongoing concerns about these Americans who are being unjustly detained. And that's an indication that we have made this a priority.\nYou've heard the President talk about how this issue is quite personal to him. I don't have an update for you of our ongoing efforts to secure their release, but we certainly believe strongly, and have made it a priority, to tell the Iranians that we're ready for our American citizens who are being unjustly detained in Iran to be released.\nQ: So, in short, you don't think that the U.S. loses leverage on Iran to get the American civilians back by giving the sanctions relief and taking the pressure off of its economy?\nMR. EARNEST: It is our view that these are -- we have always made clear that we would not -- and it would not be in the best interest of those unjustly detained Americans to make their cases somehow contingent on this nuclear agreement. That's not going to make it easier for us to get them -- to bring them home. We continue to have -- to make a strong case to the Iranians that these Americans are being unjustly detained in their country and that they should be released. We've made clear that that's a priority. And it will continue to be until they're brought home.\nLaura.\nQ: Yesterday night at the Republican debate, as usual, the President was attacked several times on foreign policy. Did he watch the debate? And what's his reaction to those candidates saying America is a mess and does not have any more influence all over the world?\nMR. EARNEST: Unfortunately, I did watch part of the debate last night. I regretted it deeply. I don't believe the President made that same mistake.\nAs for a response or a rebuttal, the President had the opportunity on Tuesday night to address the nation, where he delivered his fundamentally optimistic and confident view about how the United States is the greatest country in the world. We have the most stable and durable economy of any nation in the world. We continue to have the greatest fighting force of any nation in the world. And we continue to have the capacity to advance our interests around the world. And we're using them.\nQ: Are you annoyed by those critics during the Republican debate?\nMR. EARNEST: No, primarily because we hear a lot of overheated rhetoric but not a lot of facts to substantiate it. The other thing that was notable about last night for me is I never thought I'd pine for the days of Herman Cain, but at least he had a 9-9-9 plan. It was outrageous, but at least he had an affirmative governing proposal and agenda. You didn't hear anybody with even a semblance of a 9-9-9 plan. So I don't think -- I mean, next to all these guys that were on the stage last night, Herman Cain looks like a policy wonk.\nAnd again, the reason that that is disappointing is the President is working hard to implement a forward-looking agenda that is going to expand economic opportunity for the middle class, that's going to make America safer around the world. And we've made a lot of progress just in the last few months with members of Congress reaching the kinds of legislative agreements that are going to advance that agenda. We reformed No Child Left Behind in a way that will improve our education system and not subject our students to too much testing. We passed a five-year transportation bill that will allow us to at least, over the long term, lock in some level of infrastructure funding. The President believes we need to increase that level of funding, but at least locking in that five-year guarantee will allow state and local governments across the country to invest in the kind of infrastructure projects that are good for our economy.\nBut there are other things, right, that we -- we made permanent tax cuts for middle-class families and those families that are working hard to get into the middle class. We reached a budget agreement that would allow us to adequately fund our economic and national security priorities $50 billion over the sequester levels that were advocated by a bunch of Republicans.\nSo the President has an affirmative agenda, and we are actually having success in advancing it, despite the kind of opposition we see from the Republicans who are actually in the majority of both houses of Congress. That's what leadership is, and that's what the American people expect out of their President. And we didn't see anything close to that on the stage last night.\nQ: Does the White House have any reaction about the Donald Trump comments on 9/11?\nMR. EARNEST: Not really. I mean, I didn't actually see that part of the debate that he delivered it, but I obviously read about his remarks. Look, there's no denying that people all across the country and around the world were inspired by the response of the people of New York City in the aftermath of 9/11. There's no denying that.\nDoug.\nQ: Is the administration at all troubled or embarrassed that Iran is using these images and video of these soldiers with blindfolds -- sailors with blindfolds on, or on their knees with their hands behind their back, for propaganda purposes?\nMR. EARNEST: Doug, primarily what we're concerned about when it came to our soldiers is making sure that they were released promptly and unharmed. And all of that happened within 14 hours of their originally being taken into Iranian custody when they drifted into Iranian territorial waters.\nQ: And were you troubled or embarrassed by Iran using these photos?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't think there's any reason for anybody to be embarrassed. I think there's reason for us to be certainly relieved that our servicemen and women who are protecting America in a very dangerous part of the world were released very -- pretty shortly after they were taken into custody.\nQ: Can you tell us what the rules are engagement that these sailors in these boats were operating under in the Persian Gulf?\nMR. EARNEST: The Department of Defense could give you a better sense of the kind of instructions that they were given before their mission began. What the Secretary of Defense has said is that they erroneously ended up in Iranian territorial waters. The circumstances that led them to this particular situation are still being investigated by the Department of Defense. It's conducting interviews with the soldiers who were involved, so there's more that we'll learn about the particular situation.\nQ: It seems it's a lot of cryptic blocking of information coming out. It's been well over 24 hours now; we have instant communication. These soldiers have been interrogated by their superiors. Presumably either the Pentagon or the White House would know precisely what went on. Yet so many -- there are so many gaps. In fact, we had a senior Pentagon official tell us yesterday that the administration is blocking the facts from getting out.\nMR. EARNEST: That's not true. I think we've been pretty transparent about this. And I think we've been transparent about the fact that if we had followed the advice of some of the Republican critics of the administration, we'd probably be in a bloody war with Iran right now over our sailors.\nThe fact is our sailors right now are out of harm's way. Their boats were released and there was no loss of life. It's unclear to me, by the way, exactly how the safety and security of the United States or our men and women in uniform is advanced by starting a war with a nation like Iran that has an advanced military.\nQ: These sailors are part of the Fifth Fleet. If their instructions are to do nothing -- and from all appearances, they were apprehended by much smaller boats, much less armed boats -- and we understand that we're not in a state of war with Iran, which, again, raises questions about Iran's behavior -- blindfolding these guys and holding them at gunpoint -- but they're members of the Fifth Fleet. Is the Fifth Fleet under instructions to do nothing in the event of something like this happening?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, you'd have to check with the Fifth Fleet. I feel pretty confident in telling you they didn't just do nothing. But you can go ask them exactly what their response was. Whatever it was, it was consistent with the President's strategy that led to the prompt and safe return of those sailors about 14 hours after they were originally taken into custody.\nJC.\nQ: Although I'm sure everyone is pleased, especially the sailors and their families, that they are returned safely, and diplomacy did lead the day, in a sense --\nMR. EARNEST: I think the only people who are unhappy about it are Republicans for some reason.\nQ: Well, that's their problem, I guess.\nMR. EARNEST: I guess it is.\nQ: The fact is that this could be very well seen as a violation of the Geneva Convention, where they were traipsed out in front of cameras -- which is totally a violation -- as prisoners, in a sense, under their jurisdiction. Has anyone given that any thought? And will there be a particular protest to that? Or are you pleased that it's over and you're moving on?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, JC, we certainly are pleased that it's over. We are pleased that our sailors were released unharmed and promptly, 14 hours after being taken into custody, and without shots being fired to secure their release.\nWhen it comes to the Geneva Convention, my understanding is that it primarily applies to prisoners of war. And obviously, as Doug noted, we're not at war with Iran. So based on what I've been told, the Geneva Convention doesn't apply in this particular circumstance.\nBut again, what we were focused on from the very beginning, from the earliest reports about this incident, was the safe and prompt return of our sailors. And that's exactly what we secure. And we did that without delaying the start of the State of the Union, and without launching any sort of military action against the nation of Iran.\nQ: But you could understand how the visual effect is a serious one. There were guns, they were blindfolded. War or not war, it depends on your definition of what that kind of --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, from that standpoint, JC -- we're not at war with Iran. And I'm also not denying that this is a dangerous situation. Clearly it is. Again, that's a reason for us to be appreciative of the sacrifices and risks that our men and women in the military take to keep us safe and to keep us free, and to advance our national security interests even in one of the most volatile regions of the world.\nI also think it underscores the value of responsible, mature presidential leadership. The President didn't start a war over this. The President pursued diplomatic engagement through his Secretary of State, who had an open, diplomatic channel of communication with his Iranian counterpart. And because of that important diplomatic work, our sailors were released, unharmed, 14 hours after being taken into custody, in their own boats. Again, as I said earlier, I think Republicans would be quite hard-pressed to make the case that a better outcome was possible here.\nGreg.\nQ: A year ago yesterday, Warren Weinstein was killed in a drone strike in the border region of Pakistan. Both you and President Obama, I think, after that strike, promised a review of what went wrong. And I guess, a year on, I'm hoping that you can share some of the conclusions of that. And I'm curious if you had the opportunity to share those conclusions with Mr. Weinstein's family.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Greg, as the President stated last spring, there are no words that can fully describe the pain and sorrow that Dr. Weinstein's family must be feeling about his loss. That pain and sorrow is felt by the President himself, who took responsibility for the counterterrorism operations that are conducted in that region of the world, including the one that claimed Dr. Weinstein's life.\nThe President took the extraordinary step of directing his national security team to make public as many details as possible about that operation, and to be forthright about the tragic loss of life. I should point out that Dr. Weinstein was not the only innocent civilian that was tragically killed in this incident. There's another individual from Italy, Mr. Lo Porto, who was also killed in that counterterrorism operation, and we mourn his loss as well.\nThe fact is, the American people, especially the Weinstein family, deserve to know the truth about what exactly happened. And that's why the President directed that his team make as much of this public as possible. Out of respect for the family, there's not a whole lot of more information that I can discuss publicly. There have been -- well, let me say it this way. The handling of this particular case has allowed the government to develop some better tools to more effectively engage with families who are in this tragic situation.\nOver the summer, we announced a whole set of reforms to the way in which the U.S. government is structured to ensure that we are effectively integrating the capabilities and information of a variety of government agencies that are responsible for trying to rescue American citizens. We want that process of trying to rescue American citizens as efficient and as effective as possible, as you'd expect. But the other thing that we wanted to improve was our ability to communicate with their families and to share as much information as we possibly could about what the United States government is doing to secure the release of their loved one, and to make sure that they are updated as frequently as possible with reliable information.\nAnd we put in place those reforms and we're hopeful that those reforms will allow us to do this work more effectively, both in terms of rescuing more Americans, but also in terms of being more sensitive and being more effective when communicating with their families back here at home.\nQ: Has the investigation into the strike led you to any conclusions about drone strikes and signature strikes? Has that led to any changes in the way we prosecute that portion of the war?\nMR. EARNEST: For any changes in policy, Greg, I think I'd have to refer you to the intelligence community on this. Obviously, over the last several years, the President has tried to implement some reforms to our counterterrorism operations more broadly and tried to more transparent.\nWhat is clear is that there continues to be an incredibly high standard for avoiding civilian casualties when carrying out counterterrorism operations. That standard hasn't changed. And in fact, that very high standard is also applied to operations that are carried out the United States military, as well. And I would note, just for your reference, that just earlier today Central Command issued a news release laying out a couple of incidents in the context of our counter-ISIL campaign that led to some civilian casualties.\nAgain, that is consistent with the approach that the President has prioritized -- to be as transparent as possible about our operations, and also to be forthright when the civilian casualties that we work so hard to avoid are nonetheless sustained.\nJoe, nice to see you.\nQ: You, too, Josh. Just to follow up on one question about the sailors. Is there no protest for the United States to file? Or is the administration and the Pentagon leaning in the direction of saying that these were simply bad choices by the sailors?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Joe, they're still looking at exactly what led -- what circumstances led to these American sailors ending up in Iranian territorial waters. And so that aspect of this particular situation continues to be under investigation.\nQ: And you've talked a little bit about the linkage between the sailors and the engagement with Iran. How much of it was improved relations with Iran that led to the release of the sailors, and how much of it was just a sense that this situation as it occurred might have thrown a wrench into the program as the IAEA report approached?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think it is hard to fully assess the motivations of the Iranians who ultimately made the decision to release these sailors promptly. I think what is beyond dispute is the fact that effective diplomatic engagement from the earliest reports of this incident was critical to our success in securing their prompt release. And that kind of diplomatic engagement, that channel of diplomatic communication was established by Secretary Kerry and his Iranian counterpart in the context of the protracted, years-long negotiations over Iran's nuclear program.\nAnd look, in his inaugural address in January of 2009, the President talked about how the United States of America and our national security interests could be advanced by appropriately engaging through tough, principled diplomacy even adversaries of the United States like Iran. And that was subject to a lot of criticism not just by Republicans, by the way. There was a spirited debate about this in the context of the presidential campaign in 2007 and 2008. But I think that what we have seen in terms of our progress in getting Iran to take steps to all but dismantle their nuclear infrastructure in a way that actually shuts down every pathway they have to building a nuclear weapon and quickly defusing dangerous incidents like the one that we saw with the sailors earlier this week I think is a powerful endorsement of that approach.\nQ: A quick El Chapo question for you. He bragged in this Rolling Stone interview that he moved more heroin and other drugs through here than anybody else. Is there any sense as to whether that's true? And is there a feeling here that extraditing him to the United States will somehow dismantle his organization where others have failed?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, you heard the White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough say that that kind of bragging was disgusting.\nThe desire to capture Mr. Guzman was motivated by the sense that his capture could at least disrupt the ability of an international criminal organization to traffic a variety of things, including heroin and other narcotics, through Mexico and around the world. I don't think, unfortunately, that we can say that this kind of capture, while significant, will succeed in dismantling that organization. But we are hopeful that it will be a little harder for them to operate and do the damaging work that they do without their leader.\nQ: And you've been asked about the debate last night. The President has sort of renewed his push to try to create reconciliation among the parties at a time when he is being harshly criticized by Republicans. Is it realistic to try to push for reconciliation at a time like this? Or is this just going to turn into the President's work on getting out the base for the general election?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, I think the President made a pretty solemn commitment in the context of his State of Union to do more and to redouble his efforts to try to bridge the stark partisan divide that's on full display in the United States Congress. So I think there are couple of ways to talk about that.\nThe first is, sometimes that divide is exaggerated -- because I went through some of the things, in answering Laura's question, that we've been able to accomplish at the end of last year -- reform of No Child Left Behind, the transportation bill, the budget agreement, locking in the middle-class tax cuts. I didn't mention things like reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank and finally moving through IMF reform. All of these are long-sought priorities of the administration, and all of them were accomplished in the space of like six weeks at the end of last year, and all of them by finding common ground with the newly appointed Republican Speaker of the House -- or newly elected Republican Speaker of the House.\nSo the kind of doom and gloom along party lines that's being advanced by a lot of Republicans, both in Congress and on the campaign trail, I think does make some people pessimistic about our prospects for legislative accomplishments over the course of this year.\nBut just over the last couple of days -- been talking about this a lot, this particular issue -- and it has become clear that there are at least six things that this administration has made a priority that seem to be priorities that are shared by at least some Republicans on Capitol Hill. And I think in most cases, actually a majority of Republicans have identified these things are priorities, and we're hopeful that we can work with Republicans on the Hill.\nLet me just walk you through them. The first is criminal justice reform. That's probably the one that we've talked about the most. There appears to be significant bipartisan majorities in both the House and Senate for common-sense legislation that would reform our criminal justice in a way that would make that system more fair and make our communities more safe. The President is certainly interested in trying to advance legislation that would accomplish that goal.\nWe also talked a lot about the Trans-Pacific Partnership. A lot of Republicans -- there's strong Republican support on Capitol Hill for that agreement. There obviously are a lot of Republicans in Washington, D.C. who aren't in Congress but often support congressional campaigns who are pretty enthusiastic about the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement. And that gives us some confidence that we'll be able to build a bipartisan majority to see that agreement be ratified this year.\nThe other thing I would point out, the President talked about how he was going to put Vice President Biden in charge of redoubling our efforts and ramping our investments in trying to cure cancer. That got a lot of applause in the hall where the President was speaking on Tuesday night, and that's because we have seen even some conservative Republicans who don't have too many compliments for the President's agenda say that they strongly support investment in medical research and development -- both because of the economic benefits associated with those kinds of investments, but also because of the medical breakthroughs that could be realized that would save people's lives.\nThe fourth thing I would point out, the President had pretty direct praise for Speaker Ryan's commitment to trying to find new ways to fight poverty. The President singled out one policy idea that's Speaker Ryan had put forward this would be expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit to include those workers that don't have children. The President believes that actually sets up a pretty good incentive. And we even saw some comments earlier this week after the President's speech from some Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee saying that they thought this could be a promising idea and that there might be an opportunity to work with the administration to advance it. So that's certainly something that we'd be interested in considering.\nThe fifth thing is fighting prescription drug abuse and heroin addiction. We've seen a lot of Republican presidential candidates on the campaign trail talking about this issue. This is something the President has been talking about for quite a long time. The Director of the ONDCP, Mr. Botticelli, has obviously made this a priority. And he's got his own personal, powerful story about fighting addiction and countering addiction and helping Americans overcome addiction. And we obviously welcome the opportunity to work with Republicans on that.\nThe sixth thing is something that at least some Republicans support, and this may be an area where there's not a majority of Republicans, and that's just on an AUMF -- an authorization to use military force against ISIL. This is obviously something that the President is enthusiastic about. I know that Speaker Ryan has been hosting discussions on Capitol Hill, asking other Republicans to start talking about how to advance this kind of legislation through the House. I know there are some members of the Senate who feel strongly, both on the Democratic and Republican side, that this is something that Congress should do.\nAnd we obviously have demonstrated a willingness to work with members of Congress on this issue. In fact, we actually -- we didn't just call on them to pass an AUMF; we actually wrote a suggested AUMF and sent it to them so they wouldn't have to do too much work. And then we actually sent senior members of the President's national security team to testify about this legislation in an open hearing in Congress. So we're clearly committed to this effort.\nLook, those are six important things, and if we could make some progress on those six things, even in the context of an election year and even in the context of a Democratic President and a Republican-dominated Congress, that would be a pretty good thing. And the President is certainly hopeful that we can do that. Sorry for the long answer.\nJohn.\nQ: Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow up on the situation with Iran and the sailors. Does the White House see their actions as a violation of the Military Code of Conduct, and specifically the \"I will not surrender under my own freewill\" -- the command, \"I will never surrender the members of my command while we still have the means to resist\"? Did they have the means to resist? Was the boat disabled, so they didn'the? What was the White House's view on that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, this is precisely part of the ongoing Department of Defense investigation. So that's why I'm quite limited in what I can say about this just because I speak on behalf of the Commander-in-Chief. There's a lot of sensitivity about the Commander-in-Chief even being seen as interfering in an ongoing Department of Defense review, particularly one that I guess as you point out could have some criminal consequences. So we're going to leave all of that to the Department of Justice and just out of an abundance of caution, there's not much I can say about that.\nQ: Is there any sense whether they made this video statement under duress?\nMR. EARNEST: That's unclear. I think common sense tells you that that certainly is a possibility, but this is something the Department of Defense is taking a look at as well.\nQ: And then you guys put out a factsheet this morning talking about the momentum in the fight against ISIL. I just had -- you guys are talking about all the progress and everything that you've made really over the last year and a half -- that ISIL hasn't had any major strategic victories since May, 2015. Is the White House's view that we're winning this war? Can you put on your football hat and say maybe what the score is, what quarter it's in, or anything like that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me say it this way. The President has been quite clear from the beginning that there would be areas of progress and some periods of setback. And I think that is the nature of any sort of military conflict, particularly one that's as unwieldy as this one. I think, John, the best way to answer your question is that over the last several months, the United States and our 65 coalition partners have enjoyed a lot of progress, and there are a variety of ways to measure that, which is -- a couple of the best ways that come to mind would be the successful completion of the operation that was carried out by Iraqi forces to retake Ramadi from ISIL forces.\nObviously it was a pretty significant setback, one that we acknowledged here, when ISIL did capture Ramadi. And it was a long planned and long -- well, let me say it this way. It took significant effort and a lot of planning to mount the kind of campaign that succeeded in driving ISIL out of Ramadi. And that was an important indication that the kind of strategy that we've long discussed from here could work -- and that is, the United States and our coalition partners working closely with Iraqi forces to offer training, advice, and assistance to those Iraqi forces, to make sure that they have the necessary equipment, and then to back up their efforts on the ground with airstrikes from the United States and our coalition partners. That was the recipe that allowed them to drive ISIL out of Ramadi. That's obviously an encouraging development.\nI think the other thing that I would point to is -- and I don't think this was listed on the factsheet, but we can get you more details on this -- is that in the last couple of weeks in December, the United States and our coalition partners undertook the kind of strikes that allowed us to take 10 ISIL leaders off the battlefield just in that relatively narrow period of time, including a couple that had connections to the network that carried out the attacks against innocent civilians in Paris.\nSo I think that is an indication of the resolve that's being demonstrated by the United States and our coalition partners to hold ISIL accountable for their efforts to try to target innocent civilians. But it's also an indication that our efforts to develop intelligence and to learn as much as we can about ISIL's leaders is yielding some fruit. And the more pressure that we can apply to those ISIL leaders, the more worried we can make them about their own personal safety, the harder it's going to be for them to plot and plan and carry out attacks against the West.\nAnd so that element of our strategy is also functioning at a high level and yielding some important results.\nQ: But this reluctance to say whether you're winning or losing, is that a reflection of ISIL's ability to launch these one-off attacks in Paris and the connections with San Bernardino, and now Jakarta?\nMR. EARNEST: I think it is a reflection of the fact that these kinds of military conflicts often don't lend themselves very well to sports metaphors; that that's not an accurate way or an apt way to help people understand exactly what's happening.\nWe're certainly mindful of the ongoing risk that ISIL poses both because of foreign fighters and because of their sophisticated use of social media. But what's also undeniable is that when you take a look at the battlefield inside of Iraq and in Syria, there's important progress that's being made by the United States and our coalition partners, including Iraqi forces in Iraq and some of the moderate Syrian opposition fighters that are taking the fight to ISIL on the ground in Syria.\nMike.\nQ: A few questions, mostly nut-and-bolt ones. Does the White House have any opinion on the New York law that would force backdoor encryption access? Are you concerned that there's a risk that local governments could have access to information of the federal government, if that New York law were passed?\nMR. EARNEST: Mike, I have to admit, I'm not familiar with that New York law, but why don't I have my colleagues at the NSC who work on this issue see if we can get you a response.\nQ: All right, and I'll get to the person who's very familiar with it at Bloomberg. And then another nuts-and-bolts question -- the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Chairman of the Finance Committee in the Senate yesterday said they were working on an effort to address international corporate tax law, including both inversions -- which the White House is certainly quite concerned about -- and repatriation. Is the White House going to engage with them on this? Do you have any sense of whether you can support this effort for a legislation that would address these specific international tax law consequences?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not familiar with the specific proposals that they have put forward, but I think that the things that you have identified -- or I guess that you've identified that they have identified -- are also problems that we've identified, as well.\nSo I'm confident that we'd be happy to engage in a discussion with Republicans on Capitol Hill about making our tax code more fair, more simple. And particularly when it comes to the corporate tax code, there is the potential that we could close some loopholes that only benefit wealthy and well-connected corporations, and potentially even lower the rate for everybody.\nSo we want to do this in a fiscally responsible way. We want to do this in a way that reflects sort of our priority of expanding economic opportunity for everybody in America, particularly middle-class families and those families that are trying to get into the middle class. And the President has talked about how there are some elements of our corporate tax code that are quite unfair. It's not middle-class families that are stashing their profits overseas to try to avoid taxes; it's well-connected corporations that are taking advantage of those tax havens. And it's not fair.\nQ: Part of the idea is for you to let them bring that money back --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, and so that's -- so the question is can you do that in a way that actually is fair? There are -- the previous time that this was done -- I know that there are a number of studies that have taken a close look at this -- that the previous time that this occurred, the revenue that was generated by that repatriation holiday was dedicated much more to things like corporate bonuses and padding the bottom lines of the companies, and not on like creating jobs and other things that would actually be good for the broader economy.\nSo, again, I think we can find some optimism in the idea that both Democrats and Republicans agree that these kinds of loopholes in the corporate tax code are a problem. But thus far, our proposed solutions have been quite different. And I think that just, frankly, reflects the differences in the priorities that have been identified by the individual parties. But that certainly won't prevent us from having a conversation.\nQ: Lastly, I'm curious how you can say, if we accept that Islamic State is following a terrorist strategy -- which I think most people do -- that they've had no strategic victories in recent months. I realize short of taking over a country's capital, victory can be in the eye of the beholder. But given that the whole idea of a terrorist strategy, conventional military thinking is to affect audiences, domestic, foreign, your own organization, your potential sympathizers, how can you analyze that attack in Paris as not a strategic victory for a terrorist strategy, or an attack -- even if it's a tiny one -- in the United States as not a strategic victory for the kind of terrorist strategy that they're pursuing?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the factsheet that we put out was specifically related to our military efforts to counter ISIL, and the sentence is just that ISIL has not had any major strategic victories in Iraq or Syria since May of 2015. So they were pretty specific -- but I definitely want to make sure that you take a look at the factsheet when you get a chance.\nRon.\nQ: There's some reporting suggesting that the White House national security team is in the final stages of reviewing a Pentagon proposal to close Gitmo. True?\nMR. EARNEST: What I can confirm for you is that the Pentagon, at the instruction of the President, has been working on developing a plan for closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay. The thing that -- they've been working on that for some time. I don't have an updated time frame for you in terms of when that will be produced, but --\nQ: So there's nothing that the White House is reviewing now that they have sent over, essentially?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't know the answer to that question. I know this is something that the Pentagon has been working on a lot. I know that they've had a lot of conversations with White House officials about the development of that plan. So, presumably, the White House has some insight into the work that they are doing and has had an opportunity to talk to them about that work. I don't know if they've e-mailed over a draft version or anything.\nThe thing that I would tell you about that plan is that, first of all, it is something that we are planning to present to Congress. When we do, it's something that we'll also make public so all of you will have an opportunity to take a look at it as well. And I would also encourage you to not give into a sense of mystery about the plan. I think our strategy that we have been pursuing for quite some time is familiar to those of you who have been watching this issue for years now.\nWe have a strategy for working with partners around the world to transfer those individuals who can be transferred into situations where the threat that they pose to the United States is sufficiently mitigated. We also have a strategy for putting some of these Gitmo detainees through a legal process, either military commissions or Article 3 courts, to bring them to justice.\nThere is a certain other group of individuals who are not likely to be able to be transferred because they're so dangerous, but yet, they're also probably not going to -- the evidence that's been collected against them doesn't necessarily lend them to the kind of military commission that has been successful in other areas. So those individuals, resolving their case is the hardest part of all this. And the case that we would make to members of Congress is that continuing to hold those individuals at the prison at Guantanamo Bay isn't good for our national security interests because we know that terrorist organizations around the world use the operation of the prison at Guantanamo Bay as a recruiting tool.\nThe second thing is it's also an inefficient use of taxpayer dollars. It costs right now about $4 million per detainee per year to keep them at the prison at Guantanamo Bay. We could confine them in a different place in a way that would fully protect our national security for much less money, and that's what the President is focused on.\nQ: So is it fair to say that the plans that you're looking at -- there are still a group of detainees whose fate will not be resolved by transfer or by prosecution? There's still this group -- I think it's several dozen -- that will be in this legal limbo now for perhaps as long as 10, 12 years? That clearly is not a good situation for the United States from a propaganda point of view or from a values point of view. What happens to them? Do they just go to one of these three federal prisons or detention centers in the United States and languish further?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what we have to do is we have to figure out, frankly, a more effective way to confine them than we do right now at the Prison at Guantanamo Bay -- a way that reflects our national security interests but also our commitment to being good stewards of taxpayer dollars. But there's no denying that working through the challenges of their situation continues to be difficult.\nQ: And what's the number now? About 25, is it, 30?\nMR. EARNEST: Of those individuals?\nQ: Yes.\nMR. EARNEST: A couple dozen is the way that I would describe it. But we can get you a more precise number.\nQ: Time frame on turning this plan over to Congress?\nMR. EARNEST: I just don't have an update for you on timing. And just to be as candid as I can here, back in July I was asked about it and I told all of you that it would be relatively soon. It's now January and it hasn't been produced at this point, so I'm just not going to make any more promises on the timing. But once it is something that we have produced to Congress, we'll make sure that all of you get a chance to take a look at it, too.\nQ: Just to be clear, is it fair to say that the plans that the administration is looking at will still result with a couple dozen detainees whose situation is not resolved and who will still be in a legal limbo many years later? You still can't figure that out?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what is true, Ron, is that the goal of this plan is not to resolve all of the status -- the individual status of every single detainee at the prison at Guantanamo Bay. The goal of this plan is to put forward a strategy for actually closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay. In some cases, that will mean putting individuals through military commission proceedings. In some cases, and in the vast majority of cases, it means transferring those individuals to other countries who have appropriate security arrangements in place to take them on. But for this other group of individuals, it means finding a more effective way to detain them so that they don't pose a threat to our national security, so that they don't serve as a recruiting tool for terrorist organizations around the world, and do all of that in a much more cost-effective way than we're doing it right now.\nJohn.\nQ: Thanks a lot. So yesterday, 10 detainees from Guantanamo arrived in Oman. I believe the Joint Task Force on Guantanamo deemed that five of them were a grave risk to the U.S. and American interests. The word that you've used, the Pentagon uses is that they were transferred. Are these individuals essentially going from one prison cell in Guantanamo to another prison cell in Oman?\nMR. EARNEST: The security arrangements that are in place for these individual detainees -- all 10 of these were Yemeni detainees -- and these are individuals that were essentially placed in a rehabilitation program that Oman runs. That rehabilitation program, as you would expect, also includes significant security limitations. That is to say --\nQ: So they're not in prison? They come and go as they please.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, they are monitored around the clock, and their ability to travel is limited. So I can't speak to whether or not they're in a prison cell or not, but I can tell you that steps like monitoring all their activities, keeping close tabs on their communications, limiting their ability to travel, and also putting them through this rehabilitation program that has a track record of rehabilitation radicalized individuals is a way to get them out of the prison at Guantanamo Bay, but do it in a way that mitigates the risk of the threat that they pose to U.S. national security.\nAnd that's not just my assessment. That's not the assessment of the President of United States. The Secretary of Defense himself has to personally certify that the appropriate security precautions have been taken. And in this case, they have.\nQ: It's true that other detainees that have gone through rehabilitation programs have ended back on the battlefield, essentially rejoining the fight against the United States and American interests. Isn't that right?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't know if that's true or not. We can check on that for you. What is true is that the track record of detainees that have been transferred under the regime that we've put in place with other countries, that essentially the recidivism rate is actually much lower, which is to say many fewer as a percentage of those individuals that have been transferred have rejoined the fight than those who were transferred under the system that was in place prior to the President taking office.\nQ: These 10 individuals, Yemenis, they can't go back to Yemen because of the civil war that's going on there right now. The President once called Yemen a \"model of success.\" Does he stand by that statement?\nMR. EARNEST: That statement, John, was referenced specifically to our counterterrorism efforts inside of Yemen. I don't think the President ever made the case that Jeffersonian democracy was sprouting in Yemen. I think the President was making the case that the United States, at a point in time, had an effective counterterrorism relationship with the Yemeni government that put significant pressure on extremists that were operating in that country and had aspirations for trying to harm the United States and the West.\nI'll also point out that there have been occasions, even since the onset of this strife inside of Yemen, where the United States has preserved our ability to carry out strikes against extremists inside of Yemen. So, again, Yemen is a dangerous place with a lot of problems, but it is a place where we have been very effective in applying significant pressure to leaders of terrorist organizations that are operating in Yemen and occasionally taking those leaders off the battlefield.\nQ: You and the President have both cited that the number-one reason for closing Guantanamo is that it's a recruiting tool for terrorists. Can you think of another example where the United States government sort of bases its policy on what terrorists think -- which is what you're doing when you say it's a recruiting tool for terrorists, right? You're worried about how terrorists view Guantanamo, and that's the reason why you've decided to close Guantanamo.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think, John, it's not just reading the minds of terrorists. We actually have tangible evidence that extremists use images from the prison in Guantanamo Bay and language describing the prison to try to recruit people.\nQ: In the past six months, can you think of or cite one video in which Guantanamo has been mentioned or seen?\nMR. EARNEST: I'll refer you the intel community that keeps tabs on these kinds of things, but I certainly wouldn't rule it out.\nBut, look, I think -- just to go back to sort of your broader question -- one of the reasons that we spend a lot of time thinking about how to counter ISIL's online activities is because we are concerned about the way that they're able to recruit and inspire vulnerable individuals to take up the cause of these extremists. So it is important for us to do as much as we can to try to counter their efforts to influence the thoughts and emotions of vulnerable individuals around the world.\nAnd that's the essence of this social media strategy that we're trying to implement -- both in terms of the conversations that senior administration officials had in Silicon Valley last week, but it's also part of the kinds of fusion centers that we're setting up in places like the UAE and in Malaysia to serve as regional operations to try to counter ISIL's efforts in those regions of the world, as well.\nAnd I'll also point out that, again, it's not just me and the President who are concerned about the way that extremists use the prison at Guantanamo Bay as a recruiting tool. People like President George W. Bush, Condoleezza Rice, Defense Secretary Bob Gates, who served both George W. Bush and Barack Obama as Defense Secretary, they agree with us, too. They agree with this concern about the way that the prison at Guantanamo Bay and its continued operation undermines our ability to fight terrorism.\nQ: And it's your belief that if Guantanamo were closed today that recruitment of individuals by ISIS, by Al Qaeda would be so much more difficult because Guantanamo is no longer around?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm saying that they would have one less recruiting tool in the toolbox to inspire people to carry out acts of violence against innocent Americans or, frankly, innocent people anywhere in the world. And that would be a good thing. And when you couple that with the fact that right now it costs $4 million per detainee per year to operate the prison at Guantanamo Bay, it's just not a good use of taxpayer dollars.\nSo even if there are Republicans who are skeptical of the claim that the recruitment value of the prison at Guantanamo Bay is minimal, well, surely these guys who are strongly opposed to government spending would enthusiastically embrace an opportunity to save taxpayers some money. The President certainly has embraced that opportunity. And the President I think would be the first one to tell you that this has been part of basically every conversation that he's had with the Department of Defense\n-- about the need to put this plan together is to do so mindful of the impact that it has on taxpayers and the way their money is spent.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, is there a specific reason why you put out the ISIL factsheet today?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes. Well, I'll just be blunt with you -- it's Friday. This was a document that we had planned to release in the context of the State of the Union address, and because there was so much interagency and international coordination involved in putting it together, the deadline slipped a little bit, so we got it out today.\nQ: Speaking of the State of the Union address, I've got a leftover question.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay.\nQ: Was the White House aware that Senate President pro tempore Orrin Hatch didn't attend the speech so that he could be the designated survivor in the case of a catastrophe, even though you guys said that DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson was in that role?\nMR. EARNEST: We were aware of that. It's my understanding that this is actually something that Congress has done more than once since 9/11. And again, that's a decision that they make.\nQ: But because he's President pro tempore of the Senate, he would not only be able to take over Congress, he would -- he's ahead of Jeh Johnson in the statutory line of succession for President. So he would be in a dual role there.\nMR. EARNEST: That's true.\nQ: Was the White House ready to accept him in that role in the line of succession?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think the White House was hopeful that this was an eventuality that would not occur. (Laughter.)\nQ: But you were aware of it?\nMR. EARNEST: I think Senator Hatch would even be in that category. (Laughter.)\nQ: Well, does it mean that by designating Jeh Johnson, it was duplicative?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think that these kinds of actions are always taken out of an abundance of caution, obviously. You have to ask my colleagues in Congress about Senator Hatch's decision to not attend the State of the Union address. I don't have any information about whether or not Senator Hatch just stayed home or went back to Utah or was in the --\nQ: Undisclosed location.\nMR. EARNEST: -- or an undisclosed location. But look, we take all of the necessary contingency steps, even the ones that are taken solely out of an abundance of caution, to ensure that the United States government, even in the event of the unthinkable, needs to persist. And so that's why we took the steps with Secretary Johnson this year that we have in previous years. And it's my understanding that even when Democrats were in charge of the Senate, that this is something they periodically did, as well.\nSusan.\nQ: Wanted to follow up on a Gitmo question. How long -- quickly -- how long are these detainees that were released -- how long are they staying in Oman? And how long is the rehabilitation center? And why is that so opaque to the American public? Why is this process -- why don't I know, for instance, who -- I follow this pretty closely?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the Department of Defense did put out a news release on this, so we can certainly get you the paperwork that describes the circumstances of their transfer in more detail. So it is something that we have made public. I don't have the news release in front of me. And it's been a couple days since I looked at it in terms of the -- so I don't know off the top of my head whether or not there was a description of the amount of time that they would be in this rehabilitation program, but we can check on that for you.\nAnd I guess let me say one other thing. In some cases, there are actually diplomatic sensitivities with the other countries in terms of making public the circumstances of them taking on these individuals. So sometimes, I think as you would anticipate, there is some complicated diplomacy that goes into these transfers, and so sometimes there's a little less transparency than there otherwise would be in deference to, frankly, the sacrifice that our partners and allies are making in taking on these individuals.\nQ: Going back to the President's -- his State of the Union regrets, his statements about his regrets -- about the partisan rancor in Washington and how he hasn't been able to deal with it -- hasn't been able to bridge that divide -- I had spoken to Representative Murphy last week about his mental health bill. This is a bill that he's been working on for years, since the Sandy Hook shootings. And he said he's tried repeatedly to contact the White House about this and to engage the White House Leg Affairs office, the President himself, and he said he hasn't had his phone calls returned; that this is something that he really wants to work with the White House on. It seems like -- he said he was sort of blindsided by the mental health money that you all released last week and your gun initiatives. Isn't this an example of something where it was an obvious place where you could work together? Why wasn't that groundwork done from the White House to Capitol Hill? And can you foresee that happening in the future with Tim Murphy and others on mental health issues? And is your -- basically, my own overall question is, is the White House Leg Affairs going to beef up now that the President has said he wants to work with Republicans where we can work with Republicans?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Susan, I can't speak to all of the conversations between the White House and Congressman Murphy's office. Based on the fact that you're asking your question today, I think it's a pretty high likelihood his office will get a phone call today. I think in general we are interested in working with Congress on trying to expand mental health care to Americans all across the country.\nI've spoken with varying proportions of frustration and disappointment about the fact that Republicans profess a sincere interest in mental health care expansion while at the same time voting dozens of times to actually repeal the legislation that has done more to expand mental health care than any other legislation that's passed in decades -- that's the Affordable Care Act. There are millions of Americans that have been able to get access to mental health care services as a result of Medicaid expansion, for example, that they didn't previously have. But yet, Republicans are dogged in their attempt to try to repeal that legislation.\nSo I think there is reason for us to be skeptically, generally, of Republicans' interest in this particular area. I am skeptical of their sincerity about this. But they have an opportunity to prove us wrong.\nAnd like I said, I'm confident that Congressman Murphy's office will get a call today. And I certainly can't speak to previous conversations that may have occurred around this, but there is a genuine interest on the part of the White House in trying to make progress when it comes to expanding access to mental health care, and we are certainly willing and ready to work with Republicans who share that priority.\nVictoria, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Defense Secretary Ash Carter said that the U.S. sailors had mis-navigated. Is it the thinking that one or both of the boats mis-navigated?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the circumstances that led them to end up in Iranian territorial waters is something that's still under investigation. Obviously the Secretary of Defense has access to more information about that ongoing investigation than I do, but I made note of the Secretary's comments as well, but I can't speak with any firsthand knowledge of what exactly happened that resulted in them being in Iranian territorial waters. But that's certainly something the Department of Defense is looking at.\nQ: The area where they were is known for espionage by many different countries. Can you assure us that they were not engaged in spying?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, for details about what operation they were pursuing, I'd refer you to the Department of Defense. I don't have any firsthand knowledge of what their operation was.\nLet's do the week ahead.\nOn Monday, the President and First Lady will participate in a community service project in the Washington, D.C. area to celebrate the life and legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr. There will be travel pool coverage of that community service project.\nOn Tuesday, the President will welcome Prime Minister Turnbull of Australia to the White House. It will be the Prime Minister's first trip to Washington since taking office. The leaders will hold a bilateral meeting and a working lunch, during which they will highlight the extraordinary breadth of the U.S.-Australian alliance, and discuss a range of bilateral, regional, and global issues, including our cooperation in Iraq and in Syria, our trade relationship, the successful conclusion of negotiations of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, and other developments in Asia and the Pacific.\nAustralia has made substantial contributions when it comes to our counter-ISIL campaign. There are Australian military pilots that have flown with American military pilots in the skies over Iraq and Syria, taking strikes against ISIL. And we know that Australia has also made a substantial contribution to the training, advising, and assist effort that's underway in Iraq. So we're obviously deeply appreciative of what the Australians have done to further our coalition's efforts, and I'm confident that will be a part of the discussion between the two leaders.\nOn Wednesday, the President will travel to Detroit, Michigan, to experience firsthand the remarkable progress made by the city, its people, and neighborhoods, and the American auto industry. While in Detroit, the President will visit the 2016 North American International Auto Show to highlight the more than 640,000 new auto industry jobs that were created since the auto rescue, and the record auto sales in the United States in 2015. Additional details about the President's travel to Michigan will be made available either over the weekend or at the beginning of next week.\nOn Thursday, the President will deliver remarks and host a reception for the nation's mayors here at the White House. The President will spend time -- the mayors will spend the evening at the White House, interacting with Cabinet members and senior White House officials to expand the partnerships between cities and the federal government.\nAnd then next Friday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.\nI hope you all have a good weekend.\nQ: Are you briefing on Monday?\nMR. EARNEST: I will not. Hopefully I will still be savoring the glow of the Chiefs' playoff victory on Saturday. (Laughter.) So we'll let you know.\nSee you guys. Have a good weekend.\nEND 12:51 P.M.

Will, Washington Post Columnist\nDelaware Online\nIowa and New Hampshire together have just 1.4 percent of the U.S. population, which is actually why it is fine for them to begin the presidential selection process: Small states reward an underdog's retail politics. Chris Christie relishes such politics and has fresh evidence that voters are enjoying his enjoyment.\nSpeaking last Wednesday by phone from his home away from home, New Hampshire, he said: \"People have remembered why they liked me in the first place.\" His saturation campaigning there has produced a 55-point reversal of his favorable/unfavorable rating in the Granite State, from 16 points more unfavorable than favorable to 39 points more favorable than unfavorable. According to last week's Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll, Christie's favorability number in Iowa is 51 percent, up from 29 percent in August, when his unfavorability number was 59 percent.\n...\nChristie will campaign in Iowa for nine days before the Feb. 1 caucuses.

{"author": "Jeb Bush", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=112616", "text": "This weekend, Americans celebrate National Religious Freedom Day, a day set aside each year to honor the right to freely exercise our deeply held religious beliefs. President Obama will follow precedent and issue a proclamation to mark this day on the calendar. But people who cherish religious liberty should harbor no illusions. This administration has been hostile to our first freedom at almost every turn.\nAmerica has traditionally respected the role of faith in public life. We have respected the claims of conscientious objectors when laws put them at odds with their deepest convictions. We have worked with religious groups of all kinds that believe that taking care of the needy is part of their calling: from Jewish hospitals to Catholic soup kitchens. We have let spiritual leaders, such as Martin Luther King Jr. remind us that politics must aim at justice.\nI cherish this tradition and will uphold it as president. But it is a tradition with which too many progressives have grown uncomfortable.\nUnder Obamacare, the administration has attempted to force almost all businesses and non-profit organizations — even religious charities and small businesses with religious owners — to cover the cost of contraceptives and abortifacients in their health plans. Many of these people of faith are fighting back, and rightfully suing for their freedom. The most high-profile case involves the Little Sisters of the Poor. The Obama administration wants to compel this group of nuns to include contraceptives and abortion-inducing drugs among their health benefits — an absurd mandate that attempted to address a non-existent problem.\nPeople of faith are also being asked to compromise their beliefs on the issue of marriage. While people of good will have different opinions on same-sex marriage, in a nation as large and diverse as ours, we ought to be able to find sensible compromises that accommodate bakers and florists and photographers who choose not to participate in weddings they find objectionable. The liberal Left in America, however, is unwilling to practice this kind of tolerance.\nWith many of these battles over religious liberty ultimately finding their way to the federal courts, the stakes in this upcoming election couldn't be higher for religious liberty. The next president could have the opportunity to appoint as many as four justices to the Supreme Court. There should be no doubt about where Hillary Clinton stands on religious liberty. In a speech last year, she said that religious teachings must change to favor abortion. In her words, \"deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed\" for the sake of giving women access to reproductive health care and safe childbirth. Whatever our views about abortion — and there are people of good will on all sides — we should be able to agree that no politician should be telling churches, synagogues, and temples what they should think about it.\nSomeone who does not understand that basic point cannot be trusted to protect religious liberty, and cannot be trusted to appoint judges who will protect it.\nSo long as we respect religious liberty, it is appropriate for faith to inform our political convictions. My own faith certainly guided me as I worked to expand educational opportunity, improve public safety, provide help to victims of domestic violence and drug abuse, reform our care of people with developmental disabilities, and promote a culture of life. I am proud that when I was governor, the abortion rate in Florida fell twice as fast as it did in the nation.\nAs president of the United States, I will be guided by the same principles. I will seek to limit government, honor the rights of conscience, and help those in need. I will nominate and fight for judges who will protect our constitutional rights, and who understand that Americans' freedom isn't jeopardized by menorahs at City Hall — it's jeopardized by a government that seeks to override our conscientious convictions.\nToo many of our political leaders are turning away from our distinctly American tradition of religious freedom. That's why it's important to stand up for it. No other candidate running for president has a stronger record on religious liberty than I do — and no one is more eager to defend it from Hillary Clinton and others who don't see its value.\nOriginally Posted on National Review", "timestamp": "2016-01-15", "title": "Press Release - Jeb: Religious Liberty Must Be Respected and Protected"}

He dialed back (but didn't abandon) his signature optimism and sunniness, in favor of a more forceful approach.

But he campaigns as a consistent conservative, and basically says he's the only consistent conservative on the stage.\nThat is not his record.\nThen, Marco went on to lay out the wrinkles in Cruz's record:\nHe has flipped his position on birthright citizenship, on legalization of illegal immigrants. He wanted a 500% increase in guest workers. He wanted a doubling of the number of green cards. He did change his position on [Trade Promotion Authority] — he wrote an article with Paul Ryan, before Paul Ryan was speaker, praising TPA.\nHe used to lobby members to support TPA, and then four months later all of a sudden he flips on it.

{"author": "Mike Huckabee", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116357", "text": "By Brad Sherman\nI was invited to a private meeting with one of the Republican Candidates and his wife. A couple of staffers were also present. Not wishing to be disingenuous, I made it clear at the onset of the meeting that I was supporting Mike Huckabee, but appreciated the opportunity to meet. During the discussion, the wife commented regarding Huckabee (who was a Christian minister before he was Governor of Arkansas for more than 10 years, \"We need a Commander in Chief, not a Minister in Chief.\" I assume the candidate/husband, who said nothing, holds the same view.\nAs a Christian who understands the spiritual significance of our nation's founding and the necessity of spiritual virtue to maintain our freedom, I take issue with the notion that having been a Christian minister is somehow a negative and that it cancels out a successful political career. Consider this:\nThe nation is like a ship sailing toward a destination. The president and other political leaders are like the captain and crew of that ship. The people are the wind. When the captain and the crew understand the destination (destiny) of the ship (nation) and when the wind (people) is blowing toward the destination, all is good.\nBut when the wind blows another direction, as it inevitably will, it is more important than ever for the captain and crew to know the destination of the ship - and if need be, go against the wind. This is the difference between a democracy and a republic. In a democracy, the wind of the people is the final word. In a republic, we recognize that 51% can be wrong and the law of the land is the final authority.\nThe problem with our nation right now is that most of our political leadership (on both sides of the aisle) have no idea of the spiritual destiny of our nation. As a result, the captain of the ship has steered away from our destiny - sailing with the wind of a people who also do not understand the destiny of the nation. Neither do most of the political leaders that we Christians consider \"good,\" and their efforts only slow the ship down instead of changing the direction of the ship toward the proper destination.\nYes, we need a spiritual revival. But we also need a captain and crew who understand spiritual destiny. We need a captain who is a good communicator - who can speak to the wind and convince it to blow in the right direction. This is primarily the job of church leaders, but church leaders who will speak to the people regarding politics, are relatively few. We need a captain and crew who will drop the sails, man the oars and fight the wind. We need a president who will speak to the people and teach them the destiny of the nation.\nDo we need a Minister in Chief or Commander in Chief? Why not both? Having been a pastor and a governor, Mike Huckabee has the experience to be both. I suppose there is a reason why some nations refer to their primary leader as the Prime Minister.", "timestamp": "2016-01-15", "title": "Press Release - Commander In Chief or Minister In Chief?"}

Some brief clips below and be sure to check the last story….\n-----\nRepublican Debate 2016 — The Telegraph\n... Mike Huckabee may have had the most poignant moment of the night, nearly breaking into tears describing the people who had worked for 40 years \"on a cement floor\" but may have to wait longer to retire because of social security shortfalls. To sum it up in a sentence..Mr. Huckabee was the most engaging.\n\"Huckabee: Need Clearly Defined Goal in the Middle East\" — Wall Street Journal\nDuring Thursday's GOP debate, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee said the U.S. needs to be in the Middle East to \"destroy radical Islam and everything that threatens civilization\"… \"When I went to Afghanistan, I saw a land that looked the 'The Flinstones.' It was desolate and barren. It's been that way for thousands of years. They want to take the world back to be just like that. We don't…We need to never ever spend a drop of American blood unless there is a clearly defined goal. And we can't make sure we win unless we have a military that's the strongest in the history of mankind.\"\n\"Obama Policies Under Fire at GOP Evening Debate, Huckabee Calls Gun Rules 'Insane'\" — Fox News\nPresident Obama's policies on everything from gun control to counterterrorism got hammered by the Republican candidates... with Mike Huckabee calling recently announced firearm regulations \"completely insane.\" \"I promise you, I've been to more gun shows than President Obama,\" the former Arkansas governor said at the evening Fox Business Network debate -- claiming the gun show loophole, which allows people to buy firearms at gun shows without undergoing a background check, is a myth. \"He keeps pushing ideas that never work.\" Huckabee also commented on the progress of the U.S. military effort in Afghanistan, saying he was skeptical about efforts to rebuild a country he likened to \"the land of the Flintstones.\" Huckabee, who was responding to a question about whether the United States should continue to aid the Afghanistan government, said, \"You can't create for other people a desire for freedom and democracy\"...Huckabee called for a fair tax to \"transform our economy\"...\nHuckabee: \"There is no gun show loophole\" — The Hill\nMike Huckabee said he's been to more gun shows than President Obama has and \"there is no gun show loophole.\" The former Arkansas governor...said Obama is wrong in suggesting it is easier to buy a gun than groceries. \"I've been to more gun shows than Obama, and I've bought more weapons at them,\" Huckabee said. \"I've purchased guns, and I can assure you it is much more difficult to buy a firearm than to get ingredients in a supermarket.\" Obama last week announced new executive actions intended to require all sellers at gun shows to perform background checks on buyers. Huckabee has called Obama's action to close the gun show loophole \"unconstitutional\" and \"completely insane.\"\nHuckabee: 'We Don't Buy' That Obama Says You Can Keep Your Guns — The Daily Caller\nHuckabee blasted Barack Obama's credibility for allowing you to keep your guns saying \"we don't buy it, we don't believe it.\"...Huckabee said Obama \"has lost his credibility and his inept inability to work with Congress and pass legislation has led him to do what I never even imagined doing as a governor and that's just going and doing it my own way.\" While discussing getting rid of the visa waiver program, Huckabee said while it \"may slow it down\" international commerce \"a slowed down commerce that is making us safer is worth it.\" \"This lady who came and joined with the San Bernardino killer and passed three background checks and that's why a lot of Americans didn't buy it when the President said, 'We'll bring in Syrian refugees, but don't worry, we'll check them out.'\"\nDo Mass Shooters Target Gun-Free Zones? It's Complicated — Newsweek\nAt the debate on Thursday night, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee repeated an oft-heard claim that most mass shootings happen in places where guns are banned and potential victims can't return fire. Asked by Fox Business Network moderators about what the federal government can do to stop Americans who pose a risk to public safety from obtaining guns, Huckabee claimed that some mass shootings might have been prevented if more Americans were armed with firearms. \"Of course we want to stop gun violence, but the one common thing that has happened in most mass shootings is that they happened in gun-free zones, where people who would have been law-abiding citizens, who could have stood up and at least tried to stop it...were not allowed to under the law,\" Huckabee said to applause from the crowd gathered in South Carolina...\n\"Huckabee: Taxes Like Training Dogs, Raising Kids, Reward Good Behavior\" — NewsMax\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee said... tax policy should be like \"we raised our kids and trained dogs.\" \"You reward behavior you want more of, and you punish behavior you want less of,\" he said….\"We now punish behavior we want more off, by taxing it and reward the behavior we want less of. If you make a good investment, we punish you with a tax. If you make a bad investment you can write that off and rest of taxpayers help subsidize you and help bail you out.\" The tax system moves people into a higher tax bracket when they improve their lives by getting a better job, he noted... \"No matter how many different reforms you have to a tax on people's productivity, you're still taxing their works, their savings, you're taxing their capital gains, inheritance, dividends. Taxing everything that produces something,\" he said, touting his \"fair tax\" with \"no payroll tax deducted from their checks. They get their entire paycheck.\"\n\"Obama More Interested in Protecting Islam Than Americans, Most Religious Hate Crimes Against Jews, Huckabee Says at GOP Debate\" — Christian Post\nRepublican presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee argued President Barack Obama is more interested in not offending Islam than he is in protecting Americans, and most religious hate crimes are against Jews, not Muslims….former Arkansas governor asserted that President Obama focuses too much time on not offending Islam. \"We have a President who seems to be more interested in protecting the reputation and image of Islam than he is protecting us,\" said Huckabee. Huckabee went on to note that despite the attention Obama gives to hate crimes against Muslims in the United States, Jewish American experience a higher rate of hate crimes. \"He needs to read his own FBI crime stats from last year which would show him that of the hate crimes in the country, over 5,500, about 1,100 were religious hate crimes. And, of those, 58% were directed toward Jews. Only 16% directed toward Muslims…\n\"There are far more hate crimes against Jews than Muslims in the U.S.\" —Washington Examiner\nMike Huckabee during Thursday's debate noted that there are far more hate crimes against Jews in the U.S. than there are against Muslims — and he's absolutely right. Though the media and many political figures have focused the nation's attention on anti-Muslim sentiment in the U.S., according to FBI hate crime statistics, Jews are targeted far more than Muslims, both in absolute terms and proportionately. In 2014, the FBI reported 1,092 hate crimes based on religious bias — 58 percent of those crimes were against Jews, compared with 16 percent that were against Muslims. There are about 3.3 million Muslims and 5.8 million Jews in the U.S., according to the Pew Research Center.\n\"GOP Debate 2016: 'Obama Should Worry About Jews, Not Muslims,' Huckabee Says\" — International Business Times\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee on Thursday criticized President Barack Obama'sState of the Union plea for American citizens and politicians to treat Muslims fairly... Huckabee used recently released FBI statistics about 2014 hate crimes in the United States to back up his argument that Obama should be condemning anti-Semitic comments instead of defending Muslims. While responding to a debate moderator's question about the U.S. visa waiver program, which was criticized after recent mass shootings for allowing tourists to enter the country unchecked, Huckabee alleged that Obama was prioritizing Islam over Americans' safety. He went on to denounce Obama's Tuesday night statement encouraging people to have open minds about diversity. \"[When Obama] makes comments like he did the other night, that we have to be so careful because we don't want to offend Muslims, he needs to read his own FBI crime stats from last year,\" Huckabee said…\n\"Mike Huckabee Tells Heckler: Abortion Is the Ultimate Form of Child Abuse\" — Lifesite News\nPresidential candidate Mike Huckabee once again strongly affirmed his pro-life convictions at a campaign stop in Iowa...When confronted by an antagonist trying to make a scene... Leading a \"Huckabee Huddle\" session with voters at a local diner in Clinton, [he] was confronted by an angry woman who accused him of supporting child abuse. \"I think it's an abominable practice -anyone who would abuse a child,\" said Huckabee. \"I think the ultimate form of child abuse in this country is abortion. It'sthe most irreversible form of child abuse.\"\nMike Huckabee: Concerned For Hillary Clinton's 'Political Health' — Breitbart News\nCHARLESTON, South Carolina — GOP presidential candidate former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee says he's worried about Hillary Clinton's political health, not her medical records...asked Huckabee if Clinton should release all of her medical records relating to her fall in 2012, which resulted in a concussion and a blood clot. \"I'll leave that to Hillary. I'm not a practicing physician, so I'm not going to diagnose anything with her,\" Huckabee responded to a question referencing a recent Breitbart News story revealing medical professionals and security officials raising concerns about the former Secretary of State's health status. Huckabee added, \"I'm concerned for her political health.\" I hope that people continue to realize that she has been very dishonest about many of the things she's done as Secretary of State. I think that is a greater concern to me that she would become a credible candidate for President of the United States and Commander-in-Chief of our military when she left people stranded in Benghazi begging for help and never sent the help. Why that happened, I don't know, but that is a greater concern to me than her last medical checkup. Huckabee's comments on Benghazi come the day before the premier of \"13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi,\" which tells the story of what happened that night surrounding a stand-down order preventing military personnel from aiding the U.S. consulate under attack during Clinton's watch as Secretary of State.\nHuckabee Eyes Obama — Fox Business\n... Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee goes after President Obama's optimism in the State of the Union address saying he should have stood in line at the layaway counter at Wal-Mart around Christmas. ... In a question about Afghanistan, Huckabee referred to the country as the \"land of the Flintstones\" and said that radical Islam must be destroyed, calling it a threat to \"every civilized person on this Earth.\" ... \"Boos\" from the audience where heard when moderator Trish Regan notes that the majority of Americans are in favor of universal background checks on gun purchases. ... \"The President keeps pushing ideas that have never worked,\" says Huckabee. He also goes on to say that the President of the U.S. needs to \"protect America\" and that Obama cares more about protecting the image of Islam than keeping his country safe.\nFormer Governor Mike Huckabee to preach in Cayce Sunday — ABC\nCOLUMBIA, SC (WOLO)- Straight off the Republican Debate in North Charleston Thursday Night, Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee announced he'll lead worship at Trinity Baptist.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118086", "text": "Over the last year, the 65-member Global Coalition to Counter ISIL, led by the United States, has intensified the fight to liberate ISIL-controlled territory in Iraq and Syria and has made significant progress in its campaign to degrade and destroy this abhorrent terrorist group.\nAs we move into 2016, President Obama and the broader Administration remain fully committed to eliminating the threat posed by ISIL and will continue to pursue a strategy that strikes ISIL at its core, degrades its networks, and constrains its prospects for expansion. We must be patient and flexible in our efforts; this is a multi-year fight and there will be challenges along the way. But we are united with our Coalition partners and are making progress together to degrade and destroy ISIL.\nBackground\n• In the summer of 2014 ISIL had surged into Iraq, directly threatening Baghdad and Erbil, including locations where U.S. personnel were located, and calling for the systematic destruction of the Yezidi people. We witnessed atrocities, beheadings, crucifixions, and immolations. ISIL is like no terrorist threat we have confronted before.\n• ISIL has not had any major strategic victories in Iraq or Syria since May 2015. In fact, with the Coalition supporting local partners on the ground, ISIL has lost approximately 40 percent of populated territory it once controlled in Iraq and more than 10 percent of the populated territory it once controlled in Syria.\n• ISIL is being defeated by brave local forces in Iraq and Syria who are reclaiming and defending their villages, cities, and ultimately, their countries, with the support of the United States and our Coalition partners. ISIL's freedom of movement across borders has been significantly reduced and we are making progress in cutting supply lines between ISIL strongholds in ar-Raqqah and Mosul.\nMilitary Efforts\n• U.S. and Coalition military efforts to degrade and destroy ISIL have ramped up significantly throughout 2015.\no Seventeen Coalition members have joined the United States in deploying military personnel to assist the Iraqi government in building partner capacity and train, advise, and assist missions. To date Coalition partners have trained nearly 17,000 Iraqi security forces.\no Twelve Coalition members have conducted over 9,500 air strikes in Iraq and Syria, including over 630 in support of the liberation of Ramadi by Iraqi Security Forces. These airstrikes have taken out over 3,450 ISIL vehicles and tanks, over 1,120 artillery and mortar positions, 1,170 oil infrastructure components to include tanker trucks, oil storage tanks, collection points, and well heads, and more than 13,500 fighting positions, checkpoints, buildings, bunkers, staging areas and barracks, including 39 training camps, in Iraq and Syria.\no In December 2015 alone, Coalition airstrikes killed dozens of senior ISIL leaders, including external operations planners, explosives facilitators, financial emirs, and other key positions.\no Most recently, the ongoing progress in Ramadi illustrates an empowered Iraqi military working side-by-side with local Sunnis to retake their city. While there is still a great deal of work to be done to secure and hold Ramadi, the Iraqi Security Force have dealt a blow to ISIL.\no In Syria, Kurdish and Arab groups aligned against ISIL seized Kobane, Tal Abyad, al-Hawl, and the Tishreen Dam, cutting ISIL's access to all but 98 kilometers of the Turkish border and helping to isolate ar-Raqqah.\no Nineteen Coalition nations have provided supporting aircraft, including transport, surveillance, and aerial re-fueling capabilities.\no We have made significant progress in degrading ISIL's ability to benefit from energy resources. The Coalition has conducted 68 airstrikes in Operation Tidal Wave II in Syria, targeting oil infrastructure, supply lines, and hundreds of tanker trucks that transit oil directly from ISIL. These strikes have taken out key fields in Deir-ez-Zour that once accounted for more than half of ISIL's monthly oil revenue. Coalition strikes have reduced ISIL oil revenues by about 30 percent since November 2015.\nPolitical, Stabilization and Humanitarian Efforts\n• The United States continues to support the Iraqi government's progress toward effective and inclusive governance, stabilization efforts, and reconciliation.\no Over a dozen Coalition partners have collectively contributed over $50 million to the Funding Facility for Iraq Stabilization.\no The retaking of Tikrit in April 2015 and the successful return of 90 percent of its residents to date provided valuable lessons that will guide stabilization efforts in newly liberated areas.\no The U.S. and our Coalition partners, working with the Iraqi government, have now retrained more than a thousand Iraqi police officers to provide security in liberated areas.\n• The United States also continues to be the largest single-country donor of humanitarian aid to the Syrian people, providing more than $5.1 billion to date.\no In Syria, the U.S. Government has provided more than $4.5 billion to date and USAID is providing emergency assistance to 5 million Syrians every month, including 4 million people inside Syria. USAID is also providing food assistance to Syrian refugees in neighboring countries.\no In Iraq, the U.S. Government has provided more than $603 million in life-saving humanitarian assistance for the Iraqi people including critically needed relief items, food, shelter, clean water, and medical services.\n• The United States continues to lead the international diplomatic effort to reach a negotiated political transition that removes Bashar al-Asad from power and ultimately leads to an inclusive government that is responsive to the needs of all Syrians. The Asad regime's continued brutality against the Syrian people drives the influx of foreign fighters who join extremists' ranks, including ISIL. Also, the Asad regime's purchase of oil from ISIL and its unwillingness to target extremists have helped ISIL and other terrorist groups to flourish.\no So long as Asad remains, foreign fighters will continue to flow into Syria. This is why we have brought together partners in the region, Europe, Russia, and Iran to work towards a negotiated end to the conflict in Syria.\no Members of the International Syria Support Group (ISSG) have agreed to a notional timeline for a political transition, which was unanimously adopted by the UN Security Council in December 2015.\nCivilian Efforts to Counter ISIL\n• The United States and our Coalition partners have made progress stemming the flow of foreign fighters, and disrupting ISIL's propaganda machine and its financial networks.\no The Counter ISIL Coalition Working Group on Foreign Terrorist Fighters (WGFTF), co-led by the Netherlands and Turkey, is working with member countries to implement the obligations and recommendations set forth in UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 2178. Today approximately 45 countries have enacted laws or amendments to create greater obstacles for traveling into Iraq and Syria, at least 35 countries have arrested foreign terrorist fighters or aspirants, and 12 countries have successfully prosecuted foreign terrorist fighters.\no At least 50 countries plus the United Nations now contribute foreign terrorist fighter profiles to INTERPOL, a 400 percent increase over a two-year period. Fifty-two countries are sharing foreign fighter profiles through INTERPOL's Counterterrorism Fusion Center, and the United States has bilateral arrangements with 40 international partners for sharing terrorist travel information.\no To counter ISIL's online propaganda and recruitment network, the State Department has launched a Global Engagement Center to integrate and synchronize our communications against violent extremist groups, including ISIL and al-Qa'ida. This new center will shift focus on countering violent extremist messaging away from direct messaging and toward a growing emphasis on empowering and enabling partners, both government and non-government, across the globe.\no The Counter ISIL Finance Group (CIFG), which the U.S. co-leads with Italy and Saudi Arabia, is an integrated part of the broader Coalition and made up of 30 members worldwide focused on disrupting ISIL financing. As part of its ongoing work, the CIFG is specifically focusing on information exchange, targeting ISIL's oil revenues, combatting the financing of ISIL affiliates, and addressing ISIL sales of antiquities, among other topics.\no The United States chaired a special meeting of the UN Security Council with finance ministers in New York on combating ISIL finance and all forms of terrorist financing. At this meeting, Security Council finance ministers unanimously adopted a Security Council resolution that improves the international community's ability to disrupt ISIL financing and to counter the financing of terrorism more broadly.\nDomestic Efforts\n• Since 2014, the Department of Justice and the FBI have arrested approximately 65 individuals in ISIL-related matters.\n• Domestically, since the White House Summit on Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) last February, the United States has strengthened our efforts to prevent extremists from radicalizing and mobilizing recruits.\no The CVE Task Force announced in January 2016 will be a permanent interagency task force hosted by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with overall leadership provided by DHS and the Department of Justice, with additional staffing provided by representatives from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, National Counterterrorism Center, and other supporting departments and agencies. The CVE Task Force will (1) integrate whole-of-government CVE programs and activities; (2) leverage new CVE efforts (3) conduct ongoing strategic planning; and (4) assess and evaluate CVE programs and activities.\no The DHS Office for Community Partnerships continues to find innovative ways to support communities that seek to discourage violent extremism and undercut terrorist narratives.\n• In 2015 alone, the Treasury and State Departments sanctioned more than 30 ISIL-linked senior leaders, financiers, foreign terrorist facilitators, and organizations, helping isolate ISIL from the international financial system.\n• The U.S. government worked closely with Iraqi authorities to ensure that approximately 90 bank branches within ISIL-controlled territory in Iraq are completely cut off from the Iraqi and international financial systems.\n• Working with the Federal Reserve and the Central Bank of Iraq, we have put in place information exchanges and safeguards to deny ISIL access to U.S. banknotes. This led to the isolation of key exchange houses within Iraq that previously had access to several million dollars. As part of this effort, the Government of Iraq has prohibited over 100 exchange houses located in ISIL-controlled territory or associated with ISIL from accessing the currency auctions, disrupting one of ISIL's primary means of accessing and moving its funds.\nOver the next six months we will continue to accelerate our counter-ISIL strategy across all of our lines of effort. We will work with Coalition partners to drive out ISIL from the remaining stretch of the Turkish-Syrian border it has seized; clear and stabilize the Euphrates River Valley; cut off the remaining connections between ar-Raqqah and Mosul; increase the number of Iraqi Sunnis in the fight against ISIL by integrating them into the army, local police, and tribal mobilization structures; as well as advance the stabilization of newly liberated areas, facilitating the safe, voluntary return of thousands of internally displaced persons and restoring local communities.\nFor more information on the President's strategy to fight ISIL and the work the Global Coalition is doing, please visit https://www.whitehouse.gov/isil-strategy.", "timestamp": "2016-01-15", "title": "Fact Sheet: Maintaining Momentum in the Fight Against ISIL"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "This proclamation was published in the  Federal Register  on January 21.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111475", "text": "By the President of the United States of America\nA Proclamation\nSince our country's founding, religious freedom has been heralded as one of our most cherished ideals. The right to practice religion freely has brought immigrants from all over the world to our shores, often in the face of great adversity, so they could live their lives in accordance with the dictates of their consciences. Some of America's earliest settlers, the Pilgrims, arrived at our shores in search of a more tolerant society, free from religious persecution. Since that time, people of many religious traditions have added their own threads to the fabric of our Nation, helping advance a profound and continuous vindication of the idea of America.\nWhen the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom was adopted on January 16, 1786, it formed a blueprint for what would become the basis for the protection of religious liberty enshrined in our Constitution. Drafted by Thomas Jefferson, the statute proclaims that \"all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities.\" The First Amendment prohibits Government from establishing religion, and it protects the free exercise of every faith. Our Government does not sponsor a religion, nor does it pressure anyone to practice a particular faith, or any faith at all. The United States stands for the protection of equal rights for all people to practice their faith freely, without fear or coercion, and as Americans, we understand that when people of all religions are accepted and are full and equal members of our society, we are all stronger and freer.\nOur commitment to religious freedom has fostered unprecedented religious diversity and freedom of religious practice. But these ideals are not self-executing. Rather, they require a sustained commitment by each generation to uphold and preserve them. Here at home, my Administration is working to preserve religious liberty and enforce civil rights laws that protect religious freedom—including laws that protect employees from religious discrimination and require reasonable accommodation of religious practices on the job. We will keep upholding the right of religious communities to establish places of worship and protecting the religious rights of those so often forgotten by society, such as incarcerated persons and individuals confined to institutions. We will also continue to protect students from discrimination and harassment that is based on their faith, and we will continue to enforce hate crime laws, including those perpetrated based on a person's actual or perceived religion. This work is crucial, particularly given the recent spike in reports of threats and violence against houses of worship, children, and adults simply because of their religious affiliation.\nAs we strive to uphold religious freedom at home, we recognize that this basic element of human dignity does not stop at our shores, and we work to promote religious freedom around the globe. We are working with a broad coalition against those who have subjected religious minorities to unspeakable violence and persecution, and we are mobilizing religious and civic leaders to defend vulnerable religious communities. In addition, we are calling for the elimination of improper restrictions that suppress religious practice, coordinating with governments around the world to promote religious freedom for citizens of every faith, and expanding training for our diplomats on how to monitor and advocate for this freedom. All people deserve the fundamental dignity of practicing their faith free from fear, intimidation, and violence.\nOn Religious Freedom Day, let us recommit ourselves to protecting religious minorities here at home and around the world. May we remember those who have been persecuted, tortured, or murdered for their faith and reject any politics that targets people because of their religion, including any suggestion that our laws, policies, or practices should single out certain faiths for disfavored treatment. And as one Nation, let us state clearly and without equivocation that an attack on any faith is an attack on every faith and come together to promote religious freedom for all.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 16, 2016 as Religious Freedom Day. I call on all Americans to commemorate this day with events and activities that teach us about this critical foundation of our Nation's liberty, and that show us how we can protect it for future generations at home and around the world.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-01-15", "title": "Proclamation 9389—Religious Freedom Day, 2016"}

Dr. King joined a long line of heroes and vindicated the belief at the heart of our founding: that humble citizens, armed with little but faith, can come together to change the world and remake an America that more closely aligns with our highest ideals.\nDr. King recognized that, as a country built on the foundation of self-governance, our success rested on engaging ordinary citizens in the work of securing our birthright liberties. Together, with countless unsung heroes equally committed to the idea that America is a constant work in progress, he heeded the call etched into our founding documents nearly two centuries before his time, marching and sacrificing for the idea of a fair, just, and inclusive society. By preaching his dream of a day when his children would be judged by the content of their character—rather than by the color of their skin—he helped awaken our Nation to the bitter truth that basic justice for all had not yet been realized. And in his efforts, he peaceably yet forcefully demonstrated that it is not enough to only have equal protection under the law, but also that equal opportunity for all of our Nation's children is necessary so that they can shape their own destinies.\nToday, we celebrate the long arc of progress for which Dr. King and so many other leaders fought to bend toward a brighter day. It is our mission to fulfill his vision of a Nation devoted to rejecting bigotry in all its forms; to rising above cynicism and the belief that we cannot change; and to cherishing dignity and opportunity not only for our own daughters and sons, but also for our neighbors' children.\nWe have made great advances since Dr. King's time, yet injustice remains in many corners of our country. In too many communities, the cycle of poverty persists and students attend schools without adequate resources—some that serve as a pipeline to prison for young people of color. Children still go to bed hungry, and the sick go without sufficient treatment in neighborhoods across America. To put up blinders to these realities or to intimate that they are inherent to a Nation as large and diverse as ours would do a disservice to those who fought so hard to ensure ours was a country dedicated to the proposition that all people are created equal.\n\"We may have all come on different ships, but we're in the same boat now,\" Dr. King once said. As the most diverse country on Earth, ensuring this creed is reflected in our hearts, minds, and policies is the imperative of our citizenship. As Americans of all races and beliefs come together on this day of service to honor the life and legacy of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., let us pledge to recognize the common humanity of all people, regardless of the color of their skin or the station into which they were born.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 18, 2016, as the Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday. I encourage all Americans to observe this day with appropriate civic, community, and service projects in honor of Dr. King and to visit www.MLKDay.gov to find Martin Luther King, Jr., Day of Service projects across our country.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-01-15", "title": "Proclamation 9390—Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday, 2016"}

{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116708", "text": "From the moment that Hillary Clinton announced her candidacy, I knew I wanted to be involved with her campaign.?\nAs a longtime admirer of her both personally—her ability to achieve that ever elusive white whale known as work-life balance as both a politician and a mother—and professionally (her track record of taking a stand for women and children), I was determined to be useful in any way I could.\nI imagined this might take the form of a cheeky straight-to-camera endorsement or maybe an amusing T-shirt design, but I never imagined I would be traveling to four or more cities a day to spread the word on why I vote, why you should too, and why I'm supporting Hillary Clinton's bid for the presidency. But when the lady asks, I answer, and I found myself heading to Boston with a massive, torn garment bag (shout-out to the dude at Chicago O'Hare airport who taped it up!) and a much-practiced speech in my shaking hands.\nI want to start this recap the way I started the remarks I delivered in Boston; Manchester, New Hampshire; Portsmouth, New Hampshire; Chicago; Iowa City; and Des Moines, Iowa: by saying that involvement in politics came late for me. I didn't seize the opportunity to vote when I turned 18. Rather, I had to be urged to give a darn about the electoral process in our country.?\nIt was my friend Audrey Gelman, who worked on Hillary's 2008 campaign as a junior press aide, who told me point-blank in 2012 that if I didn't use my platform to talk about what mattered to me, then I was basically voting for Mitt Romney. And, especially as women, who we vote for matters just as much as the issues we rally around. I was never going to see the change I wanted to if I were half-hearted about showing up to the polls and half-hearted about saying what I believed in.\nSo it was only fitting that Audrey join me on this trip, often reminding me to reapply lipstick, pull up my tights, and carry my remarks in my purse. I thank her for encouraging me to pursue this incredibly gratifying aspect of my life.\nA little more background: For those of you who don't know, I interviewed Secretary Clinton for the inaugural issue of Lenny Letter, and that opportunity, to speak with her for an hour about both the personal and the political, really informed the words I shared with the young people—mostly young women—who I met during this whirlwind 48 hours.\nMy first stop was Boston, where I had the opportunity to speak to a group of Hillary supporters—most notably Barbara Lee, a woman who has helped countless other women make their way to office. Her aim is to research the roadblocks that keep women out of office and also to get a diverse range of female senators, governors—and yes, presidents—elected, so the ratio of women to men in government can actually reflect our population.?\nBarbara also has my heart for another reason: She collects modern art by women, including a piece by my mother (of a dancing little cake!) that hangs in her front hallway, and she has made generous donations from her collection to the Boston Institute of Contemporary Art.\nHere I am prepping furiously before the event or, as they call it in politics, being briefed.\nThis event is where I linked up with Abby Wambach, the remarkable (and recently retired) U.S. women's soccer star. She has the potential to be a cult religious leader, that's how charismatic she is. Glad she's using her powers for good and stumping.\nIn New Hampshire I executed a quick outfit change, then zoned out on the nearest sofa. Abby caught this picture of me in a position that is very natural to me—reclining like a stressed snail.\nAfter that, Abby and I parted ways: She continued through New Hampshire (miss you, Abby), and I stopped in Manchester before catching a plane to Chicago. The Chicago event was delightful, and not only because I met the mother and daughter behind the famous Eli's Cheesecake. They sent Audrey and me not one but FIVE cheesecakes.?\nHere, Audrey is celebrating this historic win in our hotel room.\nIowa was next, starting in Iowa City, where I had lunch with a lovely woman named Sarah, who talked frankly with me about her range of concerns as a soon-to-be mother of two, a writer, a Creative Commons lawyer, and an Iowan. She also helped me wrap my head around the caucus process, which is complex, old-school, and really instills a unique sense of political responsibility in the Iowans I met.?\nAt the end of our journey, Audrey bought and presented me with the book Caucus Chaos, both a souvenir of our time and something I should read so that I can look incredibly smart at cocktail parties.\nIn Des Moines my event was at a very stylish, Portlandia-esque silkscreen and design studio, where I got a chance to meet Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards's daughter, Lily, the director of communications for the campaign in Iowa.?\nI was really thrilled to be making the rounds directly after Planned Parenthood endorsed Hillary—their first primary endorsement in their hundred-year history. The adorable elves at the silkscreen studio made bags and T-shirts with this very personally pleasing image.\nBefore heading to the airport, I hugged Casey, the gentleman from the campaign who had been driving me in a minivan across the state. He loved my custom-knit Hillary sweater so much that I had no choice but to surrender it. I do feel it's in good hands.?\nDoesn't he look pleased?\nSo ... what did I say to all these people? Why did I go to six cities, take five planes, give seven versions of this speech, and compromise my already shitty immune system??\nIt wasn't just for the cheesecake. Below is an abridged version of the remarks I shared. Although lots of these quotes have circulated in the media, it's always nice to give something context. Especially something as important as this ...\nI'm not just here to tell you why you should vote, although you definitely have to vote, vote hard, and vote often. I also have an opinion on who you should vote for. I have admired Hillary Clinton for many years—24, to be exact, since I was six years old, and she entered the White House as the first lady of the United States. Even as a child, I was impressed not only by the poise with which she approached her position but also the ferocity. Not content to hide her own accomplishments and cede her identity to her husband, she used her time in the White House to help form the Department of Justice's Office on Violence Against Women and to tell us that \"women's rights are human rights\" in her Beijing speech of 1995.?\nTime and time again, she refused to be placed in the box that had previously been drawn for women in her position.\nSecretary Clinton went on to have a political career that, on its own terms, is a radical accomplishment. As New York senator, she introduced the CARE Act twice, ensuring that rape and incest victims had access to emergency contraception in hospital emergency rooms. As secretary of state, she continued to battle against violence toward women, spearheading a U.N. resolution that established guidelines for an international response to sexual assault in war-torn areas.?\nThrough her travel, writing, and the Clinton Foundation, she has worked tirelessly for causes ranging from AIDS research to closing the word gap for low-income families and making reading a part of every child's life. Her conviction is moving; her tenacity, astounding.\nIt's no secret that women's rights matter to me. It's why my Twitter feed is littered with insanity and my underpants say feminist on the butt (NOTE: I packed several pairs of these. They make me feel good ... .)?\nWomen's rights matter to me more than anything in the world because, as HRC said, women's rights are human rights. Women's equality allows our children to grow up strong and protected, without fear. Women's equality is about the equality of every living human, inextricably linked with issues of racial injustice and religious persecution.?\nWe so often think globally when it comes to women's rights—as we should, as does Secretary Clinton—but the assault on our rights here in America is alarming, and becoming more so every day.\nHillary Clinton's commitment to reproductive justice, wage equality, and protecting working mothers is unparalleled. When we sat together this past September for an hour-long interview, I saw how clearly she understood the connection between women's rights and the Black Lives Matter movement and how committed she is to bringing young disenfranchised voters back into an active dialogue with politics.?\nWe discussed a range of other essential issues—student debt, universal health care, gun control, and campus assault, to name a few—and she impressed me time and again with her clear-eyed plans for tackling these murky and challenging issues, issues that so often feel powerfully divisive and impossible to surmount.\nI can't talk about Hillary Clinton without saying that she has also survived horrific, gendered attacks on every aspect of her character with unimaginable aplomb. The way she has been treated by the media is just more evidence of the anger that exists toward women, particularly ambitious women, and the way we are not allowed to exist on our own merits but rather as extensions of men in power. Hillary Clinton has roundly rejected this premise, and she is running for president again. As a newly grown-up woman who has experienced my fair share of backlash, of public body shaming, of puritanical judgments, that moves me.\nNothing gets me angrier than when someone implies that I'm voting for Hillary Clinton simply because she's female, as if I have some feminist version of beer goggles—let's call it estrogen blindness. This assumption is condescending at best and hideously misogynistic at worst. The fact is, there are plenty of women whose politics horrify me, just as there are plenty of men who I would love to see in elected office. My gender doesn't prevent me from making cogent decisions about who to vote for: In fact, my gender only informs those decisions in a powerful way.\nBut I will end with this: We live in a country where women still battle daily for our basic rights. Whether it's wage equality, access to birth control, or the right to press charges against our rapists with a measure of support and dignity, women are having to run twice as fast as their male counterparts just to stay in one place. So while Hillary Clinton's anatomy is not the reason I'm voting for her, I believe that nothing will send a stronger message to America and the world at large than electing a competent, experienced, and brilliant woman to the highest office in the land.?\nOur first female president would send a message that we are here. We are ready to lead. In fact, she has been leading all along.", "timestamp": "2016-01-16", "title": "Press Release - On the Road For Hillary: a Travelogue"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118097", "text": "Say a hardworking American loses his job — we shouldn't just make sure he can get unemployment insurance; we should make sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business that's ready to hire him. If that new job doesn't pay as much, there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bills.\n- President Obama, State of the Union 2016\nBuilding on his remarks in his State of the Union, today the President used his Weekly Address to announce new proposals to provide workers with wage insurance, stronger Unemployment Insurance protections, and support for retraining to get the next job. These proposals are part of the Administration's broader push to strengthen and modernize our Unemployment Insurance system by closing holes in coverage and strengthening connections to work.\nAfter the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes, the United States is in the midst of the longest streak of private-sector job growth in our history, with more than 14 million new jobs created during the past 70 months. Yet even as the unemployment rate has had its fastest two-year decline in thirty years - and has been cut in half overall - we have further work to do to strengthen our safety net and modernize it for a changing economy. Unfortunately, even as the economy has strengthened, fewer than one in three unemployed Americans receive unemployment insurance benefits today.\nThe President has always been committed to ensuring that if Americans work hard they are able to get ahead. Through his efforts to raise the minimum wage, modernize overtime rules and secure paid leave for American workers, the President has advanced the principle that a hard day's work should be rewarded by good pay, decent benefits, and the ability for workers to care for their loved ones. In this era of rapid change, we need to modernize our policies that offer workers opportunity and security through health care, retirement, and an opportunity to advance in their careers. The proposal the President announced in his Weekly Address today is designed to ensure that if a worker loses her job, she has essential protections against economic insecurity that also help her retool and find a new job.\nThe President's proposal contains three core elements:\nI. Protecting Workers with Wage Insurance: The President's plan would ensure workers have access to wage insurance that would replace half of lost wages, up to $10,000 over two years. Displaced workers making less than $50,000 who were with their prior employer for at least three years would be able to leverage these resources to help them get back on their feet and on the way to a new career.\nII. Strengthening Unemployment Insurance (UI): The President's plan would address holes in our UI system - including by expanding coverage to part-time, many low-income, and intermittent workers, and workers who leave work for compelling family reasons. It would also ensure that states provide at minimum 26 weeks of coverage.\nIII. Making it Easier for Workers to Retool and Retrain: The President's plan would make it easier for companies to avoid lay-offs through work-sharing, while incentivizing states to offer and allow retraining for workers on UI or to provide relocation vouchers or subsidized employment. In addition, it would expand intensive career counseling to the long-term unemployed, discouraged, and part-time workers.\nMore detail on these proposals - which are paid for and will be described further in the President's forthcoming budget - is below.\nI. Protecting Workers with Wage Insurance\nThe President has put forward an agenda that grows middle-class jobs, fights to lift the minimum wage, and invests in jobs-driven skills training to improve all Americans' ability to secure a well-paying job. But the challenge for experienced workers who lose their jobs is particularly stark, as they may struggle to find work that pays as much as their prior job - both making it harder to make ends meet and leading them to stay on the sidelines.\nExperienced workers who lose their jobs through no fault of their own can face lasting consequences - as many of the same skills and experience that may have earned them higher salaries and raises at their previous job may no longer count when they are required to look for work again. On average, experienced workers starting over find themselves earning wages 10 percent or more below what they took home in the jobs they lost, and workers with more than twenty years of experience in their prior job face wages that are nearly a quarter less than what they made before.\nUnder the President's proposal, a modern system of wage insurance would help experienced workers make ends meet as they transition into a new job and start moving back up the ladder.\nProviding wage insurance to help displaced workers get back in the game. The President's proposal would require states to provide wage insurance for workers displaced through no fault of their own from jobs they had held for at least three years. Wage insurance would encourage workers to put their skills back to work quickly so that experienced workers do not join the ranks of the long-term unemployed or leave the workforce entirely.\nReplacing half of lost wages for experienced workers.Under the President's proposal, wage insurance would replace up to half of lost wages for workers who had worked three years or more at their previous employment and make less than $50,000 in their new job. Workers could receive up to $10,000 over two years to help make ends meet through a Federally-funded program administered directly through state unemployment insurance programs. This proposal would be fully paid-for as part of the President's broader unemployment insurance package described below.\nII. Strengthening Unemployment Insurance (UI)\nUnemployment Insurance is one of our most important protections for workers for who fall on tough times - last year alone over seven million workers relied on UI to get by in tough times - and during the Great Recession, UI was one of the most important policies for combatting further economic downturn. But changing times have weakened these protections.\nUI coverage is at its lowest levels in at least half a century. Today, fewer than one in three unemployed Americans receive UI benefits even though over 90 percent of employees have some taxes paid on their wages that support the UI system.\nOur economy has changed since 1935 when UI was first introduced - for example, women today are twice as likely to work, new industries have emerged, and businesses have created new ways of organizing work. As a result of all of these changes, many workers fall through cracks in our UI system. In addition, UI benefits now replace a smaller percentage of wages than before - making it harder for unemployed workers to make ends meet while looking for a new job.\nThe President's proposals would modernize the Unemployment Insurance System to protect more working families, restore system solvency, and help the Nation weather future economic crises.\nThe President's proposals, which are paid-for, would ensure Americans can rely on UI to provide basic support during difficult times by expanding coverage and ensuring states have the resources to provide benefits. In addition, the President's proposals would restore state UI program solvency, ensure each state has sufficient reserves to withstand future economic downturns, and provide a robust program that supports families and helps spur economic recovery in communities.\nThe President's proposals build on the track-record of success from the $7 billion made available through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to encourage states to expand coverage. With those resources, more than thirty states have implemented and sustained important UI reforms. The proposals put forward below, paid for in the President's Fiscal Year 2017 Budget, would go further by making many of those reforms the national standard.\nExpand coverage to protect low-income and vulnerable workers. The President's proposal would require that state UI programs cover workers that currently fall through the cracks, including part-time workers, newer labor market entrants, certain low-income and intermittent earners, and workers who leave work for compelling family reasons such as to move with a spouse, escape domestic violence, or care for an ill family member. States could receive incentives for improving benefit levels and extending coverage to workers in growing non-traditional forms of employment, like temporary employment services workers.\nRestore standard UI maximum benefit duration to 26 weeks. For the first time in over 50 years, nine states have cut their maximum UI benefit duration to less than 26 weeks - some, such as North Carolina now provide only up to 13 weeks. Even during the current economic recovery, an historically high 38 percent of workers exhaust their state-provided UI benefits. The President's proposals would reverse this damaging erosion of state UI benefit duration by requiring that all state programs provide at least 26 weeks of coverage, consistent with the historic norm.\nAutomatically extend benefits in the face of economic recessions. Unemployment insurance is one of the most effective tools to increase economic resilience. During the Great Recession, UI is credited with saving 1.75 million jobs and replacing one-fifth of the economy's lost demand. From 2008 to 2013, extended unemployment insurance benefits  helped nearly 24 million workers, lifting 2.5 million people out of poverty in 2012 alone. However, Congress has to enact extended benefits each time a recession hits, and often fails to act quickly enough for first-hit states or to extend benefits long enough for those hardest hit. The President's proposal would create a permanent program of extended UI benefits that would automatically provide up to 52 additional weeks of federally-funded benefits for states experiencing rapid job-losses or high unemployment.\nRestore solvency and ensure unemployment insurance for the long-term. Three out of five state UI programs are insolvent. Thirty-six states exited the Great Recession having relied on emergency federal loans. More than $7 billion in loans are outstanding today and even more is being borrowed through the private markets. Currently only 20 states have sufficient reserves to weather a single year of recession. Low state reserves remain a serious threat to unemployment insurance for working Americans. The President's proposal would put state unemployment insurance programs on a path to permanent solvency while insuring they have sufficient reserves to weather the next economic crisis. The proposal would modernize federal unemployment insurance taxes and hold states accountable for maintaining sufficient reserves to provide benefits for at least six months of an average economic recession.\nIII. Making It Easier for Workers To Retool and Retrain\nUnemployment Insurance should be as much about facilitating re-employment as about providing support to make ends meet while looking for a new job. As our economy continues to change and evolve, getting that next job may require preparing for new opportunities in new industries and new fields. The President's proposals encourage states to make it easier for workers to retool and retrain and provide workers with the guidance and support they need to gain new, relevant skills. These proposals build on the successes of the President's job-driven training agenda, which has aligned over $1 billion in annual job training grants with job-driven training best practices and put the most new apprentices into training in nearly a decade, among other accomplishments.\nThe President's proposals would help employers avoid lay-offs in the first place and provide unemployed workers with more opportunities and advice to train for the skills that will land them their next job.\nPrevent lay-offs before they happen. Work-sharing, also known as short-time compensation, can help employers hold onto their workers and avoid mass layoffs that can lead to long-term unemployment and hardship for working families and their communities. The President's proposal would provide implementation grants and additional incentives to states for work-sharing programs that help employers reduce hours instead of laying off workers while providing partial unemployment benefits to workers whose hours are cut.\nStrategies to help unemployed workers reconnect to the workplace. The President's proposals would provide states with incentives to directly link jobseekers to work as a reemployment strategy by providing states with incentives to adopt work and training-related reforms. For example, states would receive incentives to create temporary work-based training programs to help workers get back on the job and to allow workers to continue receiving UI benefits while participating in an apprenticeship or on-the-job training. States could also receive funds for relocation assistance programs to help workers pursue new opportunities in a different community based coupled with expert guidance on there might be new possibilities.\nProviding 21st Century Career Navigation. The President's Budget will propose to provide new resources to states for Career Navigators who instead will proactively reach out to every worker who is most at risk of not being able to reset their careers after being unemployed: (1) the long-term unemployed who have been unemployed for approximately six months or more; (2) discouraged workers who have dropped out of the labor force altogether; and (3) people who are only able to find part time work. Career Navigators will help them find a job, match with an appropriate training program, and connect to federal support services. This proposal will expand intensive counseling services to more than 1 million people annually. The President is also proposing the expansion of in-person reemployment services to the one-third of UI beneficiaries most at risk of exhausting their benefits, as well as all returning veterans who are receiving UI.\nBuilding on a Track Record of Success\nThe President's proposals for strengthening and modernizing the UI system build on the success of important reforms incentivized through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and additional modernization efforts launched through the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012.\nThe Recovery Act provided states an opportunity to receive up to $7 billion in incentives for expanding coverage and improving benefits. With those resources, well-over thirty states have implemented and sustained important UI reforms - from Maryland which introduced the alternative base period to cover workers with shorter work histories and provided benefits to part-time workers to Oklahoma which also reformed its system to protect workers who have to leave work for compelling family reasons. In addition, through the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, 28 states now have work-sharing programs, also known as short-time compensation, that conform with federal standards. In addition to the states that updated their laws to create model work-sharing programs, six of these states used incentives provided in the Act to create new programs within the past few years.. From 2008 to 2013, extended unemployment insurance benefits  helped nearly 24 million workers, lifting 2.5 million people out of poverty in 2012 alone. The experience of so many states with these reforms has helped lay the groundwork for making these policies the national standard.", "timestamp": "2016-01-16", "title": "Fact Sheet: Improving Economic Security by Strengthening and Modernizing the Unemployment Insurance System"}

It offends our fundamental American belief that everybody who works hard should be able to get ahead.\nThat's why we've been fighting so hard to give families more opportunity and more security: by working to create more good jobs, invest in our middle class, and help working people get a raise. That's what the Affordable Care Act is all about—filling in the gaps in employer-based care so that when somebody loses a job, or goes back to school, or starts that new business, they still have health care. And it's why I believe we've got to take steps to modernize our unemployment insurance system.\nIf a hard-working American loses her job, regardless of what State she lives in, we should make sure she can get unemployment insurance and some help to retrain for her next job. If she's been unemployed for a while, we should reach out to her and connect her with career counseling. And if she finds a new job that doesn't pay as much as her old one, we should offer some wage insurance that helps her pay her bills. Under my plan, experienced workers who now make less than $50,000 could replace half of their lost wages: up to $10,000 over 2 years. It's a way to give families some stability and encourage folks to rejoin the workforce, because we shouldn't just be talking about unemployment, we should be talking about reemployment.\nThat's when America works best: when everyone has opportunity, when everyone has some security, and when everyone can contribute to this country that we love. That's how we make sure that hard-working families can get ahead. And that's what I'll be fighting for with every last day of my Presidency.\nThanks, everybody. Have a great weekend.", "timestamp": "2016-01-16", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}

Donations. I hereby determine that, to the extent section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) may apply, the making of donations of the types of articles specified in such section by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order would seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12957, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by subsections 3(a)(ii), 3(b)(i)(D), and 3(c)(i) of this order.\nSec. 5.

Such persons shall be treated as persons covered by section 1 of Proclamation 8693 of July 24, 2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to United Nations Security Council Travel Bans and International Emergency Economic Powers Act Sanctions).\nSec. 7. General Authorities. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this order, other than the purposes described in section 6 of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these functions to other officers and agencies of the United States Government consistent with applicable law.\nSec. 8. Evasion and Conspiracy.

Definitions. For the purposes of this order:\n(a) the term \"entity\" means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;\n(b) the term \"financial institution,\" as used in subsection 3(b) of this order, includes:\n(i) a depository institution (as defined in section 3(c)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act) (12 U.S.C. 1813(c)(1)), including a branch or agency of a foreign bank (as defined in section 1(b)(7) of the International Banking Act of 1978) (12 U.S.C. 3101(7));\n(ii) a credit union;\n(iii) a securities firm, including a broker or dealer;\n(iv) an insurance company, including an agency or underwriter; and\n(v) any other company that provides financial services;\n(c) the term \"Government of Iran\" includes the Government of Iran, any political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality thereof, including the Central Bank of Iran, and any person owned or controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of, the Government of Iran;\n(d) the term \"Iran\" means the Government of Iran and the territory of Iran and any other territory or marine area, including the exclusive economic zone and continental shelf, over which the Government of Iran claims sovereignty, sovereign rights, or jurisdiction, provided that the Government of Iran exercises partial or total de facto control over the area or derives a benefit from economic activity in the area pursuant to international arrangements;\n(e) the term \"person\" means an individual or entity;\n(f) the term \"sanctioned person\" means a person that the Secretary of State or the Secretary of the Treasury, pursuant to authority delegated by the President and in accordance with the terms of such delegation, has determined is a person on whom sanctions shall be imposed pursuant to section 1244(d)(1)(A), 1245(a)(1), or 1246(a)(1) of IFCA (including in each case as informed by section 1253(c)(2) of IFCA) for engaging in transactions or activities outside the scope of the waiver determinations as to IFCA issued by the Secretary of State to give effect to sanctions commitments described in sections 17.1-17.3 and 17.5 of Annex V of the JCPOA, and any renewals thereof, and on whom the Secretary of State or the Secretary of the Treasury has imposed any of the sanctions in subsection 3(b) of this order;\n(g) the term \"United States financial institution\" means a financial institution as defined in subsection (b) of this section (including its foreign branches) organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States or located in the United States; and\n(h) the term \"United States person\" means any United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign branches), or any person in the United States.\nSec. 10. Notice. For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12957, there need be no prior notice of an action taken pursuant to subsection 3(a)(ii), 3(b)(i)(D), or 3(c)(i) of this order.\nSec. 11.

Relationship to Algiers Accords. The measures taken pursuant to this order are in response to actions of the Government of Iran occurring after the conclusion of the 1981 Algiers Accords, and are intended solely as a response to those later actions.\nBARACK OBAMA\nThe White House,\nJanuary 16, 2016.", "timestamp": "2016-01-16", "title": "Executive Order 13716—Revocation of Executive Orders 13574, 13590, 13622, and 13645 With Respect to Iran, Amendment of Executive Order 13628 With Respect to Iran, and Provision of Implementation Authorities for Aspects of Certain Statutory Sanctions Outside the Scope of U.S. Commitments Under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action of July 14, 2015"}

(IEEPA), I hereby report that I have issued an Executive Order (the \"order\") revoking Executive Orders 13574, 13590, 13622, and 13645 with respect to Iran and amending Executive Order 13628 with respect to Iran in order to give effect to the United States commitments with respect to sanctions described in section 4 of Annex II and section 17.4 of Annex V of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action of July 14, 2015 (JCPOA) between the P5+1 (China, France, Germany, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, and the United States), the European Union (EU), and Iran. In addition, the order takes steps to provide implementation authorities for aspects of certain statutory sanctions that are outside the scope of the U.S. commitments to lift nuclear-related sanctions under the JCPOA.\nIn Executive Order 12957 of March 15, 1995, the President found that the actions and policies of the Government of Iran threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. To deal with that threat, the President declared a national emergency and imposed prohibitions on certain transactions with respect to the development of Iranian petroleum resources. To further respond to that threat and to provide implementing authority for Iran-related sanctions legislation—including the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-172) (50 U.S.C. 1701 note); certain statutory requirements of the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-195) (22 U.S.C. 8501 et seq.); section 1245(c) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (Public Law 112-81) (22 U.S.C. 8513a); certain statutory requirements of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (Public Law 112-158) (22 U.S.C. 8701 et seq.); and certain statutory requirements of the Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act of 2012 (subtitle D of title XII of Public Law 112-239) (22 U.S.C. 8801 et seq.) (IFCA)—the President issued Executive Order 12959 of May 6, 1995, Executive Order 13059 of August 19, 1997, Executive Order 13553 of September 28, 2010, Executive Order 13574 of May 23, 2011, Executive Order 13590 of November 20, 2011, Executive Order 13599 of February 5, 2012, Executive Order 13606 of April 22, 2012, Executive Order 13608 of May 1, 2012, Executive Order 13622 of July 30, 2012, Executive Order 13628 of October 9, 2012, and Executive Order 13645 of June 3, 2013.\nOn July 14, 2015, the P5+1, the EU, and Iran announced the JCPOA, which will verifiably prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and ensure that Iran's nuclear program will be exclusively peaceful. The JCPOA provides for the lifting of nuclear-related sanctions on Iran in exchange for Iran's completion of specified nuclear-related steps, as verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). I have determined that Iran's implementation of the nuclear-related measures specified in sections 15.1-15.11 of Annex V of the JCPOA, as verified by the IAEA, marks a fundamental shift in circumstances with respect to Iran's nuclear program. In order to give effect to the United States commitments with respect to sanctions described in section 4 of Annex II and section 17.4 of Annex V of the JCPOA, section 1 of the order revokes Executive Orders 13574, 13590, 13622, and 13645 in their entirety. Section 2 of the order amends Executive Order 13628 by revoking sections 5 through 7 and section 15 of that order, revising cross references in the remaining sections of that order to the revoked sections, and renumbering the remaining sections of that order.\nSection 3(a) of the order provides implementation authority for aspects of section 1244(c)(1)(A) of IFCA; this provision only applies to the extent sanctions are imposed with respect to transactions or activities that are outside the scope of the JCPOA, specifically, providing significant financial, material, technological, or other support to, or goods and services in support of, any activity or transaction on behalf of or for the benefit of persons described in section 1244(c)(2)(C)(iii) of IFCA (i.e., Iranian persons on the list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN List)).\nSection 3(b) of the order provides implementation authority for aspects of sections 1244(d)(1)(A), 1245(a)(1), and 1246(a)(1) of IFCA; this provision only applies to the extent sanctions are imposed with respect to transactions or activities that are outside the scope of the JCPOA, as reflected in waiver determinations as to sections 1244(d)(1)(A), 1245(a)(1), and 1246(a)(1) of IFCA issued by the Secretary of State to give effect to sanctions commitments described in sections 17.1-17.3 and 17.5 of Annex V of the JCPOA (including any transactions or activities involving persons on the SDN List), and any renewals thereof.\nSection 3(c) of the order provides implementation authority for section 1249 of IFCA, which is outside the scope of the JCPOA.\nI have delegated to the Secretary of the Treasury the authority, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA, as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of the order, other than the purposes described in section 6 of the order.

After all the campaigning, soon, Americans will have their say with the first votes of the 2016 campaign just 15 days away in Iowa. And New Hampshire not far behind.\nTonight will be the final opportunity to see these candidates face to face before the voting begins. Our purpose here tonight is to highlight and examine the differences among the three Democratic candidates. So let's get started.\nPlease welcome Secretary Hillary Clinton, Senator Bernie Sanders and Governor Martin O'Malley. [applause]\nWell, welcome to all of you. Hope you're excited, we're excited. We want to thank our hosts, the Congressional Black Caucus Institute. I'm joined by my colleague Andrea Mitchell tonight. The rules are simple. Sixty seconds for answers, 30 seconds for follow-ups or rebuttals. I know you'll all keep exactly to time, so our job should be pretty easy here tonight. We'll have questions from the Youtube community throughout the debate.\nThis is a critical point in the race. You've been defining your differences with each other especially vigorously in the last week on the campaign trail. We're here to facilitate this conversation on behalf of the voters so that they know exactly where you stand as you face off tonight. Let's have a great debate.\nWe'll begin with 45 second opening statements from each candidate, starting with Secretary Clinton.\nCLINTON: Well, good evening. And I want to thank the Congressional Black Caucus Institute and the people of Charleston for hosting us here on the eve of Martin Luther King Day tomorrow.\nYou know, I remember well when my youth minister took me to hear Dr. King. I was a teenager. And his moral clarity, the message that he conveyed that evening really stayed with me and helped to set me on a path to service. I also remember that he spent the last day of his life in Memphis, fighting for dignity and higher pay for working people.\nAnd that is our fight still. We have to get the economy working and incomes rising for everyone, including those who have been left out and left behind. We have to keep our communities and our country safe. We need a president who can do all aspects of the job.\nI understand that this is the hardest job in the world. I'm prepared and ready to take it on and I hope to earn your support to be the nominee of the Democratic Party and the next president of the United States. [applause]\nHOLT: Thank you. Senator Sanders, your opening statement, sir.\nSANDERS: Thank you. As we honor the extraordinary life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., it's important not only that we remember what he stood for, but that we pledge to continue his vision to transform our country. As we look out at our country today, what the American people understand is we have an economy that's rigged, that ordinary Americans are working longer hours for lower wages, 47 million people living in poverty, and almost all of the new income and wealth going to the top one percent.\nAnd then, to make a bad situation worse, we have a corrupt campaign finance system where millionaires and billionaires are spending extraordinary amounts of money to buy elections.\nThis campaign is about a political revolution to not only elect the president, but to transform this country.\nHOLT: Senator, thank you. [applause]\nAnd Governor O'Malley, your opening statement, sir.\nO'MALLEY: Thank you. My name is Martin O'Malley, I was born the year Dr. King delivered his \"I Have A Dream\" speech.\nAnd I want to thank the people of South Carolina, not only for hosting our debate here tonight, but also for what you taught all of us in the aftermath of the tragic shooting at Mother Emanuel Church.\nYou taught us, in fact, in keeping with Dr. King's teaching, that love would have the final word when you took down the Confederate flag from your state house; let go of the past and move forward.\nEight years ago, you brought forward a new leader in Barack Obama to save our country from the second Great Depression. And that's what he's done. Our country's doing better, we're creating jobs again.\nBut in order to make good on the promise of equal opportunity and equal justice under the law, and we have urgent work to do, and the voices of anger and fear and division that we've heard coming off of the Republican presidential podiums are pretty loud.\nWe need new leadership. We need to come together as a people and build on the good things that President Obama has done.\nThat's why I'm running for president. I need your help, I ask for your vote, and I look forward to moving our country forward once again.\nThank you.\nHOLT: All right. And Governor, thank you. [applause]\nAll right, to our first question, now. The first question, I'll be addressing to all of the candidates.\nPresident Obama came to office determined to swing for the fences on health care reform. Voters want to know how you would define your presidency? How would you think big? So complete this sentence: in my first 100 days in office, my top three priorities will be — fill in the blank.\nSenator Sanders.\nSANDERS: Well, that's what our campaign is about. It is thinking big. It is understanding that in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, we should have health care for every man, woman, and child as a right that we should raise the minimum wage to at least $15 an hour; that we have got to create millions of decent- paying jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure.\nSo, what my first days are about is bringing America together, to end the decline of the middle class, to tell the wealthiest people in this country that yes, they are going to start paying their fair share of taxes, and that we are going to have a government that works for all of us, and not just big campaign contributors. [applause]\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton, same question, my first 100 days in office, my top three priorities will be.\nCLINTON: I would work quickly to present to the Congress my plans for creating more good jobs in manufacturing, infrastructure, clean and renewable energy, raising the minimum wage, and guaranteeing, finally, equal pay for women's work.\nI would also...[applause]...I would also be presenting my plans to build on the Affordable Care Act and to improve it by decreasing the out-of-pocket costs by putting a cap on prescription drug costs; by looking for ways that we can put the prescription drug business and the health insurance company business on a more stable platform that doesn't take too much money out of the pockets of hard-working Americans.\nAnd third, I would be working, in every way that I knew, to bring our country together. We do have too much division, too much mean- spiritedness. There's a lot we have to do on immigration reform, on voting rights, on campaign finance reform, but we need to do it together. That's how we'll have the kind of country for the 21st century that we know will guarantee our children and grandchildren the kind of future they deserve. [applause]\nHOLT: Governor O'Malley, same question.\nO'MALLEY: Thank you. First of all, I would lay out an agenda to make wages go up again for all Americans, rather than down. Equal pay for equal work, making it easier rather than harder for people to join labor unions and bargain collectively for better wages; getting 11 million of our neighbors out of the underground shadow economy by passing comprehensive immigration reform, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, however we can, wherever we can.\nSecondly, I believe the greatest business opportunity to come to the United States of America in 100 years is climate change. And I put forward a plan to move us to a 100 percent clean electric energy grid by 2050 and create 5 million jobs along the way. [applause]\nHOLT: Thank you. You've all...\nO'MALLEY: Finally — I'm sorry, that was second, Lester.\nAnd third and finally, we need a new agenda for America's cities. We have not had a new agenda for America's cities since Jimmy Carter. We need a new agenda for America cities that will invest in the talents and skills in our people, that will invest in CBVG transportation, infrastructure and transit options, and make our cities the leading edge in this move to a redesigned built clean green energy future that will employ our people.\nHOLT: All right governor thank you.\nWe've all laid out large visions and we're going to cover a lot of the ground you talked about as we continue in the evening. The last couple of weeks of this campaign have featured some of the sharpest exchanges in the race. Let's start with one of them, the issue of guns.\nSenator Sanders, last week Secretary Clinton called you quote, \"a pretty reliable vote for the gun lobby.\" Right before the debate you changed your position on immunity from lawsuits for gun manufacturers, can you tell us why?\nSANDERS: Well, I think Secretary Clinton knows that what she says is very disingenuous. I have a D-minus voting record from the NRA. I was in 1988, there were three candidates running for congress in the state of Vermont, I stood up to the gun lobby and came out and maintained the position that in this country we should not be selling military style assault weapons.\nI have supported from day one and instant background check to make certain that people who should have guns do not have guns. And that includes people of criminal backgrounds, people who are mentally unstable. I support what President Obama is doing in terms of trying to close the gun show loop holes and I think it should be a federal crime if people act as dormant.\nWe have seen in this city a horrendous tragedy of a crazed person praying with people in the coming up and shooting nine people. This should not be a political issue. What we should be doing is working together.\nAnd by the way, as a senator from a rural state that has virtually no gun control, I believe that I am in an excellent position to bring people together to fight the sensible...\nHOLT: Senator, but you didn't answer the question that you did change your position on immunity from gun manufacturers. So can you...\nSANDERS: What I have said, is that gun manufacturer's liability bill has some good provisions among other things, we've prohibited ammunition that would've killed cops who had protection on. We have child safety protection work on guns in that legislation. And what we also said, \"is a small mom and pop gun shop who sells a gun legally to somebody should not be held liable if somebody does something terrible with that gun.\"\nSo what I said is, \" I would re-look at it.\" We are going to re- look at it and I will support stronger provisions.\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond to Senator Sanders.\nCLINTON: Yes look, I have made it clear based on Senator Sanders' own record that he has voted with the NRA, with the gun lobby numerous times. He voted against the Brady Bill five times. He voted for what we call, the Charleston Loophole. He voted for immunity from gunmakers and sellers which the NRA said, \"was the most important piece of gun legislation in 20 years. \"\nHe voted to let guns go onto the Amtrak, guns go into National Parks. He voted against doing research to figure out how we can save lives. Let's not forget what this is about, 90 people a day die from gun violence in our country. That's 33,000 people a year.\nOne of the most horrific examples not a block from here where we had nine people murdered. Now, I am pleased to hear that Senator Sanders has reversed his position on immunity and I look forward to him joining with those members of congress who have already introduced legislation. There is no other industry in America that was given the total pass that the gun makers and dealers were and that needs to be reversed.\nHOLT: All right, Governor O'Malley, you signed tough gun control measures as governor of Maryland and there are a lot Democrats in the audience here in South Carolina who own guns. This conversation might be worrying many of them. They may be hearing, \"you want to take my guns. What would you say to them?\nO'MALLEY: This is what I would say Lester, look see, I've listened to Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders go back and forth on which of them has the most inconsistent record on gun safety legislation and I would have to agree with both of them. They've both been inconsistent when it comes to this issue.\nI'm the one candidate on this stage that actually brought people together to pass comprehensive gun safety legislation. This is very personal to me being from Baltimore. I will never forget one occasion visiting a little boy in Johns' Hopkins Hospital, he was getting a birthday haircut, the age of three when drug dealers turned that barbershop into a shooting gallery and that boy's head was pierced with a bullet. And I remember visiting him, it did not kill him - I remember visiting him and his mother in Johns Hopkins Hospital. He was getting a birthday haircut, the age of three when drug dealers turned that barbershop into a shooting gallery, and that boys head was pierced with a bullet.\nAnd, I remember visiting him, it did not kill him. I remember visiting him and his mother in Johns Hopkins Hospital. In his diapers with tubes running in and out of his head, same age as my little boy.\nSo, after the slaughter of the kids in Connecticut last year, we brought people together. We did pass in our state comprehensive gun safety legislation. It did have a ban on combat assault weapons, universal background checks, and you know what? We did not interrupt a single person's hunting season.\nI've never met a self respecting deer hunter that needed an AR-15 to down a deer. And, so...[applause]...we're able to actually do these things.\nHOLT: Alright, Governor, thank you.\nSecretary Clinton, this is a community that has suffered a lot of heartache in the last year. Of course, as you mentioned, the church shootings. We won't forget the video of Walter Scott being shot in the back while running from police.\nWe understand that a jury will decide whether that police officer was justified, but it plays straight to the fears of many African American men that their lives are cheap. Is that perception, or in your view, is it reality?\nCLINTON: Well, sadly it's reality, and it has been heartbreaking, and incredibly outraging to see the constant stories of young men like Walter Scott, as you said, who have been killed by police officers. Their needs to be a concerted effort to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.\nAnd, that requires a very clear, agenda for retraining police officers, looking at ways to end racial profiling, finding more ways to really bring the disparities that stalk our country into high relief.\nOne out of three African American men may well end up going to prison. That's the statistic. I want people hear to think what we would be doing if it was one out of three white men, and very often, the black men are arrested, convicted and incarcerated ...[applause]...for offensive that do not lead to the same results for white men.\nSo, we have a very serious problem that we can no longer ignore.\nHOLT: You time is up.\nSenator Sanders, my next question is...\nSANDERS: ...Well, I — look...\nHOLT: ... It's actually — actually my next question is to you...\nSANDERS: ... Let me respond to what the secretary said. We have a criminal justice system which is broken. Who in America is satisfied that we have more people in jail than any other country on Earth, including China? Disproportionately African American, and Latino. Who is satisfied that 51% of African American young people are either unemployed, or underemployed? Who is satisfied that millions of people have police records for possessing marijuana when the CEO's of Wall Street companies who destroyed our economy have no police records. [applause]\nHOLT: Senator Sanders...\nSANDERS: ... We need to take a very hard look at our...\nHOLT: Senator. Senator Sanders...\nSANDERS: ... criminal justice system, investing in jobs, and education not in jails and incarceration .\nHOLT: ... Just over a week ago the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus endorsed Secretary Clinton, not you. He said that choosing her over you was not a hard decision. In fact, our polling shows she's beating you more than two to one among minority voters. How can you be the nominee if you don't have that support?\nSANDERS: Well, let me talk about polling. [laughter] As Secretary Clinton well knows, when this campaign began she was 50 points ahead of me. We were all of three percentage points. Guess what?\nIn Iowa, New Hampshire, the race is very, very close. Maybe we're ahead New Hampshire. [cheering]\nIn terms of polling, guess what? We are running ahead of Secretary Clinton. In terms of taking on my taking on my good friend, Donald Trump, beating him by 19 points in New Hampshire, 13 points in the last national poll that we saw.\nTo answer your question. When the African American community becomes familiar with my Congressional record and with our agenda, and with our views on the economy, and criminal justice — just as the general population has become more supportive, so will the African American community, so will the Latino community. We have the momentum, we're on a path to a victory. [applause and cheering]\nO'MALLEY: Lester, I [inaudible]\nHOLT: Governor, I'm going to come to you in a second.\nGoogle searches for the words, \"Black Lives Matter\" surpassed, \"civil rights movement\". And, here in South Carolina, \"black lives matter\" was the number one trending political issue.HOLT: Governor O'Malley, you've campaigned on your record as governor of Maryland, and before that, the mayor of Baltimore. Last year, of course, Baltimore was rocked by violent unrest in the wake of the death of Freddie Gray.\nAnd right from the start of your campaign, you've been dogged by those who blame your tough-on-crime, so-called zero tolerance policies as mayor for contributing to that unrest. What responsibility do you bear?\nO'MALLEY: Yes, let's talk about this. When I ran for mayor in 1999, Lester, it was not because our city was doing well. It was because we were burying over 300 young, poor black men every single year.\nAnd that's why I ran, because, yes, black lives matter. And we did a number of things. We weren't able to make our city immune from setbacks as the Freddie Gray unrest and tragic death showed.\nBut we were able to save a lot of lives doing things that actually worked to improve police and community relations. The truth of the matter is, we created a civilian review board. And many of these things are in the new agenda for criminal justice reform that I've put forward.\nWe created a civilian review board, gave them their own detectives. We required the reporting of discourtesy, use of excessive force, lethal force. I repealed the possession of marijuana as a crime in our state.\nI drove our incarceration rate down to 20-year lows, and drove violent crime down to 30-year lows, and became the first governor south of the Mason-Dixon line to repeal the death penalty.\nI feel a responsibility every day to find things that work... [applause]\nHOLT: All right. Let's talk...\nO'MALLEY: ... and to do more of them to reform our criminal justice system.\nHOLT: Let's talk more about policing and the criminal justice system. Senator Sanders, a few times tonight we're going to hear from some of the most prominent voices on YouTube, starting with Franchesca Ramsey, who tackles racial stereotypes through her videos. Let's watch.\n[begin video clip]\nFRANCHESCA RAMSEY: Hey, I'm Franchesca Ramsey. I believe there's a huge conflict of interest when local prosecutors investigate cases of police violence within their own communities.\nFor example, last month, the officers involved in the case of 12- year-old Tamir Rice weren't indicted. How would your presidency ensure that incidents of police violence are investigated and prosecuted fairly?\n[end video clip]\nHOLT: Senator Sanders.\nSANDERS: I apologize for not hearing all of that question.\nHOLT: Would you like me to read it back to you?\nSANDERS: Yes.\nHOLT: Prosecutors — \"I believe there's a huge conflict of interest when local prosecutors investigate cases of police violence within their communities. Most recently, we saw this with a non- indictment of the officers involved in the case of 12-year-old Tamir Rice. How would you presidency ensure incidents of police violence are investigated and prosecuted fairly?\"\nSANDERS: Absolutely. This is a responsibility for the U.S. Justice Department to get involved. Whenever anybody in this country is killed while in police custody, it should automatically trigger a U.S. attorney general's investigation. [applause]\nSecond of all, and I speak as a mayor who worked very closely and well with police officers, the vast majority of whom are honest, hard- working people trying to do a difficult job, but let us be clear.\nIf a police officer breaks the law, like any public official, that officer must be held accountable. [applause]\nAnd thirdly, we have got to de-militarize our police departments so they don't look like occupying armies. We've got to move toward community policing.\nAnd fourthly, we have got to make our police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity. [applause]\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton, this question is for you. Tonight parts of America are in the grip of a deadly heroin epidemic, spanning race and class, hitting small towns and cities alike. It has become a major issue in this race.\nIn a lot of places where you've been campaigning, despite an estimated trillion dollars spent, many say the war on drugs has failed. So what would you do?\nCLINTON: Well, Lester, you're right. Everywhere I go to campaign, I'm meeting families who are affected by the drug problem that mostly is opioids and heroin now, and lives are being lost and children are being orphaned. And I've met a lot of grandparents who are now taking care of grandchildren.\nSo I have tried to come out with a comprehensive approach that, number one, does tell the states that we will work with you from the federal government putting more money, about a billion dollars a year, to help states have a different approach to dealing with this epidemic.\nThe policing needs to change. Police officers must be equipped with the antidote to a heroin overdose or an opioid overdose, known as Narcan. They should be able to administer it. So should firefighters and others.\nWe have to move away from treating the use of drugs as a crime and instead, move it to where it belongs, as a health issue. And we need to divert more people from the criminal justice system into drug courts, into treatment, and recovery.\nHOLT: And that's time.\nCLINTON: So this is the kind of approach that we should take in dealing with what is now...\nHOLT: Senator...\nCLINTON: ... a growing epidemic.\nHOLT: Senator Sanders, would you like to respond?\nSANDERS: Sure. I agree... [applause]\nI agree with everything the Secretary said, but let me just add this, there is a responsibility on the part of the pharmaceutical industry and the drug companies who are producing all of these drugs and not looking at the consequence of it.\nAnd second of all, when we talk about addiction being a disease, the Secretary is right, what that means is we need a revolution in this country in terms of mental health treatment. People should be able to get the treatment that they need when they need it, not two months from now, which is why I believe in universal...\nHOLT: That's...\nSANDERS: ... healthcare with mental health...\nHOLT: ... time.\nSANDERS: ... a part of that.\nHOLT: We're going to get into all that coming up.\nO'MALLEY: Lester, just ten seconds.\nHOLT: But we're going to take a break and we need to take a break...\nO'MALLEY: Just 10 seconds. All of the things...\nHOLT: ... and when we come back, the anger brewing in America.\n[commercial break]\nHOLT: Welcome back to Charleston. Let's turn to another area where there has been fierce disagreement — that would be health care.\nSenator Sanders and Secretary Clinton, you both mentioned it in your 100-day priorities.\nLet's turn to my colleague, Andrea Mitchell now to lead that questioning.\nMITCHELL: Thank you, Lester.\nSecretary Clinton, Senator Sanders favors what he calls \"Medicare for all.\" Now, you said that what he is proposing would tear up Obamacare and replace it.\nSecretary Clinton, is it fair to say to say that Bernie Sanders wants to kill Obamacare?\nCLINTON: Well, Andrea, I am absolutely committed to universal health care. I have worked on this for a long time, people may remember that I took on the health insurance industry back in the '90s, and I didn't quit until we got the children's health insurance program that ensures eight million kids.\nAnd I certainly respect Senator Sanders' intentions, but when you're talking about health care, the details really matter. And therefore, we have been raising questions about the nine bills that he introduced over 20 years, as to how they would work and what would be the impact on people's health care?\nHe didn't like that, his campaign didn't like it either. And tonight, he's come out with a new health care plan. And again, we need to get into the details. But here's what I believe, the Democratic Party and the United States worked since Harry Truman to get the Affordable Care Act passed.\nWe finally have a path to universal health care. We have accomplished so much already. I do not to want see the Republicans repeal it, and I don't to want see us start over again with a contentious debate. I want us to defend and build on the Affordable Care Act and improve it. [applause]\nSANDERS: OK.\nMITCHELL: Senator Sanders?\nSANDERS: Secretary — Secretary Clinton didn't answer your question. [laughter]\nBecause what her campaign was saying — Bernie Sanders, who has fought for universal health care for my entire life, he wants to end Medicare, end Medicaid, end the children's health insurance program. That is nonsense.\nWhat a Medicare-for-all program does is finally provide in this country health care for every man, woman and child as a right. Now, the truth is, that Frank Delano Roosevelt, Harry Truman, do you know what they believed in? They believed that health care should be available to all of our people.\nI'm on the committee that wrote the Affordable Care Act. I made the Affordable Care Act along with Jim Clyburn a better piece of legislation. I voted for it, but right now, what we have to deal with is the fact that 29 million people still have no health insurance. We are paying the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, getting ripped off.\nAnd here's the important point, we are spending far more per person on health care than the people of any other country. My proposal, provide health care to all people, get private insurance out of health insurance, lower the cost of health care for middle class families by 5,000 bucks.\nThat's the vision we need to take. [applause]\nCLINTON: But — Senator Sanders, if I can... [applause]\nYou know, I have to say I'm not sure whether we're talking about the plan you just introduced tonight, or we're talking about the plan you introduced nine times in the Congress. But the fact is, we have the Affordable Care Act. That is one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party, and of our country. [applause]\nAnd we have already seen 19 million Americans get insurance. We have seen the end of pre-existing conditions keeping people from getting insurance. [applause]\nWe have seen women no longer paying more for our insurance than men. And we have seen young people, up to the age of 26, being able to stay on their parent's policy.\nSANDERS: But — what if we have...\nCLINTON: Now, there are things we can do to improve it, but to tear it up and start over again, pushing our country back into that kind of a contentious debate, I think is the wrong direction.\nSANDERS: It is — it is absolutely inaccurate.\nO'MALLEY: I have to talk about something that's actually working in our state.\nMITCHELL: Governor — Governor Sanders...\nSANDERS: No one is tearing this up, we're going to go forward. But with the secretary neglected to mention, not just the 29 million still have no health insurance, that even more are underinsured with huge copayments and deductibles.\nTell me why we are spending almost three times more than the British, who guarantee health care to all of their people? Fifty percent more than the French, more than the Canadians. The vision from FDR and Harry Truman was health care for all people as a right in a cost-effective way.\nWe're not going to tear up the Affordable Care Act. I helped write it. But we are going to move on top of that to a Medicaid-for-all system.\nO'MALLEY: Andrea — Andrea — Andrea.\n[crosstalk] [applause]\nO'MALLEY: Instead of — Andrea, I think, instead of attacking one another on health care, we should be talking about the things that are actually working.\nIn our state, we have moved to an all-payer system. With the Affordable Care Act, we now have moved all of our acute care hospitals, that driver of cost at the center, away from fee-for- service.\nAnd actually to pay, we pay them based on how well they keep patients out of the hospital. How well they keep their patients. That's the future. We need to build on the Affordable Care Act, do the things that work, and reduce costs and increase access.\n[crosstalk]\nCLINTON: And that's exactly what we are able to do based on the foundation of the Affordable Care Act — what Governor O'Malley just said is one of the models that we will be looking at to make sure we do get costs down, we do limit a lot of the unnecessary costs that we still have in the system.\nBut, with all due respect, to start over again with a whole new debate is something that I think would set us back. The Republicans just voted last week to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and thank goodness, President Obama vetoed it and saved Obamacare for the American people. [applause]\nMITCHELL: Senator Sanders, let me ask you this, though...\nSANDERS: Yeah.\nMITCHELL: ... you've talked about Medicare for all...\nSANDERS: Yes.\nMITCHELL: .. and tonight you've released a very detailed plan, just two...\nSANDERS: Not all that detailed.\nMITCHELL: ... well, two hours before the debate, you did.\nSANDERS: Well.\nMITCHELL: But let me ask you about Vermont. Because in Vermont — you tried in the state of Vermont, and Vermont walked away from this kind of idea, of — of Medicare for all, single-payer, because they concluded it would require major tax increases...\nSANDERS: Well, that's — you might want to ask...\nMITCHELL: ... and by some estimates, it would double the budget. If you couldn't sell it in Vermont, Senator...\nSANDERS: Andrea, let me just say this.\nMITCHELL: ... how can you sell it to the country?\nSANDERS: Let me just say that you might want to ask the governor of the state of Vermont why he could not do it. I'm not the governor. I'm the senator from the state of Vermont. [laughter]\nBut second of all — second of all...[applause]... here is what the real point is, in terms of all of the issues you've raised — the good questions you've raised. You know what it all comes down to?\nDo you know why we can't do what every other country — major country on Earth is doing? It's because we have a campaign finance system that is corrupt, we have super PACs, we have the pharmaceutical industry pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into campaign contributions and lobbying, and the private insurance companies as well.\nWhat this is really about is not the rational way to go forward — it's Medicare for all — it is whether we have the guts to stand up to the private insurance companies and all of their money, and the pharmaceutical industry. That's what this debate should be about. [applause]\nCLINTON: Well, as someone who — as someone who has a little bit of experience standing up to the health insurance industry, that spent, you know...[applause]...many, many millions of dollars attacking me, and probably will so again, because of what I believe we can do building on the Affordable Care Act, I think it's important to point out that there are a lot of reasons we have the health care system we have today.\nI know how much money influences the political decision-making. That's why I'm for huge campaign finance reform. However, we started a system that had private health insurance.\nAnd even during the Affordable Care Act debate, there was an opportunity to vote for what was called the public option. In other words, people could buy in to Medicare, and even when the Democrats were in charge of the Congress, we couldn't get the votes for that.\nSo, what I'm saying is really simple. This has been the fight of the Democratic Party for decades. We have the Affordable Care Act. Let's make it work.\nLet's take the models that states are doing. We now have driven costs down to the lowest they've been in 50 years. Now we've got to get individual costs down. That's what I'm planning to do.\nHOLT: And that's time. We're gonna take a turn now.\nSecretary Clinton, in his final State of the Union address, President Obama said his biggest regret was his inability to bring the country together. If President Obama couldn't do it, how will you?\nO'MALLEY: Great question.\nCLINTON: Well, I think it's an important point the president made in his State of the Union. And here's what I would say. I will go anywhere, to meet with anyone, at any time to find common ground.\nThat's what I did as a first lady, when I worked with both Democrats and Republicans to get the Children's Health Insurance Program, when I worked with Tom DeLay, one of the most partisan of Republicans, to reform the adoption and foster care system.\nWhat I did, working in the Senate, where I crossed the aisle often, working even with the senator from South Carolina, Lindsey Graham, to get Tricare for national guardsmen and women.\nAnd it's what I did as Secretary of State, on numerous occasions, and most particularly, rounding up two-thirds votes in order to pass a treaty that lowered the nuclear weapons in both Russia and the United States.\nSo I know it's hard, but I also know you've got to work at it every single day. I look out here, I see a lot of my friends from the Congress. And I know that they work at it every single day.\nBecause maybe you can't only find a little sliver of common ground to cooperate with somebody from the other party, but who knows. If you're successful there, maybe you can build even more. That's what I would do.\nHOLT: That's time. Senator Sanders, response. [applause]\nSANDERS: A couple of years ago, when we understood that veterans were not getting the quality care they needed in the timely manner, I worked with folks like John McCain and others to pass the most comprehensive veteran's health care legislation in modern history.\nBut let me rephrase your question because I think, in all do respect, you're expression. In all do respect, you're missing the main point. And the main point in the Congress, it's not the Republicans and Democrats hate each other.\nThat's a mythology from the media. The real issue is that Congress is owned by big money and refuses to do what the American people want them to do. [applause]\nThe real issue is that in area after area, raising the minimum wage to $15 bucks an hour. The American people want it. Rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, creating 13 million jobs, the American people want it. The pay equity for women, the American people want it. Demanding that the wealthy start paying their fair share of taxes. The American people want it.\nHOLT: That's time. But let me continue with the...\nSANDERS: The point is, we have to make Congress respond to the needs of the people, not big money.\nHOLT: Senator Sanders, let me continue, you call yourself a Democratic socialist...\nSANDERS: I do.\nHOLT: And throughout your career in politics, you've been critical of the Democratic party, you've been saying in a book you wrote, quote, \"There wasn't a hell of a big difference between the the two major parties.\" How would you will a general election...\nSANDERS: Did I say that?\nHOLT: How will you win a general election labeling yourself a democratic socialist?\nSANDERS: Because of what I believe in what I was just saying. The Democratic party needs major reform. To those of you in South Carolina, you know what, in Mississippi, we need a 50-state strategy so that people in South Carolina and Mississippi can get the resources that they need.\nInstead of being dependent on super PACs, what we need is to be dependent on small, individual campaign contributors. We need an agenda that speaks to the needs of working families and low-income people. Not wealthy campaign contributors.\nHOLT: Yes, but senator, you can...\nSANDERS: We need to expand what the input into the Democratic party. I am very proud that in this campaign, we have seen an enormous amount of excitement from young people, from working people. We have received more individual contributions than any candidate in the history of this country up to this point. [applause]\nO'MALLEY: Yes, but senator you never came to campaign for Vincent Sheheen when he was running for governor. In fact, neither of you came to campaign for Vincent Sheheen when he was running for governor. [applause]\nWe can talk all we want about wanting to build a stronger Democratic party, but Lester, the question you answered, it's no laughing matter.\nThe most recurring question I get when I stand on the chair all across Iowa and talk with my neighbors is, how are you going to heal the divisions and the wounds in our country? This is the biggest challenge we face as a people.\nAll my life, I brought people together over deep divides and very old wounds, and that's what we need now in a new leader. We cannot keep talking past each other, declaring all Republicans are our enemies or the war is all about being against millionaires or billionaires, or it's all against American Muslims, all against immigrants.\nLook, as Frederick Douglas said, we are one, our cause is one, and we must help each other if we are going to succeed.\nHOLT: And that is right.\nSANDERS: And I respectfully disagree.\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton, our next question is for you. Here's another quantitative problem.\nSANDERS: And I respectfully disagree with my friend over here. And that is, you are right. All of us have denounced Trump's attempts to divide this country: the anti-Latino rhetoric, the racist rhetoric, he anti-Muslim rhetoric.\nBut where I disagree with you, Governor O'Malley, is I do believe we have to deal with the fundamental issues of a handful of billionaires...\nO'MALLEY: I agree with that.\nSANDERS: ... who control economic and political life of this country.\nO'MALLEY: I agree.\nSANDERS: Nothing real will get happened. Unless we have a political revolution. Where millions of people finally stand up.\nHOLT: And we're going to get into that coming up. But Secretary Clinton, here's a question from YouTube. It's from a young video blogger who has over 5 million subscribers. He has a question about the importance of younger voters.\n[begin video clip]\nFRANTA: Hi, I'm Connor Franta, I'm 23 and my audience is around the same age. Getting my generation to vote should be a priority for any presidential candidate.\nNow I know Senator Sanders is pretty popular among my peers, but what I want to know is, how are all of you planning on engaging us further in this election?\n[end video clip]\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton.\nCLINTON: Well thanks for the question and congratulations on five million viewers on YouTube, that's quite an accomplishment. Look, this election is mostly about the future and therefore it is of greatest urgency for young people.\nI've laid out my ideas about what we can do to make college affordable; how we can help people pay off their student debts and save thousands of dollars, how we can create more good jobs because a lot of the young people that I talk with are pretty disappointed the economic prospects they feel their facing. So making community college free, making it possible to attend a public college or university with debt free tuition, looking for ways to protect our rights especially from the concerted Republican assault; on voting rights, on women's rights, on gay rights, on civil rights, on workers rights.\nAnd I know how much young people value their independence, their autonomy, and their rights. So I think this is an election where we have to pull young people and older people together to have a strategy about how we're going to encourage even more American's to vote because it absolutely clear to me...\nHOLT: That's time...\nCLINTON: That turning over our White House to the Republicans would be bad for everybody especially young people.\nHOLT: A quick follow up — a thirty second follow up.\nWhy is Senator Sanders beating you to 2 to 1 among younger votes?\nCLINTON: Look, I have the greatest respect for Senator Sanders and for his supports and I'm going to keep working as hard as I can to reach as many people of all ages about what I will do, what the experience and the ideas that I have that I will bring to the White House and I hope to have their support when I'm the Democratic nominee.\nHOLT: We're going to take...\nSANDERS: Is that your strategy...\nHOLT: We're going to take a break. When we come back; big banks, big business and big differences among the three candidates on the American Economy. We'll be right back.\n[commercial break]\nHOLT: Welcome back from Charleston. Let's turn now to the economy.\nSenator Sanders, you released a tough new ad last week in which without mentioning Secretary Clinton by name, you talk about two Democratic visions for regulating Wall Street. \"One says it's OK to take millions from big banks and tell them what to do. My plan, break up the big banks, close the tax loopholes and make them pay their fair share.\"\nWhat do you see as the difference between what you would do about the banks and what Secretary Clinton would do?\nSANDERS: Well, the first difference is I don't take money from big banks. I don't get personal speaking fees from Goldman Sachs. What I would do... [applause]\nWhat I would do is understand that when you have three out of the four largest banks today, bigger than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have the six largest financial institutions having assets of 60 percent of the GDP of America, it is very clear to me what you have to do.\nYou've got to bring back the 21st century Glass-Steagall legislation and you've got to break up these huge financial institutions. They have too much economic power and they have too much financial power over our entire economy. If Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, the old Republican trust buster, what he would say is these guys are too powerful. Break them up. I believe that's what the American people to want see. That's my view.\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton, help the voter understand the daylight between the two of you here.\nCLINTON: Well, there's no daylight on the basic premise that there should be no bank too big to fail and no individual too powerful to jail. We agree on that. But where we disagree is the comments that Senator Sanders has made that don't just affect me, I can take that, but he's criticized President Obama for taking donations from Wall Street, and President Obama has led our country out of the great recession. Senator Sanders called him weak, disappointing. He even, in 2011, publicly sought someone to run in a primary against President Obama. Now, I personally believe that President Obama's work to push through the Dodd-Frank... [laughter]\nThe Dodd-Frank bill and then to sign it was one of the most important regulatory schemes we've had since the 1930s. So I'm going to defend Dodd-Frank and I'm going to defend President Obama for taking on Wall Street, taking on the financial industry and getting results. [applause]\nSANDERS: OK. First of all...\nHOLT: Senator Sanders, your response.\nSANDERS: Set the record right. In 2006 when I ran for the Senate, Senator Barack Obama was kind enough to campaign for me, 2008, I did my best to see that he was elected and in 2012, I worked as hard as I could to see that he was reelected. He and I are friends. We've worked together on many issues. We have some differences of opinion.\nBut here is the issue, Secretary touched on it, can you really reform Wall Street when they are spending millions and millions of dollars on campaign contributions and when they are providing speaker fees to individuals? So it's easy to say, well, I'm going to do this and do that, but I have doubts when people receive huge amounts of money from Wall Street.\nI am very proud, I do not have a super PAC. I do not want Wall Street's money. I'll rely on the middle class and working families...\nHOLT: That's time.\nGovernor O'Malley...[crosstalk]\nSANDERS: ... campaign contributions.\nHOLT: I have a question for you... [applause]\nCLINTON: You know, I think since — since Senator Standers followed up on this...\nHOLT: Thirty-second response.\nCLINTON: Your profusion of comments about your feelings towards President Obama are a little strange given what you said about him in 2011.\nBut look, I have a plan that most commentators have said is tougher, more effective, and more comprehensive.\nO'MALLEY: That's not true.\nCLINTON: It builds on the Dodd-Frank — yes, it is. It builds on the Dodd-Frank, regulatory scheme...\nO'MALLEY: It's just not true.\nCLINTON: ... but it goes much further, because...\nO'MALLEY: Oh, come on.\nCLINTON: ... both the governor and the senator have focused only on the big banks. Lehman Brothers, AIG, the shadow banking sector were as big a problem in what caused the Great Recession, I go after them.\nAnd I can tell you that the hedge fund billionaires who are running ads against me right now, and Karl Rove, who started running an ad against me right now, funded by money from the financial services sector, sure thing, I'm the one they don't want to be up against. [applause]\nHOLT: Governor O'Malley.\nO'MALLEY: Yes, thank you. Yes, Lester, what Secretary Clinton just said is actually not true. What — I have put forward a plan that would actually put cops back on the beat of Wall Street. I have put forward a plan that was heralded as very comprehensive and realistic.\nLook, if a bank robber robs a bank and all you do is slap him on the wrist, he's just going to keep robbing banks again. The same thing is true with people in suits.\nSecretary Clinton, I have a tremendous amount of respect for you, but for you to say there's no daylight on this between the three of us is also not true. I support reinstituting a modern version of Glass- Steagall that would include going after the shadow banks, requiring capital requirements that would force them to no longer put us on the hook for these sorts of things.\nIn prior debates I've heard you even bring up — I mean, now you bring up President Obama here in South Carolina in defense of the fact of your cozy relationship with Wall Street.\nIn an earlier debate, I heard you bring up even the 9/11 victims to defend it. The truth of the matter is, Secretary Clinton, you do not go as far as reining in Wall Street as I would.\nAnd the fact of the matter is, the people of America deserve to have a president that's on their side, protecting the main street economy from excesses on Wall Street. And we're just as vulnerable today.\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton, 30-second response. [applause]\nCLINTON: Yes, well, first of all — first of all, Paul Krugman, Barney Frank, others have all endorsed my plan. Secondly, we have Dodd-Frank. It gives us the authority already to break up big banks that pose...\nO'MALLEY: And we have never used it.\nCLINTON: That pose a risk to the financial sector. I want to go further and add to that.\nAnd, you know, Governor, you have raised money on Wall Street. You raised a lot of money on Wall Street when you were the head of the Democratic Governor's Association...\nO'MALLEY: Yes, but I haven't gotten a penny this year...\nCLINTON: And you were...\nO'MALLEY: ... so somebody please, go on to martinomalley.com...[laughter]. Go on to martinomalley.com, send me your checks. They're not giving me — zero.\nCLINTON: Yes, well, the point is that if we're going to be serious about this and not just try to score political points, we should know what's in Dodd-Frank, and what's in Dodd-Frank already gives the president the authority...[crosstalk]...with his regulators to make those decisions.\nSANDERS: Let me give you an example of how corrupt — how corrupt this system is. Goldman Sachs recently fined $5 billion. Goldman Sachs has given this country two secretaries of treasury, one on the Republicans, one under Democrats.\nO'MALLEY: Say it.\nSANDERS: The leader of Goldman Sachs is a billionaire who comes to Congress and tells us we should cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.\nSecretary Clinton — and you're not the only one, so I don't mean to just point the finger at you, you've received over $600,000 in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs in one year.\nI find it very strange that a major financial institution that pays $5 billion in fines for breaking the law, not one of their executives is prosecuted, while kids who smoke marijuana get a jail sentence. [applause]\nHOLT: That's time.\nAndrea.\nCLINTON: Well, the last point on this is, Senator Sanders, you're the only one on this stage that voted to deregulate the financial market in 2000, to take the cops off the street, to use Governor O'Malley's phrase, to make the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission no longer able to regulate swaps and derivatives, which were one of the main cause of the collapse in '08.\nSo there's plenty...\nSANDERS: If you want to...\nCLINTON: There's plenty of problems that we all have to face together.\nAnd the final thing I would say, we're at least having a vigorous debate about reining in Wall Street...\nHOLT: ... Senator...\nCLINTON: ... The Republicans want to give them more power, and repeal Dodd-Frank. That's what we need to stop... [applause]\nSANDERS: Anyone who wants to check my record in taking on Wall Street, in fighting against the deregulation of Wall Street when Wall Street put billions of dollars in lobbying, in campaign contributions to get the government off their backs. They got the government off their backs.\nTurns out that they were crooks, and they destroyed our economy. I think it's time to put the government back on their backs. [applause]\nMITCHELL: Senator Sanders — Senator Sanders, you've talked a lot about things you want to do. You want free education for everyone, you want the Federal Minimum Wage raised to $15 an hour. You want to expand Social Security...\nSANDERS: ... Yeah...\nMITCHELL: ... benefits. You've been specific about what you want, but let's talk about how to pay for all this. You now said that you would raise taxes today, two hours or so ago, you said you would raise taxes to pay for your health care plan. You haven't been specific about how to pay for the other things...\nSANDERS: ... That's true.\nMITCHELL: ... Will you tell us tonight?\nSANDERS: Good. You're right. I want to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, create 13 million jobs. We do that by doing away with the absurd loophole that now allows major profitable corporations to stash their money in the Cayman Islands, and not in some years, pay a nickel in taxes. Yes, I do. I plead guilty. I want every kid in this country who has the ability to be able to go to a public college, or university, tuition free. And, by the way, I want to substantially lower student debt interest rates in this country as well.\nHow do I pay for it? [applause]\nI pay for it through a tax on Wall Street speculation. This country, and the middle class, bailed out Wall Street. Now, it is Wall Street's time to help the middle class. In fact...\nO'MALLEY: [inaudible]\nSANDERS: ... we have documented, unlike Secretary Clinton, I have documented exactly how I would pay for our ambitious agenda.\nO'MALLEY: Andrea...\nMITCHELL: ... OK...\nO'MALLEY: ... The only person on this stage who has...\nMITCHELL: ... Secretary Clinton, you mentioned earlier — Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond?\nCLINTON: Well, I have actually documented every way that I'm going to pay for what I'm doing because I think the American public deserves to know. And, you can go to my website and actually see that.\nBut, there are serious questions about how we're going to pay for what we want to see our country do. And, I'm the only candidate standing here tonight who has said I will not raise taxes on the middle class. I want to raise incomes, not taxes, and I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that the wealthy pay for debt free tuition, for child care, for paid family leave. To help us bring down student debt we're going to refinance that student debt, saving kids thousands of dollars.\nYeah, and that will also come out of the — some of the pockets of people in the financial services industry...\nMITCHELL: OK, we're out of time. Senator Sanders,\nCLINTON: But I will tell you exactly how I pay for everything I've proposed...[crosstalk]\nMITCHELL: Senator Sanders...\nSANDERS: ... Here is the main two points...\nMITCHELL: ... Senator Sanders, let me ask you a question about taxes.\nSANDERS: Yeah.\nMITCHELL: The most googled political issue...\nSANDERS: ... I got it.\nMITCHELL: In the last month was taxes. Now, in your healthcare plan, the plan you released tonight, you would not only raise taxes on the wealthy, but the details you released indicate you would raise taxes on the middle class also. Is that correct?\nSANDERS: What is correct, and I'm disappointed that Secretary Clinton's campaign has made this criticism. It's a Republican criticism. Secretary Clinton does know a lot about healthcare, and she understands, I believe, that a medicare for all, single payer program will substantially lower the cost of healthcare for middle class families. So, what we have got to acknowledge, and I hope the Secretary does, is we are doing away with private health insurance premiums.\nSo, instead of paying $10,000 dollars to Blue Cross, or Blue Shield, yes, some middle class families would be paying slightly more in taxes, but the result would be that that middle class family would be saving some $5,000 dollars in healthcare costs. A little bit more in taxes, do away with private health insurance premiums. It's a pretty good deal. [applause]\nMITCHELL: Senator — Senator, let me just follow up on that.\nSANDERS: Yeah.\nMITCHELL: On Meet the Press on December 20th, you said that you would only raise taxes on the middle class to pay for family leave. And, having said that, now you say you're going to raise middle class taxes to pay for healthcare as well. Is that breaking your word?\nSANDERS: No, it is not breaking my word. When you are — it's one thing to say I'm raising taxes, it's another thing to say that we are doing away with private health insurance premiums.\nSo, if I save you $10,000 in private health insurance, and you pay a little bit more in taxes in total, there are huge savings in what your family is spending.\nO'MALLEY: Senator, I'm the only person on this stage that's actually balanced a budget every year for 15 years.\nSANDERS: I was mayor for eight years, I did that as well. [laughter]\nO'MALLEY: OK. So, that was eight years. Yes. And Senator, but I actually did it during a budget down time — I mean, during a recession.\nAnd Andrea, the — I had to make more cuts than any governor in the history of Maryland, but we invested more in infrastructure, more in transportation. We made our public schools more in America more than five years in a row, and went four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuition.\nThe things that we need to do in our country, like debt-free college in the next five years, like making universal — like making national service a universal option in order to cut youth unemployment in half in the next three years, all these things can be done if we eliminate one entitlement we can no longer afford as a nation.\nAnd that is the wealthy among us, those making more than a million dollars, feel that they are entitled to paying a much lower marginal tax rate than was usual for the better part of these 80 years.\nAnd if we tax earnings from investments on money — namely capital gains — at the same rate as we tax sweat and hard work and toil, we can make the investments we need to make to make our country better.\nHOLT: We have got a lot to ground to cover here.\nMany Democratic voters are passionate about the need to do something to combat the threat of climate change, including the team of scientists from Youtube's MinuteEarth channel.\nHere's their take.\n[begin video clip]\nANNOUNCER: Hello from MinuteEarth. Fossil fuels have long kept our cars moving and our light bulbs lit.\nBut we know that burning these fuels releases heat-trapping gases that are warming the planet, causing seas to rise and contributing to extreme weather events, like South Carolina's devastating flooding last year.\nFighting human-caused climate change means giving up our global addiction to fossil fuels and shifting the bulk of the world's energy supply to alternative sources.\nSome countries have acted decisively to make this transition. But here at home, we still get a whooping 82 percent of our energy from coal, oil, and natural gas.\nIn the U.S., political gridlock, pressure from industry lobbyists and insufficient R&D have made an already tough battle against climate change even tougher.\n[end video clip]\nHOLT: Senator Sanders, Americans love their SUVs, which spiked in sales last year as gas prices plummeted.\nHow do you convince Americans that the problem of climate change is so urgent that they need to change their behavior?\nSANDERS: I think we already are. Younger generation understands it instinctively.\nI was home in Burlington, Vermont, on Christmas Eve, the temperature was 65 degrees. People in Vermont know what's going on. People who did ice fishing, where their ice is no longer there on the lake understand what's going on.\nI'm on both the Environmental and Energy Committees. The debate is over. Climate change is real. It is already causing major problems. And if we do not act boldly and decisively, a bad situation will become worse.\nIt is amazing to me, and I think we'll have agreement on this up here, that we have a major party, called the Republican Party that is so owned by the fossil fuel industry and their campaign contributions that they don't even have the courage, the decency to listen to the scientists. [applause]\nIt is beyond my comprehension how we can elect a president of the United States, somebody like Trump, who believes that climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese. [laughter]\nBottom line is, we need to be bold and decisive, we can create millions of jobs. We must, for the sake of our kids and grandchildren, transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.\nI've got the most comprehensive legislation in the Senate to do that. And as president, I will fight to make that happen. [applause]\nHOLT: Governor O'Malley, 30 seconds.\nO'MALLEY: Thank you.\nLester, on this stage tonight, this Democratic stage, where we actually believe in science. [laughter]\nI would like to challenge and invite my colleagues here on this stage to join me in putting forward a plan to move us to a 100 percent clean, electric energy grid by 2050. It can be done. [applause]\nWith solar, with wind, with new technologies, with green buildings, this can happen, but in all — President Obama made us more energy independent, but in all of the above strategy didn't land us on the moon, we need American ingenuity and we need to reach by 2050 for the sake of our kids.\nHOLT: That's time. We're going to take a break.\nCLINTON: And let me...\nHOLT: When we return, the late-breaking developments regarding Iran. The threat of ISIS now more real than ever on U.S. soil. Americans in fear and hearing few good answers.\nWe'll be right back.\n[commercial break]\nHOLT: Charleston, Andrea Mitchell has questions now starting with Iran.\nMITCHELL: Thank you Lester.\nSenator Sanders, the nuclear deal is now enforced. Iran is getting it's billions of dollars, several Americans who have been held are now going to be heading home. The president said today, \"it's a good day. It's a good day for diplomacy. It's a time now to restore diplomatic relations for the first time since 1979 and actually re- opened a U.S. Embassy in Tehran.\"\nSANDERS: I think what we've got to do is move as aggressively as we can to normalize relations with Iran. Understanding that Iran's behavior in so many ways is something that we disagree with; their support terrorism, the anti-American rhetoric that we're hearing from of their leadership is something that is not acceptable.\nOn the other hand, the fact that we've managed to reach an agreement, something that I've very strongly supported that prevents Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and we did that without going to war. And that I believe we're seeing a fall in our relationships with Iran is a very positive step. So if your question is, do I want to see that relationship become more positive in the future? Yes.\nCan I tell that we should open an embassy in Tehran tomorrow? No, I don't think we should. But I think the goal has go to be as we've done with Cuba, to move in warm relations with a very powerful and important country in this world.\nMITCHELL: Your response Secretary Clinton?\nCLINTON: Well, I'm very proud of the Iran Nuclear Agreement. I was very pleased to be part of what the president put into action when he took office. I was responsible for getting those sanctions imposed which put the pressure on Iran. It brought them to the negotiating table which resulted in this agreement.\nAnd so, they have been so far, following their requirements under the agreement. But I think we still have to carefully watch them. We've had one good day over 36 year and I think we need more good days before we move more rapidly toward any kind of normalization. And we have to be sure that they are truly going to implement the agreement. And then, we have to go after them on a lot of their other bad behavior in the region which is causing enormous problems in Syria, Yemen, Iraq and elsewhere.\nMITCHELL: You mentioned Syria. Let me ask you about Syria, all of you. Let's turn to Syria and the civil war that has been raging there. Are there any circumstances in which you could see deploying significant numbers of ground forces in Syria, not just specials forces but significant ground forces to combat ISIS in a direct combat role?\nLet me start with you Secretary Clinton.\nCLINTON: Absolutely not.\nI have a three point plan that does not include American Ground forces. It includes the United States leading an air coalition which is what we're doing, supporting fighters on the ground; the Iraqi Army which is beginning to show more ability, the Sunni fighters that we are now helping to reconstitute and Kurdish on both sides of the border.\nI think we also have try to disrupt their supply chain of foreign fighters and foreign money and we do have to contest them in online space. So I'm very committed to both going after ISIS but also supporting what Secretary Kerry is doing to try to move on a political diplomatic to try to begin to slow down and hopefully end the carnage in Syria which is the root of so many of the problems that we seen in the region and beyond.\nMITCHELL: Senator Sanders, ground forces yes or no?\nSANDERS: As everybody you know, this is incredibly complicated and difficult issue and I applaud. I know President Obama's been getting a lot of criticism on this. I think he is doing the right thing.\nWhat the nightmare is, which many of my Republican colleagues appear to want is to not have learned the lesson of Iraq. To get American young men and women involved in perpetual warfare in the quagmire of Syria and the Middle East would be an unmitigated disaster that as president, I will do everything in my power to avoid.\nO'MALLEY: Andrea...\nMITCHELL: Governor O'Malley?\nSANDERS: We should — we should learn — we should learn from King Abdullah of Jordan, one of the few heroes in a very unheroic place. And what Abdullah said is this is a war with a soul of Islam and that Muslim troops should be on the ground with our support and the support of other major countries. That is how we destroy ISIS, not with American troops in perpetual warfare.\nMITCHELL: Governor O'Malley.\nO'MALLEY: Thank you. [applause]\nAndrea, governors have led us to victory in two world wars by doing what America does best, and that is by joining forces with others by acting in coalition. And I believe that President Obama is doing the right thing in this case.\nWe need to learn the lessons from the past. We do need to provide the special — special ops advisers, we need — do need to provide the technical support, but over the long-term, we need to develop new alliances. We need a much more proactive national security strategy that reduces these threats before they rise to a level where it feels like we need to pull for a division of marines.\nAnd I also want to add one other thing here. I appreciate the fact that in our debate, we don't use the term you hear Republicans throwing around trying to look all vibrato and macho sending other kids — kids into combat, they keep using the term boots on the ground. A woman in Burlington, Iowa said to me, \"Governor, when you're with your colleagues, please don't refer to my son who has served two tours of duty in Iraq as a pair of boots on the ground.\" Now, we need to be mindful of learning the lessons of the past. [applause]\nMITCHELL: I have a question. I have a question for Senator Sanders. Did the policies of the Obama administration, in which Secretary Clinton of course was a part, create a vacuum in Iraq and Syria that helped ISIS grow?\nSANDERS: No. I think the vacuum was created by the disastrous war in Iraq, which I vigorously opposed. Not only did I vote against it, I helped lead the opposition. And what happened there is yes, it's easy to get rid of a two-bit dictator like Saddam Hussein, but there wasn't the kind of thought as to what happens the day after you get him and what kind of political vacuum occurs. And who rises up? Groups like ISIS.\nSo I think that President Obama made a promise to the American people when he ran, and he said you know what, I'm going to do my best to bring American troops home. And I supported what he did. Our job is to train and provide military support for Muslim countries in the area who are prepared to take on ISIS.\nAnd one point I want to make here that is not made very often, you have incredibly wealthy countries in that region, countries like Saudi Arabia, countries like Qatar. Qatar happens to be the largest — wealthiest country per capita in the world. They have got to start putting in some skin in the game and not just ask the United States to do it. [applause]\nMITCHELL: Secretary Clinton, I want to talk to you about red lines, because former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said in a recent interview that President Obama's decision to stand down on planned missile strikes against Damascus after Assad had used chemical weapons hurt the president's credibility. Should the president have stuck to his red line once he drew it?\nCLINTON: Look, I think that the president's decision to go after the chemical weapons once there was a potential opportunity to build on when the Russians opened that door resulted in a very positive outcome. We were able to get the chemical weapons out.\nI know from my own experience as secretary of State that we were deeply worried about Assad's forces using chemical weapons because it would have had not only a horrific affect on people in Syria, but it could very well have affected the surrounding states, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, Turkey. So getting those chemical weapons out was a big deal, but...\nMITCHELL: But should he — should he have stuck to his...\nCLINTON: Well — but — but...\nMITCHELL: ... line? Did it hurt U.S. credibility?\nCLINTON: I think, as commander in chief, you've got to constantly be evaluating the decisions you have to make. I know a little bit about this, having spent many hours in the situation room, advising President Obama.\nAnd I want to just add to something that Senator Sanders said, the United States had a very big interest in trying to help stabilize the region. If there is any blame to be spread around, it starts with the prime minister of Iraq, who sectarianized his military, setting Shia against Sunni.\nIt is amplified by Assad, who has waged one of the bloodiest, most terrible attacks on his own people: 250,000-plus dead, millions fleeing. Causing this vacuum that has been filled unfortunately, by terrorist groups, including ISIS.\nSo, I think we are in the midst of great turmoil in this region. We have a proxy conflict going on between Saudi Arabia and Iran. You know, one of the criticisms I've had of Senator Sanders is his suggestion that, you know, Iranian troops be used to try to end the war in Syria...\nMITCHELL: Your time is up.\nCLINTON: ... and go after ISIS, which I don't think would be a good idea.\nSANDERS: Let me just...\nMITCHELL: Senator....\nCLINTON: But overall, a lot of the forces at work in the region are ones that we cannot directly influence, but we can...\nMITCHELL: You're out of time.\nSANDERS: OK. Let me suggest...[crosstalk]\nMITCHELL: Senator Sanders.\nSANDERS: Where Secretary Clinton and I think, I agree with most of what she said. But where I think we do have an honest disagreement, is that in the incredible quagmire of Syria, where it's hard to know who's fighting who and if you give arms to this guy, it may end up in ISIS' hand the next day. We all know that.\nAnd we all know, no argument, the secretary is absolutely right, Assad is a butcher of his own people, man using chemical weapons against his own people. This is beyond disgusting.\nBut I think in terms of our priorities in the region, our first priority must be the destruction of ISIS. Our second priority must be getting rid of Assad, through some political settlement, working with Iran, working with Russia.\nBut the immediate task is to bring all interests together who want to destroy ISIS, including Russia, including Iran, including our Muslim allies to make that the major priority.\nO'MALLEY: But in all of that senator and secretary, I think we're leaving out something very important here. And that is that we still don't have the human intelligence: overt, in terms of diplomatic intelligence or covert, to understand even what the heck happens as the secondary and tertiary effects of some of these things.\nWe are walking through this region, Andrea, without the human intelligence that we need. And we need to make a renewed investment as a country in bringing up a new generation of foreign service officers, and bringing up a new generation of business people and actually understanding and having relationships in these places.\nSo we have a better sense of what the heck happens after a dictator topples and can take action to prevent another safe haven and another iteration of terror.\nMITCHELL: Your time is us. Lester.\nHOLT: Senator Sanders mentioned Russia a moment ago. Secretary Clinton, you famously handed Russia's foreign minister a reset button in 2009. Since then, Russia has annexed Crimea, fomented a war in Ukraine, provided weapons that downed an airliner and launched operations, as we just did discuss, to support Assad in Syria. As president, would you hand Vladimir Putin a reset button?\nCLINTON: Well, it would depend on what I got for it and I can tell you what we got in the first term, we got a new start treaty to reduce nuclear weapons between the United States and Russia. We got permission to resupply our troops in Afghanistan by traveling across Russia.\nWe got Russia to sign on to our sanctions against Iran and other very important commitments. So look, in diplomacy, you are always trying to see how you can figure out the interest of the other to see if there isn't some way you can advance your security and your values.\nWhen Putin came back in the fall of 2011, it was very clear he came back with a mission. And I began speaking out as soon as that happened because there were some fraudulent elections held, and Russians poured out into the streets to demand their freedom, and he cracked down. And in fact, accused me of fomenting it. So we now know that he has a mixed record to say the least and we have to figure out how to deal with him.\nHOLT: What's your relationship with him?\nCLINTON: Well, my relationship with him, it's — it's interesting. [laughter]\nIt's one, I think, of respect. We've had some very tough dealings with one another. And I know that he's someone that you have to continuingly stand up to because, like many bullies, he is somebody who will take as much as he possibly can unless you do.\nAnd we need to get the Europeans to be more willing to stand up, I was pleased they put sanctions on after Crimea and eastern Ukraine and the downing of the airliner, but we've got to be more united in preventing Putin from taking a more aggressive stance in Europe and the Middle East. [applause]\nHOLT: We to want turn right now to the issue of balancing national security concerns with the privacy rights of Americans. That brings us to YouTube and this question.\n[begin video clip]\nBROWNLEE: Hi, my name Marques Brownlee, and I've been making YouTube videos about electronics and gadgets for the past seven years.\nI think America's future success is tied to getting all kinds of tech right. Tech companies are responsible for the encryption technology to protect personal data, but the government wants a back door into that information.\nSo do you think it's possible to find common ground? And where do you stand on privacy versus security?\n[end video clip]\nHOLT: So, Governor O'Malley.\nO'MALLEY: Thank you.\nI believe whether it's a back door or a front door that the American principle of law should still hold that our federal government should have to get a warrant, whether they want to come through the back door or your front door. [applause]\nAnd I also agree, Lester, with Benjamin Franklin, who said, no people should ever give up their privacy or their freedoms in a promise for security.\nSo we're a collaborative people. We need collaborative leadership here with Silicon Valley and other bright people in my own state of Maryland and around the NSA that can actually figure this out.\nBut there are certain immutable principles that will not become antique things in our country so long as we defend our country and its values and its freedoms. And one of those things is our right to be secure in our homes, and our right to expect that our federal government should have to get a warrant.\nI also want to the say that while we've made some progress on the Patriot Act, I do believe that we need an adversarial court system there. We need a public advocate. We need to develop jurisprudence so that we can develop a body of law that protects the privacy of Americans in the information and digital age.\nHOLT: That's time.\nYou have all talked about what you would do fighting ISIS over there, but we've been hit in this country by home-grown terrorists, from Chattanooga to San Bernardino, the recent shooting of a police officer in Philadelphia. How are you going to fight the lone wolves here, Senator Sanders?\nO'MALLEY: Yes, Lester, year in and year out I was the leader of the U.S. ...\nHOLT: That's a question to Senator Sanders. I wasn't clear, I apologize.\nSANDERS: OK. I just wanted to add, in the previous question, I voted against the USA Patriot Act for many of the reasons that Governor O'Malley mentioned. But it is not only the government that we have to worry about, it is private corporations.\nYou would all be amazed, or maybe not, about the amount of information private companies and the government has in terms of the Web sites that you access, the products that you buy, where you are this very moment.\nAnd it is very clear to me that public policy has not caught up with the explosion of technology. So yes, we have to work with Silicon Valley to make sure that we do not allow ISIS to transmit information...\nHOLT: But in terms of lone wolves, the threat, how would you do it?\nSANDERS: Right. What we have got to do there is, among other things, as I was just saying, have Silicon Valley help us to make sure that information being transmitted through the Internet or in other ways by ISIS is, in fact, discovered.\nBut I do believe we can do that without violating the constitutional and privacy rights of the American people.\n[crosstalk]\nHOLT: We have to go to a — we have to go to a break, and when we come back, we're going to get to some of the burning questions these candidates have yet to answer and are totally eager to talk about.\nCLINTON: Oh, we're breaking? OK.\n[commercial break]\nHOLT: And welcome back to Charleston.\nAs we were going to a break, Secretary Clinton, I cut you off. I'll give you 30 seconds to respond on the issue of lone wolves.\nO'MALLEY: Can I get 30 seconds, too? [laughter]\nSANDERS: Can I get 50 seconds?\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton.\nCLINTON: Well, I wanted to say, and I'll do it quickly, I was very pleased that leaders of President Obama's administration went out to Silicon Valley last week and began exactly this conversation about what we can do, consistent with privacy and security.\nWe need better intelligence cooperation, we need to be sure that we are getting the best intelligence that we can from friends and allies around the world. And then, we've got to recognize our first line of defense against lone wolf attacks is among Muslim Americans.\nAnd it is not only shameful, it is dangerous for the kinds of comments you're hearing from the Republican side.\nWe need to be reaching out and unifying our country against terrorist attacks and lone wolves, and working with Muslim Americans. [applause]\nHOLT: And Andrea has a follow-up.\nO'MALLEY: And Andrea — Andrea — Andrea...\nMITCHELL: Just a — just a quick follow-up, though, Secretary Clinton. Just a moment, Governor.\nO'MALLEY: Andrea, when can I get my 30 seconds?\nMITCHELL: But — but — Secretary Clinton, you said that the leaders from the intelligence community went to Silicon Valley, they were flatly turned down. They got nowhere.\nCLINTON: That is not what I've heard. Let me leave it at that.\nO'MALLEY: Andrea, I need to talk about homeland security and preparedness.\nEver since the attacks of September 11th — 30 seconds. [laughter]\nEver since the attacks of September 11th, my colleagues, Democratic and Republican mayors, Democratic and Republican governors, made me their leader on homeland security and preparedness.\nHere in the homeland, unlike combating ISIL abroad, we're almost like it's — your body's immune system. It's able to protect your body against bad bugs, not necessarily because it outnumbers them, but it's better connected — the fusion centers, the biosurveillance systems, better prepared first responders.\nBut there's another front in this battle, and it is this. That's the political front, and if Donald Trump wants to start a registry in our country of people by faith, he can start with me, and I will sign up as one who is totally opposed to his fascist appeals that wants to vilify American Muslims. That can do more damage to our democracy than any...[crosstalk]\nHOLT: All right, that's time, and — and we do...[applause]...we do have to move on.\nSecretary Clinton, this is the first time...\nSANDERS: Can I get a — can I just get a very brief response? Very brief.\nHOLT: Thirty — 30 — 30 seconds, Senator.\nSANDERS: OK. One — and I agree with what the secretary said, and what Governor O'Malley said. But here's an issue that we also should talk about. We have a $600 billion military budget. It is a budget larger than the next eight countries'.\nUnfortunately, much of that budget continues to fight the old Cold War with the Soviet Union. Very little of that budget — less than 10 percent — actually goes into fighting ISIS and international terrorism. We need to be thinking hard about making fundamental changes in the priorities of the Defense Department.\nHOLT: All right. Secretary Clinton...[applause]...this is the first time that a spouse of a former president could be elected president. You have said that President Clinton would advise you on economic issues, but be specific, if you can. Are you talking about a kitchen-table role on economics, or will he have a real policy role?\nCLINTON: Well, it'll start at the kitchen table, we'll see how it goes from there. And I...[applause]...I'm going to have the very best advisers that I can possibly have, and when it comes to the economy and what was accomplished under my husband's leadership and the '90s — especially when it came to raising incomes for everybody and lifting more people out of poverty than at any time in recent history — you bet.\nI'm going to ask for his ideas, I'm going ask for his advice, and I'm going use him as a goodwill emissary to go around the country to find the best ideas we've got, because I do believe, as he said, everything that's wrong with America has been solved somewhere in America.\nWe just have to do more of it, and we have to reach out, especially into poor communities and communities of color, to give more people their own chance to get ahead.\nHOLT: Senator sanders, a 30 second response, sir. [applause]\nSANDERS: Great ideas, Governor O'Malley, Secretary Clinton, but here's the truth. If you have an administration stacked with Wall Street appointees, it ain't going to accomplish very much.\nSo here's a promise that I make — and I mentioned a moment ago how corrupt the system is — Goldman Sachs, paying a $5 billion fine, gives this country, in recent history, a Republican secretary of treasury, a Democratic secretary of treasury.\nHere's a promise. If elected president, Goldman Sachs is not going to have — bring forth a secretary of treasury for a Sanders administration. [applause]\nMITCHELL: Senator Sanders, let me ask you a question. You called Bill Clinton's past transgressions, quote, \"totally, totally, totally disgraceful and unacceptable.\" Senator, do you regret saying that?\nSANDERS: I was asked a question. You know, one of the things, Andrea, and I — that question annoys me. I cannot walk down the street — Secretary Clinton knows this — without being told how much I have to attack secretary Clinton, want to get me on the front pages of the paper, I'd make some vicious attack.\nI have avoided doing that. Trying to run an issue-oriented campaign. [applause]\nSANDERS: I was asked a question.\nMITCHELL:: You didn't have to answer it that way, though. Why did you?\nSANDERS: Well — then if I don't answer it, then there's another front page, so it's yes. [laughter]\nAnd I mean this seriously. You know that. We've been through this. Yes, his behavior was deplorable. Have I ever once said a word about that issue? No, I have not. I'm going to debate Secretary Clinton, Governor O'Malley, on the issues facing the American people, not Bill Clinton's personal behavior. [applause]\nHOLT: We will take a break. We'll continue from Charleston right after this.\n[commercial break]\nHOLT: Welcome back everybody. Finally, before we go tonight, we set out here to understand points of differences between you. We believe we've learned a lot here, but before we leave, is there anything that you really wanted to say tonight that you haven't gotten a chance to say.\nAnd, we'll start with Governor O'Malley. [laughter]\nDidn't see that coming, did you?\nO'MALLEY: Yes, but we're going to have to get 20 minutes to do it, so. [laughter]\nMITCHELL: ...too long.\nO'MALLEY: I believe there are many issues. I have 60 seconds for this?\nHOLT: Sixty seconds, we'd appreciate it.\nO'MALLEY: There are so many issues that we haven't been able to discuss here. We have not fully discussed immigration reform, and the deplorable number of immigrant detention camps that our nation's now maintaining. We haven't discussed the shameful treatment that the people of Puerto Rico, our fellow Americans, are getting treated with by these hedge funds that are working them over. [applause]\nWe haven't discussed the fact that in our hemisphere we have the danger of nation-state failures because of drug traffickers; and Honduras, and Guatemala and El Salvador.\nI guess the bottom line is this, look we are a great people the way we act at home and abroad based on the beliefs that unite us. Our belief in the dignity of every person, our belief in our own common good. There is now challenge that is too great for us to overcome provided we bring forward in these divided times, new leadership that can heal our divides here at home and bring our principles into alignment abroad.\nWe're on the threshold of a new era of American progress and I believe we have only need to join forces together and cross that threshold into a new era of American prosperity.\nHOLT: And that's time.\nO'MALLEY: Thanks a lot.\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton?\nCLINTON: Well Lester, I spent a lot of time last week being outraged by what's happening in Flint, Michigan and I think every single American should be outraged. We've had a city in the United States of America where the population which is poor in many ways and majority African American has been drinking and bathing in lead contaminated water. And the governor of that state acted as though he didn't really care.\nHe had request for help and he had basically stone walled. I'll tell you what, if the kids in a rich suburb of Detroit had been drinking contaminated water and being bathed in it, there would've been action.\nSo I sent my top campaign aide down there to talk to the mayor of Flint to see what I could to help. I issued a statement about what we needed to do and then I went on a T.V. show and I said, \"it was outrageous that the governor hadn't acted and within two hours he had.\"\nHOLT: And that's time.\nCLINTON: I want to be a president who takes care of the big problems and the problems that are affecting the people of our country everyday. [applause]\nHOLT: Thank you.\nSenator Sanders?\nSANDERS: Well, Secretary Clinton was right and what I did which I think is also right, is demanded the resignation of governor. A man who acts that irresponsibly should not stay in power.\nNow, we are a great nation — and we've heard a lot of great ideas here tonight. Let's be honest and let's be truthful. Very little is going to be done to transform our economy and to create the kind of middle class we need unless we end a corrupt campaign finance system which is undermining American democracy.\nWe've got to get rid of Super PACs, we've got to get rid of Citizens' United and what we've got to do is create a political revolution which revitalizes American democracy; which brings millions of young people and working people into the political process. To say loudly and clearly,\" that the government of the United States of America belongs to all of us and not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.\"\nHOLT: All right. Well thank you and thanks to all of you for being here tonight shedding light on some of the differences as Americans get ready to vote.\nI also want to thank the Congressional Black Caucus Institute and certainly my friend and colleague, Andrea Mitchell. This has been great. It's been a great spirited conversation and American people appreciate it.", "timestamp": "2016-01-17", "title": "Democratic Candidates Debate in Charleston, South Carolina"}
{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111433", "text": "STEPHANOPOULOS: Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton going at it this week as we begin this campaign in 2016 just two weeks from the Iowa caucuses.\nSecretary Clinton joins us now from Charleston, South Carolina, ahead of tonight's big debate.\nGood morning, Madam Secretary.\nCLINTON: Good morning, George.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: I want to get to that back and forth between you and Bernie Sanders, but first the news that the American hostages from Iran are heading home this morning. Donald Trump not giving the president any credit and Marco Rubio says it's going to create incentives for other U.S. adversaries to take hostages.\nDoes he have a point?\nCLINTON: Well, look, I'm pleased, like I hope everybody is, that we have American citizens coming home this morning from Iran. They were unjustly held there, and I did a lot of work on these issues when Americans were being picked up, falsely charged and imprisoned, to get them home. So I applaud the fact that that's happened.\nWe still don't see Bob Levinson coming home, so we have unfinished questions and business still. But I think this is a part of what we're going to be pursuing—persistent, patient diplomacy.\nToday's also the day that we have verified the Iranians have followed through on the requirements under the nuclear agreement. They have shipped out the vast majority, I think it's up to 98 percent, of their enriched uranium. They have poured cement into one of the reactors we worried about because of a plutonium potential threat. They have destroyed centrifuges.\nSo this is the kind of smart diplomacy I was proud to be a part of in the first administration of President Obama that we're just going to have to be persistent with, because we have a lot of problems with Iran—their aggressive behavior, their destabilizing of neighboring states, their continuing military support for Assad and so much else.\nBut the fact that we've put the lid on the nuclear weapons program, the fact that we got our prisoners back, I think is a reason for good news.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Let's get to the campaign right now.\nA strange series of events yesterday. The super PAC coordinating with you put out word that they'd be demanding to release of Bernie Sanders' health records. Sanders campaign struck back, calling that vile. Your campaign disavowed it. It appeared to go away.\nSo what is relevant here and what's not?\nShould age and health be an issue in this campaign?\nCLINTON: Oh, look, you know, I put out my medical records. I think you've been around long enough to know, George, this is all part of the expectation.\nBut I think it's fair to say that I share a lot of the same goals with Senator Sanders about what we need to do on behalf of our country. But we have differences. And that's what I'm focusing on now. We're going to have a spirited debate, I expect, tonight in Charleston. Certainly Senator Sanders has been pointing out differences.\nAnd one of the issues that I have drawn a very stark contrast on has been guns.\nYou know, I have pointed out repeatedly, because I think it's a critical issue, that Senator Sanders has, for years, voted many times on behalf of the NRA gun lobby position. And one of the most egregious of those votes was the vote to give immunity from all liability to gun makers and sellers. Now, I was happy when -\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: He now supports taking that away.\nCLINTON: Well, he flip-flopped last night, said that he would sign on to a bill that is currently pending in the House and Senate to repeal that liability. And I'm delighted that he has had a change of heart. I think that's all for the good.\nNow I hope he will take a hard look at what we call the Charleston loophole. That's a provision he also voted for, that gives a gun to a potential buyer after three days whether or not the background check has been completed. And it's called the Charleston loophole because that's how the killer in Charleston got his gun when, if there had been a little more time, information would have come to light that would have shown he was prohibited. And, of course, we know he used that gun to go to Mother Emanuel Church and murder nine faithful people at Bible study.\nSo I want to see movement against the gun lobby, because we cannot continue to lose 90 people a day, 33,000 a year, to gun violence. And I welcome Senator Sanders moving on one of the issues he was wrong on. I hope he will continue to move.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And we're going to ask him about that in a few minutes.\nAnother big difference on health care. He wants to replace Obamacare with a single payer system, Medicare for all.\nSo are you against that because it's a bad idea or because it's not practical? Would a single payer system be better if you could get it passed?\nCLINTON: Well, first, I share the goal of universal health care. You know very well that I threw myself into that back in '93 and '94 and still have the scars to show for it. So the goal is we want everybody to have access to quality, affordable health care. But I think we should be defending the Affordable Care Act. This is a historic achievement for our country. It certainly is for President Obama. We are making progress. I want us to protect it, to defend it and to improve it.\nThe Republicans keep trying to repeal it and offer nothing in place of it. So rather than tear it apart or get rid of it and start all over again in a contentious national debate, let's do what I'm proposing, to get costs down, get out of pocket costs down, get more support for families who face big medical costs. Let's deal with the rising cost of prescription drugs. That, I think, is the right way for the country to go and it certainly is what I'm advocating.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You also have your differences over Wall Street. We've heard a little bit of that going into this. And I was struck this morning, American Crossroads, a super PAC founded by Karl Rove, who, of course, worked for President George W. Bush, has just launched this online ad in Iowa.\n[begin video clip]\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hillary Clinton's gotten 54 times more money from Wall Street interests than from all of Iowa. Hillary rewarded Wall Street with the $700 billion bailout. Then Wall Street made her a multi-millionaire.\nCLINTON: I represented Wall Street.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Huh, you sure did, Hillary.\n[end video clip]\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Now, that echoes the points being made by Bernie Sanders in his campaign.\nAre you worried that your ties to Wall Street are weighing you down?\nCLINTON: Well, first, let me say I think it shows how desperate the Republicans are to prevent me from becoming the nominee. I find that, in a perverse way, an incredibly flattering comment on their anxiety, because they know that not only will I stand up for what the country needs, I will take it to the Republicans. I have a track record which shows I know how to stand up to them. And I will win.\nSo I think this just proves my point, that I am the strongest candidate to go up against any Republican.\nWith the back and forth on Wall Street, I think it's, you know, look, I have stood up to Wall Street even though I did represent New York. I have advocated for changes. But what I find sort of strange is, number one, the ad that Senator Sanders ran was really against all Democrats who ever took any contributions from anybody associated with the financial industry. That would include President Obama, who took more anyone ever had in 2008. That did not stop him from turning around and imposing the toughest rules on Wall Street since the 1930s. The same with Barney Frank, who has actually written about this.\nYou know, that is just a false charge.\nBut in addition, I think it's important for us to look at our respective plans. In fact, everyone who has offered an opinion about the plan that Senator Sanders has proposed and the one I put together has said mine is tougher, mine is more comprehensive, it would be more effective, because it tries to get not just at the problems of yesterday, but the potential problems of tomorrow, going after shadow banking and investment banks and big insurance companies, like what we saw in '08 where Lehman Brothers and AIG were principal causes of what happened to us.\nAnd I think, finally, I would say that I have gotten maybe 3 percent of my - less than 3 percent of my contributions this time from anybody associated with financial industry activities. I've gotten so much more from students and teachers. Ninety percent of my contributions are from smaller donors and 60 percent from women.\nSo I'm just - you know, I didn't know about Karl Rove's ad against me, but it kind of boosts me up, because I assume he thinks that I am going to get the nomination and he's trying to interfere with the Iowa caucus to maybe confuse people on their way to caucus for me.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Madam Secretary, thanks very much for your time this morning.\nCLINTON: Thank you.\nGood to talk to you, George.", "timestamp": "2016-01-17", "title": "Interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News \"This Week\""}
{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111434", "text": "TODD: But we start with the Democrats and a Hillary Clinton/Bernie Sanders race that has turned out to be much closer than the experts thought especially the Clinton campaign.\nIn fact, we have some brand new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll numbers out this morning and it does have some good news for the Clinton campaign. Nationally we still have her with a big lead over Bernie Sanders 59 percent-34 percent.\nBut in Iowa the story has been very different. Three polls out this week alone showing neck and neck race including our own NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist polls which had Clinton leading by jut 3; Quinnipiac found Sanders actually up by 5 and the \"Des Moines Register\" had Clinton up by just 2. Bottom line, it's too close to call.\nSo as they close the race it has become a more aggressive race against Sanders so we begin with Hillary Clinton who joins Clinton campaign against Sanders and so we begin with Hillary Clinton who joins us from Charleston, South Carolina. Good morning—Secretary Clinton.\nCLINTON: Good morning, Chuck.\nTODD: Let me start with the Iran deal. Yesterday in response to it you immediately said that Iran is still violating U.N. Security Council resolutions with its ballistic missile program which should be met with new sanctions, designations and firm results.\nSo I guess my question is what do you tell the American public that says you want new sanctions against Iran, they're still violating agreement and yet what did we do? We just handed them $100 billion and we just did a prisoner exchange. Would you have still done that considering your concerns about their missile program?\nCLINTON: Absolutely. Look I have said for a long time that I'm very proud of the role that I played in getting us to the point where we could negotiate the agreement that puts a lid on Iran's nuclear weapons program but I've also said that the way we're going to hold them accountable is to have consequences when they do anything that might deviate from the agreement or continue to block the kind of sanctions and mandates the U.N. Security Council has put on, including on missiles.\nSo I see these as mutually reinforcing, Chuck. I was delighted that the prisoners are on their way home. That's a good sign. We still don't see Bob Levinson coming home, there's more work to be done there. But if the implementation of the agreement which is being done today is to be successful in the way that I expect we're going to watch Iran like the proverbial hawk.\nAnd when it comes to the missile program, they are under U.N. Security Council sanctions and if they are violating it which the evidence seems to suggest they should be held accountable. They need to know that this is a good step forward with respect to the nuclear weapons program but there are other areas of their behavior that we're going to continue to be focused on.\nTODD: Do you consider Iran a national security threat to the United States?\nCLINTON: Well, certainly we have lowered that threat because of the nuclear agreement but they continue to be destabilize governments in the Middle East. They continue to support proxies and terrorist groups like Hezbollah. They continue to threaten Israel. There are a lot of concerns. But what I've said for some time now is I'd rather have the nuclear weapons program off to one side and work to make sure they abide by the agreement and then turn our attention to some of these other behaviors that are threatening, certainly in the region and therefore cause concern for us.\nTODD: All right. Let me move to the campaign. To try to figure out why this race has gotten closer in Iowa, why your lead has shrunk in Iowa, we spoke to a number of voters. I want to play three sound bites from Iowa voters about some potential pause they have regarding your candidacy. I'm going to play it and get you to respond on the other side.\n[begin video clip]\nJAY HELTON, O'MALLEY SUPPORTER: You get the impression from her that she believes maybe the rules don't apply to her. Or the same rules don't apply to her that apply to everybody else.\nNATASHA NEWCOMB, SANDERS SUPPORTER: She's worked really hard and done some amazing things I just feel that Bernie Sanders is kind of—has a little bit more fire lit up in people.\nSALLY WILSON, CLINTON SUPPORTER: Well, I hear people talking about questioning her honesty. And I don't necessarily do that but I think that's one thing people are kind of not sure and they've felt that way about Bill Clinton, too. So I think some of that rubs off.\n[end video clip]\nTODD: Madam Secretary, how do you answer that pause. This is from Democrats—some pause that they have.\nCLINTON: Well, first of all, Chuck, I always thought this was going to be close and I can't speak for anybody else but I've worked as hard as I can to build an organization in Iowa, to be out there listening and talking with Iowans as they move toward making the first in the nation decision in the caucus on February 1.\nAnd I've also been very consistent over the course of my public life. If I tell you I'm going to fight for something, I will do my very best to get results. I think that's why I have such strong support and I feel very good about where we are but we're going to just keep working until the very last caucus is decided on February 1.\nTODD: You know, another problem you may be having in Iowa is that you don't ideologically fit. This was in the Des Moines Register poll this week. 43 percent of likely Democratic caucus goers identify as socialist. Only 38 percent of likely Democratic caucus goers identified themselves as a capitalist. You, in the last debate, said you were a capitalist. Bernie Sanders calls himself a Democratic socialist. If you don't win Iowa, do you think that's the reason?\nCLINTON: Oh, I don't know how people take all this information. But I support a free market economy. I support the competitiveness that has created the greatest economic engine in the history of the world. What I am worried about is that it's not continuing to do what it used to do which is to give the vast majority of Americans the chance to get ahead and stay ahead.\nThat's why I've got a very vigorous jobs agenda. That's why I put raising incomes at the center of my economic policy and I think what I know will work is to get back the good old-fashioned job opportunities that will help people get ahead through manufacturing, through infrastructure, through clean energy, through the kinds of plans that I've been putting out.\nLook, when we have a Democrat in the White House—a Democrat—we do that better economically. We saw that when my husband was president, we've watched President Obama dig us out of the huge ditch that Republican policies put us into, so I'm very confident that I know what will work if we have a—the right commitment as a nation and that's what I want to do as president.\nTODD: Let me ask you about whether—going with Chicago—right now, Mayor Rahm Emanuel has been under fire for what he may have known about a shooting incident. Do you think he still has the credibility to heal the wounds in Chicago between the African-American community and law enforcement?\nCLINTON: Look, like everybody else who watched that video on television I was just outraged by what happened to Laquan McDonald. I was one of the first to call for a complete Department of Justice investigation and, in fact, urged that it include the entire Chicago police department.\nThis is not a problem that is unique to Chicago, unfortunately, and we've got to do more to deal with the systemic racism and the problems that policing has demonstrated. Mayor Emanuel has said that he is committed to complete and total reform and I think he should be held to that standard.\nTODD: But do you think he still has the credibility to do that?\nCLINTON: Well, that's going to be up to him and up to the people of Chicago to prove.\nTODD: Very quickly, the movie \"13 Hours\" about the incident in Benghazi. I know there's a lot of chatter about the movie itself. But let me ask you—the controversy involves whether or not everything was done that night to rescue Ambassador Stevens.\nLooking back, do you believe everything was done that night that could have been done to save his life?\nCLINTON: Based on everything I know and based on a Republican-led intelligence committee investigation, is a Republican-led arms services committee investigation, the answer to that is yes. That people were scrambling trying to figure out what could be done if anything.\nAnd I can't speak to a movie but I know people have raised questions about some of the dramatization. I testified for more than 11 hours, as you know I answered every question I was asked. My real focus, Chuck, is what do we do to make sure that we send Americans into harm's way—military or civilian, diplomats or our soldiers—we take every precaution to the best of our ability in what is an unpredictable and dangerous world to make sure that they can discharge their duties and be safe while doing it.\nTODD: All right. Secretary Clinton, I have to leave it there. We look forward to seeing you tonight on stage in Charleston for the Democratic debate.\nCLINTON: Great.\nTODD: That's right here on NBC. Thank you.\nCLINTON: Thanks a lot.\nTODD: You got it.\nEND\nLOAD-DATE: January 17, 2016\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Transcript\nCopyright 2016 Federal News Service, Inc.\nAll Rights Reserved\n7 of 1079 DOCUMENTS\nFederal News Service\nJanuary 17, 2016 Sunday\nCBS \"Face the Nation\" Interview with Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Democratic Presidential Candidate\nLENGTH: 1189 words\n??????????????????????? Subject: The 2016 Presidential Race\nParticipants: John Dickerson\nTime: 10:30:00\nDate: 2016-01-17\nDICKERSON: And we start with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is in Charleston this morning. Good morning, Secretary Clinton.\nAfter this prisoner exchange, Senator Marco Rubio said—quote—\"If you take an American hostage, Barack Obama will cut a deal with you, whether it's Bowe Bergdahl, what he did with the Castro brothers, and now what he's done with Iran.\"\nYour reaction to that?\nCLINTON: Well, I think it's just typical political rhetoric, and it overlooks some very basic, important issues.\nNumber one, we always try to get Americans back who are unjustly held. I certainly did when I was secretary of state. And when I was a senator, I advocated for the Bush administration to do the same for people who have been unlawfully held in foreign countries.\nSecondly, the important news here is that the Iranian agreement to put a lid on the nuclear weapons program of Iran is being implemented. The Iranians have so far fulfilled their side of the bargain by destroying centrifuges, by shipping out 98 percent or so of their enriched uranium out of their country, even making one of their plutonium reactors under construction no longer able to be ever used because they have poured cement into it.\nSo, the real issue here is, if you're committed to making the world safer and to show strong American leadership, you have to engage in patient, persistent diplomacy with people who are not your friends. They are on the other side of a lot of the issues and values that you hold very dear, and that is certainly true for the United States.\nDICKERSON: Former FBI agent Robert Levinson is still in Iran. Do you believe that the Iranians know where he is? And, if so, why wasn't he a part of this deal?\nCLINTON: Well, I regret deeply that Robert Levinson was not on his way home either. And I hope and expect that the Iranians will continue to be pressed very, very hard to give up any information they have and, if possible, to return Bob Levinson to his home and family.\nDICKERSON: Switching to the topic of gun control, you have said Bernie Sanders should vote or support the idea of lifting the immunity block on gun manufacturers. He now says he will support the legislation you have pushed him to. So, hasn't he done what you wanted him to do?\nCLINTON: Well, I am pleased that Senator Sanders has flip-flopped on legal immunity for gun makers and sellers. Now I hope he will also join members of Congress to change what's called the Charleston loophole that enabled the killer in Charleston to get the gun that he used to murder nine people at Bible study here in Mother Emanuel Church. That's something else Senator Sanders has supported that we need to change.\nSo, now I'm calling on him to also flip-flop in the right direction and sign on the legislation to change the Charleston loophole.\nDICKERSON: You at once in 1939 when you were first lady supported in testimony in front of the Senate Finance Committee a 25 percent tax on guns. You're not supporting that now or promoting that now.\nHow have you evolved over the years in terms of your support for the Second Amendment?\nCLINTON: Well, I do support the Second Amendment. That has always been understood.\nI just believe that, like any amendment to our Constitution, there are reasonable steps that can be taken. We have reasonable restrictions on certain kind of speech or certain forms of assembly. And for goodness sakes, we ought to be smart enough and do so consistent with the Constitution, to have more gun safety measures to try to save some of the 33,000 lives that we lose to gun violence every single year.\nThis is something that I have spoken out about, that I have advocated for right now. I think there is a consensus in the country on comprehensive background checks, closing the gun show loophole, closing the online and Charleston loopholes, reversing the immunity given to the gun industry, certainly prohibiting would-be terrorists on the no-fly zone from buying guns.\nThat's kind of the commonsense approach that we should be working to achieve.\nDICKERSON: I would like to ask you about these stories out of Flint, Michigan. Lead levels in the water have created an emergency there. Senator Sanders called for Rick Snyder, the governor, to resign. What is your feeling?\nCLINTON: Well, John, this is an issue I have been involved in now for a couple of weeks. I am horrified by what has happened in Flint.\nI started calling for immediate action, calling for federal intervention. I sent two of my top campaign aides to meet with the mayor of Flint. As you may know, I appeared on a show this past week and demanded that Governor Snyder ask for the help that Michigan needs to deal with the horrible consequences that children and their families are facing in Flint.\nAnd I saw that Governor Snyder turned around within two hours and finally asked for the help that he should have asked for some weeks ago. I don't want to get caught up in the political back and forth here. I want to help the people of Flint.\nAnd I particularly want a comprehensive health analysis of what's happened to these children. Lead is a poison. It destroys your brain. It interferes with your learning and your behavior. Whatever it takes for Michigan and the federal government to come together, through FEMA, through Health and Human Services, the EPA, whatever it takes, we now have to fix the problem and help these kids and especially their health and education development probably for years to come.\nDICKERSON: On the topic of health care back at the national level, you—your daughter, Chelsea Clinton, said that Senator Sanders' universal health care plan will dismantle Obamacare, dismantle Children's Health Insurance Program, and a series of other things it would dismantle.\nAren't—isn't she and your campaign not taking into account that those things would be replaced by an actual plan that Senator Sanders has put forward?\nCLINTON: Well, I think it's very confusing, because he hasn't put forward a plan.\nAnd the only way we know what it is he's advocating for comes from looking at the nine bills that he's introduced in the House and Senate and Congress. And in those bills, every kind of health care is rolled all up together, and handed over to the states, which bear a financial responsibility to match what the federal government provides in order to administer health care.\nSo, it's not a traditional kind of single-payer system, as I understand it. It is a state-based system, kind of similar to Medicaid, if you will. And I do think there are very legitimate questions that can be raised, and because we don't have an up-to-date plan from Senator Sanders, all of us trying to figure out what it would mean for everybody to be put into that new system.\nDICKERSON: All right.\nWell, Senator—excuse me—Secretary Clinton, I know that will be debated this evening when you're on the stage with Senator Sanders.\nWe thank you for being with us.\nCLINTON: Great to talk to you again, John.\nCitation: Hillary Clinton: \"Interview with Chuck Todd of NBC News \"Meet the Press\",\" January 17, 2016.

{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111435", "text": "TAPPER: We're joined right off the bat by Democratic candidate for president and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\nMadam Secretary, thanks so much for joining us.\nOn Saturday, you called for new sanctions against Iran for its ballistic missile program. That prompted a response from another American who was once held prisoner in Iran, Shane Bauer, one of the hikers released in 2011. He had some tough words for you on Twitter, writing—quote—\"Seriously, why would Hillary call for more sanctions now? As far as we know, four of the Americans are still in Iran. Totally irresponsible\"—unquote.\nHe also said, whenever he was in Iran, whenever he heard your voice, his heart would sink, because—quote—\"All she ever does with Iran is inflame tensions.\"\nI want to give you awe chance to respond.\nCLINTON: Well, look, I appreciate what he went through when he was held prisoner in the infamous Iranian prison.\nAnd we were very happy that we were able to get him and the two other hikers back home. But we have a very clear path we are pursuing with Iran. I am pleased that we do have an agreement that is being implemented. And I was part of putting that in place by getting the sanctions imposed on Iran that the entire world went along with.\nBut we also have made it clear from the beginning that their missile activity is still subject to sanction. That is part of the overall approach that the administration has taken toward Iran, and that I support.\nSo, when we became aware of missile activity that is under U.N. supervision and is prohibited, it would be a mistake not to make clear to Iran that we are very, very happy to see us implementing the agreement to put a lid on the nuclear weapons program and the way that they have complied, but that doesn't mean they can now go off and invest and test a lot of missiles that would eventually be able to be intercontinental that could reach the United States and maybe carry a very dangerous weapon.\nSo, I think there might be a misunderstanding of what our whole agreement consists of, because, certainly, I have made clear I'm proud of the role that I played in getting that agreement in place, but, as president, I will enforce it.\nAnd there have to be consequences if Iran veers away from what it has agreed to or what it has been mandated to do or prohibited from doing by the international community.\nTAPPER: Let's turn to politics, obviously a big night tonight, a Democratic debate.\nYou will be facing off with Bernie Sanders in this new, more contentious phase of the election, with just a week and a—two weeks and a day until the Iowa caucuses.\nOne of your top allies, David Brock, is calling on Bernie Sanders to release his medical records. The Sanders campaign—campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, he called this—quote—\"one of the most desperate and vile attacks imaginable.\"\nWho's right there, David Brock or Jeff Weaver? [laughter]\nCLINTON: Well, I don't know anything about it, but I have released my medical records.\nAnd I remember being asked frequently for me to do so. And, so, obviously that's, you know, something I will leave up to the Sanders campaign.\nBut this is a spirited debate, because, although we share some very similar goals for our country, we have differences. And Senator Sanders has been pointing them out.\nOne of my biggest differences has been on guns. And I'm very pleased that he flip-flopped on the immunity legislation. Now I hope he will flip-flop on what we call the Charleston loophole, and join legislation to close that, because it's been a key argument of my campaign that we Democrats, in fact, Americans need to stand up to the gun lobby and pass comprehensive commonsense gun measures that will make America safer. And that's what I intend to do.\nTAPPER: One of your major lines of attack against Bernie Sanders, in addition to the gun one that you just leveled, has been on his proposal for single-payer health care.\nBack in 1994, you said a single-payer system administrated by the states would actually lower health care costs. Take a listen.\n[begin video clip from 1994]\nCLINTON (in 1994): Single-payer would have lower costs. And one of the reasons that the president has a provision in his approach that guarantees states can go single-payer is to permit states that are able to do that to start down the single-payer road.\n[end video clip]\nTAPPER: Now, I know that was a long time ago, but you said in the Q&A single-payer would not be politically feasible.\nIn a perfect world, do you believe that single-payer would ultimately lower health care costs?\nCLINTON: Well, I believe in universal health care. And I think we have now, finally, after many decades of efforts, thanks to President Obama, a plan that will get us to universal health care. It's the Affordable Care Act. So, I'm not interested in what the Republicans are trying to do, which is to repeal it, as they consistently vote to do. And I also think it would be a mistake to really thrust our country into another contentious national debate about how we're going to provide quality, affordable health care to everybody. So, I'm...\nTAPPER: Right, but just on the merits.\nCLINTON: ... very focused on—well, the merits are we need to get to universal health care. That is the merit.\nThe merit is, how do we get to universal health care, where everybody's covered, where everybody can afford it? We have had some experimentation with states. Actually, Vermont tried to do single-payer. They found that the cost and the taxes that were required were prohibitive.\nColorado now has a referendum on its ballot, so it's going to also pursue it. I'm a big believer in letting states experiment. But when it comes to where we are right now, in 2016, I'm going to defend, protect, and improve the Affordable Care Act.\nTAPPER: For years, you have been very protective of your daughter, Chelsea Clinton, especially when she was a child, of course, and now she's a grown woman.\nThis week, she surprised a lot of people when she unleashed one of the most scathing attacks of the cycle, accusing Bernie Sanders of wanting to empower Republican governors who might then cut people's health care.\nPolitiFact called Chelsea's remarks mostly false. Former Obama adviser David Axelrod said it was not an honest attack. And liberal columnist Mark Shields said the attack turned your daughter into a—quote—\"political hack.\"\nDo you think it was a mistake to muddy up Chelsea like that?\nCLINTON: Look, she was asked a question. I love my daughter. And she answered a question.\nAnd all I can say, Jake, is that the only health plan we know of from Senator Sanders is what's described in the legislation that he has introduced nine times in the Congress, in the Senate. And it does turn all of the programs we know of that provide health care over to the states.\nThe federal government would provide a big portion of the cost, but states would be mandated to also pay considerably, about 14 percent of the cost. That's what's in his bill.\nSo, I think anyone who wants to compare and contrast, since we don't have any more current plan from Senator Sanders, has to look at the legislation that he introduced.\nAnd, yes, if it were going to be state-run, then governors, Republican and Democrat alike, would bear responsibility for appropriating the funds and administrating it, according to Senator Sanders' own legislative proposals.\nTAPPER: So, no regrets about using Chelsea that way?\nCLINTON: Oh, I didn't use her. She answered a question.\nAnd, you know, she gave a factual answer, based on the legislation that is the only way we know what Senator Sanders is actually proposing, because he introduced it nine times in the Congress.\nTAPPER: OK. PolitiFact said it was mostly false, but let's move on.\nA new movie opened this weekend. It's called \"13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi.\" It's a cinematic version of a book, a nonfiction book, telling the story of the six private security contractors who defended the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, from an attack by Islamic militants.\nAre you planning to see it at all?\nCLINTON: I'm just too busy campaigning. I am still very focused on making sure we do everything we can, as I did when I was secretary of state, as I testified to over 11 hours, to make sure that nothing like that happens again, insofar as we are able to prevent it.\nAnd that's my focus when it comes to the continuing obligation that the United States government has whenever we send anyone into harm's way.\nTAPPER: Let's talk about ISIS. It's a big concern among many Americans.\nI know that you're very reluctant to criticize President Obama, and I understand that. But I want to ask you about the situation in Syria on the ground, because Anne-Marie Slaughter, who is the former director of policy planning at the State Department under you, she told me on my show \"THE LEAD that, if President Obama had listened to you about arming the Syrian moderates years ago, there's a—quote—\"very good chance that we would not be facing ISIS like we are now.\"\nDo you agree?\nCLINTON: Well, we will never know the answer to that question.\nObviously, I thought, at the time, it was the right approach. And I advocated for it, along with then Secretary Panetta and CIA Director Petraeus, because I was worried about what would happen if there were a very vicious civil war, when, on one side, you had Assad's army backed by Iran, and now we know also backed by Russia, against a group of people who wanted more freedom, wanted to live in dignity, not the continuing oppression from the Assad regime, that it would be a pretty uneven match, to be understating that, and it could open territory for terrorist groups, foreign fighters, and others to come in.\nSo, let's talk about where we are now. And I have laid out a plan to deal with ISIS about airpower that is being used now, with more nations joining the United States, which is in the lead, to try to go after ISIS leadership, infrastructure, other assets, also to support Iraqi and Syrian fighters who are on the ground trying to take territory back from ISIS, and what else we need to do to build up those forces, the Iraqi army, which has had some success taking back Ramadi, Sunni tribal fighters, which we have to get back into the fight, and that is beginning to happen, and supporting the Kurdish fighters, who have been extraordinary brave on both sides of the border, by helping to equip and support them.\nSo, we have a clear mission to deprive ISIS of territory. And there is some movement, positive movement on that. And then we have to cut off their foreign fighters, their foreign funding, and take them online—take them on online, so that they are no longer able to recruit and propagandize, which keeps their flow of fighters and money coming.\nTAPPER: I'm told we're out of time. I just have one last question for you.\nIn terms of the status of the FBI investigation into your private e-mail server, have you been interviewed by the FBI yet?\nCLINTON: No.\nTAPPER: You haven't.\nAll right, Secretary Clinton, thanks so much. Really appreciate your time. Good luck with the debate tonight.\nCLINTON: Thanks. Thanks, Jake.", "timestamp": "2016-01-17", "title": "Interview with Jake tapper of CNN's \"State of the Union\""}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111543", "text": "Via Conference Call\n11:24 A.M. EST\nMR. PRICE: Morning, everyone. And thanks for joining this call. I wanted to convene this group to discuss some of the recent developments with and in Iran.\nFirst, a word about the ground rules. We will do this call on background. You can attribute this call to senior administration officials. This call will be embargoed until the end of the call, so we would ask you not tweet or otherwise use this material until then. So again, this call is on background to senior administration officials.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Great, thanks, everybody. So you just heard from the President; I know we spoke to some of you throughout the day yesterday on these issues. We did just want to provide another opportunity to some after what has been a very busy 24 hours with respect to Iran, and to discuss the two additional pieces of information that were rolled out today, which is an important settlement as a part of our claims tribunal at The Hague, and some additional designations that have been pursued with respect to Iran's ballistic missile program.\nStepping back, though, I think, as the President said, what we've been able to do over the course of the last two days is make very important progress on a number of different tracks that we have had with Iran. First, of course, on the nuclear side, we saw the implementation of the nuclear deal based upon the fact that Iran has now completed its major nuclear actions -- rolled back significant portions of its nuclear program, accepted the international monitoring verification regime that can assure us that Iran is not able to pursue a nuclear weapon. That initiates the sanctions release associated with the nuclear deal. So Implementation Day was yesterday.\nAlso yesterday, we had the release of five Americans that were held in Iranian custody. This morning -- or in the early morning hours in Tehran, we were pleased that three of those Americans were able to fly out of Tehran -- and we can speak to that -- that of course includes Saeed Abedini, Jason Rezaian, and Amir Hekmati. And yesterday, Matthew Trevithick was able to leave Iran as he was released.\nThen, third, we've had a longstanding tribunal at The Hague to resolve a number of different claims in either direction between the United States and Iran. The one that we resolved and announced today has to do with military equipment that was sold to the Iranians that they made payment for before the revolution. Clearly, it's in the U.S. interest to resolve these in ways that reduce our risk, and we believe that this is a very positive settlement for us and it is also a part of this broader resolution of a number of issues; really, the three issues where we've had sustained, regular diplomatic contact with Iran over the course of the last month and years.\nAnd then fourth, we've also been clear that just as -- even as we were making this important progress, we're going to continue to have differences with Iran and we're going to continue to have to have enforcement associated with those differences, particularly when it relates to things like ballistic missile violations of U.N. Security Council resolutions, as well as terrorist activity. And so we'll have some designations that we'll speak to related to those ballistic missile launches.\nI'll stop there. I'll turn it over to my colleague who can speak to the prisoner releases, as well as the Hague tribunal.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I'll just give a little bit of color about -- on this very long -- 14 months -- intense negotiations for the American citizens.\nAnd as I think has already been discussed, this really came out of the nuclear channel. And as we've always said on the margins of the nuclear talks, we would always raise the matters of our American citizens. And it became clear about a year and a half ago that really to make some progress on those issues, we would have to open a separate channel, a separate track, and that to have that track be successful, it would have to include elements of the Iranian government that were partially from the -- which is leading the nuclear talks, but also other elements of the systems that we had -- decision-makers in the room.\nAnd we were able to set up that channel, started about 14 months ago; very intense discussions, most of them held in Switzerland. And the Swiss government was just instrumental in hosting these talks and allowing them to remain secret -- which was absolutely critical to the ability of both sides to make any progress -- and then the facilitation of returning our American citizens today, which we're extremely grateful for. And they should be wheels down we hope within a couple hours.\nSo one thing that drove us throughout this was just the situation that was faced by the American citizens. Of course Jason Rezaian was detained in July 2014. He had not been sentenced yet, but speculation was that he was facing a very significant sentence, given the nature of the charges the Iranian government was really falsely alleging against him -- a multiple-year sentence potentially, a multiple-decade sentence potentially.\nSaeed Abedini, a Christian pastor from Idaho, had been detained since September 2012. He was sentenced in 2013 to eight years in prison, so therefore his sentence was running until 2021, and really no hope of ever finding a release valve.\nAmir Hekmati, a former U.S. Marine sergeant. He was detained in Iran in August of 2011, and was actually convicted to death in 2012. That sentence was later reduced, but he was serving a sentence until about 2022.\nOf course, there were other Americans who were detained over the course of these talks. Nosratallah Roodsari was one of them. Matthew Trevithick has been mentioned. And of course, Robert Levinson, the former FBI agent, has been missing since he went missing on a business trip to Kish Island in 2007 -- was also central to these discussions.\nSo what we were able to do over these 14 months was really narrow the scope of issues, focus on the fact that Iran did have some concerns about people detained in our system. And the fact that the people they were talking about -- we really narrowed it down to non-violent sanctions-related offenses, and in the context of the progress that was being made on the nuclear track, I think it kind of became possible to see a way that we could get the American citizens home and focus on non-violent offenders who were -- focused really on sanctions-related offenses.\nSo we found a way forward, which got our American citizens home. Three of them are coming home today. Two more were released from Iranian custody yesterday. One left Iran on a civilian plane yesterday, so -- I think is a very significant breakthrough most importantly for our fellow citizens and their families.\nWe've also agreed to continue a dialogue with Iran through multiple channels for missing persons, in particularly for Bob Levinson. And we made some progress in that case, but that's a case that we are never going to quit and never going to give up on, and he's central to our minds every single day. And we're going to continue to do everything we possibly can to find Bob and bring him home.\nSo I think what happened today in the breakthrough in getting our American citizens home was quite significant for being able to do this secretly, and with elements of the Iranian system that we don't normally, typically engage with, and also, but most importantly, bringing our citizens home.\nAnd I have to mention, again, I think the Swiss government was such a critical facilitator. We could not have done this without them, so we're extremely grateful. And as my colleague mentioned at the top, we've really had three tracks of sustained engagement with Iran going on for decades. It's really just unique.\nSo one was the Iran -- the nuclear track, of course. The second was in the Hague settlement tribunal, a process that came out of the Algiers Declaration in 1981. And that process has gone on for -- fits and starts for three decades. And sometimes it's made progress; sometimes it hasn't. Since Rouhani came into office, we have been able to make some progress in that track -- I defer to the lawyers who work this thing every day -- but we settled a number of smaller claims over the last four or five months. And then there was an opening through that track to settle a fairly substantial claim that was directly within U.S. interest because it reduced a significant risk of liability. And that particular claim also was being actively litigated in The Hague, and there was a timeframe for the litigation. So it was kind of on the courthouse steps.\nSo all of these patterns of interaction between -- with the U.S. and Iran created I think some opportunities across areas. And sometimes you have situations like the sailors in which, because of those patterns of interaction, that we were able to resolve some issues. And also I think we were able to advance the ball on other multiple issues simply because we had developed these patterns of engagement.\nSo that's where we are today. And I believe the most important thing for us is we're seeing our fellow citizens come home. And we consider that a significant breakthrough, a very good day, and we feel very good about it. And we're happy to address any questions.\nQ: Can you just give us a little bit of a tick-tock of the logistics of the prisoners leaving Iran, including, if you can, what happened to the fourth fellow, Nosratallah -- I'm not going to try his last name -- and how that fit in with the President's timing? We had thought, maybe from what Secretary Kerry said, we'd hear from the President last night. But was he -- kind of how those things meshed up. And also, how the timing of the sanctions fits into the prisoner swap, the new ballistic sanctions.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So I'll start. And let me just note that we have my colleague for a limited time so I think we'll do these questions and then we can wrap by having my colleague from Treasury kind of go into a little more detail about those -- well, actually, why don't we do that now just so that my colleague from Treasury can do that. And you asked a sanction question anyway, so I think that works.\nBut I'll start with the issues related to the President. Then I think we can -- Treasury can speak briefly to the designations the release has -- the specifics. And then my colleague can take the tick-tock on the prisoners.\nThe first thing I'd just say is, with respect to the President speaking, he wanted to wait until our Americans had left Tehran and we had a certainty that they and their families were on that plane and coming home. And so that drove our determinations about the timing of him speaking, and that was certainly Secretary Kerry's recommendation, as well.\nSecondly, with respect to the designations, yes -- and I got this question yesterday -- but I think it's obviously fair to say that the key issue for us was we had these three different tracks going on. The most sensitive one was the one that pertained to our Americans whose release we were seeking. And we did not want to complicate what was a very sensitive and delicate effort to bring Americans home with that action. So it was not the nuclear step.\nWe've had sanctions imposed in the context of JPOA and the negotiations toward the nuclear deal for the last few years. And so I think that is fairly routinized, even though the Iranians don't like it when we obviously impose sanctions and enforce an existing sanctions regime -- but rather this sensitivity around making sure we're not compromising our efforts to get the Americans out. But we are making clear that this is a one-time, unprecedented situation with the release of prisoners, and we are going to enforce our sanctions as necessary going forward with respect to issues like ballistic missiles and terrorism.\nSo why don't I turn it over to Treasury to speak briefly to the topline of those sanctions, and then my colleague can get into the timeline on the Americans.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Sure, I'll go ahead and give a brief overview of what we've done.\nI think with the implementation of the JCPOA yesterday and reaching Implementation Day, we've made very clear that the U.S. retains a number of designations authorities outside the scope of the JCPOA to counter Iran's multiple activities of concern, including its support for terrorism; its human rights abuses at home or abroad; support for persons involved in human rights abuses in Syria, for the government of Syria; support for persons threatening the peace, security or stability of Yemen; and, of course, its ballistic missile activities.\nSo today, we rolled out the designations of three entities and eight individuals involved in procurement on behalf of Iran's ballistic missile program with the UAE and China-based network that had been of concern involved in procuring materials and other equipment for carbon-fiber production for Iran's ballistic missile program. We've issued a press release on the Treasury website today with the details -- on the OFAC website of those designated that can answer more of the detail questions. I'm happy to answer anything further that you need.\nQ: Yes, I have a two-part question. What about the notion that the prisoner swap sets a bad precedent? On the talk shows this morning, there was comments from one presidential candidate who said, \"Every bad actor on Earth has been told [to] go capture an American; if you want to get terrorists out of jail, capture an American, \"and President Obama is in the let's-make-a-deal business.\"\nAnd then secondly, on the financial aspects that the President mentioned toward the end of his statement, how much was the U.S. looking at having to pay? How much did it save? And why did the U.S. feel so compelled to make this payment? What were the -- what was the feedback you were getting?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Sure. So I can start with that.\nFirst of all, with respect to releases of prisoners, swaps and otherwise, that has -- there's nothing new about that concept. That's gone on under presidents of different political parties for a long time. This was not a swap in the sense that this did not relate to intelligence assets -- a traditional spy swap is when you have people in prisons who are intelligence assets and you make exchanges for them -- but rather, these were releases that were undertaken by each side on a humanitarian basis. We of course reject the detention of the Americans. We believe that that detention was unjust.\nI would say a simple thing -- I said a version of this last night -- we had a judgment to make, which is, do you want to leave these Americans in prison at great risk to themselves and at great hardship to their families? If people want to say that they were for leaving these Americans in prison, they should say so. But the fact of the matter is, this was our opportunity to bring them home. And the fact of the matter is, we also were not -- did not have to release any Iranians involved in terrorism or convicted of violent crimes. Iran had a significantly higher number of individuals, of course, at the beginning of this negotiation that they would have liked to have seen released. But we were able to winnow that down to these seven individuals, six of whom are Iranian Americans.\nAnd they were convicted or awaiting trial for sanctions-related offenses, violations of the trade embargo in the context of a nuclear deal that is rooted in Iran taking enormous steps to roll back its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. While this was not a part of that deal, there was some natural convergence in the notion that you would provide the releases of the Iranians involved in sanctions-related offenses in the context of them releasing these Americans.\nBut I do have to say that it's very easy to insist that we stay in this cycle of endless conflict with Iran. I will tell you, across the board that is a recipe for potential confrontation and disaster for the United States in the sense that if we had not engaged in diplomacy around the nuclear issue, Iran right now would not have rolled back its program. They would be on the verge of having the capability to build a nuclear weapon.\nIf we did not have these diplomatic channels with the Iranians that have been established over the last two or three years, it is very likely that our sailors who had gone into Iranian waters would still be detained there today. If we did not have this diplomatic channel with Iran, we certainly would not have our Americans coming home.\nSo we believe that diplomacy delivers results. And again, people can, as the President said in the State of the Union, reduce their foreign policy to a sound bite, but ultimately, that's not going to be effective in advancing America's interests.\nWith respect to The Hague, I'd just say one thing -- and I don't know if my colleagues want to jump in --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Hey, guys, can I jump in really quick? I got to go -- in like two minutes.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Oh, sure, go ahead.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: But I'll just say -- there was a question of when the American citizens left, and they left this morning. There were some issues last night just with the crew rest and the length of flight, and also making sure that -- we wanted Jason Rezaian's mother and his wife on the plane.\nSo they left this morning, and from all indications -- and I've been in touch with folks who have been on the plane -- that they're in good spirits and they're going to get very well taken care of. And we very much look forward to seeing them here in a few minutes, and also welcoming them back to the United States.\nSo with that, I've got to head out. But it's great to join you.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I might want to -- I'd just like to say a couple more words on the Hague settlements, there was a question on that.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, sure, go ahead. I was going to do that but why don't you go ahead.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Okay. So if you -- just to give a little context around that settlement, obviously that's a tribunal that's been around since 1981. It was established with the Algiers Accords. Over the course of the decades that the tribunal has been in existence, there have been thousands of claims that have been resolved. As my colleague mentioned earlier, there has been quite a few claims that we're been able to resolve just over the course of the last few months.\nBut almost all of the 4,700 or so private U.S. claims filed against Iran in the tribunal after it was established have been resolved, and that's resulted in something like $2.5 billion in awards to U.S. nationals and U.S. companies. So Iran has paid out substantially from awards at this tribunal over the years. And what we were doing in the context of this settlement is settling a longstanding Iranian government claim against the United States government regarding this contract in the Foreign Military Sales program.\nAnd the settlement -- we reached a judgment that this settlement would result in a substantial reduction in our exposure at the tribunal because Iran was seeking billions of dollars on this claim, and these kinds of complex litigation are very unpredictable, and our lawyers assessed that we could have faced a significantly higher judgment. And so we see this kind of settlement as profoundly in our national interest and in our national security interest.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: And just to put one fine point on that, clearly, we -- foreign military sales to Iran that they made payment for, and we didn't make delivery of the military equipment. That's the basis of the claim. The longer the claim goes on, the greater the risk to the United States in terms of the type of interest associated with the account. And again, the type of interest that is utilized to settle the issue can carry with it a difference of billions of dollars.\nSo as the President mentioned today, and Secretary Kerry mentioned in his statement, if we did not settle this claim on these terms, the potential exposure for the United States could have been billions of dollars more. If this had gone to litigation in The Hague, that carries with it a legal risk for us.\nWe, of course, recognize the legitimacy of these types of international tribunals, so, for us, this settles an open account in a manner that we believe is profoundly in our interests, and ultimately reduces both the legal risk and the potential cost to the American -- to the United States that would have resulted from letting this drag out.\nQ: I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the tick-tock of why the plane took a while to take off, where it's headed, and talk about that there was need for some of the money to be released under the sanctions before the Americans could take off, the fact that the Iranians here weren't going to be released until the Americans were wheels up. I'm just trying to understand kind of what mechanisms -- if you guys could cover that that would be great.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: First of all, money was not related -- the sanctions relief under the nuclear deal was not related to the prisoner release at all. I think that's been conflated publicly. The issue very specifically was we wanted to make sure that when the plane took off, that Jason Rezaian was able to travel with his wife and mother. So that took extra time to ensure that they were located and on that plane. And we felt, obviously, very strongly that the Rezaian family had the right to leave together.\nAnd so, on the additional timing, there was an initial set of timing questions related to bringing together the different Americans who were being released. Then there was the question of ensuring that we had the Rezaian family on that plane. And once all those pieces were in place, that's when the Americans left. And then, similarly, here, in the United States, once we had certainty that these issues were being resolved, that's when the Iranian Americans and the Iranian here were presumably released. Although, I think DOJ should speak to that -- the Department of Justice should speak to the exact timing and procedures related with their releases.\nSo that was really the main question. And then, again, there were five Americans total released. Four have left. The other individual, it's his free determination as to whether or not he -- where he wants to go; stay in Iran or come to the United States. So we don't make that judgment for him. So that accounts for the people who were on the plane in the early morning hours from Tehran.\nQ: Looking ahead, you've accomplished three or four major things here -- is there a possibility for more cooperation with the Iranians on other issues of common concern -- like ISIS, like the humanitarian problem and situation in Syria? And do you worry that this imposition of these ballistic missile sanctions so quickly after these other agreements is going to close the door to any other future cooperation?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: That's a great question. So, first of all, we do believe that we should test whether or not there can be additional cooperation or at least constructive dialogue between the United States and Iran with respect to other issues. I think we've shown that over time, very persistent diplomacy can yield results -- most dramatically, on the nuclear issue, and then also on the other issues. And the main -- frankly, the main forum for that will be the Vienna process related to Syria.\nSo Iran is at the table in the discussions around resolving the Syrian civil war. They are part of the Vienna process. The fact of the matter is, Secretary Kerry has seen Foreign Minister Zarif in the context of the Vienna process and, frankly, has been raising issues related to the American citizens and the Iran nuclear issues in that context. So they have an open line of communication that is now focused on Syria.\nWe've had profound differences and continue to have profound differences with Iran over the situation in Syria. And we believe that test of whether Iran wants to engage constructively on regional issues is whether or not they can understand over time that the Syrian civil war is not going to be resolved so long as Bashar al-Assad is in power. And that's been the main difference between the United States and Iran in those discussions.\nSo we will continue to test that proposition. If Iran does act in a more constructive fashion, it would be a positive development in resolving difficult issues. If they don't, we will continue to enforce our sanctions and continue to have very strong differences. And I think the ballistic missile designations demonstrate that even as we make progress in all these different areas, we still have the ability to see that there are consequences for a ballistic missile program that violates international law, or, for instance, support for terrorism.\nSo as the President said in his remarks, though, it would be good for Iran if it takes -- and this will be a long-term proposition. Iran is not going to change dramatically in the next year or two years, but if over time, Iran takes this opportunity of reengaging with the international community to moderate its own behavior, internationally and with respect to its own human rights practices, ultimately, that would lead to a far better future for the Iranian people. And we want to make sure that the door is open for Iran to make that choice. If they don't make that choice, we retain all of our capabilities to impose consequences for areas where we have serious differences.\nWe've got time for one more question.\nQ: Related a little bit to the last question, what kind of longevity do you see for these multiple diplomatic channels your administration has established with Iran? Can they be institutionalized a bit more over the next year so that they can outlast this administration, or are they dependent on the philosophy of the people occupying the administration?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, great question. We're obviously not opening diplomatic relations with Iran formally. So this is not analogous to Cuba, where we set up an embassy and they set up an embassy here. However, it is the case that we were able in the course of the last two or three years to have more diplomatic engagement with Iran than I think we've had in total since 1979.\nAnd so we have engaged on these three tracks. The Hague one is a fairly technical one; generally, lawyer to lawyer. But again, this had been somewhat moribund in ways that we believe created risk for us, and so we're pleased that it's moving again.\nBut on the bigger issues, I guess I'd say a couple things. One is, on the issue with respect to the Americans, as my colleague said, we were dealing with different parts of the Iranian system, and so having conversations with the type of people we don't normally have conversations with. I'd just make that observation to demonstrate that some of this involved a broader engagement with the Iranian system than we've had even as -- even under the previous administration, there was engagement that was discrete and focused on Afghanistan or Iraq.\nBut I say that to say that that is unique and not part of I think a more sustained dialogue that we've had with Foreign Minister Zarif and other elements within the Rouhani administration and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In that regard, a lot of this has accelerated since President Rouhani was elected. Foreign Minister Zarif and Secretary Kerry have very regular dialogue through the nuclear discussions and now through the Vienna process. That dialogue gives us openings to resolve other issues.\nSo when our sailors drifted into Iranian territorial waters, we now have -- Secretary Kerry can pick up the phone, call the Foreign Minister of Iran, and resolve that issue in a matter of hours. That just wasn't available to us two years ago. If that happened two of three years ago, again, I think we would have had to spend ages getting a message back and forth with the Iranians. We'd have to have our U.N. ambassador find the Iranian representative up in New York and have that person send a message back to Tehran, and then have the Swiss government receive the answer from the Iranians. And now, we're just picking up the phone.\nSo that is clearly in our interest, because it allows us to not just make positive progress, but also to avoid unnecessary escalation or confrontations. But to your point, that is very much rooted in both administrations. So on our side, this President has been committed to engagement as a means of resolving differences or avoiding escalation. Secretary Kerry has also been deeply involved in this. And there will to some extent -- because they're not formal ties between our countries, it will be up to the next administration to determine how they want to carry that forward.\nObviously -- and I'm not speaking about the presidential campaign here -- this was -- well, I should leave it at that. I was just going to note that that has been the case throughout our administration under both terms.\nBut importantly, the question is -- the Iranian side. And under the Ahmadinejad administration, we did not have particularly constructive engagements at all on the nuclear issue or anything else. And the fact of the matter is the tone very much changed when President Rouhani was elected. He was elected on a mandate to engage the West and the United States on the nuclear issue. We had essentially just dialogue with the Iranians related to the nuclear issue that went nowhere except to -- sanctions that were imposed upon them because they weren't serious.\nThat all changed very quickly after President Rouhani was elected. President Obama sent him a letter indicating that we wanted to open up diplomatic discussions around the nuclear deal. We received a constructive response that initiated the nuclear dialogue.\nSo the choice is even more on the Iranian side than on our side as to whether or not they are going to continue to pursue more constructive relations with not just the United States but the rest of the world.\nAnd with that, I'm sorry, we'll have to wrap. But thanks, everybody, for getting on the call. You have from Treasury the details on the designations. You have from State Secretary Kerry's statement on the resolution of the Hague issue, as well as all the paper from yesterday.\nSo, Ned, I don't know if you have anything else you need to say in wrap.\nMR. PRICE: As you know, just a reminder that this was on background. And thanks, everyone, for joining.\nEND 12:00 P.M.

{"author": "Chris Christie", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111840", "text": "Christie has sense, maturity, intellect\nFoster's Daily Democrat\nJeff Chidester\nWho are you supporting? You will either answer the question with conviction, reservation or uncertainty. In almost every other state, the presidential candidates and policies we support or oppose attract very little attention except maybe in an active political circle. But we live in New Hampshire, where the conversation of politics is as natural as talking about the weather; the only difference is that confusing partly cloudy with partly sunny usually won't end in a fist fight.\nBeing a participant of the First-in-the-Nation Primary is fraught with danger, even for someone as seasoned as me.\nI take my role as a public figure very seriously. Whether or not people agree with me, there is a trust established between those who read my article, listen to my radio show or invite me to speak in front of their organization. It is my belief that failing to share with you who I am supporting, all while continuing my public commentary, would be a violation of this trust. With that said, I wanted to let you know why I have decided to enthusiastically support New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie for president and why I am encouraging all those who are still undecided to consider Christie.\nThe first thing that impressed me about the governor was his approach to governing. Christie governed as a conservative in one of the most fiscally liberal states in the country. Unlike many of the others running for president this cycle, Christie has had to govern with a legislative body that overwhelmingly consisted of representatives from the opposition party. Democrats outnumber Republicans in New Jersey by more than 700,000 votes, yet Christie has governed as a conservative, building consensus with Republicans, Democrats and Independents.\n...\nUnder Christie, New Jersey has become the role model for criminal justice reform and veterans care. Christie's efforts proved so successful that the New Jersey prison population has been reduced to the point it can now close one prison. However, Christie is not going to just board up the prison to sell it to a private entity. Working with the private and nonprofit sector, he is leading the charge to convert the former prison to a state-of-the-art drug treatment center. Christie believes we need to stop treating drug addiction purely as a criminal matter, and start treating it as a health care issue. He is not only proving to be a leader for New Jersey on this issue, but for the nation.\nChristie's commitment to veterans is extremely impressive. When the federal government shut off funding to the Rutgers University-operated suicide prevention hotline (Vets4Warriors), Christie showed true leadership and stepped up to save the program. Vets4Warriors hotline is now funded thanks to Christie and the people of New Jersey, yet remains accessible to all veterans across the country. Accountability and dedication, those are characteristics of Christie's leadership style. A style we need leading our country.\nRegardless of your party affiliation or political ideology, none of that matters if you cannot govern. Christie proved, much like Ronald Reagan did, that you can govern as a classic conservative without always alienating people of differing opinions. All too often we criticize from \"the hip.\" Those who have never had to govern claim how \"if they were in charge, things would be different,\" as if somehow they have a magic wand that others do not possess. Governing is not easy, but some people rise to the occasion. One such person is Gov. Christie.\nRead the full op-ed here.\nJeff Chidester was raised in Portsmouth and is a lifelong resident of New Hampshire. He is the host of the Clear Channel radio show \"New Hampshire Perspective with Jeff Chidester,\" which can be heard on News Radio WQSO - 96.7 FM and New Hampshire's News Network WGIR - 610 AM.", "timestamp": "2016-01-17", "title": "Press Release - ICYMI - Foster's Daily Democrat Op-Ed: Jeff Chidester: Christie Has Sense, Maturity, Intellect"}
{"author": "Jeb Bush", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=112378", "text": "Every individual in this country has the right to rise. Yet today, the American Dream—the idea that anything is possible through hard work—is threatened by an education system failing to prepare the next generation of children for success. Choice, innovation and transparency have transformed practically every part of our lives, and yet our schools remain artifacts of another century.\nGovernor Bush's goal is to ensure that all Americans, no matter their background or zip code, graduate from high school, college and career ready, and have the opportunity to pursue affordable post-secondary education or training. Achieving this goal requires a complete overhaul of a system from one that serves bureaucracies to one that serves the needs of families and students. Empowering individuals doesn't require additional money or programs designed by Washington. What we need is a national focus on fueling innovation and providing quality choices for every student in this country.\nGovernor Bush's plan is budget neutral but will dramatically improve educational opportunities in America. Rather than spending more, this plan consolidates current programs, eliminates waste and returns power back to states, local districts and families. In fact, this plan reduces the size of the federal Department of Education by approximately 50 percent.\nGovernor Bush has an unmatched record of reforming education to improve results. As governor of Florida, he expanded choices for families, increased transparency on the quality of schools, and increased student achievement across the board, particularly among minority and low-income students. The only thing he needed from Washington bureaucrats was for them to stay out of the way. As president, he will return power to families and states. This platform reflects the fundamental belief that every student can learn and that parents—not bureaucrats—should make decisions for their child. It gives students and families real choices, the resources they need for a strong start in life, and the information they need to make critical decisions.\nGovernor Bush's education reform agenda is guided by four core principles:\n* Education decisions should be made as close to the student as possible. The federal role in education should be limited, and should respect the decision-making power of parents, teachers, schools, and local and state officials.\n* Choice—of all kinds—should be expanded across the board. Choice fuels innovation and competition in the education market, resulting in a greater diversity of options for students and teachers, and ultimately better results. Choice goes beyond just choosing a school. It also means being able to tap into opportunities to learn outside the traditional classroom. Rather than having the students fit into the \"system,\" we need to empower individual families to find the learning environments that best meet their unique needs.\n* Transparency is essential to choice, quality and results-based accountability. Parents and students need information to make good choices; teachers need information to improve their teaching; and policymakers need information to ensure scarce resources are invested in what works. Information should be used as a flashlight to guide progress rather than simply as a hammer to punish failure.\n* Innovation requires flexibility. In exchange for choice and transparency around outcomes, we should reduce the number of rules and requirements tied to federal dollars. These rules simply drown the system in compliance costs, wasting valuable resources and preventing innovation. We need to empower educators to use their passion, creativity and energy to transform education.\nSupporting Lifelong Education\nIn our increasingly knowledge-based economy, all Americans need a quality education that equips them with the skills to succeed. Understanding that many families invest in their children's education well before college, Jeb's plan allows for the conversion of 529 college savings accounts into Education Savings Accounts. These accounts would allow families and individuals to save tax-free for lifelong education, including for pre-K, elementary school, high school, college, job training, tutoring, summer school or online classes. Relatives, employers, and other non-relatives would also be able to contribute to these accounts. As they currently do with 529 college savings plans, states would choose whether to offer Education Savings Accounts and would continue to oversee these savings plans.\nTo help low-income families save for their children's education, Governor Bush would foster charitable giving directly to the Education Savings Accounts of low-income children by making those contributions tax-deductible. If the full amount of funds in an individual's account isn't spent, that individual can pass the funds down to their child.\nEarly Childhood Education\nDespite spending roughly $22 billion each year on early childhood through approximately 44 different programs—more than the federal government spends on low-income students in K-12—too many low-income children are unprepared for Kindergarten. In order to ensure that those dollars are spent directly on children's education, rather than wasted on bureaucracy, Governor Bush would allow states to return these funds directly to parents and let them choose the type of education that their children actually need (day, night, weekends, center-based, home-based), rather than the type a bureaucrat is offering. Giving families choice will ensure each child's unique educational needs are met, as well as fueling a focus on results, innovation, transparency and accountability in early childhood education. This new system would be optional for states—states could choose to opt-in or they could maintain the status quo and continue to participate in the fragmented menu of programs and services available from the federal government.\nIn the states that choose to participate, Governor Bush's plan would consolidate existing federal early childhood funds and deposit $2,500 annually in the Education Savings Accounts of low-income children under the age of five. Participating states would create and execute a plan for regulating, evaluating and holding providers accountable for high educational quality, and ensuring parents have critical information on program quality and outcomes. States may (and would be encouraged to) contribute additional state and district funds to each child's account, facilitating seamless coordination with the significant state early childhood investments already in place. In most cases it will require more than the federal dollars to ensure adequate funding for a strong start for low-income children—the federal investment is intended to be supplementary to state, local, and family expenditures, just as it is for the education of children from low-income families in K-12 and post-secondary. Unspent funds would grow within the Education Savings Accounts and could be spent on K-12 education expenses, college tuition or postsecondary training.\nK-12 Education\nOur primary and secondary schools have failed to keep up with the increasing knowledge and skill demands of the competitive 21st century global economy. We need a system that meets the unique needs of students through a diverse set of educational options with strong accountability for results. This is best achieved through empowering those closest to students—parents and teachers—to make decisions and returning the funding and accountability decisions back to states and local school systems. The states must continue to be the laboratories for change while the federal government's role should be limited and focused on responsibilities for which it is uniquely suited. The federal government cannot run or fix schools from Washington, but it can make it easier for families, educators and entrepreneurs to reform education.\nThe proposals below are designed to be budget neutral and return power and decision-making to the states and citizens. To leverage the limited, but critical role of the federal government to create the conditions necessary for every child to graduate from high school prepared for the demands of college or the workplace, Governor Bush would:\n* Empower parents and students with quality options\n* Support states with the flexibility and resources to create great schools\n* Reward great teaching and successful student outcomes\n* Give parents, teachers and taxpayers the information they need\n* Drive innovation and research to break the stranglehold of the status quo\nEmpower Parents And Students With Quality Options\n* Support Charter School Expansion: There are nearly a million students languishing on waitlists around the country, hoping for the opportunity to go a charter school. Governor Bush would do everything within his power—from using the bully pulpit and reducing regulations and restrictions to increasing funding—to support charter school expansion and success so that more students around the country have the school options they want, need and deserve. Specifically, Governor Bush proposes doubling federal support for charter school expansion to meet the high demand of students on wait lists around the country.\n* Strengthen Educational Opportunity in D.C.: In order to improve education in our nation's capital and give more families the opportunity to attend a school that best fits their needs, Governor Bush would ensure continued funding for the three-sector strategy which supports public, charter and private school options, and strengthen the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program.\nSupport States With The Flexibility and Resources To Create Great Public Schools\n* Defend State Control Of Education: Governor Bush would continue to build on Congress' recent restoration of state control over accountability decisions and would ensure the federal government does not interfere with state decisions related to academic standards, content or curriculum. The federal government cannot, and should not, impose a one-size fits all model of anything on states. As the newly reauthorized Every Student Succeeds Act reinforces, states need to be held accountable for serving their citizens, not federal bureaucrats. This fundamentally conservative approach must be expanded to every part of education, not just accountability systems. States are best positioned to decide how to serve every student and family; the federal government must make it easier for states to do this, not create more rules, burdens and programs.\n* Increase State Flexibility & Allow States To Expand Choice For Disadvantaged Students: Governor Bush would block grant Title I dollars to states to give them the flexibility and resources needed to expand student choices and innovate to better serve low-income students. He would also allow states to make Title I portable so that federal funds can follow low-income students to the school, course or program of their choice. States could deposit these funds directly into students' Education Savings Accounts or use them to expand school choice in other ways.\n* Allow States To Make Federal Special Education Funds (IDEA) Portable: Instead of forcing parents to fight in court for the right to send their special needs student to a different school, Governor Bush would give parents—with state approval—the federal dollars allocated to their special-needs child. Parents could then use those funds—made available through an Education Savings Account or a state choice system—to pay for the education that best serves their child's needs.\n* Reward State Success: Rather than dictating specific reform prescriptions from Washington D.C., Governor Bush proposes giving low-income and high needs schools the chance to earn additional dollars based on their ability to improve student outcomes. Rewarding performance will create incentives for schools to think more creatively about innovating in education in order to capture the additional dollars by improving performance goals. More importantly, it gives complete flexibility for schools to achieve the outcomes however they see fit and ensures the federal government pays for success, not just promises. States are the laboratories of innovation, and rewarding success instead of applying punitive regulations and bullying from D.C. will drive reform around the country.\nReward Great Teaching And Successful Student Outcomes\n* Support Great Teaching and Ensure The Neediest Benefit From The Best Teachers: Teachers are our most valuable resource. To support great teaching, Governor Bush would block grant Title II funds and give states the option to spend those funds on rewarding top teachers in a state's lowest performing schools; recruiting new talent to the teaching profession; or creating individual training accounts that teachers can use to further their own professional. Just as school choice allows students to receive the education best suited to their needs, giving teachers more choice over professional development would allow them to receive training tailored to their needs. States would need to evaluate and demonstrate the positive impact of their approach on student outcomes.\nGive Parents, Teachers And Taxpayers The Information They Need\n* Publicly Report Critical Student Outcome Measures: Transparency is the most basic form of accountability—parents, teachers and taxpayers need information to evaluate their schools and make informed decisions. ESSA will ensure that there is richer information on student achievement available to the public than ever before, but much more must be done to provide taxpayers, policymakers and parents actionable information beyond static test scores. Rather than having states bury information in warehouses or state websites, Governor Bush would require states to ensure every citizen receives a complete, useful and timely picture of student achievement, system progress and finances in their schools.\n* Guarantee Parent and Teacher Access to Information: Governor Bush would ensure that every parent is given their own child's information in a timely, contextual, useful format, as well as information on the quality of schools and programs available to their family. Every teacher should also receive information on the students enrolled in their classes before they show up for the school year.\n* Safeguard Student Privacy: States must prioritize the safeguarding of student information through strong governance, use of best practices in information security and privacy protection and increased training and communication around data protection. Parents should be able to trust that their child's information is being safeguarded and used in appropriate ways.\nDrive Innovation and Research To Break The Stranglehold of the Status Quo\nSupport Next Generation Education Models: Every part of our lives has been transformed by technology and information; yet, today's students \"receive\" education in the same passive manner that their grandparents did. In order to encourage innovation and play a trust-busting role, Governor Bush would support states' creation and scaling of innovative school models such as online, blended and competency-based learning models.\nInvest in Research, Development and Dissemination: Governor Bush would invest in researching what is working in education around the country and disseminating that information to ensure that leaders and educators in every state and district can learn from the successes and failures of others.\nPost-Secondary Education & Training\nEducation after high school has become critical to upward mobility, yet post-secondary education and training has become too expensive for many Americans to afford, not to mention the quality of degree and certificate programs varies dramatically. Students lack the information to identify colleges that are worth the investment, and more than 40 percent of those who start a program fail to finish one in six years. Increasing numbers of student loan borrowers struggle to repay their debts. Simply spending more federal money will not solve these problems. Existing aid programs give institutions every incentive to enroll students at high tuition prices and less incentive to make sure they are equipped to succeed. While advances in technology and new models of education could create a wider array of affordable, effective options, regulatory barriers to entry keep new competitors out. To fix these problems, Governor Bush would implement a new system that will:\n* Ensure Flexible Access to Post-Secondary Education and Training with Education Savings Accounts\n* Drive Down Costs and Hold Post-Secondary Institutions Accountable\n* Expand Student Access To Innovative New Types of Education and Training\n* Give Students and Families the Information They Need To Make Good Decisions\n* Help Existing Borrowers Successfully Repay their Loans\nEnsure Flexible Access to Post-Secondary Education & Training with Education Savings Accounts:\nA vibrant future for all Americans requires every single one of our citizens to be a skilled and contributing member of society. In our increasingly skilled economy, a successful career requires education and training beyond high school. That may come in the form of apprenticeships, short-term programs for career preparation, micro-credentials, or more traditional two-year or four year colleges—but everyone needs access to postsecondary training. And they need options that fit their needs and goals. Many students cannot afford to drop everything and enroll in a traditional college for multiple semesters. They would prefer to jump in and out of programs to gain the skills they need, when they need them.\nTo ensure flexible access to post-secondary education and training, Governor Bush would consolidate all current funding and replace the confusing, burdensome federal loan program with an entirely new, income-based financing system that gives students ownership and the flexibility to plot their own individual educational path. This new financial aid system would eliminate FAFSA, the confusing financial aid application process, and remove the menace of accumulating interest, default, damaged credit and collections agencies. It would ensure that repayment is predictable and affordable, protects students during periods of unemployment or underemployment, and eliminates defaults. It would encourage low-income students to aim high and invest in their future, and give students ownership of their student aid, incentivizing them to be cost-conscious and spend funds carefully over the course of their education, which will help bring down the spiraling cost of post-secondary education.\nSpecifically, Governor Bush would provide all high school graduates access to a $50,000 line of credit (similar to the amount currently available for independent undergraduates) through their Education Savings Account. Recipients would be able to use the funds to pay for a wide-range of educational and skill building programs over the course of a lifetime, with sensible first year spending limits. Unlike the federal contributions to Education Savings Accounts for low-income students (early childhood, K-12, Pell Grants) which come with no repayment obligation, every student accessing the $50,000 line-of-credit would repay by contributing a percentage of their incomes proportional to the amount spent—1% for every $10,000 spent—through their federal income taxes for 25 years. No student, no matter how successful, would repay more than 1.75 times the amount spent. As they do currently, students will have to make satisfactory academic progress to maintain access to funds. To help students navigate their educational finances, Governor Bush would incorporate financial education into all aspects of the program's management.\nLow-income students, in addition to the $50,000 line of credit, would also have access to an improved need-based Pell Grant through their Education Savings Account—so that every student, regardless of income, knows that college is within their reach if they work hard. For children under 18, eligibility would be assessed through their parents' tax returns. Students would be notified of likely eligibility in 8th grade, and the total grant amount would be credited to their Education Savings Account over the course of high school. Once students graduate from high school, they would be able to access a portion of the total grant amount each year to spend on educational and skill building programs. Low-income adults without a postsecondary degree could become eligible for grant funds by completing a simple application when they file their taxes.\nDual-Enrollment: In order to support student efforts to save themselves time and money, Governor Bush would allow students to use a portion of their line-of-credit or grant to pursue postsecondary work—such as AP classes, college credits and industry certifications etc.—while still enrolled in high school, provided they meet certain performance benchmarks.\nDrive Down Costs and Hold Post-Secondary Institutions Accountable\nAmerica has some of the best colleges and universities in the world but our higher education system is increasingly unaffordable for most Americans and too often doesn't prepare students to succeed in the workforce, raising important questions about institutional accountability. To protect students and taxpayers, drive down costs and ensure Americans are getting real value for the money they spend on higher education, Governor Bush would give colleges and career training programs \"skin in the game.\"\nHe would put all institutions—colleges, universities, workforce training programs, apprenticeship etc.—on the hook for a portion of the federal funds students spent at that institution and were unable to repay. Giving colleges \"skin in the game\" forces institutions to share the risk of failure with students and taxpayers, incentivizing them to increase the value of their programs by reducing costs and boosting quality, and ensure that students graduate with the skills to succeed in the workforce. Institutions whose students chronically fail to repay their obligations would also lose eligibility based on a new and more rigorous performance standard. To ensure colleges maintain access for low-income students, colleges will receive bonuses for every low-income graduate.\nExpand Student Access To Innovative New Types of Education and Training\nMany students cannot afford to drop everything and enroll in a traditional college for multiple semesters at a high price tag—they would rather get recognition for what they learned on the job or in the military and/or pursue the skills they need for career-advancement as quickly and affordably as possible. New models of education—low-cost course and assessment providers; exam-based certifications of learning; targeted, short-term programs for career preparation; and apprenticeship models—offer alternative and often less expensive routes to develop skills with great labor market value. Unfortunately, students are currently unable to use their federal aid at many of these programs, making these successful new options unaffordable for most students.\nGovernor Bush would allow students to spend Education Savings Account funds at a broader set of postsecondary organizations — prior learning assessments, short-term occupational training, industry certifications, apprenticeships etc. — that have demonstrated positive student outcomes. New providers will gain incremental access to federal student aid based on their rates of student success (completion, licensure/certification passage rates, labor market outcomes). Initially, providers would have no access to federal funds upfront, but would be reimbursed based on their rates of student success. Over time, successful providers could gain full access to Education Savings Account funds based on their performance. New, independent quality assurance organizations—employer groups, industry associations, nonprofits—will be granted the authority to oversee the process and make eligibility decisions in exchange for more accountability and transparency.\nGive Students and Families The Information They Need To Make Good Decisions\nToday, prospective students lack the information they need to choose the school or program that is best for them. To ensure that students have the information needed to evaluate schools and training programs, Governor Bush would incentivize the creation of state databases that make information on student outcomes on the program level (retention, completion, unemployment, earnings, etc.) available to the public. He would do this by making receipt of federal student aid at institutions within a state contingent on the state creating this database, and by making federal information on repayment rates, loan performance, and graduation rates available to states and other third parties. This information is already being collected at the state and federal level, and should be made available to students and families while ensuring the privacy and security of student information through strong governance, use of best practices in data security and privacy protection, and increased training and communication around data protection.\nTo guarantee that students actually receive this critical information, Governor Bush would require students to verify they have received it from the program they plan to enroll in before they can spend the money in their Education Savings Account.\nHelp Existing Borrowers Successfully Repay Their Loans:\nWhile Governor Bush's income-based repayment model will eliminate debt balances, interest and defaults for all future students, there are millions of Americans currently struggling to repay their debt—or already in default with disastrous consequences for their ability to buy a car, a home, start a business or get a job. For those students, Governor Bush proposes the following reforms to ensure they successfully repay their loans:\n* Allow borrowers with existing debt to transfer into Governor Bush's new financing system and repay their outstanding debt with a percentage of their income.\n* Facilitate struggling borrowers movement into the existing REPAYE program. Millions of people continue to default and ruin their credit despite existing options for income-based debt repayment due to various administrative and informational barriers.\n* Allow all borrowers to extend debt repayment period up to 30 years to reduce the monthly burden of student debt and lower the risk of default.\n* Make federal debt collection more transparent, simple and fair while intensifying efforts to move borrowers into income-based repayment when they first miss payments.\n* Task the Department of Treasury with managing the $1.2 trillion in outstanding federal loans to mitigate the financial risk to our nation's fiscal stability.\n* Make it easier for private student debt to be discharged in bankruptcy.\nConclusion\nReaching our goal of four percent annual growth requires providing every individual in this country with the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in the increasingly competitive 21st century global economy. We know how to do this. Jeb's record in Florida proves that when we empower families with quality learning options and the means to access them, student achievement increases. Making America's education system world class is not only an economic imperative, it is a moral one. We can change the trajectory of our nation's future as well as the lives of individual students. There is nothing more important to the right to rise than a world-class education. Our children deserve one.", "timestamp": "2016-01-17", "title": "Press Release - Restoring the Right to Rise through a Quality Education"}

Bernie Sanders on Sunday detailed a Medicare-for-all plan to provide better health care for all Americans at less cost.\n\"Universal health care is an idea that has been supported in the United States by Democratic presidents going back to Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman,\" Sanders said. \"It is time for our country to join every other major industrialized nation on earth and guarantee health care to all citizens as a right, not a privilege.\"\nThe proposal would expand Medicare, the popular and successful health care program for seniors, and build on the success of the Affordable Care Act, which Sanders helped craft. Patients would be able to choose their own doctors and receive comprehensive care for everything from hospital stays to emergency room visits to primary and specialty care.\nSanders' Medicare-for-all plan would save $6 trillion over the next 10 years compared to the current system, according to a detailed analysis by Gerald Friedman, an economist at University of Massachusetts at Amherst who is a leading expert on health care costs.\nIn a nation that now spends $3 trillion a year on health care – nearly $10,000 per person – Sanders' plan would save consumers money by eliminating expensive and wasteful private health insurance. The plan would save taxpayers money by dramatically reducing overall health care costs and bringing down skyrocketing prescription drug prices which are far greater in the United States than in any other country.\nThe typical family earning $50,000 a year would save nearly $6,000 annually in health care costs, Friedman calculated. The average working family now pays $4,955 in premiums for private insurance and spends another $1,318 on deductibles for care that isn't covered. Under Sanders' plan, a family of four earning $50,000 would pay just $466 per year to the Medicare-for-all program.\nBusinesses would save more than $9,400 a year in health care costs under Sanders' plan. The average annual cost to the employer for a worker with a family who makes $50,000 a year would go from $12,591 to just $3,100.\nThe shift to universal health care would be paid for with a 2.2 percent health care premium (calculated under the rules for federal income taxes); a 6.2 percent health care payroll tax paid by employers; an estate tax on the wealthiest Americans and changes in the tax code to make federal income tax rates more progressive.\nUnder the plan, individuals making $250,000 to $500,000 a year would be taxed at a rate of 37 percent. The top rate, 52 percent, would apply to those earning $10 million or more a year, a category that in 2013 included only the 13,000 wealthiest households in the United States.\nAdditional savings would be achieved from reducing outlays for taxpayer-supported health care expenditures.\nSanders laid out his health care plan and progressive tax reform proposals here in South Carolina where he and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley were to take part on Sunday night in a nationally televised debate in their contest for the Democratic Party presidential nomination.\nTo read more about Sanders' Medicare-for-all plan and his progressive tax proposals, click here.\nTo read Professor Gerald Friedman's analysis of Sanders' plan, click here.", "timestamp": "2016-01-17", "title": "Press Release - Medicare-for-All Plan Detailed by Sanders: Improves Health Care, Cuts Costs"}

{"author": "Bernie Sanders", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123312", "text": "TODD: Let me start with one of the issues that is likely to come up tonight at the debate and that's the issue of gun safety. Last night in what the Clinton campaign is referring to as a debate-eve conversion you came out in favor of essentially repealing immunity for gun manufacturers when it comes to being held liable for gun deaths. That's a switch of your positions. What brought you to this conclusion?\nSANDERS: Well, not really. You know, I understand that Secretary Clinton and her campaign understand that, you know, they're losing ground. We've started this campaign off at 3 percent in the polls and now we're closing in, in Iowa. And we're doing really well in New Hampshire. So I think in the next few weeks you're going to see a lot of nonsense being thrown around.\nLook, I have --\nTODD: This is nonsense -- I mean you did change your position on this.\nSANDERS: What I said -- what I said Chuck -- what I said several months ago, having a D-minus voting record from the NRA having voting to ban assault weapons way back in 1988, yes, that was a piece of legislation that I wanted to relook at.\nBut what that legislation had among other things is a prohibition on armor-piercing ammunition designed to kill police officers. It had language in it for a child lock safety for our kids -- important provision. There were things in it that I did o not like and I was willing to rethink. We have rethought it. There's a bill apparently being introduced, I like that bill, it makes some good changes and we will be supportive of it.\nTODD: All right. Another thing that's going to come up on the issue of gun safety is the issue of a waiting period. The Clinton campaign is hitting you for supporting only a three-day waiting period or instant background checks and not being in favor supportive of something longer like a five-day or seven-day window. And the reason this is being brought up is that if Dylann Roof -- the man who killed those nine folks in Charleston last year -- if there had been a longer waiting period he might have been prevented from buying a gun.\nSANDERS: Look, what we saw here in Charleston is a tragedy of unspeakable dimensions. I sit in prayer with people that takes out a gun and shoots nine people. I hope we don't have to politicize that issue. I believe very strongly in instant background checks. I think we have to expand it. I think we have to make sure 100 percent that we keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have that, people with criminal backgrounds, people who are mentally unstable. That has been my view from day one.\nBut you know, Chuck, I think the reason that the Clinton campaign is getting defensive is they see that we have the momentum. They see that the issues that we are talking about, a disappearing middle-class and almost all new income and wealth going to the top 1 percent, a corrupt campaign finance system where people like Secretary Clinton can raise millions of dollars through super PACs. Those are kind of issues which they don't want to discuss.\nSo tonight we're going to be discussing a lot of issues and the main issue for me is why the rich get richer, almost everybody else gets poorer and the fact that we have got to stand up to the billionaire class and change those dynamics.\nTODD: So you're not in favor of a longer background check? A five, seven-day background check?\nSANDERS: We are willing to look at anything that makes sense that keeps guns out of the hands of people who should not have them. But I'm not going to be defensive on that issue.\nI lost an election in 1988, probably lost an election because I had the courage back then to say that assault weapons should not be sold in America.\nTODD: Let me ask you quickly about the Iran deal. Is Iran still an enemy of the United States given what's going on? The improved diplomatic relations?\nSANDERS: Well, you know, it's funny. If you think back to I think it was 2007 during the campaign in which Secretary Clinton ran against Barack Obama. She was critical of him, a question was asked to Obama and said would you sit down and talk to the Iranians? And he said yes, I would. The point being that you talk to your adversaries, you don't run away from that.\nSecretary Clinton I think called him naive -- turns out that Obama was right. Mo clearly we have many, many issues and many concerns with Iran but clearly also we want to improve our relationship with this very powerful country.\nI think the agreement to make certain Iran does not get a nuclear weapon was a huge step forward. The fact we had the prisoner release today was a good important step forward. So I hope that we can continue to go forward to improve relations with Iran.\nTODD: All right. Senator Sanders -- I'll leave it there. We look forward to seeing you, Secretary Clinton and Martin O'Malley on stage tonight on NBC.

This is a good day, because once again, we're seeing what's possible with strong American diplomacy.\nAs I said in my State of the Union Address, ensuring the security of the United States and the safety of our people demands a smart, patient, and disciplined approach to the world. That includes our diplomacy with the Islamic Republic of Iran. For decades, our differences with Iran meant that our governments almost never spoke to each other. Ultimately, that did not advance America's interests. Over the years, Iran moved closer and closer to having the ability to build a nuclear weapon. But from Presidents Franklin Roosevelt to John F. Kennedy to Ronald Reagan, the United States has never been afraid to pursue diplomacy with our adversaries. And as President, I decided that a strong, confident America could advance our national security by engaging directly with the Iranian Government.\nWe've seen the results. Under the nuclear deal that we, our allies, and partners reached with Iran last year, Iran will not get its hands on a nuclear bomb. The region, the United States, and the world will be more secure. As I've said many times, the nuclear deal was never intended to resolve all of our differences with Iran. But still, engaging directly with the Iranian Government on a sustained basis, for the first time in decades, has created a unique opportunity—a window—to try to resolve important issues. And today I can report progress on a number of fronts.\nFirst, yesterday marked a milestone in preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Iran has now fulfilled key commitments under the nuclear deal. And I want to take a moment to explain why this is so important.\nOver more than a decade, Iran had moved ahead with its nuclear program, and before the deal, it had installed nearly 20,000 centrifuges that can enrich uranium for a nuclear bomb. Today, Iran has removed two-thirds of those machines. Before the deal, Iran was steadily increasing its stockpile of enriched uranium, enough for up to 10 nuclear bombs. Today, more than 98 percent of that stockpile has been shipped out of Iran, meaning Iran now doesn't have enough material for even one bomb. Before, Iran was nearing completion of a new reactor capable of producing plutonium for a bomb. Today, the core of that reactor has been pulled out and filled with concrete so it cannot be used again.\nBefore the deal, the world had relatively little visibility into Iran's nuclear program. Today, international inspectors are on the ground, and Iran is being subjected to the most comprehensive, intrusive inspection regime ever negotiated to monitor a nuclear program. Inspectors will monitor Iran's key nuclear facilities 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. For decades to come, inspectors will have access to Iran's entire nuclear supply chain. In other words, if Iran tries to cheat—if they try to build a bomb covertly—we will catch them.\nSo the bottom line is this. Whereas Iran was steadily expanding its nuclear program, we have now cut off every single path that Iran could have used to build a bomb. Whereas it would have taken Iran 2 to 3 months to break out with enough material to rush to a bomb, we've now extended that breakout time to a year, and with the world's unprecedented inspections and access to Iran's program, we'll know if Iran ever tries to break out. Now that Iran's actions have been verified, it can begin to receive relief from certain nuclear sanctions and gain access to its own money that had been frozen. And perhaps most important of all, we've achieved this historic progress through diplomacy, without resorting to another war in the Middle East.\nI want to also point out that by working with Iran on this nuclear deal, we were better able to address other issues. When our sailors in the Persian Gulf accidentally strayed into Iranian waters, that could have sparked a major international incident. Some folks here in Washington rushed to declare that it was the start of another hostage crisis. Instead, we worked directly with the Iranian Government and secured the release of our sailors in less than 24 hours.\nAnd this brings me to a second major development: Several Americans unjustly detained by Iran are finally coming home. In some cases, these Americans faced years of continued detention. And I've met with some of their families. I've seen their anguish, how they ache for their sons and husbands. I gave these families my word—I made a vow—that we would do everything in our power to win the release of their loved ones. And we have been tireless. On the sidelines of the nuclear negotiations, our diplomats at the highest level, including Secretary Kerry, used every meeting to push Iran to release our Americans. I did so myself, in my conversation with President Rouhani. After the nuclear deal was completed, the discussions between our governments accelerated. Yesterday these families finally got the news that they had been waiting for.\nJason Rezaian is coming home. A courageous journalist for the Washington Post, who wrote about the daily lives and hopes of the Iranian people, he's been held for a year and a half. He embodies the brave spirit that gives life to the freedom of the press. Jason has already been reunited with his wife and mom.\nPastor Saeed Abedini is coming home. Held for 3½ years, his unyielding faith has inspired people around the world in the global fight to uphold freedom of religion. And now pastor Abedini will return to his church and community in Idaho.\nAmir Hekmati is coming home. A former sergeant in the Marine Corps, he's been held for 4½ years. Today his parents and sisters are giving thanks in Michigan.\nTwo other Americans unjustly detained by Iran have also been released: Nosratollah Khosravi-Roodsari and Matthew Trevithick, an Iranian—who was in Iran as a student. Their cases were largely unknown to the world. But when Americans are freed and reunited with their families, that's something that we can all celebrate.\nSo I want to thank my national security team, especially Secretary Kerry; Susan Rice, my National Security Adviser; Brett McGurk; Avril Haines; Ben Rhodes. Our whole team worked tirelessly to bring our Americans home, to get this work done. And I want to thank the Swiss Government, which represents our interests in Iran, for their critical assistance.\nAnd meanwhile, Iran has agreed to deepen our coordination as we work to locate Robert Levinson, missing from Iran for more than 8 years. Even as we rejoice in the safe return of others, we will never forget about Bob. Each and every day, but especially today, our hearts are with the Levinson family, and we will not rest until their family is whole again.\nIn a reciprocal humanitarian gesture, six Iranian Americans and one Iranian serving sentences or awaiting trial in the United States are being granted clemency. These individuals were not charged with terrorism or any violent offenses. They're civilians, and their release is a one-time gesture to Iran given the unique opportunity offered by this moment and the larger circumstances at play. And it reflects our willingness to engage with Iran to advance our mutual interests, even as we ensure the national security of the United States.\nSo nuclear deal implemented, American families reunited. The third piece of this work that we got done this weekend involved the United States and Iran resolving a financial dispute that dated back more than three decades. Since 1981, after our nations severed diplomatic relations, we've worked through a international tribunal to resolve various claims between our countries. The United States and Iran are now settling a longstanding Iranian Government claim against the United States Government. Iran will be returned its own funds, including appropriate interest, but much less than the amount Iran sought.\nFor the United States, this settlement could save us billions of dollars that could have been pursued by Iran. So there was no benefit to the United States in dragging this out. With the nuclear deal done, prisoners released, the time was right to resolve this dispute as well.\nOf course, even as we implement the nuclear deal and welcome our Americans home, we recognize that there remain profound differences between the United States and Iran. We remain steadfast in opposing Iran's destabilizing behavior elsewhere, including its threats against Israel and our Gulf partners and its support for violent proxies in places like Syria and Yemen. We still have sanctions on Iran for its violations on—of human rights, for its support of terrorism, and for its ballistic missile program. And we will continue to enforce these sanctions vigorously. Iran's recent missile test, for example, was a violation of its international obligations. And as a result, the United States is imposing sanctions on individuals and companies working to advance Iran's ballistic missile program. And we are going to remain vigilant about it. We're not going to waver in the defense of our security or that of our allies and partners.\nBut I do want to once again speak directly to the Iranian people. Yours is a great civilization, with a vibrant culture that has so much to contribute to the world: in commerce and in science and in arts. For decades, your Government's threats and actions to destabilize your region have isolated Iran from much of the world. And now our governments are talking with one another. Following the nuclear deal, you—especially young Iranians—have the opportunity to begin building new ties with the world. We have a rare chance to pursue a new path, a different, better future that delivers progress for both our peoples and the wider world. That's the opportunity before the Iranian people. We need to take advantage of that.\nAnd to my fellow Americans, today we're united in welcoming home sons and husbands and brothers who, in lonely prison cells, have endured an absolute nightmare. But they never gave in, and they never gave up. At long last, they can stand tall and breathe deep the fresh air of freedom.\nAs a nation, we face real challenges, around the world and here at home. Many of them will not be resolved quickly or easily. But today's progress—Americans coming home, an Iran that has rolled back its nuclear program and accepted unprecedented monitoring of that program—these things are a reminder of what we can achieve when we lead with strength and with wisdom, with courage and resolve and patience. America can do and has done big things when we work together. We can leave this world and make it safer and more secure for our children and our grandchildren for generations to come.\nSo I want to thank once again Secretary Kerry, our entire national security team, led by Susan Rice. I'm grateful for all the assistance that we received from our allies and partners. And I am hopeful that this signals the opportunity at least for Iran to work more cooperatively with nations around the world to advance their interests and the interests of people who are looking for peace and security for their families.\nThank you so much.

{"author": "Jeb Bush", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=112335", "text": "Every individual in this country has the right to rise. Yet today, the American Dream—the idea that anything is possible through hard work—is threatened by an education system failing to prepare the next generation of children for success.\nToo many low-income students start kindergarten already years behind their more affluent counterparts. Only one-third of students graduate high school prepared for college or a good career. And our higher education system has become too expensive for many Americans to afford.\nTo achieve equal opportunity and increased economic growth, we must provide every child the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in the increasingly competitive 21st century global economy.\nAs the nation honors Dr. Martin Luther King and his legacy today, I firmly believe that ensuring every individual has access to a quality education is the great civil rights challenge of our time.\nAchieving these goals doesn't require additional money or programs designed by Washington. That's why my plan is budget neutral and returns power to states, local school districts and parents. My plan requires a complete overhaul of a system from one that serves bureaucracies to one that serves the needs of families and students and is based on four conservative principles: 1) education decisions should be made as close to the student as possible; 2) choice of all kinds should be expanded; 3) transparency is essential to accountability; and 4) innovation requires flexibility.\nUnderstanding that many families invest in their children's education well before college, my plan allows for the conversion of 529 college savings accounts into Education Savings Accounts. These accounts would allow families and individuals to save tax-free for lifelong education, including for pre-K, elementary school, high school, college, job training, tutoring, summer school or online classes. We'll make charitable donations to the ESA's of low-income children tax-deductible.\nTo give low-income children a stronger start in life, we will consolidate the roughly $22 billion annual federal dollars spent through 44 disjointed programs, and allow states to deposit $2,500 annual scholarships in the ESA of every low-income child under five so their parents can choose the type of education services and care their children need to flourish.\nTo leverage the limited role of the federal government to improve all schools, we will take four main steps. First, we will dramatically expand choice by doubling support for charter schools; strengthening the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program; and making federal aid to low-income (Title I) and special needs students (IDEA) portable, so states can give scholarships directly to those students to attend the school of their choice.\nSecond, we will require states to ensure every citizen receives a complete picture of student achievement, system progress and finances in their schools. Parents, teachers and taxpayers need information to evaluate their schools because transparency yields better results.\nThird, we will empower states with the flexibility to improve their schools, while ensuring the federal government does not interfere in academic standards, curriculum or content. Right now, too many regulations drown the system in compliance costs, wasting valuable resources. We need to give states the flexibility to reform and innovate to meet the unique needs of their students.\nFourth, we will focus on teachers. We will give schools whose teachers achieve good results for low-income students more money, incentivizing and rewarding success. And, we will foster excellent teaching by helping states reward the best educators, recruit new talent and improve professional development.\nTo drive down college costs and ensure every student is getting value for the dollars invested in his or her education, we will also restructure our higher education system in four main ways.\nFirst, we will create state databases so every student can see the average unemployment rate, earnings, graduation rates and debt repayment rate of programs they are considering. We need students to be able to judge the cost and quality of programs so they can make better choices and hold schools accountable.\nSecond, we will give colleges and career training programs \"skin in the game,\" putting them on the hook for a portion of the federal funds their alumni are unable to repay.\nThis will incentivize them to reduce costs and ensure that students graduate with the skills needed to succeed.\nThird, we will expand access to innovative new providers based on their rates of student success. Innovation has the potential to transform higher education and dramatically increase access and drive down costs while giving students a wider variety of options that fit their needs and budgets.\nFinally, instead of the current burdensome federal loan system, we will give all high school graduates access to a $50,000 line of credit through their Educative Savings Account (ESA) to pay for college and career training. For every $10,000 spent, students would repay 1 percent of their income for 25 years. This ensures affordable repayment, removes risk of default and protects students during periods of unemployment, while the ESA structure gives students flexibility and the incentive to be cost-conscious.

Our national debt must be dealt with. ISIS is an evil that must be destroyed; otherwise thousands will continue to be murdered.

Millions of our citizens feel they have no chance and are trapped in generational poverty.\nOhio Gov. John Kasich stands out as the most capable candidate to deal with these enormous challenges. He was one of the architects of balancing federal budget in the 1990s, and led Ohio from an $8 billion deficit into a $2 billion surplus. Gov. Kasich is passionate about helping the most vulnerable Americans; his record of welfare reform, tax cuts for low-income Ohioans, and expanding treatment and housing to individuals with mental illness, show he is a man of compassion. As a member of the House Armed Services Committee for 18 years, Kasich made sure the military was prepared to defend the U.S. Throughout the 1980s, Kasich was a strong ally of President Reagan and his national security agenda, and understands \"Peace through Strength.\"\nI encourage all Iowans to thoroughly research each candidate and not base their vote on Twitter, political pundits or the media. In comparison to the other candidates, Kasich provides the most comprehensive record of fiscal discipline and plan to destroy ISIS.

Ted Cruz defended religious liberty in public schools, the workplace, and the church. Ted Cruz' resume is just as remarkable as his courage: Cruz does not simply choose the right side in the battles that matter: he leads the battle to victory.\nAs a United States Senator, Ted Cruz has led the fight against Planned Parenthood and Obamacare. He has defended marriage, opposed judicial activism, exposed Common Core, and worked to secure our border. He has eloquently defended our freedom of speech and 2nd Amendment rights.\nThe Washington cartel has betrayed the American people. Too many Republicans have abused the trust of conservatives. It is time for conservatives to claim our nation for liberty and to restore opportunity: as Ted Cruz says, to reignite the promise of America.\nTed Cruz embodies Eagle Forum's mission: \"to enable conservative and pro-family men and women to participate in the process of self-government and public policy making so that America will continue to be a land of individual liberty, respect for family integrity, public and private virtue, and private enterprise.\"\nTed Cruz is the Reaganesque leader our country needs in 2016. While establishment Republicans led the charge for amnesty and betrayed the trust of those who elected them, Ted Cruz fought to uphold the law and defend our borders. Ted Cruz has demonstrated steadfastness, character, and intelligence in Washington.\n50 years ago, during another strategic election, Phyllis Schlafly reminded America that ultimately, the people do not serve the government: government must serve the people.

{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116721", "text": "She's a progressive who gets things done.\nWant to know what it means to be a progressive who gets things done? Just look at what Hillary Clinton has done—and what she's fighting to do.\nHealth care has been the cause of Hillary's career.\nAs first lady of Arkansas, she worked to expand health care access to rural parts of the state. And as first lady of the United States, Hillary did something unprecedented: She helped lead the fight for health care reform—and when it didn't pass, she worked with Democrats and Republicans in Congress to create the Children's Health Insurance Program, which currently provides 8 million low-income kids with health care. She kept fighting as a U.S. senator, securing health care for 9/11 first responders and expanding access to care for the National Guard, Reservists, and their families.\nAnd she's not done. Hillary has a plan to make health care more affordable and get every American covered.\nIn 2010, Democrats finally achieved the health care reform they spent generations fighting for—and so far, 18 million Americans have gotten coverage, and millions more have received benefits like free preventive care and the promise that they'll never be denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition. We can't afford to tear it up and start over. That's why Hillary will defend the Affordable Care Act from Republicans who want to repeal or dismantle it (they've already tried 50 times). But she won't stop there—she also has a plan to lower out-of-pocket costs like co-pays and deductibles and make prescription drugs more affordable—and as president, she'll get it done.\nHillary has gotten one \"F\" in her life. It's from the NRA.\nThere's good reason for that: As senator, Hillary co-sponsored and voted for legislation to close the gun show loophole by requiring criminal background checks on all transactions taking place at events that sell firearms. Unlike Bernie Sanders, she voted against the dangerous immunity protections Congress provided gun dealers and manufacturers that prevent victims of gun violence from holding the gun industry accountable. And she co-sponsored and voted for legislation to extend and reinstate the assault weapons ban. Hillary has always stood up to the gun lobby—and that won't change as president.\nHillary has a plan to tackle the epidemic of gun violence in America—with or without Congress's help.\nHillary will fight to pass comprehensive background check legislation and to close the loopholes that help put guns in the wrong hands, including the gun show loophole and the loophole that let the Charleston shooter legally purchase a gun. She'll hold gun dealers and manufacturers accountable, repealing the gun industry's sweeping immunity from lawsuits. And she'll work to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers, other violent criminals, and the severely mentally ill.\nHillary has spent decades fighting to put higher education within reach for more people.\nMaking college affordable isn't just a campaign promise for Hillary—she's been working on it since her days as first lady of Arkansas. She helped found the Arkansas Single Parent Scholarship Fund, which has helped more than 38,000 people attend college. Then, as a U.S. senator, she introduced legislation to give students the option of income-based loan repayment. She also introduced a bill to make Pell Grants available year-round, so nontraditional students could afford to pursue their education during the summer months. And she co-sponsored legislation to help student borrowers refinance their loans.\nShe has a plan to make college affordable for every student who wants to attend (and for those who already attended).\nUnder Hillary's plan, students would never have to borrow money to pay for tuition to attend a four-year public college in their state. And the 25 million Americans with student debt will be able to refinance their loans at current rates—which could save borrowers thousands of dollars each.\nHillary has consistently voted for comprehensive immigration reform.\nHillary supported comprehensive immigration reform legislation every time it came up for a vote during her time as a U.S. senator. She co-sponsored the DREAM Act three times. As president, Hillary will fix our broken immigration system—with or without help from Congress.\nAs president, Hillary will finish the fight to ensure a fair and just immigration system.\nThat starts with comprehensive immigration reform once and for all, with a path to full and equal citizenship that treats every person with dignity. But if Congress refuses to act, she'll defend President Obama's executive actions that provide relief from deportation for DREAMers and their parents, and she'll do everything possible under the law to protect immigrant families, including a system for parents of DREAMers and others who have contributed to this country to make their case and be eligible for deferred action.\nHillary has been a lifelong champion for women and families.\nHillary has been fighting for women and girls since she graduated from law school: Instead of taking a job at a big law firm, she went to work at the Children's Defense Fund as an advocate for women and families. As first lady, she advocated for the Family and Medical Leave Act and worked to increase funding for child care. And as a U.S. senator from New York, she championed the Paycheck Fairness Act, co-sponsored the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, and fought for legislation to guarantee paid sick leave and paid parental leave for all federal employees.\nIt's time to recognize that equal pay, paid leave, and affordable child care are economic issues—not women's issues—once and for all.\nThat's why, at the Democratic debate in Charleston, South Carolina, Hillary said that closing the wage gap would be one of her earliest priorities as president. She'll also fight for paid family leave, because the United States is the only developed country in the world without guaranteed paid leave of any kind. And she'll make quality, affordable child care a reality for families across the country.", "timestamp": "2016-01-18", "title": "Press Release - Let's Get One Thing Straight: Hillary Clinton Has Been Fighting For Progressive Issues Her Entire Career"}

And she's taking on big corporations that move abroad on paper simply to avoid paying their fair share of U.S. taxes.\nBut this isn't the first time Hillary has gone up against corporate lobbying groups. Hillary has been battling powerful special interests for decades—and she has the scars to prove it.\n1993: As first lady, Hillary took on one of the toughest fights of her career: working to fix our broken health care system.\nShe was the driving force behind President Clinton's initiative to rein in health care costs and provide health care and financial security to American families.\nRight off the bat, health insurance companies launched a barrage of attack ads, spending $50 million against the bill. And the health care and pharmaceutical industries together spent a total of $100 million against the bill.\nRecognizing the threat to the status quo, a group called \"Citizens for a Sound Economy\"—bankrolled by the Koch brothers—led a smear campaign against the effort. They even sponsored an advertising plane and a tow truck carting around a wrecked bus with a sign that read \"This is Clinton Health Care—Beware of the Phony Express.\"\nBut Hillary refused to back down.\n1997: Big Tobacco and the Koch brothers went after Hillary's plan to expand children's health insurance—and they failed.\nAfter special interests blocked Hillary's health care reform effort, she worked with Republicans and Democrats in Congress to provide health care access to uninsured children.\nBut it didn't happen without a fight.\nDespite the opposition, Hillary worked tirelessly to help create the hugely successful Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). The program provides health insurance to 8 million kids and has helped cut the children's uninsured rate in half.\n2005: Hillary stood up to the gun lobby and voted against immunity for gun manufacturers.\nThe NRA has never been a fan of Hillary. In 2002, they called her \"one of the most strident advocates\" of gun restrictions and later warned their members that they'd need a filibuster-proof Senate majority to get pro-gun legislation past \"the likes\" of senators like Hillary.\nThe gun lobby quickly discovered what the health care industry had known for a decade: Hillary isn't easily intimidated.\nShe supported the Brady Bill, and she voted against legislation that shields gun manufacturers and dealers from legal accountability when they endanger Americans—a bill the NRA called \"the most significant piece of pro-gun legislation in 20 years.\"\nAnd the gun lobby has been attacking her ever since—but it hasn't stopped her fighting for commonsense gun laws. And Wayne LaPierre, CEO and executive vice president of the NRA, has taken notice.\n2006: Hillary fought to allow Medicare to negotiate for lower drug prices and make prescriptions more affordable.\nDespite opposition from the pharmaceutical and health insurance industries—two of the most powerful lobbying forces in Washington—Hillary fought to allow Medicare to negotiate for lower prescription drug prices.\nAnd she's still fighting to lower prescription drug costs today.\n2007: Hillary called on Wall Street to take responsibility for the housing crisis.\nAs a senator for New York, Hillary went to the NASDAQ and criticized Wall Street for their part in creating the foreclosure crisis, and she called on them to put a moratorium on foreclosures.\nHillary has always fought for families—even when doing the right thing invited attacks from powerful, well-funded lobbies. And that's what she'll do as president.", "timestamp": "2016-01-18", "title": "Press Release - In 1997, Hillary Took On the Koch Brothers and Won—and It Wasn't Her First Uphill Battle"}

She has the experience and leadership skills to be president.\n\"As president there would be no learning curve. She would be in full command of the geopolitical challenges facing our nation from day one. And given the concerns about global instability and terrorism we place a high value on this competence.\"\n2. She has the respect and admiration of Granite Staters.\n\"Granite State Democrats and independent voters, having seen and heard Clinton with their own eyes and ears, have rejected the decades of distortions peddled by her political opponents. We know the real Hillary Clinton, and we admire and respect her.\"\n3. She was a remarkable secretary of state.\n\"She is credited as the architect of the crippling sanctions against Iran that led to the recent nuclear deal. She brokered a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. She was on the front lines of the tragedies and triumphs of the Arab Spring, learning hard and valuable lessons. Henry Kissinger, President Richard Nixon's secretary of state, said she ?ran the State Department in the most effective way that I've ever seen.'\"\n4. She knows how to find common ground to get things done.\n\"When Clinton saw a chance to improve relations with Burma, she approached then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell because she knew of his admiration for Aung San Suu Kyi, the nation's embattled human rights leader. Together, Clinton and McConnell made progress opening up this country that had been closed to the United States for decades.\"\n5. When she gets knocked down, she gets right back up.\n\"As first lady she led the White House's effort to implement health care reform, and she took a beating as vested interests pushed back against ?Hillarycare.' But Clinton proved resilient. The defeat taught her valuable lessons and she put that knowledge to work in her husband's second term, working with Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy and Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch to pass the Children's Health Insurance Program, which insured millions of previously uninsured children.\"\n6. She has a bold and detailed vision for the future of our country.\n\"But unlike her opponent, Clinton's plans are not all centrally planned and run by the government. They are collaborations: college students work to help pay for their education; energy companies have incentives to change for the good while a safety net is built for displaced coal-state workers. In the spirit of John F. Kennedy, government leads the nation toward big goals and taps the aspiration and ingenuity of individuals and the private sector.

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111549", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:06 P.M. EST\nQ: The Patriots --\nMR. EARNEST: Well --\nQ: You must have lost a bet.\nMR. EARNEST: I did lose a bet to -- (laughter) -- resident Patriots fan here at the White House, Jen Friedman, and I had a little bet over the weekend, and it did not go my way. So I'll be sipping from this mug. I can tell you that the --\nQ: Thirsty?\nMR. EARNEST: I probably will be over the course of today.\nQ: It's deflated, I hear.\nMR. EARNEST: Exactly. It is.\nQ: -- dissing the Chiefs by using the Royals mug before? You could have had a Chiefs mug and it could all be different. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Maybe so. What I had planned, though, is that by using the Royals mug it was going to sort of confer some good luck on the Chiefs. But it didn't quite work out that way. But the Chiefs had a great year, and obviously they won 11 games in a row. And, Kevin, I think you and I even had the opportunity to talk about how the team would recover from a difficult loss early in the year.\nQ: We did.\nMR. EARNEST: And we discussed how it would be pretty revealing in terms of the character of the team, and a team that endured a string of losses at the beginning but then came back to win 11 in a row is I think testament to their character. But it's actually your team that ended up in the AFC championship game.\nQ: I'm very excited about that.\nMR. EARNEST: So it should be a fun weekend.\nSo now that we have the football pleasantries out of the way, we can get down to business, and we've got plenty of business to talk about.\nJosh, why don't you go ahead and get us started with some questions.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Quiet weekend for you?\nMR. EARNEST: I was going to say -- it was anything other than a traditional, quiet three-day weekend in Washington, D.C. But obviously it was a great weekend for the country and for the families of those who had been deprived of the company of their loved ones for far too long. And there obviously was a lot of work that went into the efforts that culminated this weekend, but also a lot of celebrating going on, too.\nQ: Well, I'm sure there will be some questions on Iran, but I want to start actually with immigration. If the Supreme Court rules in your favor later this year, on the immigration plan, how long would it take the White House to execute that plan to shield these people from deportation? And is there a plan in place to frontload that in the few remaining months that you'll have before this administration comes to an end?\nMR. EARNEST: Josh, I want to be careful about being respectful for the Supreme Court. Obviously, they're going to hear the arguments on both sides. We've got a lot of confidence in the legal arguments that we'll be making before the court. The kinds of executive actions that the President took a little over a year ago now to try to bring some much-needed reforms and greater accountability to our broken immigration system were clearly consistent with the precedent that was established by other Presidents, and clearly within the confines of his authority as President of the United States. That is certainly the -- that's the nature of the argument that will be presented to the Court.\nAnd it should be noted that there's one state, Texas, that's sort of leading the charge against these executive actions before the Supreme Court, but I'll note that there are 15 other states and the District of Columbia that have filed paperwork indicating they strongly support the implementation of these executive actions. And there are actually law enforcement officials inside the state of Texas that are hoping -- and have, again, communicated to the Court as well -- that are hoping that these executive actions will be able to go into force because it will make their communities inside the state of Texas safer.\nSo we've got a strong argument to make both in terms of the legal ground on which we're operating, but also in terms of the practical impact, positive impact that these executive actions will have on the security of communities all across the country, a positive impact on our economy, and obviously a positive impact on thousands of families inside the United States.\nQ: And given that all the Republican candidates are saying that they would tear this up as they came into office, are you comfortable, if this goes your way and you have a chance to execute this, asking these immigrants, who are here illegally, to come out of the shadows and identify themselves? I mean, aren't you asking them to really put themselves out on a limb, considering what could come next?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Josh, this was an argument that was made by some in advance of the President's -- the administration's decision to implement DACA. This is essentially -- that would allow DREAMers, those individuals who entered the United States as young children, and giving them a status -- has given them the ability to live out the kind of life that's in the best interest of the country.\nThe President announced these executive actions in an election year, in 2012. And there were some who suggested that there might not be a significant number of people who would sign up for this program because it could be reversed by a President who succeeded Barack Obama. And we've actually seen a pretty strong take-up rate when it comes to these DREAM Act protections that are extended, like I said, to individuals who entered the United States as children, essentially through no fault of their own.\nAnd so, again, it's hard to apply one case to the other, but the recent evidence that we can point to would indicate that there are a lot of people who would benefit from this decision who would take advantage of the benefits as soon as they possibly could. And the good news is that the benefits are not just going to be enjoyed by individuals who qualify, but also would be enjoyed by the broader country and by our economy. Like I said, there are law enforcement officials across the country who believe that the successful implementation of these executive actions would make their communities safer because it would focus law enforcement resources on felons and others who posed a threat to the community, and not on separating families. And there's been some academic work that's been done by the President's economic advisers that indicate the broader economic benefit for the country is pretty significant when you take a look at the impact it would have on economic growth over the course of 10 years.\nQ: And I wanted to ask you about the Democratic debate on Sunday. The President was a hot topic in South Carolina.\nMR. EARNEST: So I heard.\nQ: And Hillary Clinton, in particular, accusing Sanders of campaigning against the President and of not being sufficiently supportive of his agenda. Does the President at this point have any opinion or thoughts about which of the Democratic candidates is best positioned to carry on his agenda?\nMR. EARNEST: I wouldn't be surprised if the President does have an opinion about that. It's not one that he's communicated publicly because presumably it would have an impact on his decision about who he plans to support in the primary. But at this point, the President is not prepared to offer up an endorsement. But reading the coverage of the debate, I think it is apparent that there are -- that the Democratic candidates are pretty enthusiastic about the progress that the country has made under the leadership of President Obama. And I think each of them made pretty clear that, if given the opportunity to serve as President of the United States, they would look to build on the important progress that we've made. And that's obviously -- it certainly beats the alternative and it certainly is a testament to the amount of progress that we've made, and we're pleased to hear it.\nRoberta.\nQ: So if a Republican wins the White House, how will you ensure that the immigration action, should you be successful in the Supreme Court case, isn't turned off on January 21st? Is there some way to secure the longevity of that?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the most effective way for us to secure the longevity of these reforms is to actually have Congress pass legislation that would enact them. And there is strong support for that across the country, but strong opposition to that in the House Republican conference. That's unfortunate. But look, that is the difference -- this is why -- or at least one of the important reasons why we've often made the case that the President taking executive action does not absolve Congress of their responsibility to pass legislation. And this is one reason why -- that executive actions can be, in most cases, reversed by subsequent Presidents. Legislation that's passed is more enduring and requires another act of Congress in most cases to change it. So that's why we're going to continue to press Congress to take these important steps.\nBut what the President said in November of 2014 when he announced these actions is that he was only taking these actions and taking these steps because Congress had failed to act; that he would continue to push Congress to act even though he was taking these steps. And he also noted that if Congress were to pass legislation, that he was happy to have congressional legislation supersede the executive actions that he had taken.\nSo this ultimately is a reflection of a President who is determined to do everything he possibly can to try to fix our broken immigration system. But ultimately, we need to see Congress take some steps.\nQ: I wanted to ask you, with the CBO numbers out today -- CBO's view of the economy is pretty weak. Does the White House agree with that? And CBO said that the deficit is going to grow this year because of the permanent tax breaks cast late last year. And I'm wondering if the White House is worried that that uptick, combined with pressures from the election, political pressures, is going to make it harder to expand the EITC.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me say a couple of things about this. The first is that we will be releasing a budget of our own here in a couple of weeks that will lay out what we believe is an effective path forward for investing in the middle class, growing our economy, and doing so in a fiscally responsible way. And that ultimately is what -- that's consistent with the President's vision since he took office and it's also consistent with his record, because we've seen strong economic growth in job creation since the economic recovery took hold. We're in the midst of 70 consecutive months of job growth -- about 14 million private sector jobs. And that's an indication of a strong bounce back from the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.\nBut since the President took office, we've also succeeded in reducing the deficit by about 75 percent. That's important progress, too, and the President wants to build on all of that momentum, and he'll lay out in his budget proposal how exactly we can do that.\nLet's go to the birthday boy next. Jon, happy birthday.\nQ: Thank you very much. Appreciate it, Josh. On Sunday, we learned that the United States made a payment to the government of Iran of $1.7 billion. Was this tied to the deal that led to the freedom of the Americans that were being held in Iran?\nMR. EARNEST: Jon, this is actually the result of a long-running claims process that had been at The Hague. In 1979, there was obviously an Iranian revolution that abruptly severed relations between our two countries. And prior to that revolution, the U.S. government had entered into an agreement with the then-Iranian government to transfer about $400 million in military equipment to the Iranian government. Once the revolution took place, obviously that equipment was not transferred, but we also didn't return Iran's money either. So that money essentially was held in what could, I think -- essentially in an escrow account. And for more than 30 years now, the Iranians have been using this claims process at The Hague to try to recover that $400 million.\nThis resolution that we agreed to was to return the $400 million and also to pay about $1 billion in interest. Now, the reason that this ends up being a very good deal for taxpayers is that our exposure, when it came to paying interest, could have been much higher. The Iranians were actually seeking $7 billion to $8 billion in interest payments. And I think that's an indication of how the interests of taxpayers were very well served by reaching this settlement.\nQ: Okay, but as I understand it, the Department of State announced this payment of $1.7 billion to the government of Iran just before the plane carrying the freed Americans landed in Geneva. You're really telling me that this is an absolute coincidence that this payment just happened to coincide with the precise moment when the American prisoners were flying to freedom?\nMR. EARNEST: Jon, I think we've made pretty clear that this is not a coincidence. The fact is, these kinds of diplomatic opportunities --\nQ: So it was -- because Paul Ryan has suggested this was a ransom payment. You saw his statement.\nMR. EARNEST: He's wrong about that.\nQ: But you're saying that this is connected with the freedom of --\nMR. EARNEST: What I'm suggesting is that the successful resolution of our concerns about Iran's nuclear program created a series of diplomatic opportunities for the United States that we've capitalized on. And we used that opening and we used that deeper diplomatic engagement to secure the release of five American citizens who are being unjustly held inside of Iran. And we used that diplomatic opening to resolve a longstanding financial claim that the Iranians had against the United States in a way that ultimately saves U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars, potentially up to $6 billion or $7 billion. So this is exhibit A in the administration pursuing tough, principled diplomacy in a way that actually ends up making the American people safer and advancing the interests of the United States more effectively than military actions.\nQ: So let me ask you, now that this is the third time by my count that we've seen a situation where Americans who are being held are freed in exchange for something else -- we had five Taliban freed to get the release of Bowe Bergdahl; we had three convicted Cuban spies freed to get the release of Alan Gross; and now we have five Americans who, as you said, were illegally detained, improperly detained by the Iranian government, freed in exchange for seven who had been duly charged and convicted under American law. Doesn't this give an incentive for America's enemies to take Americans -- either kidnap or imprison Americans -- knowing full well that this administration has proved a willingness to give them something in return to get their release?\nMR. EARNEST: Let me just go back to one thing on Cuba. Alan Gross was released as a humanitarian gesture. The --\nQ: Coincided exactly with the release of three convicted Cuban spies.\nMR. EARNEST: In exchange for a U.S. intelligence asset that the Cuban government had been holding for quite some time. And so that was essentially a spy swap. And there had been one previous --\nQ: Alan Gross was a spy?\nMR. EARNEST: No, no, no, Alan Gross was not a spy. That's why he is --\nQ: You said it was a spy swap.\nMR. EARNEST: Let me finish.\nQ: Okay.\nMR. EARNEST: Alan Gross was released as a humanitarian gesture by the Cuban government. There was an additional U.S. intelligence asset that was held by the Cuban government. That individual was released in exchange for the three other individuals that you referred to. And there was also an exchange between the United States and Russia -- a spy swap -- that was engineered in 2010 or so, I believe, and that related to a case of individuals that had infiltrated the United States that were then uprooted by our counter-intelligence officials here.\nBut to go more directly to your question, Jon, the President believes strongly that pursuing diplomacy with the Iranians in a tough, principled way to secure the release of five Americans who are being unjustly detained inside of Iran is in our national security interest and clearly is in the interest of those individuals who had not had the opportunity to -- who had been separated from their families for years.\nAnd what we saw was that essentially was a humanitarian gesture that was offered up by the Iranians. We made a reciprocal humanitarian gesture by releasing seven individuals, six of whom were U.S. nationals, who had either been tried and convicted of nonviolent crimes -- essentially sanctions violations or violations of the trade embargo the United States has in place against Iran. Three of those people had been convicted. The other four were still awaiting trial. But ultimately, the President believes that this is a reflection of what can be accomplished when the United States pursues tough, principled diplomacy even with countries like Iran with whom we have significant and longstanding disagreements.\nChris.\nQ: Josh, the Senate Armed Services Committee is going to proceed with the confirmation hearing of Eric Fanning as Army Secretary. How confident is the President that the Senate will confirm his nomination?\nMR. EARNEST: Mr. Fanning certainly deserves confirmation. And we are confident that he will make a very positive presentation to the United States Senate for this job. He's somebody who is eminently qualified and has served his country with distinction. He is somebody who has a range of experience at the Pentagon, and somebody who is certainly in a good position to provide the kind of leadership at the United States Army that our men and women deserve.\nQ: If confirmed, Mr. Fanning will be the first openly gay person confirmed by the U.S. Senate as civilian head of a military department. Has the U.S. Senate given the White House assurances that sexual orientation will not be an issue during the confirmation process?\nMR. EARNEST: I can't speak to all of the conversations between the administration and individual members of the Senate. Mr. Fanning was nominated because the President believes that he is the best person to provide good leadership to our men and women in uniform in the United States Army. Given his experience, given his character, given his skills as a leader, the President believes that he is the best person for the job. And I think anybody in the United States Senate who's willing to take an impartial look and judge him solely on the merits will reach the same conclusion.\nToluse.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I want to try to re-ask Josh's question about the immigration ruling, about how quickly you can actually get work permits and get people out of the shadows if this ruling is in your favor. Is this something that can be done before the next election? Is the infrastructure already in place to start issuing these work permits and getting this program up and running, given the fact that the President only has a year left in office?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, Toluse, I want to be deferential of the Supreme Court. They have a role to play here, and so I certainly want to be respectful of that role. The administration believes strongly that the prompt implementation of these executive actions would have positive benefits for our economy, would have positive benefits for the security of communities across the country. So we're certainly interested in moving forward with implementing these executive actions as expeditiously as possible.\nBut the Supreme Court has a role to play here, and we're going to make a presentation to the Supreme Court about why we should be allowed to do that. And at this point, I'm just not in a position to provide you a lot of guidance about what would happen in the event of a positive outcome at the Supreme Court. But we certainly have a lot of confidence in our arguments, but ultimately we'll have to see how those arguments play out before I can give you a lot of detail about our ability to move forward.\nQ: I want to ask you about Flint, as well as the President is going to Detroit tomorrow. He signed a disaster declaration, I believe, or emergency declaration over the weekend. Does he plan to visit Flint on his trip to Detroit?\nMR. EARNEST: The President did, over the weekend, sign this emergency declaration that would allow the federal government to provide up to $5 million in assistance to state and local officials that are trying to manage that response. This comes on top of the assistance that the federal government has already provided in the form of both expertise and logistical support. And obviously the city of Flint and the citizens of Flint are going to be going through a very difficult time, and the U.S. government is determined to do what we can to support the state and local officials who are responsible for responding to this incident.\nSo let me tell you about a couple of things that we're doing. I can tell you that later today, the Department of Health and Human Services will designate an individual -- this woman's name is Dr. Nicole Lurie. She's Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. And she will be the lead federal appointee, the lead federal official to coordinate the federal response to this particular situation. Given the significant public health equities that are involved, it makes sense that somebody from HHS would play this role. And so she will be principally responsible for dealing with state and local officials and coordinating the assistance that can be provided by the federal government, not just by HHS but also federal agencies like the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the EPA, and others -- the United States Department of Agriculture -- that can provide some assistance here.\nI can also tell you that the Mayor of Flint, Karen Weaver, is visiting the White House today on a prescheduled trip. The U.S. Conference of Mayors is meeting in Washington this week, and there is a special session held at the White House for newly elected mayors. And I know that in advance of that group meeting with other newly elected mayors, Mayor Weaver had the opportunity to sit down today with Valerie Jarrett, the President's Senior Advisor, to discuss some of the challenges that the city is facing right now. And obviously, as a newly elected mayor, she's got a lot of responsibility that she's trying to juggle, and so we felt it was important for staff at the White House to have an opportunity to hear at some length the challenges that are facing the city.\nAnd I would expect before the end of the day that the President will have an opportunity to visit with Mayor Weaver, as well, while she's here. And again, it's an opportunity for the President to hear from the mayor of Flint on the significant challenges that are facing that city.\nGiven all that activity, I would not expect that the President will stop in Flint on his trip tomorrow. He's obviously got a full schedule where he'll spend some time talking about the tremendous economic recovery that the city of Detroit has made. And a lot of that economic strength and economic recovery was possible only because of some of the difficult decisions that this administration made early on to make the auto recovery possible and to reinvigorate the American manufacturing sector.\nQ: Over the weekend, during the debate, Hillary Clinton brought up race in relation to the Flint water crisis thing -- that essentially because it's a majority-black town, this issue was being ignored. Does the President share that view, that race played a role in this?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, at least I can tell you from the perspective of the Obama administration, based on what I've just told you about the FEMA response and the HHS leadership role, and the meetings that will take place at the White House today, I think this situation is anything but being ignored by the White House. I know there are questions that have been raised about the conduct of state and local officials in leading to this particular situation, but I'm quite limited in what I can say about that because the Department of Justice has indicated that there's an ongoing investigation into this matter.\nBut in terms of the response, this is obviously a response that is and should be led by state and local officials. But the federal government is mobilizing significant resources to support that ongoing effort.\nQ: One more, on Iran. You all put forward some ballistic missile-related sanctions over the weekend, and Iran's foreign ministry said today that they plan to continue their ballistic missile program, which they say is legal. I'm wondering if you have a reaction to that, or if there are any other tools that you have at your disposal to try to deter Iran from moving forward with their ballistic missile program.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Toluse, I think what you're asking actually is a good way for us to talk about one other aspect of the history that was made over the course of the weekend. Over the weekend, the IAEA was able to confirm that Iran had taken the steps to curtail their nuclear program, consistent with the international agreement to prevent them from obtaining a nuclear weapon. And they had to take a number of steps that included essentially dismantling two-thirds of the installed centrifuge capacity that they previously had. They reduced their enriched uranium stockpile by 98 percent. They essentially dismantled and rendered harmless the core of their heavy-water reactor at Arak. They shipped out a significant quantity of heavy water outside of the country to come into compliance with the standards of the agreement.\nAnd we also saw Iran do something that they had never done before, which is to agree to and begin to cooperate with a set of unprecedented transparency and verification measures into their nuclear program. And we will now have continuous monitoring of all of Iran's declared nuclear facilities. This will include a range of measures, including technology seals to ensure that they continue to abide by the commitments that they made in the agreement.\nThis inspection and verification regime will also allow the international community to have insight and access to Iran's entire nuclear supply chain. This means that there will be ongoing inspections and monitoring of Iran's uranium mines and uranium mills and of the facilities that are critical to their nuclear program. And all along, we'll be able to confirm that their nuclear activities are solely for peaceful purposes.\nMind you, these are all things that could not have been accomplished if we had pursued the strategy that was advocated by some to carry out a military strike. We would not have been successful in setting back Iran's nuclear program so far if we'd carried out a nuclear strike. We would not have preserved the international unanimity of opinion about the best way to prevent them from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and we certainly wouldn't be in a position to monitor their ongoing nuclear activities. If anything, it would have been much harder to preserve international unanimity on this issue and it would have been much harder for us to gain insight into what exactly Iran's nuclear program was doing. And, again, I think this is another example of the success of principled diplomacy.\nSo this is why we believe that we can continue to advance the interests of the United States, whether that is preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, securing the release of innocent Americans being held against their will overseas, or resolving longstanding financial claims at The Hague, all through tough, principled diplomacy, even with a country with whom we have significant concerns. And the fact that the United States imposed sanctions on Iran for their ballistic missile program is an indication that we're quite serious about continuing to hold Iran accountable for their nefarious activities.\nAnd, look, I understand the claims that are made by the Iranians that what they're doing is not in violation of international law, but the fact is, you had the United Nations Security Council come out and express concerns about these kinds of activities. So it's clear that the international community continues to have concerns with Iran's ballistic missile program, and I think the one thing we can all agree on is it sure is a good thing they don't have access to a nuclear weapon.\nKevin.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. Did you have an opportunity to talk to the President about the Levinson family's disappointment, great disappointment, that he was not part of the number of Americans who have recently been freed? And if so, what is his position with regard to notification, with regard to maybe making more inroads to bring that man home?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the Levinson family. The ordeal that they have been through over the last almost nine years now is virtually unthinkable. To imagine how difficult the situation must be for them is hard to do. And this administration has repeatedly, over the years, pressed the Iranians to be more forthcoming and to provide information about his whereabouts. And one of the things that was actually secured in this agreement was a specific commitment from the Iranians to help us locate Mr. Levinson.\nNow, as we mentioned several years ago, we have reason to believe that he no longer is in Iran, and that's why we continue to press for information about his whereabouts. And we're going to continue to do that, and we've secured a commitment from the Iranians to use the channel that has now been opened to secure the release of those individuals that we know were being held by Iran on unjustly to use those same channels to try to gather information about Mr. Levinson's possible whereabouts. And we're going to continue to make that a priority moving forward. And I recognize, and I readily acknowledge, that that does not address the significant pain that's being sustained by the Levinson family right now. And there's no denying the fact that they've been separated from their loved one, and deeply concerned about his safety and health and wellbeing is something that we all feel. But we certainly don't feel it as deeply as those who know and love Bob Levinson.\nQ: If I'm correct then, you're confident that he is alive, and I'm getting that distinction because you said we believe he's no longer in Iran. So you do believe or you do know that he is still alive?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have an updated assessment of that. I know that there was some publicity in the last couple of years where whoever was holding Mr. Levinson put out a so-called proof-of-life evidence. I don't have an updated assessment to share with you. What we are determined to do, though, is to press the Iranians to provide as much information as they have about Mr. Levinson's whereabouts. And we're going to continue to do that through the channel that has been opened.\nQ: Is there a liaison or a contact person within the administration that could reach out to the Levinsons? I guess I'm sensitive to the notion, in listening to some of the comments recently from the family, that they didn't know that he was going to be part of this group. I was under the impression that there was someone who might, from the administration, be able to reach out to them in advance, or at least to maintain some level of communication. And it doesn't look like that happened in this case.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, there actually has been extensive communication on the part of the administration to the Levinson family. And over the weekend, there were senior officials here in the administration that were in touch with the Levinson family. They were last --\nQ: This was before everyone knew about the release?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as I think all of you knew who were following the news on Saturday morning, that there was an announcement that was made by the semi-official news agency in Iran that was not coordinated with the United States. And we obviously were treating this information quite sensitively until we knew we could secure the safe return of our citizens who were still in Iran at the time.\nSo this was a delicate situation, but it is important for people to understand that the administration has been in touch with the Levinson family; we were over the weekend. The Levinson family last received an update on our efforts shortly before Christmas in another conversation they had with senior administration officials. Over the course of this process, the President himself has on at least one occasion had the opportunity to be in touch directly with the Levinson family. And they are part of the hostage recovery task force that the President formed over the summer to improve the way that information is provided to the families of those who are being held hostage overseas.\nSo we're obviously very sensitive to the concerns and rather raw feelings of the Levinson family. I think the feelings that are on display are, I think, feelings that no one can really relate to unless you've gone through something like that. But I think we can all imagine, just in our mind's eye, what that must be like and how painful that must be. And we certainly are very sensitive to that.\nQ: Just one more on the Iran deal. The windfall -- people have made a great deal about the money. Is there great concern from the President that, now flushed with cash, that the regime will not only do what they've made a habit of doing, which is sort of using their resources to cause problems all over the world, but is there greater concern now that they have more money that they'll be emboldened to take an even larger role in the region?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, the thing that we do know about their economy is that it has suffered significant negative consequences as a result of the sanctions that were put in place. After all, that's why we know that Iran came to the negotiating table was because of their desire to get out from under these very tough international sanctions. And it has meant that there is a lot of rebuilding of their economy that they need to -- their infrastructures projects that they need to undertake. There are also large bills that have remained unpaid that also are coming due.\nSo the kinds of financial benefits that Iran will reap from this deal have been exaggerated by critics of the deal. But we would acknowledge that they will have access to more resources. And we would expect that they're likely to use at least some of those resources for some of the kinds of malign activities that they've been involved with for quite some time. And that is why over the last couple of years, you've seen the President lead the effort to try to deepen our security cooperation with our friends and partners and allies in the region.\nThere's an ongoing process right now with Israel to deepen and lengthen the memorandum of understanding that governs the military-to-military relationship between the United States and Israel. There potentially is, in the context of negotiating that agreement, additional military assistance that could be provided to our Israeli allies by the United States. The President convened a meeting at Camp David with our GCC partners to discuss how the United States and our Gulf partners could more effectively coordinate our security efforts. And some of that includes countering some of Iran's destabilizing activities in the region. And the President is certainly committed to that effort, as well.\nBut overall, our top objective here had been to shut down every pathway that Iran has to building a nuclear weapon, precisely because of their support for terrorism, precisely because of their destabilizing activities in the region, precisely because of their missile program, precisely because of their willingness to threaten Israel. And that objective has been accomplished in a way that has been far more effective than some of the alternative strategies that have been advocated by our critics.\nQ: I don't know if you saw this last thing. A federal judge rejecting the President's assertion of executive privilege to deny Congress access to records pertaining to Operation Fast and Furious. Did you hear about that before coming out? And if so, do you have any reaction?\nMR. EARNEST: I didn't hear about that ruling before I came out here, but we'll have somebody follow up with you on that.\nRon.\nQ: On the tribunal and the Iranians, is it true that there were some 4,700 claims made by the U.S. for a total of about $2.5 billion, and that all of the Americans' claims have been settled?\nMR. EARNEST: It is true that there are 4,200 claims through this claims process at The Hague that have been made by U.S. citizens or U.S. businesses. And many of those claims have been settled to the tune of $2.5 billion that was paid out by the Iranians to these American nationals or to these American companies.\nAs it relates to this debt, I don't know to what extent there are ongoing claims, but I think it is indicative of how the claims process has been able to make some American businesses and American nationals whole. And again, it also reflects sort of how this established channel -- a separate channel than the nuclear channel, a separate channel than the one that led to the release of our American citizens but one that nonetheless yielded significant economic benefits for American taxpayers, because we potentially saved billions of dollars by resolving the claims in the way that we've described.\nQ: Was any of that money used to settle claims on behalf of the Americans who were taken hostage in the first place back in the 1970s? Or the families?\nMR. EARNEST: My understanding is that these kinds of claims are actually different. These kinds of claims relate to contractual obligations and other agreements that were ruptured in the context of the Iranian revolution in 1979. So this is a process that was actually established right around that time -- I believe it was 1981 -- by the -- that was sort of set up -- negotiated by the Carter administration and then eventually set up by the Reagan administration; both administrations were involved.\nQ: The Obama administration ever bring up this issue of compensation to the families or to the individuals who were taken hostage back in 1979?\nMR. EARNEST: That was separate from these discussions. My understanding is the way that these claims could be resolved is that, according to the statute, as long as these claims are resolved in a way that is favorable to U.S. taxpayers -- and clearly it is, we saved billions of dollars here based on what the Iranians have been asking for -- that this fulfills all of our obligations under the statute.\nQ: And so it sounds like this issue of compensation for the 50 hostages or so was not an issue and it's a closed issue?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't know about that. I can't speak to any of the claims that are made by those who have been the victim of terrorism that was sponsored by the Iranian government or held hostage by the Iranians. I can't speak to any of those claims. But my understanding is simply that these claims that were settled at The Hague were different from those.\nQ: And on Flint, you said that the federal government has done a lot, so much in their meetings at the White House, so on and so forth. But as you know, the mayor is asking and the governor are asking for a significant amount more money than the $5 million through the emergency declaration, and asking for a disaster declaration, which would be about $100 million. So what do you say to them? Because it doesn't seem like even close to what they say they need.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, just to be clear about what the law will allow here, a disaster declaration is essentially something that FEMA offers routinely to state and local governments who have sustained a natural catastrophe or a fire, flood, or explosion. And none of those events has occurred in Flint. So by statute, it's going to be difficult to grant that request for a major disaster declaration. There is an opportunity for the governor to appeal that ruling, and I'll leave it up to him to decide whether or not they're going to do that. And there's a regular process for considering those kinds of appeals.\nSo what we have, however, done is granted their request for an emergency declaration that will allow us to provide some resources as they work to recover from this situation. And there are resources that can be mobilized by USDA, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the EPA, obviously, and HHS, obviously, to assist the state and the city in weathering this rather challenging situation.\nQ: Knowing this gap -- and I don't mean to sound flip, but that sounds like what an insurance company says to somebody who is claiming the flood in their basement or something -- is the administration proactively trying to marshal more resources because you're well aware that there is like a $90 million or so gap between what they're saying they need and what you've been able to provide so far? So is there a proactive process going on to fill that gap?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Ron, certainly this is a situation that we take seriously. And I don't mean to sound flip about it, even in response, but the U.S. government also has an obligation to our taxpayers to make sure that funds are being spent consistent with the statute and with the law.\nBut as it relates to what we can mobilize to support them, there certainly is a lot of expertise and resources that we can make available through existing programs. And so let me give you a couple of examples. The USDA, for example, has waived requirements on potable tap water availability at school meal service, instead allowing schools to provide bottled water. The WIC program -- this is the Women, Infants, and Children program -- is allowing participants to use WIC vouchers for ready-to-feed infant formula, which does not need to be mixed with water. And they're also allowing participants to swap the powdered formula that does require water for the ready-to-feed formula. So that's sort of one example of how a federal program can be leveraged to try to meet the needs of the people in Flint.\nQ: Just one more on the EPA's role in all this. The critical issue seems to be when the water system was switched to the river system. Is that something that the EPA would have had to sign off on? And are they -- what exactly is their -- is the administration satisfied that the EPA did everything that they should have been doing in this process? Or is that also the focus of some of the investigation?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't want to get into sort of dissecting the entire relationship between the state of Michigan and the EPA, primarily because this is a subject of ongoing discussion and investigation by the Department of Justice. So I don't want to sort of get too far into the middle of that.\nBut there surely is a role for the EPA to play to assist in the response effort, and there is expertise that the EPA can bring in terms of testing the water and the system, of conducting an audit of the system to determine which parts of it are safe and what can be done to make the system more safe. Obviously, this kind of scientific expertise can be valuable as they respond to the situation there in Michigan. And that certainly is an important role the EPA will play.\nQ: That covers the response. But what about the process? Was there an EPA sign-off required for them to switch their water system?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know if any sort of requirement like that was in place. You can check with EPA, who may be able to tell you a little bit more about their system for working with state officials in these kinds of matters.\nQ: And lastly, just to follow up on another question about that. Hillary Clinton the other night framed this as a civil rights issue. And the DOJ is involved in this. Is that what they are looking at, whether this is a civil rights violation in some manner, as well as other violations that may have happened during the course of the decision making?\nMR. EARNEST: My understanding is that this is actually a pretty specific inquiry into the circumstances that led to this situation that is now plaguing the people of Flint. So you'd have to ask the Department of Justice whether or not that would include a consideration of the civil rights of the citizens of Flint being violated.\nByron.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. The Supreme Court is asking attorneys on both sides in the immigration case to argue a point about whether the President is violating his constitutional duty to \"take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\" Our Supreme Court reporter says it's rather unprecedented this this question is being litigated in the context of an executive power fight. Is the White House worried that the Court might rebuke the administration's aggressive use of executive actions? Or are you worried about anything else that this question portends?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Byron, I think the case that we will make is that these kinds of decisions about enforcement are well within the authority of the executive branch. After all, these are the kinds of enforcement decisions that were also made by President Reagan and President H.W. Bush in the context of the Family Fairness program.\nThis is essentially a program that provided temporary relief and work authorization for up to 1.5 million people. So this is way that the authority was exercised by President Reagan and the first President Bush. And it's entirely consistent with the way that President Obama has exercised his administration's authority in this matter.\nThat is a case that we've been making since the day that we announced these executive actions. There probably is a more technical legal argument that will be presented before the court, and I'll give our attorneys the opportunity to make that argument. But just as a matter of common sense, and by consulting recent presidential history, we feel confident that there is a strong precedent that exists for this executive action.\nQ: Can you give us the general philosophy behind the President's approach to immigration? On one hand you have the administration offering to deportation relief -- that's at the center of the controversy that's in front of Court. On the other hand, you've moved pretty aggressively to deport some Central Americans who were here. Again, these are different groups and they're different circumstances, but what's the overall coherence or approach to the administration's philosophy about who gets to stay and who has to go?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there are a couple different ways to answer that question. I know it's gets repetitive, but it bears repeating.\nIf we really want to solve the challenges of what is so obviously a broken immigration system, we need congressional legislation. That's the most impactful comprehensive way for us to do the common-sense thing. And that's why the President has pushed so hard for Congress to take that action. And it continues to be a source of disappointment that House Republicans blocked a common-sense proposal to do that.\nSo separate from the question about legislation, our approach has been to use as much of the President's authority, consistent with the law, to try to fix as many of the problems in that system as we can. And one thing that we -- so one fact about the system is that because our system is broken, there are potentially millions of people inside the United States who have been in the country for years and are otherwise making a positive contribution to their community. And they have -- they attend -- they send their kids to school alongside American children. They attend religious services alongside other Americans. They work in factories and other facilities alongside other Americans. These are, in many cases, upstanding members of communities all across the country.\nAnd those are the individuals whose cases we believe need to be resolved consistent with our interests as a nation. And the President does not believe that it's in our interest nor is it consistent with our values to go and tear those families apart.\nWhat he actually does believe is in our national interest is that we need to bring some greater accountability to our broken immigration system and allow them to come out of the shadows, and allow them to be in a situation where they are paying taxes, where they are undergoing a background check, where they are learning English. That's the nature of the President's actions.\nAnd that's what we're trying to achieve. And there are significant public safety, national security, and economic benefits associated with this action. We have always said that we need to do more to secure the border. That's why the legislation that was defeated or blocked by House Republicans included an historic investment in border security. It's also why we have said that people who have only recently crossed the border wouldn't be prioritized or eligible for this kind of relief. And we certainly don't want to set up a system that provides an incentive for individuals to flee violence in other countries and take a dangerous journey in their own right to try to come to the United States. And that's why we've worked with the United Nations to establish this separate process that would allow individuals in Guatemala and El Salvador and Honduras to petition the U.S. government consistent with a routinized process to get some humanitarian relief. And they can do that without putting themselves in the hands of a human trafficker or otherwise taking a journey that has victimized too many innocent people.\nQ: One more. You had the head of a prominent immigration rights group call the President the \"Deporter in Chief.\" On the other hand, you have Republicans saying the President is handing out amnesty, wants amnesty. These are rather different interpretations for actions by this administration. What do you think the President's legacy on this issue will be, and how would you sum it up?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think ultimately it will be historians who have the opportunity to do that. I think historians will note that Republicans blocked a common-sense compromise proposal that this administration helped to craft in the United States Senate. And I think ultimately a lot of historians will say that, despite making this a top priority, the President was not able to do as much as he would have liked to have done to fix our broken immigration system. And one of the things that we certainly want to do is, in the face of congressional inaction, try to lay out a path to solve at least some of these problems. And our proposed solution is one that we're going to aggressively defend before the courts.\nMichelle.\nQ: Hillary Clinton laid out the federal response to the situation, but obviously you know that there's this huge emotional reaction around the country and even beyond that it was something that potentially has lifelong effects and there's race and socioeconomics wrapped up in that. So we haven't really heard from the President on this. We've heard pretty forcefully from Secretary Clinton. Does he share that sense of outrage? Or what is the President's feeling on this that this could even happen today? And he is going to be in Detroit talking about progress in that city, where very nearby this other city hasn't experienced that, but then had this outrage heaped upon them. I don't know how you could really call it something else. What does the President think of that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President is quite concerned about the impact that the situation is having on the tens of thousands of citizens of the city of Flint. One thing it underscores is the importance of having good environmental laws on the books. I know Republicans often like to describe these as job-killing regulations. But as you point out, Michelle, the failure to properly enforce them, or what appears to be a situation in which they were not properly enforced, has grave consequences for the day-to-day lives of thousands of innocent Americans.\nSo these kinds of rules are important to our health and safety and to the wellbeing of our kids and the next generation of Americans. And the President feels strongly about that. And I don't know when the President will next have the opportunity to talk about it, but it certainly is part of what he feels about this.\nQ: Is he disturbed by the fact that this had been going on for such a long time?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think it's -- again, I don't want to get too far into this because there's an ongoing Department of Justice investigation. I can tell you that the President is determined to make sure that available resources within the administration can be used to support the state and local officials that are responding to the situation.\nQ: Okay. And in other reaction news, we heard from Secretary Kerry yesterday talking about when the U.S. sailors were released by Iran. And looking at that video, I mean, he described it as feeling extremely upset, frustrated, and even angry when he saw that. But around the same time that it was happening, what we generally heard from the administration was everything is working out fine and everybody cooperated and it was great. And there just seems to be a disconnect in the way the Secretary viewed that situation versus how it was described early on. So does the President share Secretary Kerry's initial assessment of how that video was shot and used?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I haven't spoken to the President about the video. What I can tell you is the reaction of this administration was consistent with our strategy of securing the safe and prompt release of our sailors. And there was a lot of second-guessing from our critics, some who have suggested that the full faith and -- or the full fury and anger of the United States should be felt by those who took the sailors into custody. Others suggested that the President should somehow postpone the State of the Union address.\nWell, the fact is, none of that would have guaranteed the release of our sailors within 14 or 15 hours of originally going into custody. Those kinds of rash, provocative reactions would have only made the situation worse and only would have made it harder for us to secure the safe return of our sailors, to say nothing of the implementation of the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon; to say nothing of the safe return of the five Americans who had been unjustly detained in Iran; and to say nothing of the resolution of some financial claims that were made by the Iranians that actually is going to allow the American taxpayers to save $6 or $7 billion.\nQ: So the outcome, obviously, was what everybody wanted. But do you not see the way the Iranians handled this as provocative and exploitive?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, what is clear is that because of diplomacy, the United States government was able to secure promptly the return of our sailors who had been taken into custody. And those are just the facts. That is an approach that I think has served the American people and our national security quite well. That has not prevented our critics from making rash claims about the President's weakness, but I actually think that the President's willingness to absorb those claims and pursue tough, principled diplomacy is probably the strongest endorsement of his strength and toughness that you could look for.\nQ: Okay. And lastly, on Levinson. Over the weekend, it was talked about by the administration that there was progress. Do you see that progress as meaning primarily that the communication is open? Or do you have some other indication that either Iran knows his whereabouts? I guess another way of asking would be, what is your confidence level that Iran can actually still be helpful in this situation?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what we have secured as a result of this agreement is a commitment on the part of the Iranians to use the diplomatic channel that's been opened to continue to engage with the United States about the whereabouts of Mr. Levinson. And we're going to hold the Iranians to that commitment, and we're going to continue to make it a priority to try to determine his whereabouts and bring him home. And we're going to be focused on that moving forward.\nAnd, look, there are some indications that Mr. Levinson may no longer be in Iran, and that may raise questions about what Iran can do to actually bring him home. But what we're looking for right now is information about his whereabouts. And we're going to press the Iranians on that accordingly as a result of this agreement.\nQ: Do you feel that they are using him as leverage?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think it's hard to arrive at that conclusion until we have more information about his whereabouts. And we're going to continue to press the Iranians for more information about his whereabouts.\nScott.\nQ: I'm going to try again on CBO. A week ago, the President was boasting about bringing the deficit down by three-quarters. Now CBO says that trend is turning around, largely because of the decisions that Congress made, the President signed off on to raise the spending caps and extend the tax breaks. Does the White House see that as a problem?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Scott, just as a factual matter, the consequences for the tax policy decisions and not paying for those tax breaks has far bigger fiscal consequences than the spending decisions that are incorporated into that budget agreement. The President would have preferred that Congress do the responsible thing and only enact those tax cuts and paying for them by closing loopholes that only benefit the wealthy and well-connected.\nThat is a case that we have made on a number of occasions. That would have been not just the fairer thing to do, it would have been better for the economy. It also would have improved the fiscal situation of the country.\nBut, look, these kinds of agreements are a compromise, and we said that even as the President was signing the legislation. What the President, though, moving forward, Scott, will lay out is a budget proposal that properly invests in our national security priorities and in our economic priorities, particularly when it comes to expanding economic opportunity for the middle class, but doing so in a fiscally responsible way. And everybody will have an opportunity to evaluate the strategy that the President puts forward, and it certainly will be consistent with our goal of keeping our deficits under the 3 percent threshold that would allow us to stabilize our debt as a percentage of GDP.\nQ: So will the President's budget show continued decline in the deficit as a percentage of GDP?\nMR. EARNEST: Stay tuned.\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, obviously the families of the Americans released are happy to have their loved ones home. But coinciding with the billion-dollar payment, coinciding with the nuclear deal, what do you say to those even within your own administration who worry that this puts a price on the head of every American?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we've made clear that this is a one-time proposition. Obviously the circumstances, as you just laid them out, are quite unique. And what the President did was he used tough, principled diplomacy to bring our citizens home. And if there are those -- if our critics disagree with that, then they should have the courage to stand up and say so, and say it would be better for the United States for those individuals, those innocent Americans, to remain in an Iranian prison. If that's what they believe, they should have the courage of their convictions to say so.\nQ: What is the administration's view here on hostage policy and prisoner policy? I mean, it appears that this swap is different from those in the past, and it also appears that that was the case with Cuba. I mean, in both cases, Iran and Cuba, this was not prisoner for prisoner alone; it coincided with a much bigger policy shift and change. So it appears that there is a policy link between taking Americans hostage, or prisoner, and it leading to some other kind of inroad with the administration to pursue other things.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me try to explain to you how we see it. I think there is a connection generally. Each of these situations is so different. But I think there is one of general thing that you can draw from this, which is the President believes that there are a variety of benefits associated with engaging with countries around the world, even those with whom we vigorously disagree. And by more deeply engaging with those countries, we don't give them a free pass. We certainly continue to, as we've mentioned earlier, institute sanctions against Iran for their continued development of their ballistic missile program.\nWhen it comes to Cuba, you continue to hear the administration be quite harshly critical of the human rights conditions inside that country. But deeper engagement with those two countries has allowed the United States to advance our interests, including securing the release of innocent Americans who are being unjustly held in those two countries. That is a pretty strong endorsement of tough, principled, diplomatic engagement. And that's what we're pursuing.\nNow, the other thing is, in each case, we've also derived other benefits. Of the Iranians, we've succeeded in building an international coalition to shut down every pathway they have to a nuclear weapon. We resolved a longstanding financial claim that put taxpayers on the hook for potentially billions of dollars, according to claims that the Iranians themselves had made.\nWhen it comes to Cuba, what we have actually succeeded in doing is transforming the relationship between the United States and countries throughout the Western Hemisphere. No longer is our effort to isolate Cuba an impediment to our ability to form deep and important relationships with countries throughout the Western Hemisphere. Those strengthened relationships doesn't just benefit the United States, it also has the added benefit of getting people to focus less on the relationship between Cuban and the United States, but rather on the relationship between the Cuban government and the Cuban people, and to focus more attention and more pressure on the Cuban government to do a better job of protecting the basic human rights of the Cuban people.\nQ: So it sounds like you're saying the administration thinks it got more than it gave in both cases.\nMR. EARNEST: We surely believe that -- that the result of this diplomacy, particularly when it comes to just focusing on Iran here, the United States accomplished significant objectives that, again, even our allies, some of whom are critical of this agreement, have long identified preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon as a top national security priority. And you'll recall, when the President took office in 2009, Iran was accelerating their nuclear program in the direction of developing a nuclear weapon. And the international community was at a loss with how to deal with it.\nSince that time, President Obama has stood up, organized the international community to impose these tough sanctions on Iran, compelled Iran to come to the negotiating table. And what we've seen Iran do now is follow through on commitments that they made at that negotiating table to essentially assure us that they don't have a path to developing a nuclear weapon. That is remarkable progress in the space of just less than seven years, and represent a significant advancement in the national security interests of the United States.\nQ: But you could also look at it and say, look, these secret talks only began in the first place because Iran took three hikers hostage many years ago, and then that led to the path of diplomacy, and then this coincides in finality with another prisoner swap. I mean, some look at that and say Iran has made a successful business of taking hostages and prisoners, and the United States responded by brokering this deal.\nMR. EARNEST: I actually think this started when the President stood on the steps of the United States Capitol on January 20th, 2009 and said that if Iran is prepared to engage in conversations with the United States and to do so peacefully in an effort to try to achieve our collective goals, that the United States would engage. And that was a controversial notion at the time. When the President was talking about this on the campaign trail, he was criticized for it. But the President believes strongly that this is the best way to advance the interests of the United States. And I think if you take a look at the results seven years later, it's pretty difficult to say that he was wrong.\nNadia.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. Two questions on Iraq. The U.N. just issued a report -- I don't know if you've had a chance to look at it or not -- but it has staggering statistics of 19,000 civilians dead between January 2014 and October 2015; 36,000 wounded; almost 3 million displaced. Now, the President described ISIS -- most of them are committed by ISIS. The President described them as a bunch of killers with good social media tools. And this report is saying that basically these crimes could be crimes against humanity, and possibly they could be charged with genocide. How do you square these two --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what you -- the President has been unsparing in describing the horrific tactics and actions of ISIL. And, again, there is a reason that the President has stepped forward and built an international coalition of 65 nations to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. There's a reason that our coalition has taken some 9,000 airstrikes -- 9,500 airstrikes against ISIL targets in Iraq and in Syria. And we are very focused on implementing a coordinated, integrated strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy that terrorist organization.\nThe reason -- the thing that prompted U.S. involvement in this matter in the first place was the willingness of ISIL figures to carry out atrocities against innocent Iraqi citizens. You'll recall that in August of 2014, the first airstrikes that were carried out by the United States against ISIL targets included strikes against ISIL figures that were preparing to slaughter innocent Yazidis at Mount Sinjar. So the President has led the effort against ISIL in no small part because he is quite concerned about the kind of violence that they've perpetrated on innocent people throughout the region.\nQ: -- his critics, Josh, I know you know that very well, they criticize the President as not taking them seriously.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, and I think -- I recognize that that is something that our critics regularly say, but it flies in the face of all of the facts about what we have done to degrade and ultimately destroy that terrorist organization. The amount of territory that they control inside of Iraq has been significantly reduced. We've also made progress in driving them out of some populated areas in Syria.\nJust to give you sort of the most recent example, the Department of Defense has recently released footage of millions of dollars held by ISIL being destroyed in an airstrike. We've talked in here about how critically important it is for us to shut down ISIL's financing, because they're not just trying to organize terrorist acts around the world; they're also trying to occupy and govern land. And so if we can shut off their financing, we can choke off the lifeblood of that organization. And strikes like the one the Department of Defense announced over the weekend I think are a good indication of how we are integrating our counter-financing efforts with our military efforts. And we're making important progress.\nWe also are going to continue to be mindful of the homeland security threat that ISIL poses. And over the holidays, the last couple of weeks in December, the United States and our coalition partners carried out airstrikes that resulted in the death of 10 ISIL figures, including at least one that had connections to the network that carried out the terrorist attacks in Paris and included others who were helping to support efforts to plan attacks in other places, too.\nSo even as we're mindful of the terrible atrocities that are committed by ISIL in Iraq and in Syria, we're also mindful of the threat that they pose to innocent human beings outside of that region of the world. And, again, I think the President's bold action when it comes to leading a coalition to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL is indicative of how serious he understands this threat is.\nQ: One more on Iraq. Any update on the missing Americans -- three of them -- and it all falls into the criticism by the Republicans that basically any prisoner exchange will encourage other groups, militias or whatever, to kidnap more Americans.\nMR. EARNEST: Nadia, I've seen those reports but there's very little that I can say about these reports at this point. I can tell you that U.S. officials have been in touch with Iraqi officials about those reports, but there's not much more that I can say about the situation beyond that.\nJared.\nQ: Josh, on Iran and leverage. You've been asked a couple times about the nature of the way in which these five detainees were negotiated around. Has the White House essentially -- you've described this as the -- this was happening parallel and that this was a unique opportunity alongside the nuclear talks. Was this the last chance, the last window for the United States to exercise that kind of leverage? Or should -- I guess to the other side of this, to manage expectations, should we be expecting other areas that the United States has conflict with Iran to essentially fall by the wayside because we don't have that kind of leverage anymore?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the way that I would describe it, Jared, is that we capitalized on an opportunity that had been presented to try to advance our interests and secure the release of these innocent Americans.\nAnd it's only because, frankly, that in the context of the nuclear talks every single time, once those talks were concluded, American negotiators would remind their Iranian counterparts that there was another significant priority that hadn't yet been discussed, which is the case of innocent Americans. And it's only because of that persistence did the Iranians agree to establish a separate, parallel track where their release could be negotiated.\nNow, what we have been clear about since the beginning, even when we were being criticized for not securing the release of these Americans by our harshest critics, is that this nuclear agreement was not predicated on a dramatic change in Iranian behavior. In fact, it's because we know that Iran is supporting terrorism, threatening Israel, engaging in other destabilizing activities in the region -- principally in Syria and Yemen -- and developing a ballistic missile program that we needed to make preventing them from getting a nuclear weapon a top priority. And so that's what we did.\nIf there are additional diplomatic opportunities that are presented, then we'll see if we can use diplomacy to advance our interests. I wouldn't rule that out. I don't say that with anything in mind. But of course, if there are additional opportunities for us to resolve issues that benefit the United States, then we're going to capitalize on them.\nBut what we're not going to do is we're certainly not going to paper over the concerns that we have with Iran's malign activities in the region. And I think the decision that was announced over the weekend to impose sanctions on individuals and entities connected to Iran's ballistic missile program is a good example of that.\nQ: I guess with the implementation day in the rearview mirror, though, is it reasonable to say that the United States leverage -- so if the high-water mark is these five detainees and ballistic missiles clearly above that, since Iran was willing to exacerbate its own activities over the weekend, is there anything that you can say is still being worked on as actively as those detainees were over the past few months?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, one thing that will continue is the way that we will continue to press the case of Mr. Levinson and to press Iranian officials for information about his whereabouts. That's the thing that comes most directly in mind. But what -- the other breakthrough here has been the demonstration that principled diplomacy can allow the governments of both countries to make some progress. And we'll look for additional opportunities to do that.\nOlivier, I'll give you that last one.\nQ: Can I take two?\nMR. EARNEST: Okay. (Laughter.)\nQ: So Margaret, Jon, and Nadia have all asked you to directly reject one of your critics' central points, which is that this sets up an incentive structure to take more Americans prisoner. You've defended the administration's approach, but you haven't directly tackled that. In fact, I haven't heard you directly tackle that. Could you do that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess what I would say is it's not distant or ancient American history that President Reagan acknowledged on live television that he had traded arms for hostages. And I haven't heard a lot of Republican criticism of that. So maybe they are so reflexively committed to defending those kinds of actions that it's hard for them to consider what could be gained from a humanitarian release of nonviolent individuals, most of whom are American citizens, by the way, in the United States to secure the release of innocent Americans that were being detained by Iran.\nSo I think if you consider the history here, the President's effective use of diplomacy withstands a lot of scrutiny in a way that, frankly, their claims don't.\nQ: And then, in the State of the Union, the President talked about the low price of gas, but there's a growing chorus of economists that he's expressing concern that low oil prices might actually have negative knock-on effects on the American economy. Do you share those concerns? If so, to what extent?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President's point in the State of the Union was to note that American middle-class families who are filling up the tank in the car once or twice a week are enjoying significant benefits to their household income as a result of the low price of gas.\nNow, there are a variety of reasons for that. Some of that has to do with the fact that cars are more efficient than they -- are getting more efficient than they have been before. Some of that is a result of the level of production of the oil and gas on American soil. And some of that is also a reflection of weakness in other countries' markets. So there are a variety of factors here, and I think the President's allusion here is that a lot of the criticism that the administration gets is related to how middle-class families don't benefit from the energy policy that this administration has put in place.\nAnd the fact is, right now, middle-class families are benefiting from that policy and we want to make sure that our policy reflects not just those pocketbook concerns but also reflects the need for us to invest in growing industries, including the renewable energy industry, which will create jobs and economic opportunity for middle-class families that can't be exported. We also want to be looking out for the best interests of the planet and for public health. And all of that is consistent with a policy of transitioning our economy to a low-carbon economy. And that is a long-term goal, one that will not be accomplished before the end of this administration and probably not going to be accomplished by the end of the next administration.\nBut starting that planning now will allow the United States to maximize the upside potential, including when it comes to creating good, middle-class jobs of the future.\nThanks a lot, everybody.\nEND 2:26 P.M.

Sanders has a lot of respect for the senior U.S. diplomats who support Secretary Clinton and question his views on ISIS and Iran. We certainly concede that former Secretary of State Clinton has more experience than Sen. Sanders, but his judgement on major foreign policy issues is far superior.\n\"In 2002, then Sen. Clinton and then-Rep. Sanders both listened to the Bush administration's arguments for getting us into a war in Iraq. Secretary Clinton voted for that war – one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the modern history of our country and a war which resulted in the kind of chaos and instability which allowed for the rise of ISIS. Sen. Sanders not only voted against the war but helped lead the opposition to the war. Many of the concerns he raised in 2002 turned out, unfortunately, to be true.\n\"As president, Sen. Sanders would do all that he could to destroy the barbaric Islamic State terrorist group, but he will do it by maintaining a strong coalition of major powers and our Muslim allies. He agrees with King Abdullah of Jordan that it must be Muslim troops on the ground that destroy ISIS with the support of the United States and other major powers providing air support, training and military equipment. He will do everything he can to prevent U.S. troops from getting involved in perpetual war in the quagmire of the Middle East.\n\"Sen. Sanders also agrees with President Obama that Secretary Clinton's proposal for a no-fly zone in Syria could have dangerous implications.\n\"As president, Sanders also will work to prioritize military spending to make sure we are no longer fighting the Cold War but focus our resources and priorities in fighting today's challenges, including international terrorism.\"", "timestamp": "2016-01-19", "title": "Press Release - Sanders Campaign Statement on ISIS"}

{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116704", "text": "The stakes couldn't be higher.\nOn January 20, 2017, America will begin our next chapter. A new president will stand on the steps of the Capitol, raise one hand, and take the oath of office. From that moment on, he or she will decide whether we defend and build on the progress we've made under President Obama—or tear it all away.\nThat feels pretty personal to me—not just as an American who supports President Obama, but also as someone who was proud to work alongside him at the White House.\nI remember vividly the day after the 2008 election when President-elect Obama asked me to come see him in Chicago. It turned out that he would ask me to be secretary of state. But first, we talked about everything he was doing to get ready for his first term—and everything he was learning about the reality of the economic crisis our country was facing. The president-elect was getting briefings every day, sometimes several times a day. And the news was not good. He turned to me and said, \"It is so much worse than they told us.\"\nHe was right.\nBy the time President Obama was sworn into office, we were on the brink of another Great Depression. Before the worst was over, we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 5 million Americans lost their homes, and 13 trillion dollars of family wealth was wiped away. Meanwhile, our auto industry—the pride of American manufacturing and ingenuity for decades—was on the verge of collapse. It turned out to be the second-worst financial crisis in our country's history.\nPresident Obama changed all that. Look where we are today. We've had 70 straight months of private-sector job growth. Our businesses have created 14.1 million jobs. The unemployment rate is the lowest in seven years. And the auto industry just had its best year ever.\nThat's a pretty outstanding record for any president—let alone one who took office amid an economic disaster. ?That's not all. We've imposed the toughest regulations on Wall Street since the 1930s. We created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau just over a year ago—and it's already returned nearly $11 billion to consumers.\nWe've restored our standing around the world. Under President Obama's leadership, we worked with Congress and the United Nations to impose crippling sanctions against Iran, which paved the way for a landmark deal that will keep Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. We stood up for LGBT rights and women's rights around the world. We brought Osama bin Laden to justice. And thanks to a lot of painstaking diplomacy by the president and his team, nearly 200 countries have signed on to a landmark agreement to tackle the urgent threat of climate change.\nThen there's the progress we've made toward a cause close to my heart: putting quality, affordable health care within reach for everyone. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, 18 million Americans now have health coverage. Millions more are receiving benefits like free preventive care. Americans can sleep easier knowing they'll never be denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition. Democrats have been trying to pass universal health care since Harry Truman's administration. President Obama got it done. Now we need to build on it, bring down out-of-pocket costs, and make sure every American can get the care they deserve.\nIf you take a step back and look at all America has achieved over the past eight years, it's remarkable to see how far we've come. But you'd never know it from listening to the Republicans. They're quick to demonize and demean President Obama. At the last GOP presidential debate, two candidates referred to him as a \"child.\" That kind of racially coded rhetoric has no place in our politics. Instead of insulting our president, we should be thanking him. ?\nRepublicans aren't just harshly criticizing the president. They're threatening to undo just about everything he has achieved. They want to repeal the Affordable Care Act; in fact they've voted to repeal or dismantle it more than 50 times. They're hard at work dismantling workers' rights and voting rights. They want to take away women's rights to make our own health decisions. Some even want to reverse marriage equality—one of the greatest civil rights accomplishments in American history.\nIn short, they want to drag us backward and undo all the progress we've worked so hard to achieve. We can't let that happen.\nAs president, I will carry forward the Democratic record of achievement. I'll defend President Obama's accomplishments and build upon them. I'll work to get incomes rising for middle-class families, make college affordable, alleviate the crushing burden of student debt, protect LGBT Americans from discrimination, preserve women's access to health care and reproductive choice, and keep America safe from threats at home and abroad. And I'll never allow the Affordable Care Act to be repealed.\n?We've made tremendous progress over the past eight years. That shouldn't be dismissed or taken lightly. Let's keep that progress going. Let's make sure no one turns the clock back. We've come too far. We've accomplished too much. We can do even more for our families, our communities, and the country we love. And together, we can build an economy and a country that works for everyone. That would be truly revolutionary.", "timestamp": "2016-01-19", "title": "Press Release - What President Obama's Legacy Means To Me"}

In October 2015, at the thirtieth annual Australia-United States Ministerial (AUSMIN) consultations, we reaffirmed the Alliance, reiterated a commitment to implement fully the U.S. Force Posture Initiatives in Australia, and signed a Joint Statement on Defense Cooperation articulating the principles underpinning defense cooperation. The Statement underscored our shared commitment to further enhance military interoperability and intelligence cooperation, as well as build cooperation with regional partners. The success of Talisman Saber 2015, our biennial joint military exercise, exemplifies the strength of the Alliance. The United States applauds Australia's commitment to spend 2 percent of GDP on defense as a tangible commitment to contribute to regional and international security.\nThe United States deeply appreciates Australia's tremendous support to the Counter-ISIL Coalition, the effectiveness of which was well demonstrated by recent progress against ISIL in Ramadi. We share a firm commitment to defeat ISIL and support the government of Iraq. The United States and Australia share the goal of reaching a political solution in Syria and are committed to providing humanitarian aid to those affected by the conflict, including resettlement of refugees and working with the international community to do more. We have served side-by-side in Afghanistan for over a decade. The United States recognizes Australia's sacrifices in Afghanistan and its continued crucial support for NATO's Resolute Support Mission and our joint commitment to a sovereign, secure, stable and unified Afghanistan.\nThe United States and Australia also share an interest in maintaining freedom of navigation and overflight and other lawful uses of the sea, including in the South China Sea. We have made clear that claimants in the South China Sea should exercise restraint and halt land reclamation, construction and further militarization of outposts, and voiced support for the peaceful settlement of disputes, including the right to pursue arbitration consistent with the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).\nThe United States and Australia are committed to cooperation on nuclear security and to working together to make the 2016 Nuclear Security Summit a success. They are working to counter biological threats, whether naturally occurring, deliberate, or accidental, and are advancing the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) to prevent future outbreaks from becoming epidemics.\nCountering Violent Extremism\nThe United States and Australia also share a commitment to countering violent extremism. Last year, the Australian Attorney-General attended the White House Summit on Countering Violent Extremism and announced a Combatting Terrorist Propaganda in Australia initiative focused on the Internet and social media. In June, Australia hosted the Regional Summit to Counter Violent Extremism to further goals outlined at the White House Summit and build on UN Security Council Resolution 2178. The Summit brought together key stakeholders from across government, civil society and industry with the aim of building capacity to address the threat posed by violent extremist groups. While work is underway on all five outcomes from the Regional Summit, the Australian Government is currently prioritizing the delivery of two outcomes: creating a compendium of counter-narratives and establishing a regional civil society network of experts in CVE. We will continue to work together and with our regional partners to improve efforts to stop the spread of violent extremism.\nCooperating on Cyber Issues\nWe share a commitment to cyber security and an open Internet—a transformative technology that has led to greater connectivity, efficiency, and access to markets—and together we are continuing to seek an open, interoperable, secure, and reliable Internet that also protects the privacy of our citizens.\nTo achieve these goals, the United States and Australia are committed to: supporting a new Track 1.5 U.S.-Australia Cyber Security Dialogue; working together to enhance our efforts to respond to cyber incidents, beginning with mapping our respective cyber incident response architectures, with the aim in the future to exercising our incident response measures; enhancing cybercrime cooperation, including through increased exchanges between respective law enforcement and cybercrime experts and more collaboration in cybercrime investigations; continuing to work together closely to promote voluntary peacetime norms of responsible state behavior in cyberspace; and, enhancing the coordination of our cyber capacity building efforts in the Asia-Pacific region to improve the cybersecurity of our partners and their capacity to combat cybercrime.\nEconomic Cooperation\nThe United States and Australia recognize the importance of foreign trade and investment to job creation, consumer welfare, competitiveness, and innovation in both our countries. We greatly value our thriving bilateral economic relationship: since the Australia-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (AUSFTA) entered into force in 2005, goods trade between our two countries has increased by 74 percent, and services trade by 48 percent. We are among each other's most important trading partners; the United States is the largest foreign investor in Australia, and Australia's top foreign investment destination is the United States.\nThe recently-concluded Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is an important opportunity to further deepen the trade and investment ties between the United States and Australia. TPP will expand trade, spur investment, and lift standards throughout the Asia-Pacific. The TPP is strategically important, as it will help us to define and strengthen the rules-based international system and increase economic stability throughout the region. We hope to see the domestic TPP approval processes move forward in both countries as soon as possible, so the agreement can begin to generate benefits for our people.\nAustralia and the United States have also re-committed, as G20 members, to strengthen the global economy, make global growth more inclusive, enhance the resilience of the international financial system, mobilize investment to raise long-term growth, and implement previous G20 commitments on economic reform and labor markets.\nPartners in Innovation\nAustralia and the United States share a belief in the power of innovation, science, and technology as a way to grow the economy, create jobs, and expand prosperity. The United States cooperates with Australia to foster innovation across a broad range of issues. U.S. energy companies and technology will help Australia become the world's largest Liquefied Natural Gas exporter by 2018. NASA collaboration with the Commonwealth Scientific Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO)—including on the Deep Space Network and the U.S. contribution for two new satellite dishes at Tidbinbilla, Australia to support the Mars Program—continues our joint cooperation that began with our efforts in the 1960's to reach the moon and flourishes today with missions to Mars and Pluto.\nThe United States' National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Australia's National Health and Medical Research Council are working together to uncover new ways to understand, treat, prevent, and cure brain disorders like Alzheimer's, autism, and epilepsy. The NIH funds Australian cancer research and collaborates with Australia on pediatric cancer and prevention of cancer in the Pacific islands. The U.S.-Australia Joint Commission on Science and Technology promotes scientific exchanges and collaboration between our two countries.\nUSAID's Global Development Lab and Australia's InnovationXchange have been working together on innovative approaches to development and have jointly invested in the Global Innovation Fund, a non-profit formed by USAID, Australia and other donors to source and develop innovation with evidence of impact and a pathway to scale.\nThe United States and Australia are both committed to creating an ideal environment to support innovation and to supporting and enhancing our already-robust cooperation on innovation. One of Prime Minister Turnbull's first major policy initiatives upon taking office was establishing the National Innovation and Science Agenda (NISA), which emphasizes reforms to encourage risk taking and investment, collaboration to improve the commercialization of ideas into products, and science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education. Included in NISA is the planned opening of a \"landing pad\" in Silicon Valley to help Australian innovators and entrepreneurs. President Obama created the first-ever U.S. Strategy for American Innovation in 2009, updated it in 2011, and released a final update in October 2015. The Strategy describes the many policies and programs the U.S. government is undertaking to sustain the world-leading U.S. innovation ecosystem, including making world-leading investments in fundamental research, boosting access to high-quality STEM education, and ensuring the right conditions for a thriving entrepreneurial ecosystem.\nShared Energy Initiatives\nThe United States and Australia have strong bilateral energy cooperation. U.S. investments in the liquefied natural gas (LNG) sector that will come online in 2016 and 2017 will transform global energy markets and result in Australia becoming the world's largest LNG exporter.\nThe United States and Australia are committed to supporting and expanding the Clean Energy Solutions Center, an initiative of the Clean Energy Ministerial. The Solution Center offers no-cost, fast response expert assistance on clean energy policy and finance measures to countries around the world. Post-Conference of the Parties (COP) 21, the Solutions Center will act as a critical component in helping countries implement their Nationally-Determined Contributions (NDCs) and other climate and clean energy goals.\nThe United States and Australia are also committed to supporting Mission Innovation, which was announced by the leaders of 20 countries, including the United States and Australia, on November 30. Each participating country is seeking to double its governmental clean energy research and development funding over five years. New investment focuses on transformational clean energy technology innovations that can be scaled to varying economic and energy market conditions that exist in participating countries and in the broader world.\nBoth governments are committed to nuclear security cooperation, including participation in the U.S. Department of Energy's and Dutch-hosted January 2016 \"Apex Gold,\" a ministerial, scenario-based policy discussion for the 2016 Nuclear Security Summit, at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory on January 27-28.\nAdvancing Cooperation on Marine and Climate Science\nThe United States commends Australia's constructive role in leading the Umbrella Group at the COP-21 international climate change negotiations in Paris in December 2015, and looks forward to future cooperation on reducing carbon emissions.\nThe United States and Australia both highly value the marine environment, which is critical to global food security and the healthy functioning of the Earth's climate. Through Memoranda of Understanding between the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Organization (NOAA) and partner Australian agencies—including the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), the Australia Institute of Marine Science (AIMS), and the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM)—we advance global goals in food security, weather forecasting, climate adaptation, and biodiversity.\nThe United States seeks further opportunities to cooperate on conservation, which often is led by civil society in the United States and Australia, but which also features engagement between U.S. and Australian governmental agencies responsible for environmental protection and natural resource management. We also note our history of providing assistance to each other during some of the worst wildfire seasons in the past 50 years, including the much-appreciated contributions of Australian firefighters during the 2015 wildfire season in the United States.\nEducation, including Strengthening Educational Exchanges\nGovernment and institutional relationships stem from close and cooperative relationships between our citizens. The deep cultural and historical linkages between the United States and Australia are continually refreshed and renewed through educational exchanges and the interaction of students, teachers and institutions from both countries. The United States and Australia maintain a wide-ranging education policy dialogue aimed at ensuring that students in both countries benefit from a high quality education.\nThe Australian-American Fulbright program was the result of the first official treaty signed between the United States and Australia. The Prime Minister of Australia and the U.S. Ambassador are the Honorary Co-Chairs of the Australian-American Fulbright Commission, which offers approximately 50 scholarships each year to Australian and American citizens to study and undertake research in each other's country. Over the course of its existence, the program has awarded scholarships to nearly 5,000 citizens of both countries. Additionally, each year between 4,500-5,200 youth and professionals participate in the Exchange Visitor Program (EVP), building lasting ties between our two nations.\nPartnering in International Development\nThe United States reaffirms the importance of development cooperation with Australia, which directly reflects our shared core values and intent to increase regional and global prosperity and security. We share a strong commitment to promote the empowerment of women politically, economically, and socially, and we have both established ambassadors for women and girls to lead government efforts. The United States and Australia continue to work together to advance women's empowerment in the Asia-Pacific and Indian Ocean regions through regional organizations and joint projects like the Papua New Guinea Women's Business Center.", "timestamp": "2016-01-19", "title": "Fact Sheet: United States - Australia Cooperation: Deepening Our Strategic Partnership"}

These are complex and challenging times, and we need a Commander in Chief who knows how to protect America and our allies and advance our interests and values around the world. The stakes are high. And we are concerned that Senator Sanders has not thought through these crucial national security issues that can have profound consequences for our security.\n\"His lack of a strategy for defeating ISIS - one of the greatest challenges we face today - is troubling. And the limited things he has said on ISIS are also troubling.\n\"For example, his call for more Iranian troops in Syria is dangerous and misguided and the opposite of what is needed. Supporting  Iranian soldiers on Israel's doorstep is a grave mistake. And while we support de-escalation of Sunni-Shia tensions, his argument that Iran and Saudi Arabia - two intense adversaries - should join together in a military coalition is just puzzling. Indeed, the Iranian government recently failed to stop protesters from ransacking and burning the Saudi embassy in Tehran, after which Saudi Arabia cut off diplomatic ties with Iran.\n\"We are all strong supporters of the nuclear diplomacy with Iran. Some of us were part of developing the policy that produced the diplomacy over the past several years. And we believe that there are areas for further cooperation under the right circumstances. But Senator Sanders' call to \"move aggressively\" to normalize relations with Iran - to develop a \"warm\" relationship - breaks with President Obama, is out of step with the sober and responsible diplomatic approach that has been working for the United States, and if pursued would fail while causing consternation among our allies and partners.\n\"Given these concerns, it is important to ask what he would do on other issues - on Russia, China, our allies, nuclear proliferation, and so much else.

In his remarks, he referred to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) terrorist organization. Prime Minister Turnbull referred to Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi of Iraq.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111479", "text": "President Obama. Well, it is a great pleasure to welcome Prime Minister Turnbull and his delegation to the Oval Office. We had the opportunity to work together at the G-20 summit in Turkey and then had our first bilateral meeting in Manila during the APEC and ASEAN events. And I emphasized to the Prime Minister at that time and want to reiterate the extraordinary gratitude that the American people have for the strong and steadfast alliance between our two countries.\nI've said before that the friendship between the United States and Australia is not only based on common economic and geopolitical interests, but it's also based on an extraordinary affinity and shared values. There are probably—there are very few countries that have as much in common as the United States and Australia does, and I want to thank all the people of Australia for the extraordinary hospitality and graciousness that they've shown me every time that I've had a chance to visit your wonderful country. I'm glad to be able to reciprocate. I will note, it is a little bit colder here—[laughter]—than it was down under.\nMalcolm has had an opportunity to travel to some key hotspots over the last several days, including Afghanistan and Iraq. And those are just two places where we see the value of Australia's Armed Forces and the remarkable contribution that they have made and the sacrifices that they make consistently.\nKeep in mind that in our fight against ISIL, Australia is the second largest contributor of troops on the ground after the United States. They have been a consistent and extraordinarily effective member of the coalition that has helped to deliver an opportunity for the Afghan people to govern themselves and to build up their security forces. And so I'm very much looking forward to hearing from Malcolm his impressions about how we can continue to focus on what we call the parent tumor of ISIL in Iraq and Syria and the important work that we have to do together on countering violent extremism generally.\nWe note the recent attack in Jakarta that appears to have been ISIL-inspired, and it's a reminder that Southeast Asia has generally done a very effective job fighting against extremism, but it is an area that we have to pay attention to and watch. And obviously, Australia has been impacted in the past by such terrorist attacks. So we're going to talk about how we can strengthen our cooperation, both in Syria and Iraq, the state of affairs in Afghanistan, but also countering violent extremism globally. And Australia will be a very important partner in that process.\nWe'll also have a chance to talk about the Asia-Pacific region, where we have common interests across the board. Our rebalance has been effective in part because we have such strong treaty alliances, and Australia is one of those critical alliances. And our Marines in Australia, the joint exercises that we do, the work that we do to affirm an international order and rules of the road with respect to issues like maritime law all are critical for the continued expansion of commerce and the sustained, peaceful conditions that allow our economies to thrive. And finally, we'll have a chance to talk about TPP. We are both the—part of the driving force that created this rules-based system that is now being prepared to ratify among the various nations. It is going to be good for our economy. It is going to be good for our workers and our businesses. And it reaffirms that in order for us to thrive in the 21st century—particularly economies that are respectful of rule of law and concerned about labor rights and environmental rights—it's important for us to be making the rules in this region, and that's exactly what TPP does.\nAnd I know that the Prime Minister has an agenda to spur additional innovation and investment in science and technology in Australia, which in this economy is going to be vital for any economy to succeed. So I'll be interested to hear his plans and maybe offer my thoughts about the work that we're doing to continue to make sure that our economy is a dynamic, knowledge-based economy.\nSo I am grateful for our friendship, grateful for the work that we do together, very grateful for the sacrifices that have been made by Australian troops around the world, working side by side with our outstanding men and women in uniform. And I look forward to a very productive meeting.\nPrime Minister Turnbull. Thank you. Thank you very much, Barack. You've been very hospitable and generous in inviting me to Washington this month. And your agencies have been very open.\nWe've had very productive discussions with the Defense Secretary, Ash Carter. Together, we went to Arlington and paid our respects to the—on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and recalled the comradeship, over a hundred years, of Australians and Americans fighting side by side in freedom's cause.\nYou're quite right, our alliance, our relationship is founded not just on national self-interest, not just on economics or kinship, but on shared values. We define our national identities by reference to common political values of freedom, the rule of law, democracy—real democracy, which empowers the majority, but constrains them so as to protect the minority. So we have those strong values in common.\nAnd as you've said, just over the last few days, I've been in Baghdad and Kabul meeting our servicemen and meeting many of your service leaders there as well. And I've learned firsthand from our people and yours and, indeed, from the Government of Iraq, from its Prime Minister, how Australians and Americans working together were able to support the Iraqi security forces in the retaking of Ramadi, which has been an absolute adrenaline shot of confidence for that Government, a very, very significant result. And it was a great combination of our servicemen and women working with the Iraqis to achieve that.\nIn Kabul, I met with our soldiers who are training the Afghan National Army, their next generation of leaders, building capacity so that they can secure and hold their own country. And once again, we're doing that in partnership. So it is a very strong—very, very strong partnership.\nWe've had very good discussions with your intelligence community too. That is especially important in the battle against violent extremists. We have to constantly lift our game in the way we engage with and tackle these extremists—particularly ISIL, but there are many others—as they operate in the cybersphere. Archaic and barbaric though they may be, their use regrettably of the Internet is very sophisticated. And so I'm pleased that we're going to be working on even closer collaboration there.\nBarack, you mentioned the TPP. And can I say, as I've just said to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, encouraging them to encourage their Congressmen and Senators to support it, that the TPP is much more than a trade deal. The prosperity of the world, the security of the world has been founded on the peace and order in the Asia-Pacific, where—which has been delivered underwritten by the United States and its allies, including Australia.\nAnd what we've been able to do there is deliver a period of peace—a long period of peace—from which everybody has benefited. And America's case—its proposition—is more than simply security. It is standing up for, as you said, the rules-based international order, an order where might is not right, where the law must prevail, where there is real transparency, where people can invest with confidence.\nAnd the TPP is lifting those standards. And so it is much more than a trade deal. And I think when people try to analyze it in terms of what it adds to this amount of GDP or that, that's important. But the critical thing is the way it promotes the continued integration of those economies, because that is as important an element in our security in the maintenance of the values which both our countries share as all of our other efforts, whether they are in defense or whether they are in traditional diplomacy.\nSo right across the board, Mr. President, we have so much in common.

As I have noted before, too many of our waters have been left vulnerable. Pollution from upstream sources ends up in the rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and coastal waters near which most Americans live and on which they depend for their drinking water, recreation, and economic development. Clarifying the scope of the Clean Water Act helps to protect these resources and safeguard public health. Because this resolution seeks to block the progress represented by this rule and deny businesses and communities the regulatory certainty and clarity needed to invest in projects that rely on clean water, I cannot support it.

SCHULTZ: Welcome aboard, everyone, en route to Detroit, where the President will have an opportunity to experience firsthand the remarkable progress made by the American auto industry, the city and its people and neighborhoods in recovering from the Great Recession.\nAs you all know, when the President first took office, the American auto industry was on the brink of collapse. Sales had plunged 40 percent, and the industry was shedding jobs by the hundreds of thousands. Both GM and Chrysler were only weeks away from running out of cash and collapsing. At that time, the President made the tough call in the first few months of entering the presidency to place a bet on American workers and American manufacturing.\nBecause the President acted so quickly and aggressively, and demanded real change as a condition of the government assistance, the American auto industry not only avoided a much deeper collapse, but bounced back and is stronger than ever.\nFor example, since 2009, the auto industry has posted the strongest job growth on record. American auto has doubled production with auto sales at an all-time high. We've seen American automotive products and exports go up 89 percent since 2009. And once again, American auto technology is the envy of the world.\nThe President also initiated more broadly -- more broader than just the auto manufacturing industry a broader commitment to the city of Detroit that has resulted in a sustained commitment through our federal officials that partner with the mayor, local businesses and community leaders to deliver robust yet tailored assistance.\nSo, alongside the progress of the auto industry, we've seen the city of Detroit make significant strides, as well. Unemployment in the city has been cut by more than half, and now is at its lowest levels since 2003. There is obviously much more work we can do, but the President wanted to take some time and make this trip, and really mark the remarkable progress that this city has undergone in the last few years.\nWith that, I'm happy to take your questions.\nQ: Hey, Eric, two questions. Is the President disappointed that despite the success of the auto industry, that the cars and vehicles that it keeps turning out continue to be the gas guzzlers that he opposed in 2009?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, Jeff, I think you've seen the President also do a lot of work in this issue space, and that includes new CAFE standards for our vehicles. And he thinks that American car manufacturers recognize that that is the technology of the future, have embraced that, and have adopted that as their goal.\nQ: So with gas prices so low, SUVs are obviously still getting produced at record numbers and getting purchased at record numbers. Is that something that the President is disappointed about?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I see. Well, I do think it's important to note that the auto industry remains on track to meet targets that double their fuel efficiency and cut emissions by half by the year 2025. So vehicle manufacturers are beating their standards for the third year in a row now. And the President believes our fuel economy standards reduce economic vulnerability to this volatile market and spur innovation. And we've seen results of that throughout the industry, especially in the context of the global markets.\nQ: Can I maybe I follow up on that? Chrysler has met its targets, but it barely met its targets for the most recent year. And it may have trouble meeting its emissions targets for next year. Is the President concerned, following up on Jeff's question, about the mix of cars and trucks that Chrysler is selling, and particularly that his auto task force chose Fiat for the merger partner?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Angela, I'm not going to have comment on every particular -- or any specific manufacturer. But what I will say is, the President is encouraged by the progress these manufacturers are making to meet their goals.\nQ: What is the White House's reaction to Governor Snyder's apology in his State of the State? And does the EPA owe an apology, as well, to the residents of Flint?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Kevin, I did not have a chance to watch or read the Governor's remarks in their entirety, but I did see some of the press coverage of it. I don't have a direct response to that address. I will say the President is deeply engaged on this issue. He took time out of his day yesterday to meet with Mayor Weaver. He came away from that discussion determined to get to the bottom of this, determined to resolve the situation as fast as humanly possible. And that meant -- for him, that means mobilizing all possible federal resources to make sure that the federal government is doing what we can to help support state and local response efforts, because they have the primary responsibility on this.\nQ: If they have the primary responsibility, what is the EPA's responsibility in the White House's view, and did they meet that responsibility?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, if you would like a catalogue of how EPA has been engaged on this and been responding, you should probably check with them. I'm sure they will be able to get that for you. From our point of view, our focus right now is solving the problem. And that's why the President, yesterday, announced a new federal coordinator, Dr. Nicole Lurie, who's an Assistant Secretary at the Department of Health and Human Services. She's going to help coordinate all the federal resources that are being surged to Flint right now. She's actually in Flint today meeting with all the important stakeholders on the ground.\nThe President, as I mentioned, met with the Mayor yesterday, and he wants to make sure that we are marshaling all the resources of the federal government to address that problem.\nQ: Does the White House think Governor Snyder should resign?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Again, our view is everyone right now should be focused on the actual problem. And that's why the President -- and I'm happy to walk you through some of what the President has directed his agencies to provide for Flint. That includes the Department of Health and Human Services providing technical assistance so they can really make sure that water is as safe as humanly possible right now for the children and people of Flint. That also includes disseminating as much public health information as possible so that the people of Flint have access to the best information they can get.\nThe CDC is on the ground providing technical assistance, also providing support for anyone with high lead levels in their blood. FEMA is obviously on the ground -- has been on the ground for weeks now providing water filters and tens of thousands of liters of bottled water. The EPA is obviously on the ground working to identify the sources of contamination and making sure that they can root that out. HUD has been involved, making sure that -- what they're doing is they're providing the data tracking to make sure that there's a full audit and accounting of where the problem is and how it can be stemmed. And finally --\nQ: But you think that Governor Snyder is a trustworthy partner at the state level to help you get all these things done?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, I saw that the Governor yesterday accepted responsibility for this. Clearly, the primary responsibility lies with local and state officials. But that's not stopping the administration and this President from doing what they can to help support those response efforts.\nQ: Eric, specifically on the question of EPA -- and I have checked with them -- obviously, part of what they've been saying is that Michigan officials were not as forthright in disclosing things to them as they could have been, and that impeded the effort. However, there is an issue about a memo that an EPA officer drafted in April of last year, submitted to the EPA regional coordinator in June, and it was not publicly disclosed for some time. Now, EPA says that it was circulated within the EPA regional office and that that helped inform their discussions with Michigan officials. I'm just wondering that, as the President obviously responds to the concerns of the people of Flint, is the White House and the administration looking at that issue and to what extent EPA acted as quickly as possible in conveying concerns about elevated lead levels in the water?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Thank you, Juliet. I have not seen any reporting on that particular memo. I can say that clearly the notification process is part of the problem here, and the President is absolutely determined to figure out what went wrong, generally speaking. And I know that a lot of this is under investigation, so I'm a little bit hindered in what I can say. But all I can say is, broadly speaking, the President is concerned that something like this could happen in the greatest country on Earth, and that's why he's determined to resolve it as soon as possible.\nQ: Can you comment on the attack against the university, the new terrorist attack which happened today?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Laura, I did see that report. Obviously, we condemn in the strongest possible terms that attack. And I think we might have more of a response later today.\nQ: And, Eric, on the question of a potential executive order requiring federal contractors to disclose their political contributions, obviously the White House has issued some comment on this today. One of my questions is, can you discuss to what extent the White House feels constrained by existing language that Congress has passed which appears to affect contractors who would be bidding on federal contracts, and of course just elaborate a bit on this issue?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I'm glad you brought this up, Juliet, because this speaks to a theme that the President devoted significant time to in the State of the Union address, which is changing our politics. And the President has long advocated for campaign finance reform, and expressed his opposition to the Citizens United decision that really opened the floodgates to special interest spending in our elections.\nThe President took some steps when he first took the oath of office back in 2009 to limit special interest influence peddling in Washington. But the President also viewed -- the most robust action we could take on this is an action that Congress failed to take when they considered a piece of legislation called the DISCLOSE Act. That would have increased transparency and done a lot to further this goal. Unfortunately, Senate Republicans banded together to block that.\nAnd so, for our part, we are going to continue to consider actions we can take at the administrative level to combat this problem. I don't have any specific measures to preview at this point.\nQ: Can you just talk about the legal landscape as it stands right now and how that would affect anything the administration could do in the same way that obviously there are limits because the Senate did not act in 2012?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, as Josh is fond of saying, he's not a lawyer -- I'm not a lawyer. But I can tell you that any executive action that would be vetted through our system and announced by the President would be on solid legal footing.\nQ: Eric, the stock market has taken another tumble today. Can you issue the White House's reaction to that? And are you concerned that this continuation of a stock fall and the oil prices staying low suggests a greater problem or a deeper problem in the world economy, and that that will affect the U.S.?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Jeff, like Josh, I'm not going to comment on the day-to-day moves in the markets. The President is regularly briefed on these developments that relate to the economy, and we obviously monitor the ongoing volatility. That's a process that's principally housed at the Department of Treasury.\nBut I can say more broadly, the President believes our U.S. economy continues to grow, and we have ample data to back that up. For example, U.S. businesses have added 14.1 million jobs in 70 consecutive months of private sector job growth. This, as you know, is the longest stretch of private sector job growth on record. But what remains clear is that we need to stay focused on what we can do to strengthen job growth here at home. The President has several proposals to do just that, one of which is urging Congress to pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership. That's a deal that's going to help America's businesses and help America's workers.\nI should also add that there's no better case study for the resilience of the American economy than where we're headed right now. Detroit, as we talked about, was on the precipice of collapse. And thanks to not only the President's leadership in 2009, but mostly to the grit, determination, and ingenuity of the American worker, they're resurging.\nQ: Is the President going to address the Volkswagen cheating scandal today during his address?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I don't believe that's going to be in the President's remarks.\nQ: Will we hear him talk about Flint today in either of his appearances?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Angela, I, again, don't have a preview of his remarks. But the purpose of today's visit is to really mark the remarkable comeback of Detroit.\nQ: Thanks, Eric.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Thank you, guys.\nEND 11:34 A.M. EST", "timestamp": "2016-01-20", "title": "Press Gaggle by Principal Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz"}

So what happens if he does nab second — or better — after spending almost the entire campaign season in single digits in the polls? 'It would be all of the sudden the whole media would be talking about John Kasich,' he said. The point being: Then anything would be possible for him.\"\nWhy John Kasich really could beat Donald Trump and Ted Cruz for the Republican nomination\nBy Douglas Perry\nThe Oregonian\nOhio Gov. John Kasich has faith. In the Almighty, yes — he's a committed Christian. But also in Republican primary voters.\n\"People will settle down and start looking for someone who is a reformer and who has accomplished things,\" he told Time magazine this week. \"I believe that, at the end, they will want someone who can land the plane.\"\nThe long-shot presidential candidate is convinced, of course, that he can land the plane. And that front-runners Donald Trump and Ted Cruz would crash that sucker into the side of a mountain.\nTo the surprise of many observers, voters just might be coming around to his point of view. Kasich believes climate change is a very real problem and that law-abiding undocumented workers should be allowed to stay in the country — views that contradict the message that has fueled Trump and Cruz. And yet Kasich is now fighting for second place in the \"first in the nation\" New Hampshire primary, which takes place Feb. 9.\nSo what happens if he does nab second — or better — after spending almost the entire campaign season in single digits in the polls?\n\"It would be all of the sudden the whole media would be talking about John Kasich,\" he said.\nThe point being: Then anything would be possible for him.\nThe 63-year-old governor, the son of a mailman and the grandson of coal miners, believes his secret weapon is that he's not an angry man. The working-class side of the Republican base is very angry and has been pushing its presidential candidates to show them their matching rage — about disappearing jobs, about illegal immigrants, about Muslims, about President Obama, about anything and everything. As a result, a lot of candidates are going for that very vocal angry vote — and there's only so much of it to go around. Trump, Cruz, Chris Christie and now a newly mad Marco Rubio could all end up knocking each other out.\nKasich, pundits are beginning to believe, could then step over them into the lead. His approach is a folksy form of straightforward retail politics that he's convinced will serve him well as the primary-election calendar moves south and west: \"Meet people. Tell the truth. Talk to them. Have fun.\"\nRead the full article here.\n——\nNote: \"His poll numbers here are moving in the right direction. The airwaves, now so cluttered and so noxious, have become so much white noise. 'I think what really matters then is the ground game,'' Kasich said. \"I think we have the best ground game. There's never been a better ground game.''\nJohn Kasich Sees An Opening in New Hampshire\nBy Thomas Farragher\nThe Boston Globe\nHILLSBOROUGH, N.H., — You've seen him there on the edge of the stage, in the far corner of your TV screen as the Republican presidential field take turns talking about building big walls, dropping bombs, and — like crazed fast-food joint workers — asking whether you'd like some guns with that burger.\nIn some of those split-screen reaction shots, as the front-running demagogue Donald Trump blends hate speech with paper-thin policy, I've wondered: What is it exactly that Ohio Governor John Kasich is thinking?\n\"Generally, what I'm thinking is: God, I wish they'd ask me the same question so I could answer it,'' Kasich told me aboard his campaign bus here Tuesday. \"But I'd rather have people see that I'm positive and happy than get this extra time. These debates are not a great way to pick a president, to tell you the truth.''\nKasich brought his happy-face tour to Morse Sporting Goods on Tuesday, a place where you can get a fishing license for $45, a Buck knife for $54.99, and a bottle of doe urine that will run you $5.50. You can also find proprietor-emeritus Walt Morse, a former New Hampshire state trooper who for 10 years was the elected Hillsborough County sheriff.\n\"He's a good person and he's got a good plan,'' Morse, 81, told me before he showed Kasich around the place. \"I just want the country to be safe and prosperous.''\nThat's what Kasich wants, too. And, he told a small group of voters here, it's not that difficult to deliver. \"Can you believe I said that?'' he said. \"It's very easy. You know what gets in the way? Politics.''\nOf course, that's like saying the only problem with flight is gravity.\nKasich is embarking on a bit of gravity defying business himself these days. He's in second place in some New Hampshire primary polls. He has virtually moved here full-time until the state votes on Feb. 9.\nKasich is a serious guy. He's a former nine-term congressman and House Budget Committee chairman. He left Washington in 2001 and returned to politics in 2010 when he was elected Ohio's governor.\nHe's a staunch abortion opponent, but in a field where there's not a yardstick big enough to measure how far right the far right has drifted, Kasich is a voice of relative moderation.\n\"You can go into the room as the prince of darkness and you can get everybody depressed and down,'' he said. \"Or you can go in as the prince of light and tell people: Yeah, we have problems but they're not that hard because I don't really believe they're that hard. Everything doesn't have to be a trip to get a root canal.''\nIf presidential politics is all about timing, Kasich is hoping that the ground game he's built here will help prove his timing fortuitous. He has dismissed suggestions that he's the 2016 version of Jon Huntsman, the former Utah governor who also bet the house on New Hampshire and bowed out four years ago after finishing third.\nAnd if he's taking anything for granted, the voters are happy to bring him up short. \"I was really excited, this lady told me: ‘You're in my top six,'\"he said.\nHis poll numbers here are moving in the right direction. The airwaves, now so cluttered and so noxious, have become so much white noise. \"I think what really matters then is the ground game,'' Kasich said. \"I think we have the best ground game.

His resume, his credentials outstrip all others in this campaign.\nHis nine terms in the U.S. House of Representatives were distinguished by his ability, in a highly polarized body, to build consensus and to use that consensus to produce results that made this country safer, more secure and standing on the strongest economic footing we had seen for years and have not experienced since his departure. He was the chief congressional architect of the last balanced budget this country has seen and he did so with Bill Clinton in the White House. Now in his second term as governor of Ohio (our seventh largest state, with over 11 million citizens), he has led an unprecedented economic revival. When he took office, Ohio's state government was running a $5 billion deficit; today it enjoys a $2 billion surplus. When he took office, Ohio had lost more than 350,000 private-sector jobs; today, during his administration, Ohio has seen more than 385,000 new jobs. Today, Ohio has 210,000 job openings in the private sector. Not surprisingly, Kasich won re-election by a better than 2-1 margin, carrying 86 of Ohio's 88 counties in the race.\nBoth in Congress and as governor, John Kasich has been a unifier, someone who works with people who are from a different party than him, who have different concerns from him, who think differently than he does but who share a common concern to make Ohio a better state and the United States a better country.\nAs a Republican, I have been particularly impressed by Kasich's insistence that improved economic conditions must mean not leaving folks behind. Using a surplus not just for lowering and cutting taxes, Kasich has concentrated on getting more help for folks with mental illnesses, addiction issues and for the so-called working poor, those folks who played by the rules but have not found success. In particular, he has concentrated on expanded vocational education and occupational retraining, much like we are now concentrating on in New Hampshire.\nFor all these political strengths, what stands out for me is this man's character.\nIn many ways, who a president is matters as much as what a president does. A president must be smart and strong and tough and determined. But a president must also know who we are as a people, know our dreams, our hopes, our concerns. John Kasich gets us. He has lived a life grounded in the realties of the lives of everyday Americans. His ability to talk about these things – good and bad – is unique. It comes from not just his political experience but his life experience. John Kasich gets it.\nIt is Kasich's optimism that makes him want those serious complicated discussions, that impels him to want to continue to serve. He sees the chance to better the lot of all the highest calling. In private, when you might think he would be the most tired or worn down, is when this optimism comes through most clearly. His determination is powerful and unrelenting.\nRead the full article here.", "timestamp": "2016-01-20", "title": "Press Release - New Hampshire AG Tom Rath Says John Kasich Will Make Us Proud as President"}

(AP) — With three weeks until the primary in New Hampshire, where John Kasich's White House hopes probably will live or die, he's approaching his campaign with a sense of calm.\nTouring the state Tuesday on his campaign bus, the Ohio governor seemed fortified by a serene outlook at odds with the stakes and the pace of the Republican contest in the state, admitting in the process that this unsettles some of his advisers.\n\"I'm doing the best I can, nobody's working harder than I am, and I'm very much at peace,\" the Ohio governor told The Associated Press.\nAs Kasich fights for a strong finish in the state, he's strayed little from a strategy centered on the idea that voters want a candidate with a record of getting things done. And in a race where Republican voters are gravitating toward political outsiders like Donald Trump, Kasich openly talks about his 18 years as a member of Congress, pointing to his work balancing the federal budget in the 1990s. He shies away from the doom and gloom that some of his rivals project, suggesting the country's problems are easy to fix if only people work together.\nAs the Feb. 9 primary approaches, Kasich is seeing progress in polling, which suggests he is in a contest behind Trump with Chris Christie, Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz. Kasich is betting that his support will grow as people take a more serious look at their choices in the final weeks before voting.\nHe's not specifying what he'll consider a success on primary night, saying only that he'll calculate how to move forward once the results are in. Kasich says New Hampshire's style of close-up campaigning, where the town hall meeting reigns, offers him a chance to show depth on a variety of subjects. It's altogether easier than Iowa, he says.\n\"It's more compact, and it's 1.2 million (people) and you can stand in Manchester and hit the whole state with a pebble; it's manageable,\" Kasich said. \"It's like running in a community.\"\nHis campaign has five offices open in the state and 15 full-time staff members, and he's backed by notable Republicans such as former Sens. Gordon Humphrey and John E. Sununu. Three New Hampshire newspapers recently endorsed him. Voters who see him speak often are impressed by his substantive answers and his positive outlook on bringing change to Washington.\n\"There's so much animosity in Washington these days,\" said Steve Burritt of Henniker, New Hampshire, and \"we need someone to bring this crowd together and get some things done.\" Burritt said Kasich \"certainly sounds like someone who could do that.\"\nTo read the full story, click here.", "timestamp": "2016-01-20", "title": "Press Release - The Associated Press Says John Kasich is Calm & Optimistic in New Hampshire"}

An American Research Group survey released Tuesday showed him at 20%, up six percentage points from earlier in the month.\"\nThe Wall Street Journal\nBy Reid J. Epstein\nLEBANON, N. H.—While the rest of the Republican presidential field is betting on an electorate furious with President Barack Obama and angry with career politicians, John Kasich is making the opposite wager.\nThe Ohio governor is stumping across New Hampshire highlighting his experience in Congress, backing such issues as the Iran nuclear deal and campaign-finance reform that are usually supported by Democrats and painting himself as an uplifting alternative to the doom-and-gloom tone dominating the GOP primary.\nThere is some evidence this approach is working. Mr. Kasich is second to front-runner Donald Trump in each of five public polls of New Hampshire voters in the past month. An American Research Group survey released Tuesday showed him at 20%, up six percentage points from earlier in the month. Mr. Trump leads at 27%, the poll found.\n\"I'm not sugarcoating anything, but I'm not walking in there as the prince of darkness,\" Mr. Kasich said during an interview on his campaign bus. \"I'd rather be the prince of light, the prince of hope.\"\nThis weekend he received endorsements from newspapers in Nashua, Portsmouth and Dover. His town-hall events Monday and Tuesday drew standing-room-only crowds. And the super PAC backing former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush recently targeted him, stuffing mailboxes with a flier detailing Mr. Kasich's violations of Republican orthodoxy, which include accepting the Obamacare Medicaid expansion for Ohio and voting in Congress for a 1994 ban of certain semiautomatic firearms.\nA strong showing by Mr. Kasich in the first GOP primary eight days after the Feb. 1 Iowa caucuses would increase the odds he would still be around as a favorite-son candidate March 15 in Ohio, a winner-take-all state unlike those before it where delegates are awarded proportionally.\nStill, Mr. Kasich's campaign is essentially a one-state operation for now. He has written off Iowa and his campaign has a minimal footprint in South Carolina and Nevada, which vote in the weeks following New Hampshire. He has less money than his competitors, whose ads appear far more often on New Hampshire's lone broadcast TV network.\nThe latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll of GOP primary voters nationwide showed Mr. Kasich with just 3% support and he remains unknown by 18%—the largest percentage in the GOP presidential field.\nAnd his unorthodox stands don't sit well with plenty of voters. Bill Gamache, a retired salesman, pressed Mr. Kasich on his relatively lenient immigration position at a Concord town hall Tuesday.\n\"We have millions of people here illegally. What is your plan to deport them?\" Mr. Gamache asked. Mr. Kasich dug in. \"I wouldn't, OK? It's not practical and we're not going to do that.\"\nThe Kasich message is aimed at independent voters who make up 44% of the New Hampshire electorate rather than bedrock Republicans being pursued by candidates such as Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.\nKasich New Hampshire strategist Tom Rath said he needs at least one-third of his primary votes to come from independents to meet his turnout targets. To that end, his goal is to present himself as an alternative to conservative candidates while remaining outside of the squabbling between Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, New Jersey Gov. Chris Chris Christie and Mr. Bush.\nTo read the full story, click here.", "timestamp": "2016-01-20", "title": "Press Release - Wall Street Journal Says John Kasich's Positive Approach Is Paying Off"}

He is passionate for the nation because he loves the nation,\" said Holmes.\n\"Before entering the political arena, Huckabee also pastored two Southern Baptist Churches.

Uzo Aduba, actress\n\"This is someone whom I feel goes home and thinks about us. I feel like she thinks and considers what our challenges are. She cares about the things that are important to us.\"\n2. Jim Obergefell, plaintiff in the historic Supreme Court marriage equality case\n\"Too many people think that the fight for LGBT rights ended with marriage equality—but that's not true. ... That's why I endorsed Hillary Clinton. Not only does she understand how important the continued fight for equality is, but she has the experience, the knowledge, and the drive to get things done—and to make life safer and more equal for LGBT Americans.\"\n3. Jeanne Shaheen, senator\n\"I choose Hillary because I know her and I trust her.\"\n4. Howard Dean, former six-term governor of Vermont\n\"Hillary Clinton is by far the most qualified person in the United States to serve as president. ... She has enormous capacity to analyze and solve problems. She has a work ethic that drives her to persist until the job is done and done right. And she has a record in the Senate of successfully working with both sides of our very combative political spectrum in order to accomplish goals that improve the lives of ordinary Americans.\"\n5. Tammy Baldwin, senator\n\"When women get ahead, we all get ahead. It's like what she said in Beijing: Women's rights are human rights. And so it's not like women are in some little silo. We are part of the human family. And the progress of any part is progress for the whole.\"\n\" ... women need more than a vote or a supportive statement; we need a fighter in the White House ... \"\n6. Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood\n\"More than ever, women need more than a vote or a supportive statement; we need a fighter in the White House who will put women and families at the front of the agenda. We face unprecedented attacks from candidates who seek to create a country where our daughters have fewer rights than we do now. As a senator, Hillary Clinton introduced eight separate bills to advance women's reproductive rights—eight more than anyone running. As secretary of state, she helped advance the status of women and girls around the world and confronted human rights abuses. And as a candidate she has put issues important to women on the front burner—like equal pay, overturning the Hyde Amendment, and ensuring patients can continue to come to Planned Parenthood. She has stood up for access to safe and legal abortion and will stand up to every attempt to roll back the rights generations have fought to earn. That's the kind of champion women deserve.\"\n7. Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign\n\"Hillary Clinton is the only candidate who, as a member of Congress and national leader, has consistently put the safety of the American public ahead of the interests of the corporate gun lobby.\"\n8. Karen Civil, author\n\"Recently, the debate over immigration, an issue that's very close to my heart, has been poisoned by some of the other people running. I am Haitian American. ... Watching the immigrant community be torn down over these past few months has been incredibly hurtful. But Hillary has been there every step of the way, making sure that everyone in this country is shown the respect they are owed.\"\n\" We should only support leaders that fight for commonsense gun reforms. Clinton passes that test.\"\n9. Sybrina Fulton, mother of Trayvon Martin\n\"In spending some time with her in person, I also found a mother and a grandmother who truly heard me and understood the depth of my loss. She knew all the statistics. But like so many, I've long since grown numb to the numbers. So instead, we talked about Trayvon and all the other families who have lost a loved one to gun violence. ... I agree with the president: We should only support leaders that fight for commonsense gun reforms. Clinton passes that test. Just as importantly, Clinton also wants to address larger, systemic problems.\"\n10. Jackie Ryan, first openly transgender elected official in Massachusetts\n\"I endorsed Hillary Clinton because her experience and her vision for the country speak to me. She's done so much for so many people: whether it's her work for the Children's Defense Fund, securing benefits for those affected by 9/11, or promoting human rights as secretary of state, she's always fighting. America needs a fighter.\"\n11. Stephanie Schriock, president of EMILY's List\n\"Hillary Clinton is a lifelong champion for women and families and the most qualified candidate to be president. ... No one will work harder than Hillary. ... As president, Hillary will create more opportunities than ever for women and girls and for all hardworking Americans across the country, just as she has done throughout her exceptional career.\"\n12. Barbra Streisand, actress\n\"I want Hillary Clinton to be president. We need a woman president, we need compassion, we need to have a person who comes from the heart and brain. And experience, experience counts.\"\n\" She has the experience and right judgment to deliver results ...\"\n13. Eric Holder, former attorney general\n\"Our next president can't shy away from building on the progress of President Obama, which is why Hillary Clinton is the candidate that we need in the White House. She has the experience and right judgment to deliver results for families across the country. I've seen her deal with the issues that will confront the next president firsthand, and she has bold plans to address police brutality, fight for commonsense reforms to our gun laws, get incomes rising, and make college affordable. If we have a Republican president, they would tear down our progress on civil rights, health care, and curbing gun violence. It can't and won't happen under Hillary, who has spent her life taking on the toughest fights.\"\n14. Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL\n\" ... we need more than an ally. We need a champion, and Hillary Clinton is that champion—for all of us. ... Secretary Clinton understands the connection between economic advancement and gender equality better than anyone else running.\"\n15. John Lewis, Congressman and civil rights icon\n'I know her heart. We need her leadership, not just here in America, but all over the world. She is tireless in her advocacy for those who have been left out and left behind. She is ready to be president on day one. Hillary Clinton has my wholehearted endorsement, and I plan to work and campaign for her to see that she is elected the next president of the United States.\"\n16. Gene Karpinski, president of the League of Conservation Voters\n\"When it comes to fighting the climate crisis, the stakes couldn't be higher—and we are confident that Hillary Clinton is the right person for the job. With her proven history of leadership, strong environmental record, and a campaign committed to building a clean energy future, Hillary Clinton is without a doubt the most effective leader to stand up to Big Polluters and push forward an aggressive plan to tackle climate change and get it done.\"\n17. Amy Klobuchar, senator\n\"My home state is at the forefront of medical research and innovation. I know Hillary will fight hard for the critical investments our nation needs to find the treatments and cures that will help people stay healthy and ultimately, save lives.\"\n\" She will do big and important things.\"\n18. David Plouffe, 2008 campaign manager for Barack Obama\n\"She's the right person to protect President Obama's legacy on health care and so much else. The woman who helped create the CHIP program, which covers 8 million kids, won't stop until affordable health care is recognized as a basic human right in America. She'll enhance Social Security and strengthen Medicare. She'll continue President Obama's reforms to make sure Wall Street works for Main Street, not the other way around. She'll make sure America continues to lead the world in the 21st century. ... And, like President Obama before her, she will make history. ... Hillary Clinton will not just make an outstanding and worthy successor to President Obama. She will be a president we should all look back on and be proud we did whatever we could to make it so. She will do big and important things.\"\n19. Steve Benjamin, mayor of Columbia, South Carolina, and president of the African American Mayors Council\n\"Whether it's her vision for economic fairness and shared prosperity or her steadfast commitment to comprehensive criminal justice reform—it's clear that Hillary Clinton is the best candidate to be our next president.\"\n20. Gabby Giffords, former congresswoman and gun violence prevention advocate\n\"Talk is cheap. ... Only one candidate for president has the determination and toughness to stand up to the corporate gun lobby—and the record to prove it. That candidate is Hillary Clinton.\"\n\" I believe in her now.\"\n21. America Ferrera, actress\n\"I believed in her then, I believe in her now.\"\n22. Claire McCaskill, senator\n\"I can't imagine anyone who has run for president in my lifetime that has stronger qualifications to be President than Hillary Rodham Clinton. The majority of this country is going to want substance and stability over anger.\"\n23. Ricky Martin, performer\n\"Hillary has been a fighter for us for years, from supporting equal workplace legislation to working for equal rights for trans Americans. ... Growing up the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, I never dreamed that I would one day be a proud, out gay father of two beautiful little boys, in a country where marriage equality was the law of the land. Now, that's just an average day—that's what real progress is. Hillary knows this, and she's not going to stop fighting.\"\n24. Claudia Kennedy, retired lieutenant general\n\"With her experience and foresight, Hillary Clinton is uniquely qualified to defeat ISIS as our commander in chief. She's developed a comprehensive plan to address not only ISIS, but also the broader radical Jihadist movement that includes al Qaeda.\"\n25. Dolores Huerta, activist\n\"Hillary has been a lifelong advocate for children and families. She stands up for workers and immigrants.\"\n26. Star Jones, lawyer and television personality\n\"For me it's a very easy choice. She is at the forefront of issues that are important to me and other women of color, including pay equity, health care and reproductive rights, increasing the minimum wage, paid family leave, among other things.\"\n\" We cannot let hate and discrimination determine the outcome of this election. \"\n27. Salma Hayek, actress\n\"Es incre?ble that the leading candidate of the Republican Party has been irresponsibly campaigning, using unfounded and insulting accusations against the Latino community to win votes. We cannot let hate and discrimination determine the outcome of this election. We owe it to the hardworking Latinos that came before us, to ourselves, and to our children, to show the people who unfairly label us as criminals and speak down to us that our community is strong, meaningful, and incredibly powerful. We are one of the largest, youngest, and fastest-growing groups in the United States of America. We deserve a candidate who respects the contributions we have made to this country and understands how important it is that our community continues to thrive, all while treating us con dignidad y respeto.\"\n28. Lena Dunham\n\"We live in a country where women still battle daily for our basic rights. Whether it's wage equality, access to birth control, or the right to press charges against our rapists with a measure of support and dignity, women are having to run twice as fast as their male counterparts just to stay in one place. So while Hillary Clinton's anatomy is not the reason I'm voting for her, I believe that nothing will send a stronger message to America and the world at large than electing a competent, experienced, and brilliant woman to the highest office in the land.\"\n29. Kathleen Turner, actress and chair of Planned Parenthood's Board of Advocates\n\"Planned Parenthood has issued its first-ever primary endorsement of Hillary because she's been fighting for women and families her entire life. In Arkansas, she launched the first rape crisis hotline in the state. In the Senate, she fought tirelessly for reproductive rights, access to birth control, and sex education. As secretary of state, women's health and women's rights were the centerpiece of her agenda. All that experience means that Hillary has the skills and the scars that no one else can match. She is the strongest, most qualified candidate for the office of president that I have ever encountered. But in an election, she'll only be as powerful as those who stand with her.\"\n\" She is a fighter; she's fighting for you.\"\n30. Tom Perez\n\"I'm a proud, progressive Democrat. ... She is a fighter; she's fighting for you. She's smart enough to get elected, smart enough and tough enough to govern effectively. And her North Star is the middle class, her North Star is working families, her North Star are those kitchen-table issues that keep people up across the country every night, fighting for good jobs, fighting for fair wages, fighting to make sure that women have an opportunity to succeed, fighting to make sure that everybody who works hard and plays by the rules can succeed. ... Hillary Clinton is a progressive who gets things done.\"\n31. Mara Keisling\n\"I'm so pleased that Hillary Clinton has outlined an ambitious and necessary LGBT agenda that would ensure transgender people are supported and protected in America. This year the epidemic of violence faced by transgender people has drastically worsened?particularly for transgender woman of color. Any person who wants to be president should be talking about such an important issue and putting forth bold proposals to secure full federal equality for all LGBT people, much like Hillary has done so comprehensively and thoughtfully today.\n32. Roberta Kaplan, GMHC co-chair and counsel for Edie Windsor\n\"Hillary Clinton has proven once again that she really 'gets it.' From legal rights, to trans rights, to ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic, her plan comprehensively and creatively addresses every major issue facing the LGBTQ communities. The very fact that a leading candidate for president has issued this type of proposal is itself historic and a testament to how far we have come, as well as how much farther we still need to go.\"\n\" I don't think anybody is better prepared to be president than she is.\"\n33. Madeleine Albright, former secretary of state\n'There are not a lot of people that have the brains that can deal with both domestic and foreign policy, and she can do that. I don't think anybody is better prepared to be president than she is.\"\n34. Kasim Reed, mayor of Atlanta\n\"Hillary Clinton has a heart for service and has spent her entire career working to expand opportunities for all Americans. As a champion for women's rights, thoughtful diplomacy, criminal justice reform, commonsense immigration policies and a clean energy economy, she has proven that she is the most capable candidate to lead our country. The City of Atlanta needs a partner like Hillary Clinton in the White House to continue supporting investments in infrastructure, transportation solutions, and expanding economic opportunities for working families.\"\n35. Olivia Wilde, actress\n\"The fact that she feels the plight of women and girls as the most important issue of the 21st century is a huge reason why I'm supporting her. ... I'm very excited to have not only a female candidate, but Hillary herself who has spoken so eloquently and passionately about the rights of women and girls around the world.\"\n36. Rini Sampath, University of Southern California student body president\n\"There's a lot at stake in this year's election: college affordability, women's reproductive rights, gun violence prevention, LGBT equality. The only person I can imagine protecting America's future and putting us on a path to progress is Hillary Clinton. I know she is the right candidate for us. I know she's the right candidate for a young person like me. I know she's the right candidate for Asian Americans like us, and immigrants coming from near and far.\"\n37. Hilda Solis, congresswoman\n\"Her commitment to promoting policies to develop alternative energy technologies and fighting global warming are only two of the many issues in which Hillary has shown her ability to lead. Senator Clinton also has a long record of working on issues that are important to women and to Latino families, such as education, healthcare and economic empowerment. I look forward to working to help elect Hillary the next president of the United States.\"\n\" Hillary will be a tremendous partner that delivers results. \"\n38. Joe Riley, mayor of Charleston\n\"Our next president must rise to the challenges facing our cities and our country, and Hillary will be a tremendous partner that delivers results. Hillary is the president that our nation's mayors need to build and expand the progress of President Obama.\"\n39. Karen Weaver, mayor of Flint, Michigan\n\"She has actually been the only, the only candidate, whether we're talking Democratic or Republican, to reach out and talk with us about, ?What can I do? What kind of help do you need?\"\n40. Julian Castro\n\"Having watched and respected for years now Secretary Clinton, I know that she appeals to Americans of all backgrounds and colors, different perspectives and walks of life. ... The difference between [Hillary] and the Republicans is that she respects the Latino community.\"\n41. Wendy Davis, former senator\n\"What those of us know who've been around the Texas scene for a long time is that Hillary and Bill Clinton cut their teeth organizing communities in South Texas and creating the kinds of relationships that show they understand the real needs of people, not only in this state, but across these United States.\"\n42. Abby Wambach, soccer player\n\"I think all candidates have such valuable things that they're going after and that they want to change about this country. But I think Hillary lines up with my personal value system. ... I want to make sure whoever is in the White House stands for the things that I stand for.\"\n43. Mazie Hirono, senator\n\"Hillary Clinton has fought her entire life to create opportunity and prosperity for American families, small businesses, and individuals. Our country needs Hillary's tenacious leadership now more than ever.\"\n\" When asked why I, a longtime progressive activist who has worked closely with Bernie Sanders in the Congress, am so strongly supporting Hillary, my answer is simple.\"\n44. Jan Schakowsky, congresswoman\n\"When asked why I, a longtime progressive activist who has worked closely with Bernie Sanders in the Congress, am so strongly supporting Hillary, my answer is simple: I really, really want a pro-woman woman to be the most powerful person in the world.\"\n45. Luis Guti?rrez, congressman\n\"Hillary is with the Latino community, and I am with her. She will do what is best for Latinos and all Americans. Hillary is poised to propel the country forward, and I'm proud to be with her.\"\n46. Barbara Boxer, senator\n\"I want people to remember that Hillary was a U.S. senator from New York when they were hit hard by those planes crashing into the World Trade Center. And I still get chills thinking about Hillary. She went and stood on the rubble after 9/11 with a mask on. And she knew at that moment what the first responders were facing, health-wise. And she fought and fought to make sure we never forgot about those first responders. And I'll never forget that.\"\n47. Randi Weingarten, AFT president\n\"In vision, in experience, and in leadership, Hillary Clinton is the champion working families need in the White House.\"\n48. Katy Perry\n\"Ladies! There are so many incredible opportunities for us that are possible: equal pay, paid leave ... and your choice to have a family when and if it's right for you! These are just some of the reasons I am standing with her and will continue to do so. [This] election is one of the most important ones in decades, and the choices we make will have a profound impact on women for years to come.\"\n49. Mary Kay Henry, president of SEIU\n\"Hillary Clinton has proven she will fight, deliver, and win for working families. SEIU members and working families across America are part of a growing movement to build a better future for their families, and Hillary Clinton will support and stand with them. This movement for economic, racial, immigrant and social justice is poised to turn out to vote in November with their families and communities and keep pushing elected officials to deliver once in office.\"\n50. Carol Browner, chair of the League of Conservation Voters\n\"With a history of leadership on the international stage and a commitment to protecting public health, Hillary Clinton is the leader we need to meet the climate crisis head-on.\"\n51. Lily Eskelsen Garcia, president of the NEA\n\"Clinton is a strong leader who will do what is best for America's students. For more than four decades, Clinton has fought to make sure all children have a fair opportunity to succeed, regardless of their ZIP code. ... she understands the road to a stronger U.S. economy starts in America's public schools.\"\n\" And when she goes into the Oval Office, she will bring our hopes and our dreams with her. \"\n52. Barbara Mikulski, senator\n\"We love Hillary, but why do we love Hillary? Well first of all, we know her. But most of all, she knows us. She knows our hopes and dreams, the needs and the people. She's been criss-crossing the country—having meetings, roundtables, and listening and listening and listening. She know that all bright leaders have to listen and learn from the people. And when she goes into the Oval Office, she will bring our hopes and our dreams with her. Hillary will be quite a fighter. She is already quite a fighter. We know her as a champion for the underdog. We know her as the champion for the little guy—and little gal.\"\n53. Chad Griffin, Human Rights Campaign\n\"We've heard the leading Republican presidential candidates repeatedly threaten to block our progress, and to revoke, repeal, and overturn the gains we've made during President Obama's two terms. While they fight to take us backwards, Hillary Clinton is fighting to advance LGBT equality across our nation and throughout the world. We are proud to endorse Hillary Clinton for president, and believe that she is the champion we can count on in November—and every day she occupies the Oval Office.\"\n54. Debbie Stabenow, senator\n\"I have seen Hillary fight from the first time I met her when we were on a panel together in Detroit. She was there talking about children and child abuse on behalf of the Children's Defense Fund. I was in awe. I said, ?Who is this woman?' Because she was so passionate and so articulate. I saw that same fight again when we came into the Senate together after the 2000 election. Whether it was equal pay, whether it was fighting to close loopholes to bring jobs home, whether it was lowering the cost of college, mental health, Hillary is someone you can count on to be there for you.\"", "timestamp": "2016-01-20", "title": "Press Release - Here's What 54 Leading Progressives Think About Hillary Clinton"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118119", "text": "During his State of the Union address, President Obama focused on America's future and discussed the progress we've made on the economy since 2009. America is in the middle of the longest streak of private-sector job creation in history. Manufacturing has created nearly 900,000 new jobs in the past six years and the auto industry had its best year ever in 2015. And while there's more work to be done to ensure a growing economy that works for all Americans, today, President Obama is visiting Detroit to experience firsthand the remarkable progress made by the American auto industry, the city and its people and neighborhoods.\nWhen President Obama took office, the American auto industry was shedding jobs by the hundreds of thousands, with GM and Chrysler on the brink of failure and facing the possibility of liquidation—which estimates at the time suggested would have caused at least 1 million more jobs to be lost across the supply chain and around the country. Detroit was flat on its back, with unemployment headed to a peak of more than 25 percent. Many in Washington opposed providing government assistance and were ready to write off not just the American auto industry but the entire City of Detroit.\nPresident Obama made the tough call in his first few months in office to place a bet on American workers and American manufacturing—and to place a bet on Detroit—by providing temporary Federal assistance to rescue the American auto industry. He also initiated a broader commitment to the City of Detroit that has been sustained and ongoing through a team of federal staff that partner with the Mayor, local business and community stakeholders to deliver tailored assistance, identifying unique programs and resources that have helped the people of Detroit get back on their feet. Because he acted quickly and aggressively, and demanded real change as a condition for government assistance, the American auto industry not only avoided a much deeper collapse but bounced back stronger than ever. Because he required the auto industry to modernize in exchange for that support, we are now producing the vehicles of the future that will enhance America's competitiveness in the 21st Century and further reduce our dependence on oil.\nThe Administration's efforts in Detroit include the continuous engagement of top Federal talent to support the Mayor, his team, and local partners—from City Hall officials to neighborhood advocates—tailoring Federal government support to address Detroit's unique needs and opportunities. Alongside the progress of the auto industry, Detroit has made significant strides too. Unemployment in the city has been cut by more than half, and is now at its lowest levels since 2003. And because of the grit and determination of the people of Detroit and the President's support, the city has begun a turnaround with brighter days ahead.\nToday, President Obama is visiting Detroit to witness that progress up close. He will have lunch with Mayor Mike Duggan and special guests; deliver remarks at the United Auto Workers-General Motors (UAW-GM) Center for Human Resources on the Detroit Riverfront; and tour the Detroit Auto Show to see the 21st-Century cars, trucks, and auto technology that will help the American auto industry stay on top.\nThe Auto Rescue and the Auto Industry Resurgence\nIn late 2008, the American auto industry was on the brink of collapse. Access to credit for auto loans dried up and sales plunged 40 percent. In the year before President Obama took office, the industry shed over 400,000 jobs. Both GM and Chrysler were only weeks away from running out of cash and collapsing. Both companies faced the stark choice of seeking government support or facing almost certain uncontrolled liquidations, as no private source of credit was available anywhere near the scale needed. In this context, the Bush Administration extended short-term bridge loans to GM and Chrysler, but left it to President Obama to ultimately make the decision about how to resolve the industry's historic crisis and what role, if any, the federal government should play. Following is a brief rundown of how the rescue played out:\n• Additional Government Support Was Deeply Unpopular: Providing additional support to the auto industry was strongly opposed in Washington. The auto rescue was described by Republicans in Congress as \"the road toward socialism\"; \"nothing more than another government grab of a private company\"; \"without any plausible plan for profitability\"; and \"the leading edge of the Obama administration's war on capitalism.\" Both a December 2008 poll and a March 2009 poll found that more than 60 percent of Americans were opposed to the government extending assistance to General Motors and Chrysler to help them stay in business.\n• President Obama Required Fundamental Change in Exchange for Support: On March 30, 2009, after studying the plans submitted by GM and Chrysler, President Obama decided that he would not commit any additional taxpayer resources to these companies without requiring fundamental change and accountability in return for assistance. He rejected their initial viability plans and demanded that they develop more ambitious strategies to reduce costs and increase efficiencies.\n• The Damage from Allowing GM and Chrysler to Fail Would have been Immense: President Obama also recognized that failing to stand behind these companies would have consequences that extended far beyond their factories and workers. GM and Chrysler were supported by a vast network of auto suppliers, which employed three times as many workers and depended on the auto companies business to survive. An uncontrolled liquidation of a major automaker would have had a cascading impact throughout the supply chain, causing failures and job loss on a larger scale. Because Ford and other auto companies depended on those same suppliers, the failure of the suppliers could have caused those companies to fail as well. Also at risk were the thousands of auto dealers across the country, as well as small businesses in communities around the country that rely on the ongoing income from auto workers. Some experts estimated that were GM and Chrysler allowed to liquidate, at least 1 million additional jobs could have been lost. In addition, the cost to the government to provide social safety net services and health care to these workers and communities would have been substantial.\n• The President Placed His Bet on the American Auto Worker: To avoid this outcome, the President decided to give Chrysler, GM, and their stakeholders a chance to show that they could take the tough but necessary steps to become viable, profitable companies. Following the emergency loans to Chrysler and GM and a revamp of their businesses - with a total of $57 billion of additional taxpayer support committed by the Obama Administration - the companies returned to profitability, became more competitive, and served as engines for growth, leading a nationwide manufacturing recovery. By the end of 2014, the Administration exited the last investment under the auto rescue. Every dime of the funds provided by the Obama Administration had been repaid.\nHere are just a few indicators of the progress in the American auto sector since 2009:\n• Strongest Auto Job Growth on Record: Since Chrysler and GM emerged from bankruptcy in mid-2009, the auto industry has added more than 646,000 jobs across manufacturing and retail, the industry's strongest growth on record. The more than 300,000 auto industry manufacturing jobs have led a manufacturing sector that has added nearly 900,000 jobs since job growth began nearly six years ago.\n• American Auto Production has Doubled and Auto Sales are at an All-Time High: America is once again a world leader in auto production and technology. Auto sales in the U.S. reached a record level of 17.4 million units in 2015, the strongest in history. And domestic production has more than doubled from below 6 million units per year in the depths of the crisis to about 12 million in 2015.\n• The Detroit Three are Hiring, Profitable, and Investing in the United States: GM, Chrysler, and Ford are adding jobs, generating profit, and investing in their U.S. facilities. Since GM and Chrysler exited bankruptcy, the Detroit Three have invested in facilities and added shifts at plants all across the country, totaling more than $30 billion in domestic investment. Each of the companies is now positioned to compete globally and conducting R&D on state-of-the-art fuel efficient, electric, and autonomous vehicles. The companies' most recent agreements with the UAW commit to additional investments, additional raises, and additional jobs.\n• International Automakers are Investing in the United States Too: International automakers—recognizing the quality of our workforce and the strength and dynamism of the American economy—have $52 billion invested in U.S.-based production facilities and directly employ more than 97,000 Americans.\n• American Automotive Products Exports are up 89 Percent Since 2009: In 2014, the total value of U.S. automotive products exports was $160 billion, up 89 percent from 2009. And more than 60 percent of those exports in 2014 went to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) region, highlighting the opportunities presented to the American auto industry by the tariff cuts and elimination of non-tariff barriers included in TPP.\n• American Auto Technology is Again the Envy of the World: Due to American innovation and commonsense fuel efficiency standards, the fuel economy of new vehicles sold in the U.S. is at an all-time high, the cost of batteries has fallen 70 percent, and the distance our electric cars can travel on one charge has increased significantly. American automakers are expanding consumer choice and leveraging this progress to design lower-priced low-carbon and electric vehicles that are poised to be strong competitors in the global market while incorporating new technologies that have the potential to save thousands of lives per year. And they are not slowing down; one automaker recently announced they sought more patents for breakthrough technologies last year than they have in the last 100 years.\n• Ramping Up Investments and Writing the Rules of the Road for the Auto Technologies of the Future: Autonomous vehicles (or \"self-driving cars\") have the potential to transform transportation, giving us the chance to lead the world in a technology that can save lives, reduce emissions, and give new mobility to millions of elderly and disabled Americans. The President and his Administration are taking bold new steps to make that a reality, including by proposing to invest $4 billion in autonomous and connected vehicle research, development, and deployment efforts. To help accelerate deployment, last week Secretary Foxx announced at the Detroit Auto Show that he would take new regulatory action to move beyond piloting and testing for self-driving vehicles. Among those efforts will be redefining regulations in order to enable technology innovation, establishing a paradigm for testing and performance standards to ensure vehicle safety, partnering with states on model state legislation to prevent a patchwork of approaches that would slow down innovation, and proposing updates to our national rules of the road to accommodate self-driving vehicles. In addition, earlier this year the Administration launched a $40 million Smart Cities Competition to challenge mayors across the country to develop strategies for deploying self-driving cars, autonomous vehicles, and smart sensors to prototype the future of transportation in their cities.\nFederal Support for a Resurgent Detroit\nOver the past seven years, this Administration has been steadily taking a different approach to engaging in communities—disrupting an outdated, top-down way of doing business, and transforming the Federal government into a more effective partner for local stakeholders. This approach has led to the launch of numerous initiatives and partnerships in places across the country, such as the Strong Cities Strong Communities initiative, memorialized by a 2012 Executive Order, to embed full-time Federal staff with city governments to provide capacity and technical assistance to cities in economic crisis\nThe Administration has had a Strong Cities, Strong Communities team on the ground in Detroit since 2011. Detroit was one of the original fourteen cities to receive full-time Federal staff embedded in the city government to provide capacity and technical assistance by working directly with city leaders, local business, philanthropy, neighborhood and community leaders to identify federal resources, cut through red tape, and ultimately co-develop solutions with city leadership, helping local partners achieve their economic goals. In 2013, when Detroit filed for bankruptcy, the President appointed a special federal coordinator and interagency team to provide additional sustained municipal capacity and customized technical assistance, and assist in identifying existing federal resources to support the city. Detroit's challenges were decades in the making and will not be resolved overnight, but this collaboration has led to some notable and steady progress.\nToday, the Detroit Federal team is working to provide a \"one-government\" approach, bringing federal resources and expertise across agencies together to support Detroit. At the direction of the President, this robust on-the-ground engagement with Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan has yielded impressive results. This partnership has led to many recent accomplishments, including:\n• Significant Progress Toward Blight Elimination: The Treasury Department's Hardest Hit Fund provided Michigan with more than $130 million that was directed to the City of Detroit for demolition. Detroit has taken down over 7,500 blighted structures in under two years while maintaining a careful balance between program speed, environmental impact, and cost. Independent studies found a payoff of more than 4:1 in increased property values as a result, and even greater increases where demolition was combined with other neighborhood improvements. Building auctions and rehabilitation are incorporated where possible and vacant lots are available for neighbors to purchase for $100.\n• Going from Half the City in the Dark to High-Efficiency Lighting Everywhere in Less than Two Years: In 2014, nearly half of Detroit's 88,000 streetlights were dark. The Department of Energy provided technical assistance on advanced lighting to the newly established Public Lighting Authority (PLA), and in less than two years, the city will go from being in majority darkness to being re-lit with a smaller carbon footprint. Early estimates show that the LED street lights will save nearly 46 million kilowatts of energy per year, resulting in nearly $3 million in annual cost savings for the City. Anticipated emissions reductions are equivalent to the annual emissions from 10,993 passenger vehicles.\n• Supporting Workforce Training for Young People, the Long-term Unemployed, and the Formerly Incarcerated: Detroit received a $5 million demonstration grant from the Department of Labor to support additional workforce training for youth and the long-term unemployed. A portion of the funds is used to support an American Job Center (AJC) within a correctional facility and to launch a job preparation program for citizens returning to civilian life from incarceration. Detroit's My Brother's Keeper (MBK) Initiative works closely with these efforts to support returning citizens.\n• Meeting Detroit's Full Bus Schedule for the First Time in Decades: With the support from a $25 million Department of Transportation grant, Detroit purchased 80 new buses so that the city can now, for the first time in decades, meet its full bus schedule. There are now 192 buses on the road daily, the most in more than 20 years, and 24-hour service was recently announced for some key routes. Ridership is up by 25,000 to 50,000 trips per week since adding the buses last year, while customer service complaints are down 20 percent.\n• Innovative TIGER Grants to Support a Regional Transit Authority and M-1 Rail: The Department of Transportation provided more than $25 million in TIGER grants to Detroit for the new M-1 Rail that connects the Downtown and Mid-Town corridors. The funding for the M-1 Rail inspired the creation of the Regional Transportation Authority (RTA), a long-sought goal of transportation planners.\n• Supporting Expanded Affordable Housing: In 2014 and 2015, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) closed on financing for 14 multi-family development projects, including substantial renovation or new construction of over 1,400 units of affordable and market-rate housing (with 600 renovations completed to date). HUD also provided over $16 million in capital funds to the Detroit Housing Commission to assist in the operation and renovation of Detroit's public housing units, which has been returned to local control after a decade in receivership.\n• Investing in Green Infrastructure That Prevents Flooding: In the aftermath of a flooding disaster in August 2014, HUD provided $8.9 million for green infrastructure projects that will redirect water out of the over-loaded sewer system and into more sustainable gardens, bioswales, and tree plantings. The Environmental Protection Agency, in partnership with foundations and non-profits, has supported projects that allow vacant lots to be converted to rain gardens.\n• Developing a Comprehensive Plan for Spurring Manufacturing: Detroit was one of the first 12 communities designated as an Investing in Manufacturing Community Partnership (IMCP)—a Federal initiative to support comprehensive economic development strategies designed by communities. Through the Advance Michigan initiative, over thirty partner organizations banded together to build the region's capabilities to master the next frontier of automotive technology and manufacturing through new supplier networks, infrastructure, export and foreign direct investment opportunities, and more. The IMCP designation also prompted Advance Michigan and its partners to commit to $177 million in training and workforce development activities to upgrade the region's talent infrastructure through new talent attraction and training in the latest manufacturing technologies for incumbent workers.\n• Supporting Groundbreaking Auto Parts Research through Manufacturing Innovation Hubs and over $140 million in Public-Private Funding Going to Detroit: In 2014, Detroit won the competition for the Department of Defense's Lightweight Innovations for Tomorrow (LIFT) lab, bringing over $140 million in public-private investment in cutting-edge manufacturing research to Detroit's oldest neighborhood, Corktown. In 2015, the Department of Energy's Institute for Advanced Composites Manufacturing Innovation (IACMI) announced plans to co-locate some of its work with LIFT. This co-location joins two research facilities, reflecting how materials need to be joined and work together in cars of the future: lightweight metals working with advanced composites.\n• Bolstering Economic Development: The Department of Commerce's Economic Development Administration has invested over $5 million in the Detroit area since 2010, including NextEnergy's improvements to a battery testing facility, as well as funds to support an advanced energy storage system cluster and developing an advanced manufacturing cluster. The Department of Energy awarded funds to NextEnergy to support clean energy small businesses and entrepreneurs.\n• Strengthening Global Engagement: Detroit sits on an international border with Canada that is the site for the New International Trade Crossing (NITC) approved in 2015. The Detroit-Windsor Border is the richest border in the world with more than $350 million in trade crossing every day, making global engagement an underused asset in Detroit's recovery. To that end, the State Department helped the Mayor launch the City's first-ever Mayor's Office of International Affairs in October, with Secretary Kerry. The team is assisting the Mayor in creating the city's first global engagement strategy, finding resources, leading trade missions, and developing a refugee resettlement strategy to support resettlement of refugees from Syria in support the of Administration's policy.\nIn 2016, the Federal-Detroit partnership will continue to address the Mayor's priorities in expanding access to mortgage finance, building the workforce training system, developing Detroit's resiliency, and supporting global trade that benefit Detroiters.", "timestamp": "2016-01-20", "title": "Fact Sheet: How Bold Investments By the Administration in the Auto Industry and City of Detroit Put Americans Back to Work and Strengthened the Economy"}

In his remarks, he referred to Cindy Estrada, vice president, International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW), and her son Jason White; former Rep. John D.

Hello, Detroit! Oh, it's good to be back in Michigan, even though it might be just a little cold here. [Laughter] But I'm from Chicago, so I'm used to it.\nA couple people I want to start off by introducing. First of all, Detroit is coming back, and everybody deserves credit for that. But one person who deserves special credit for it is your mayor, Mike Duggan. He's doing an outstanding job. So we're very proud of him. You've got four outstanding Members of Congress: Debbie Dingell; the \"Dean\"—John Conyers; Brenda Lawrence; Sandy Levin. We've got one of the finest Congressmen who ever served and a great friend of Detroit; John Dingell is here. There he is.\nAnd a dear friend of mine—we drove over together. And I was just telling my team, when I was running for the United States Senate—not for the President—when I was running for the United States Senate and nobody knew who I was and nobody could pronounce my name—[laughter]—the regional leader of the UAW in Illinois was a guy named Dennis Williams. And he was my friend and supporter before just about anybody else out there. And then, when I ran for President, by that time, we'd made some great friends in the UAW, and so I just want to say how proud I am to call him a friend. Your UAW president, Dennis Williams.\nAnd give it up for Cindy for that outstanding introduction.\nAudience member. My mom!\nThe President. That's your mom?\nAudience member. That's my mom.\nThe President. That's her—are you proud of your mom?\nAudience member. I'm very proud of my mom!\nThe President. Oh, look at that. Well, you're, like, out of a TV show. What, are you, like, a child actor or something? Look at him. He's all handsome, all yeah. [Laughter] All right, Cindy, he's a pretty impressive young man.\nI want to pick up briefly on something that Cindy said, and that is just to talk for a second about what's happening in Flint. I am very proud of what I've done as President, but the only job that's more important to me is the job of father. And I know that if I was a parent up there, I would be beside myself that my kids' health could be at risk. And that's why, over the weekend, I declared a Federal emergency in Flint to send more resources on top of the assistance that we've already put on the ground. We've designated a Federal coordinator to make sure the people of Flint get what they need from their country.\nYesterday I met with Mayor Weaver in the White House, in the Oval Office, and I told her that we are going to have her back and all the people of Flint's back as they work their way through this terrible tragedy. It is a reminder of why you can't shortchange basic services that we provide to our people and that we, together, provide as a government to make sure that the public health and safety is preserved. But I have come to Detroit for another reason as well. I already drive in a great American car, which we affectionately know as the Beast. [Laughter] Next year, I've got to give it up. I'm saying goodbye to the Beast. So I figured that I needed to do a little browsing now at the Detroit Auto Show. I know they've got auto shows in Paris and Frankfurt and Tokyo. But there's only one Motor City. There's only one Detroit. And if you're looking for the world's best cars and the workers who make those cars, you need to be in Detroit, Michigan. That's why I'm here.\nAudience member. CT6!\nThe President. He said the GT6—CT6. All right.\nAudience member. Get that!\nThe President. Well, I'm looking at all of them now. [Laughter]\nAudience member. You get that Ford. [Laughter]\nAudience members. [Inaudible]\nThe President. All right, I've got the idea. I'm not going to tell you all what I'm buying now. [Laughter]\nAudience member. Jeep Grand Cherokee! [Laughter]\nThe President. Now, I will say, the Cherokee was my car—first new car I ever bought. Somebody was asking me—I didn't get a new car until I was, like, 32. [Laughter] I always had an old, beat-up hoopty. [Laughter] But my first brand-new car with the brand-new car smell was a Jeep Cherokee. And I thought I was a bad man once I was in that car. [Laughter] I was all up high, looking at the road. Man. [Laughter]\nI could not be prouder of this industry and the road that we've traveled together. And I'm proud of each and every one of you. Think about what you've fought through. It wasn't that long ago that a crisis that started on Wall Street sparked a great recession on Main Street, and it cost millions of Americans their jobs, their homes, the savings that they had worked a lifetime to build. Nearly one in five autoworkers got a pink slip, laid off from a job in an iconic industry that had been a ticket to the middle class for generations. And across the Midwest, plants closed with little hope of reopening.\nSo the American auto industry, the beating heart of American manufacturing, was flatlining. That's where we were when I took office 7 years ago today. The year before I took office, the auto industry had laid off 400,000 people—400,000. And we had a choice to make.\nWith the economy in a freefall, the markets frozen, there were no private companies, there were no private investors who were going to step up and take a chance on you. So we could have kept on handing over billions of taxpayer dollars to automakers, but things didn't change and it just got worse—that would have just kicked the can down the road. Or we could have done nothing, thrown in the towel, walked away from this industry entirely. And a lot of folks suggested we do that. They'd deny it later, but that's what they said at the time.\nAudience member. But not you!\nThe President. Think about what that would have meant for America. GM and Chrysler would not exist today. Suppliers and distributors that get their business from those companies would have died off. And when that happened, Ford could have gone down too. Because those supplier chains are vital to all three industries—or all three companies. Production stopped. Factories shuttered. Proud companies chopped up, sold off for scraps. And all of you, the men and women who built these companies with your hands, would have been hung out to dry.\nMore than 1 million Americans would have lost their jobs at the worst possible time. Not just autoworkers, but the people in communities that depend on you: the teachers who teach your kids, the small-business owners who know your name. Their livelihoods were at stake as well.\nAnd so we decided we're not going to let that happen, and we came up with another option. In exchange for help, we demanded responsibility. We said that the auto industry would have to truly change, not just pretend like it was changing. The industry retooled, it restructured. Management and labor got together to settle your differences. Everybody put some skin in the game. Everybody sacrificed for the sake and survival of this industry.\nAnd it wasn't popular. It wasn't even popular in Detroit. [Laughter] Wasn't even popular in Michigan. But I said at the time, I didn't run for President to be popular. I ran for President to do what needed to be done. And I placed my bet on you. And after visiting auto plants across the Midwest and seeing what you have done firsthand, let me tell you, I'd make that same bet any day of the week. Because today, factories are humming, business is booming, the American auto industry is all the way back—all the way back.\nSeven years ago, auto sales hit a 27-year-low. Last year, they hit an alltime high. Across the country, workers who thought that they'd never make another car again can't make them fast enough. You guys see it. New shifts are coming on. The Big Three are starting to boost wages. Since our plan kicked in, the American auto industry has added more than 640,000 new jobs. And because everybody came together and everybody worked together, not only are you producing more cars, but they're some of the most high-tech, most fuel-efficient, best looking cars in the world. They're designed and engineered and forged and built right here in the United States of America.\nAnd because the auto industry came back, that obviously gave the capacity for Detroit to start coming back. So you've now cut the city's unemployment rate by more than half. Folks aren't writing off Detroit anymore. Starting 5 years ago, I sent some of my top people across the Federal Government to help City Hall and ordinary citizens to spark that comeback here in Motor City. So today, you've got buses that are running again, streets that are well lit again, new homes and businesses getting off the ground again. There's still plenty of work to do, but you can feel the difference. You can feel something special happening in Detroit.\nI stopped by a restaurant to have lunch with the mayor and a good friend of mine, Tom, who has started Shinola here, and one of you outstanding autoworkers, and an emergency room doctor. What was that restaurant's name?\nAudience member. The Jolly Pumpkin!\nThe President. The Jolly Pumpkin. It was—that was tasty stuff. [Laughter] And then, I went over to Shinola and—now, I already had this Shinola watch. It's a good-looking watch. Made right here. And for you who don't know the story of Shinola and how it started—a factory here in Detroit and hiring folks who had never been involved in manufacturing before, and now it's got over 500 employees, and it's shipping these spiffy-looking watches and bicycles and belts and wallets and purses. And this is some good-looking stuff.\nAnd the people who work there—we were talking about how there was a woman who was homeless, got a job there as a janitor, is now the supervisor of one of the assembly processes over there to make the watches. Completely turned her life around. Well, that's the story of Detroit when you give people a chance, when you have confidence in what we can do together.\nAnd so what's true of Detroit is true of the country. And that's part of the reason I came here. I'm shopping for a car—[laughter]—but right now I want people to remember how far we've come. And it's not—I'm not running for office again. The reason I want to remind people is not because I'm on the ticket, it's because I want America to have confidence in where we can go.\nThis was—I talked about this at the State of the Union Address. Seven years ago, we put in place new plans to help hard-working families get back on their feet. We put folks back to work rebuilding roads and bridges. We passed big, new, middle class tax cuts. We asked the wealthiest Americans, who were doing fine, even through the recession, to pay a little bit more, we—pay their fair share. We rethought our health care system. We reinvented our energy sector. We put in place the toughest Wall Street reforms in history. And today, businesses like this one have added more than 14 million new jobs. This has been the longest streak of job creation in our history—in our history.\nThe United States of America right now has the strongest, most durable economy in the world. We're doing so much better than other folks are doing. The American economy right now is 10 percent bigger than it was at its peak, before the financial crisis. In Europe, it hasn't gotten back to where it was back in 2007, 2008.\nAudience member. Thank you, Mr. President!\nThe President. We've added more jobs than almost all the other advanced countries combined during this period.\nSo when you hear people—I won't say who—but when you hear people—[laughter]—claiming that America is in decline, they don't know what they're talking about. They're peddling fiction during a political season. And it's strange to watch people try to outdo each other in saying how bad things are. When one says our economy is terrible, the next says it's terrible and on fire and covered in bees. [Laughter] And they'll just come up with stuff. They're racing to see who can talk down America the most.\nBut remember—and this is why I want everybody to remember—these are the same folks who would have let this industry go under. These are the—some of the same folks who back in Washington called our plan to save the auto industry \"the road to socialism,\" said it was going to be a \"disaster,\" said, \"They'll run it into the ground.\" Those are quotes, by the way. I'm not making that up. Look it up. [Laughter] And so when I hear today some of these folks running for President, who can't bring themselves to admit what you guys have accomplished, I don't want you to take that seriously. Because when you ignore the progress we've made, then you're not going to make good choices about where we need to go in the future.\nIf they're still trying to spin a tale that the auto rescue was a bad idea, the same folks who predicted that you'd fail, they had other predictions about policies too. They predicted gas prices would hit $6.50 a gallon. I don't know what you all are paying right now, but it ain't no $6.50. In most places, it's $2 or less. On the way here, we saw gas for less than 2 bucks. But that's what they said: It's going to be $6.50.\nThen, they predicted, \"Oh, the deficits are going to go way, way up.\" We cut our deficits by almost three quarters. They've been below average for the past 40 years. They said, \"We'll get unemployment to 6 percent by 2016.\" Well, we got it down to 5 about a year ahead of schedule—of their schedule.\nThis is the crowd that was dead set against betting on you and your hard work and your professionalism and your skills. They've somehow still convinced themselves that cutting taxes for folks at the very top is going to help you succeed. I think there's a better plan. By the way, they said when I—when we raise taxes on the folks at the very top who had been doing great, they said, \"Oh, well, that's going to kill jobs.\" And guess what, 70 months straight of job creation now. Just like they said when Obamacare passed, \"Oh, that's going to be terrible\"—18 million people with health insurance who didn't have it before.\nSo, now, this is not to make an argument for complacency. I'm not suggesting we should be satisfied where we are. Because what is true is, the economy has been changing in profound ways for the last 20, 30 years. You've all seen it. Technology has made it easier to replace jobs on the assembly line. That's been going on for a long time. Any job where work can be automated is in danger of being replaced. The attacks on unions have been going on for a long time. And when union participation is down, workers have less leverage to get a raise.\nThe fact that companies can move because of increased technology means more global competition. And all these trends have squeezed workers, even when they've got jobs, even when the economy is growing, which means that a lot of Americans sometimes feel anxious. And that tells us we've got more work to do. But as I said at the State of the Union, if we're going to solve those problems for working families and middle class families, for your neighbors, for your friends, for your kids, your grandkids, then we've got to have smart answers, not just a bunch of fantasies that end up helping the folks who don't need help.\nIn this economy, we've got to make sure that everybody who works hard has a chance at opportunity and security. And real opportunity in this new economy means every American has got to get the education and training they need to land a good-paying job. I know that any of your fathers or grandfathers who worked in an auto plant, they wouldn't recognize a plant today. It's just entirely different. And you've got to know computers, and you've got to have skills that didn't even exist a generation ago. So that means that we've got to really make sure our kids are properly trained.\nAnd the good news is, last year, our high school graduation rate reached another alltime high. And we've got to build on that progress with early childhood education for every child that needs it so they get a good start, and computer and math classes to make kids job-ready in this new economy. And we should recruit and support and pay properly great teachers for our kids. We've got to make college affordable for every American. And college doesn't mean necessarily a 4-year degree. It might mean a community college. It might mean a technical school. But we—you're going to need more than just high school, which is why I've laid out a plan to provide 2 years of community college at no cost for every responsible student. I'm going to fight to get that done, to get that moving this year.\nThen, we've got to think about real security. Now, this is a union facility. So you know the importance of secure health benefits and secure retirement benefits. But not everybody in this new economy has that. So real security in this new economy, in addition to encouraging workers to join together so they have a voice and some leverage, also means benefits and protections you can count on.\nWhen Social Security and Medicare are more than—important than ever, we shouldn't weaken Social Security and Medicare, we should strengthen Social Security and Medicare. For Americans that are short of retirement, benefits should be mobile, like everything else. That's what we did with the Affordable Care Act. The idea with the Affordable Care Act was not to replace employer-based care, but it was to say, if you lost your job—as some of you did—and you tried to buy it on COBRA, and it was so expensive, you couldn't even think about it; or if you decided you wanted to go back to school for more training; or let's say you decided you wanted to start a new business, you had a chance to still get some coverage at a reasonable price and good quality. And as I said, 18 million people have gained coverage so far.\nSo now we should make sure that when folks lose their job, the system works for them. For example, they should be able to get unemployment insurance that encourages retraining for a business that's ready to hire. And if a new job doesn't pay as much, there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that folks, if they take a job with the hope of retraining and ultimately getting a better job, in the meantime they can still pay their bills. And if you take a part-time job or a temporary job before you get—find that full-time job, you'd have some insurance, some cushion. And when folks are going from job to job, they should still be able to save for retirement and take their savings with them. See, all that would make this new economy work better for everybody.\nNow, even as we work to secure real opportunity and secure—and security for working families, we've also got to make sure that the system is not rigged against working families. Now, GM, Ford, Chrysler—those are all great companies. Shinola is a great company. I believe in private enterprise. I believe in the incredible dynamism of the American economy, and that's business. And we're—America's business is business. We love business.\nBut after years of corporate profits, we also have to make sure that business is sharing what it makes with the workers who make it. And that's the American way. I mean, Henry Ford used to talk about, I've got to pay my workers enough so they can buy my cars. That's good for business. And so working families are not going to get more opportunity or bigger paychecks by letting big banks or big oil or hedge funds write their own rules and do whatever they want. They're—you're not helping middle class families by allowing a tax on collective bargaining to go unanswered. And I'm not going to back down on my belief that we've got to have strong rules to protect the air that our kids breathe and the water that they drink. It is more important than ever.\nAnd by the way, I should just point out that the auto industry here in the United States has figured out that we can make more fuel-efficient cars that reduce the carbon pollution that's causing climate change and make a profit and put more people to work. There's no contradiction between creating jobs and economic growth and caring for the environment.\nAnd in this new economy, workers and parents and startups and small businesses, they need more of a voice, not less. So this year, I'm going to lift up some of the businesses who have figured this out: what it means to do right by your workers and the fact that that's good for your bottom line. A lot of our best corporate citizens are also our most creative and our most innovative. And in this new economy, it's that spirit of creativity and innovation that we need more than ever.\nSo you've got to be thinking about the future, not just the past. And that's what you're doing here in Detroit. You're not just making cars that people want today, you're thinking about cars that people are going to want tomorrow. When I was over at the auto show, I saw plug-in hybrids and electrics and fuel-efficient cars that can protect our planet, save people money at the pump. You're working on self-driving cars that one day could prevent accidents and save lives. This year, my administration is going to take steps to get more of those cars on the road. Right here at GM and UAW, we're teaming up to train American workers for the good-paying jobs of the future.\nThat's the kind of spirit that's going to lead us forward, that says we're all in it together, we've all got a stake in each other's success. It doesn't always get a lot of attention. But all across this country, if you just look for it, all kinds of good things are happening. And all the division and yelling and rudeness and controversy that gets spun up and manufactured, that's not who we are. That's not how we live on a day-to-day basis. You don't—at your workplace, everybody is on the same team trying to get the job done. You might have a disagreement; you try to figure it out. You don't start shouting. You don't start saying, well, I like those kind of people, but not those kind of folks.\nAnd by the way, the UAW, part of the reason it succeeded was, it was one of the first unions to realize that we're all in this together and didn't divide people up. You look at the history of the UAW: It was one of the first unions to say, no, we're going to take everybody. If you're working hard, if you're doing the right thing, trying to raise your family, we're going to be better off if we're hand in hand trying to make sure workers get a fair deal, even if we don't look like each other, even if we don't all worship at the same place. That's what built the UAW. That's what built America. [Applause] That's what built America.\nBut I see it all across the country. I see it in the Leathers family from Sterling Heights. So Steve Leathers—I just want to tell a quick story here—works for a company called Empire Wire and Supply. And during the crisis, they had to lay off nearly 20 percent of their workers. So Steve's friends were losing their jobs. His neighbors were losing their homes. So one night, he tells his wife if things didn't get better, they might have to leave too.\nSteve didn't know it at the time, but his 13-year-old daughter, Brianna, heard what he said—because, I've discovered, kids hear everything. So you all got to watch what you say around your kids. They'll repeat it back to you, sometimes, 10 years later. [Laughter] So without telling her dad, Brianna sat down and she wrote me a letter. Thirteen years old. She said, \"Dear President Obama, I am 13 years old, and I am worried about my family's future in Michigan. My dad,\" she wrote, \"works for a company that manufactures cables for the automotive companies. This industry isn't doing so well, but these guys are still doing okay.\"\nSo Brianna is here today. Where's Brianna? Wave. There you are, right there. She's older now. So Brianna is 13 years old now—or she's 19 years old now. This was 6 years ago. She's a young lady. She's working her way through Macomb Community College. Her twin brother, Brendan—is that Brendan right next to her? He's at Oakland University, half hour away. Dad is still in Michigan—that's dad. But today, Steve's future is very different.\nBut before the crisis, Steve's company had about 110 employees. Today, they've got nearly 200. Brianna says—she's looking back, and she says: \"I remember a lot of people getting laid off. They all have jobs now.\" Steve remembers what it was like back then; there was a panic. Now, he says, I'm 110-percent confident we're going in the right direction.\nNow, Steve and his family, they're just one example. But those stories are multiplying all across the country. We don't hear a lot about them. They don't get on TV. You won't always read about them in the newspapers. Sometimes, we take it for granted.\nBut I remember. And I read Brianna's letters. And that's why I've got so much confidence in the future—because of you. I know that we've got young students like Brianna and Brendan. I know we've got workers like Steve who've proven that we're tougher than any kind of times that we might face. I'm confident because every one of you who clock in every day and work as hard as you can, not just for your own sake, but for the sake of this industry and for the sake of the country and because you take pride in what you do. And when you see that car rolling down the highway and you know, \"Hey, I built that thing,\" and you know it's a great product, and it gives you a sense of being part of something bigger, that makes me confident about the future.\nI'm hopeful about our future because of every single American that I've met who never stopped believing that the people who love this country can change it for the better. You are what makes America great. And I want you to know that I have faith in you. And when I leave this office, I'll still have faith in you. And every day that I have the privilege of holding this office, I'm going to have faith in you.\nAnd we're going to work side by side to make sure more folks got jobs and more folks got better wages and benefits and more people have the ability to join a union when they want to and more people are able to start businesses and more people have health benefits and more companies are thriving. And this country is going to keep on moving forward. And I know it's going to happen because of you.\nThank you, Detroit. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2016-01-20", "title": "Remarks in Detroit, Michigan"}

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111551", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n12:58 P.M. EST\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. So, as you may know, the U.S. Conference of Mayors is meeting in Washington this week. And a significant group of mayors will be meeting with the President later today to discuss a range of issues. I asked for the three best mayors in America -- (laughter) -- to join me at the White House briefing today. A bipartisan group of the three best mayors in America have joined me today. And so what I am inclined to do is to give them the opportunity to make brief statements at the top, and then they'll stick around for a little bit to take some questions from all of you.\nSo I'll just introduce them all, and then we'll go from there. To my right is Mayor Sly James, the mayor of Kansas City, Missouri -- (laughter.) He was chosen specifically because he is one of the best three mayors in America. (Laughter.) To his left is Mayor Ashley Swearengin. She is the mayor of Fresno, California. And she is a Republican, but she is also somebody who committed to solving problems, and I think she is a good example of somebody who does not let partisan differences get in the way of actually trying to do the right thing for her city. She'll talk more about that. And then, to my left is Mayor Marty Walsh from the great city of Boston.\nMayor James, do you want to just start and we'll work our way across?\nMAYOR JAMES: I'll be happy to.\nWell, first of all, it's great to be here. And I noticed the groan when I was introduced. I guess that has something to do with the fact that the Royals are world champions. (Laughter.) Far be it from me. But I am here to say, first of all, that Kansas City has done quite well under this administration. We have been very fortunate to be the recipient of a $30 million Choice Neighborhoods grant that is being put to use in one of the gateway areas of Kansas City. We are involved in ConnectHome and ConnectED.\nThe Choice grant specifically is something that we treasure because it's a collaborative effort between universities, neighborhoods, and services and housing units that will really help change the dynamic in that part of our city.\nWe're also very fortunate that we've had great success and backing and support from the Department of Transportation with our streetcar project. At one point, we had the largest TIGER grant for streetcar of anyplace in the country. And Secretary Foxx was there. We've collaborated quite well with Secretary Castro on HUD issues, and we're engaged with him again on mobility issues.\nBut the thing that's most important to us is that we have, during the time that President Obama has been in office and I've been in office, we have been able to increase our jobs numbers by a tremendous amount; over 80,000 jobs have found their way to Kansas City. I don't say create jobs because I think, as a mayor, I don't create jobs. We simply try to build an environment in which jobs can foster. And we've done that by promoting entrepreneurs and startups.\nSo this has been an administration that has helped my city tremendously, and for that I'm grateful -- because, at the end of the day, we're trying to move an agenda along that betters the lives of our citizens and provides them with jobs and services that they need, and this has been an administration that has reached out to us -- without our asking a lot of times -- and done some very good things for the people of Kansas City, Missouri. Thank you very much.\nMAYOR SWEARENGIN: Well, I suppose we're starting with baseball credentials, so I'll just say Fresno is not far from San Francisco -- (laughter) -- and with the Giants championships on the table for all of you all to admire. (Laughter.)\nAnd with that, let me just say, good afternoon. I'm Ashley Swearengin, Mayor of Fresno, California -- a 515,000-person city right in the heart of the state. We're the fifth largest in California and also the 34th largest city in the United States.\nFresno is known for being the food capital of the world. We're also the fastest-growing region in California and we're known for our young and our diverse population. Unfortunately, in recent decades, we've also been known for chronic, long-term economic challenges, and a near financial crisis during the Great Recession.\nBut I'm very grateful and proud to say today that those economic conditions are being reversed in our city, in no small part thanks to partnerships with and support from the Obama administration. In 2011, Fresno was selected as one of six cities in the nation to participate in the White House's Strong Cities, Strong Communities initiative. As a result, we had half a dozen federal agencies that were assigned to our city to help us with our economic development plans, our downtown revitalization efforts, as well as our transportation infrastructure.\nIn addition, we had two federal officials actually move to Fresno -- they were embedded in the Mayor's office. They worked directly with local officials to help us really chart a new path for our city.\nSo almost five years later, the results are pretty incredible. We've developed, environmentally cleared, and adopted local land-use plans that are geared towards revitalizing the older parts of our city and really accommodating new growth in Fresno.\nLast year, California broke ground on its high-speed rail system. It's the first of its kind in the nation, and that happened in downtown Fresno.\nNext month we're breaking ground on another major public infrastructure project to support our downtown revitalization and our historic Main Street. Next week, we're issuing a contract to construct two new transit lines that are federally funded that serve major portions of our city.\nOn top of all of that, Fresno's unemployment rate has been cut in half. Chronic homelessness has dropped by 60 percent. And after coming dangerously close to having to file municipal bankruptcy in 2013, I'm very proud to say that Fresno has paid off all of our negative fund balances. We've begun to restore core city services, and we're just two years away from hitting our targeted general fund emergency reserve levels. That will be the largest such rainy day fund in the history of our city. And I say that to say I really am a Republican.\nChallenges in our city still remain, of course. We have much work to do, but our partnership with the Obama administration has been pivotal in helping Fresno reverse the course of many decades of decline and to chart a new future for our city.\nThank you.\nMAYOR WALSH: Thank you, Mayors. And before I start my formal remarks, I want to first of all say this is pretty cool. Usually as a mayor you don't say it's cool talking to the press. But today is one of those days. (Laughter.) So it's great to be here. And I have no idea why I'm up here because my sports credentials certainly don't fly with Kansas City. And I know that my little football team is playing Sunday, so sorry, guys. (Laughter.) But it's a great opportunity to be here.\nI want to thank Josh and I want to thank my fellow mayors for joining me today. One of the things -- I've been mayor of Boston now for -- heading into my third year. And one of the things that's been the most surprising about being mayor of a city is the support you get from the administration in Washington, D.C. -- never really expecting that.\nAnd President Obama and the White House has been tremendous partners in cities across America, particularly with -- and this is probably a little controversial -- particularly with the inability for Congress to act on so many different pieces of legislation that affect our cities. And the fact that that's not happening in Washington, D.C., it's really taken upon the mayors that we have to do more. We have to do more to try and get things done.\nAnd the Obama administration, the Obama White House has been a very good partner in many of those because they understand what it takes to move cities ahead and what it takes for cities to lead.\nBoston has been proud to answer the White House's call in ensuring health and safety in our communities, as well as growing opportunity for our children and all our residents.\nWe're investing right now because of initiatives working very closely with the administration in affordable homes. We broke our record last year in the city of Boston by creating 1,000 low-income, affordable homes. That's not all of the housing we've done in the city of Boston. That's a piece of low-income housing. We've been able to set records in other areas of housing.\nWe launched a citywide housing plan to create 53,000 units of new housing by the year 2030. We're into the First Lady's call to end veterans' homelessness. And I was happy to announce at my state of the city two nights ago that we ended chronic veterans' homelessness in the city of Boston. And we're working towards a goal of ending all chronic homelessness by the year 2018.\nWe're supporting our workforce by creating skill-building opportunities. Boston received a $3 million grant from the Department of Labor to go to apprentices and construction and hospitality. We're offering free salary negotiation workshops with the American Association of University Women for women to help women understand and help them negotiate when they're going for a job so that the economic gap that they have with men gets closed. We're working on that.\nThe other night we were able to -- we also announced a task force to look at a $15-an-hour minimum wage in the city of Boston. We don't have the ability in the city of Boston right now to raise the minimum wage because it's a state law, but we're going to work through a task force to see how we can do that.\nWe established the first-ever parental leave policy to support workplace and creative development. Boston is also, I feel, a leader of community-police relations. My Brother's Keeper has been a tremendous success in our city where we've engaged the community, particularly young men of color. But we're also tying in the young women of color, as well. And we're very active there.\nSome of our stats: violent crime this year in 2015, went down by 3 percent; property crime went down by 10 percent; homicide rates fell to a 16-year low; all the while our arrests also dropped by 15 percent.\nSo in Boston we don't believe in locking people up; we believe in lifting people up. And we're working to make that happen across our city.\nAnd in 2016, I look forward to working very closely with the White House to address the issue of substance abuse. The U.S. Conference of Mayors named me the chairman of the substance abuse task force. I have a great working relationship with Michael Botticelli, who works for the administration, and I look forward to working with the administration because substance abuse is in every single one of our communities all across America. It doesn't matter if you're a Democrat, Republican, independent, Green Party, drug addiction is affecting everyone. So the White House has made a real commitment. The U.S. Conference of Mayors have made a real commitment. I look forward to working with them.\nThank you.\nMR. EARNEST: Let's take some questions. Here. Tara, you want to go first?\nQ: Welcome. I'm from Kansas City.\nMAYOR JAMES: You're delightful. (Laughter.)\nQ: This is rare. Three people from Kansas City at the White House. I work at the BBC, and I'd like to ask you about race relations.\nMAYOR JAMES: Yes.\nQ: You talked about the administration and Kansas City. What has the President done to help Kansas City and the state also around Kansas City deal with race relations?\nMAYOR JAMES: Well, the best thing that he's done was he was elected twice. That in and of itself says something about race relations because there were -- before his election, there were people who believed that that was an impossibility. A lot of older African Americans thought they would never have an opportunity to see that in their lifetime. So the mere fact that he was elected is a tribute not only to him, but to this country and the fact that there were people in this country far surpassing the numbers of African Americans who had to participate in that election to elect him. So that gave us hope right off the bat.\nNumber two, he's been to Kansas City I think four times. It's not just because he likes the barbecue or my bowties. He's been there because we're doing things. And when he comes to the city and we're able to show the people of Kansas City that the President of the United States is in town, we're able to leverage that in the conversations about race.\nThe main thing that he has done is he's put into place a set of policies that in my city, we are able to build upon. TechHire, for example, allows us to put people who have been out of the workforce for over 18 months back into employment. That's something that takes place and is very important in the minority community. All of those things are important. The Choice Neighborhood grant is going to affect a racially discrete area of town, but it's also a diverse area of town. And those types of things are things that actually have an impact on people's lives, and those are the types of things that we use in order to leverage good conversations about race and race relations.\nMR. EARNEST: Justin.\nQ: Mayor Walsh, I was wondering if I could ask you about the minimum wage study that you announced a couple days ago. I think there's some question about whether you support a $15.00 minimum wage, or whether the study is to determine whether or not you'd support it.\nMAYOR WALSH: Both. I mean, the study is for both. I support a $15.00/hour minimum wage, but also we're going to have business leaders, non-profits, community engagement workers sitting down and talking about how would this be implemented, what the effects would be. I certainly support a $15.00/hour minimum wage. As a legislator, I voted for the increase in minimum wage a couple times in Massachusetts. But this is a task force to really look at how do we get there. And also, we're going to need a state law changed to be able to get there.\nQ: And is that something that you've been working with people here at the White House on? Or is that just something --\nMAYOR WALSH: No. Well, the President made the initiative -- spoke about it. And really, when the President starts talking about -- and Secretary Perez, when we start talking about the $15.00 minimum wage -- the Secretary of Labor -- a lot of conversations start happening in Boston. Cities like Seattle did it, and then it starts to go across the country. So a lot of people have been talking about it.\nWe have two hospitals in Boston -- Boston Medical Center and Tufts Medical Center -- that both increased their lowest wage to their employees to $15.00/hour. So we're starting to see the momentum going that way, so I felt it was the appropriate time. There was also a study that came out that said the income inequality gap is number one in the city of Boston in the country. So we have to address those issues.\nMR. EARNEST: Juliet.\nQ: Also for Mayor Walsh, this issue of substance. But again, if the other mayors want to speak to this, too. Obviously this is something that the President has elevated in recent weeks. Can you talk about what specifically you think this administration needs to do to help tackle this problem, and anything else you would say for context about how you think the national approach to heroin and prescription drug abuse has changed, given what we've been seeing nationwide?\nMAYOR WALSH: Well, first of all, just as far as a national approach, I think that the approach to addiction is very different in different cities and towns across America. So I think what we have to do is -- not one system is going to fix the problem when it comes to addiction. And I think, really, what the White House can do the best right now is sit down with the Conference of Mayors and work with us, and also with SAMHSA and with their own department, and figure out what's needed around the country.\nSome cities and towns have done some good things. Some states have done some good things. Some states have ignored it because it's the stigma around it. And when I say \"ignored\" I'm not saying in a critical way. It's like any family, any member watching this press conference right now, they have a loved one that's in the grips of addition, they can't talk to anyone, they're embarrassed, there's a stigma there.\nSo I think that part of what the White House can do the best is listen and then come up with some policies on how we address the issue.\nI think the fact that -- it can't be just a money situation; you can't just throw money at the situation, even though we do need money for detoxes and treatment centers. So I think we have to work on how do we get a continuum of care that can work that way, and how do we also get some best practices into our schools and into America to talk about how do we get prevention.\nAnd I think that the addiction that we're seeing today, particularly around prescription drugs, is something that we've never seen in this country before. We've had addiction for a long time, but because of prescription drugs, we see it rampant. And again, it's different in every city, but at the end of the day it comes down to a stigma. So I think that the White House can do a lot around it.\nQ: Is there anything that the other two mayors might want to say about what you've seen in your communities?\nMR. EARNEST: Okay. Kathleen.\nQ: I have a question for Mayor Swearengin. The President has lately been on a push to change the narrative around the economy, to change people's perception. As part of that, he's been really critical of Republicans, saying that they're talking down the economy and exaggerating problems. I'm wondering, from where you sit, if you agree with them on that.\nMAYOR SWEARENGIN: Well, certainly in our struggle in Fresno to deal with chronic, long-term unemployment. When we see good job reports -- for example, in 2014, our job creation rate was actually one of the highest in the nation and one of the best in the world. So, in Fresno, what we do is we celebrate that, we honor and recognize that achievement, but we also look at how high the mountain is that we still have left to climb.\nSo, usually what I find in these debates, whether it's right versus left, or the other way around, it's usually a both/and. It is both the case that there are good things happening, there's momentum, and there are strengths to build on. But it also is the case that there's a lot farther that we need to go. So that's our focus in Fresno, is celebrate the success, but then get back to work, because we know we need 10 years of good job performance to really be where we want to be as a city.\nMR. EARNEST: JC.\nQ: The mayor of Boston -- needless to say, tomorrow, within 24 hours, Mayor, we have a major snow event on its way. Your advice? (Laughter.) You know it well.\nMAYOR WALSH: Yeah, I do. I saw the mayor of Washington on TV last night, and I think that's number one. The best thing you can do is get on TV and talk about what the preparation is. Number two is make sure you have in the wings -- if Washington gets hit with two feet of snow, which we dealt with last winter several times, be prepared to reach out to your partners. My public works department in the city of Boston has already contacted me. If we don't get hit with the snow that's getting hit in Washington, we brought our two truck-mounted snow blowers last year to remove the snow off the street. So when I see the mayor later on today, I'm going to offer to her, if she needs these snow blowers to come to the city to help her, we will help.\nLast year, we had great help from around the country. The White House reached out to us right away. We had mayors from around the country that send their crews up and send their equipment up. We needed it. I mean, we had literally three weekends -- three blizzards in a row. We set a record, as you most of you in this room now, for all-time snow. And it didn't melt until March or April. And the last bit of snow melted in July -- I think it was July 17th. (Laughter.)\nSo I feel bad. I'm leaving tonight, and I'm going to hopefully watch on TV and I'll look out the window and see it. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Leslie.\nQ: Thanks. Mayor Swearengin, I had a question for you on -- the drought remains a critical problem in California. Have you talked to the administration? Is there more they could be doing on it?\nMAYOR SWEARENGIN: The drought is absolutely still a critical issue. In California, even though we're starting to see rainfall this year, it's a welcome sign. But the reality is we still need major cooperation between the federal and the state government to make sure that to the greatest extent possible we are keeping and storing that water because we know we are a long way from being out of this hole that we're in.\nSo it is always a struggle. It's a very complicated issue. And yes, I've talked with folks at the White House about the need to literally be in the weeds, counting the number of fish that may be close to a pump. And the second we have a chance to turn on the pumps and store some water, we have to do that. So it is a constant press for us from California here in D.C.\nQ: Do you feel like the administration is doing enough?\nMAYOR SWEARENGIN: I think they're very focused on the issue. I don't think yet we've seen the resolution that we need to see. And it's incumbent upon both the federal and the state government to really efficiently manage the water situation and the pumps. And of course there are great debates over exactly when the right moments are to turn them on. But as mayor of Fresno, all I can say is make sure that every drop of water that can be stored for next summer is being stored.\nMR. EARNEST: Kevin.\nQ: Mayor Walsh, first of all, my condolences to your team this weekend up in Denver. They're going down. Just letting you know now. (Laughter.) I do honestly want to say congratulations on GE. And this is probably for all three of you -- I want to talk about job attraction to cities and how you avoid brain drain. This probably doesn't happen often in Boston -- young people graduate, and they tend to stick around the hub. But what advice would you give to mayors and other leaders in middle-size and smaller cities to keep their brains in town? Because what happens is, often they'll graduate from college and they go to other places; whether in Kansas City, they move to Chicago or Denver; in Fresno, they go to Los Angeles or San Francisco. What advice would you give?\nMAYOR WALSH: Well, I think, first of all, we do everything we can to keep the talent in the city of Boston. We lose a lot of people in Boston. We have 25 college universities within the heart of the city, and 75 within the greater Boston, including Boston. So we have those conversations all the time in our city. Some of it is by trying to change some social perceptions of Boston as far as the nightlife and make it more lively.\nThe housing stock is a big key. Part of my reason for announcing the creation of 53,000 units of new housing is because the cost, the affordability of our city -- young people leave because they can't afford to live there. Also, trying to attract new businesses, tech and startup companies. The downtown Boston area, which is all skylines and big buildings and the financial district, in the past it's been insurance companies and financial services -- 35 percent of those companies [sic] are filled by high-tech companies.\nSo we have to constantly work at this every single day. GE was a very big win for the city of Boston, but it doesn't mean that we stop there. We have to continue to try and attract new businesses to our city. So what I would suggest to other cities, it's about quality of life. To keep young people, it's the jobs and quality of life. And part of that quality of life is what's the environment living in that city, is it a safe city, is it a walkable city, is it an affordable city. And I think those are the key components in trying to keep young people -- or attract young people.\nQ: How many jobs with GE, by the way?\nMAYOR WALSH: About a thousand.\nMR. EARNEST: Mayor James.\nMAYOR JAMES: We have a slightly different approach. I, frankly, believe that the day of chasing smokestacks from one area to another has become too expensive and too unpredictable. We like to try to grow our own and to create an atmosphere where people come from other places, like Boston, to Kansas City. And I certainly don't want to disadvantage Mayor Walsh or Mayor Swearengin, but the fact of the matter is, the competition right now is less for businesses than it is for talent. And we are definitely in the talent competition business.\nWhen we were chosen, along with Kansas City, Kansas, to be the first cities in the country to have a Google come in and install fiber, our phones lit up, our televisions lit up. Everything lit up with people curious about how that could be used in order to promote entrepreneurism and startups. And it's been very successful.\nWe started a place called Startup Village, which straddles the line between Kansas and Missouri, where people -- young people -- as a matter of fact, Mayor, there were two kids that showed up -- three kids that showed up at a reception for Code for America, and they came in off the street. I asked them where they were from, and they said they had just driven in from Boston to go live at Startup Village where they started their business that deals with software for home 3D printers. And they moved to Kansas City; they're still there.\nMAYOR WALSH: They must have left their Red Sox hats in the car. (Laughter.)\nMAYOR JAMES: They did -- because now they're all wearing Royals jerseys.\nQ: Oooh! (Laughter.)\nMAYOR JAMES: But we have a tremendously active entrepreneurial population with a lot of startups. We surprised Tech Week -- they brought Tech Week in on kind of an experimental basis, expecting 1,500 people; 4,000 showed up. And during the time of Tech Week, he had a launch code that we used, and we gave away $500,000 in $50,000 blocks to 10 selected entrepreneurial enterprises, which have now grown and are getting secondary and third-level funding.\nSo we're developing jobs at home, because we believe that if we develop the jobs there, they're more likely to stay. And the process of trying to chase the big companies costs cities way too much money in terms of incentives and such. So we want to make sure that we're building a city for the future that is attractive to people. And it doesn't hurt that we have a very reasonable cost of living in Kansas City. Anybody who wants to move to Kansas City, we have plenty of houses and you can afford them.\nMAYOR SWEARENGIN: I'll just chime in quickly and reinforce what my colleagues have said. And you'll notice a theme, when you're talking to mayors, every mayor has the best city ever. So we're all touting our city's credentials.\nSo, absolutely the case for mid-size cities -- there's no way that you should have any expectation that you can find the money necessary to become a major center, like a Boston; in our case, San Francisco or L.A. So you absolutely have to focus on, number one, build a great urban center in your community. Cities have to have the type of quality urban infrastructure. This generation wants to be in a downtown setting. So making sure your city center is as amazing as it can be, authentic and genuine to who you are as a community -- number one.\nNumber two, I'll repeat it again because it's that important -- entrepreneurship is really the key. So, in Fresno, we focus on entrepreneurship education. Started at the undergraduate level, developed a degree in entrepreneurship, taught a bunch of college students how to start their own businesses. And then went to the graduate level, then down to the community college level, then high school. We have the only high school in the United States that is dedicated entirely to entrepreneurship. And now, every fifth-grader in Fresno Unified gets entrepreneurship training, as well. So it's absolutely the case that we have to grow our own, knowing that that really will reap the benefits down the road.\nMR. EARNEST: Mark.\nQ: This is to all the mayors. What do you think of what's been going on in Flint, Michigan, the crisis there? The President yesterday seemed to think this was a real cautionary tale about neglecting infrastructure. Do you guys share that view? Have you been calling your water departments lately?\nMAYOR WALSH: First of all, I spoke to Gina McCarthy last week from the White House because our water and sewer department is one of the best in the country -- Boston Water and Sewer -- partly because of a federal court case that forced us to make some changes. So we're trying to reach out to the people of Flint, Michigan and help them with some of the infrastructure problems. That's an issue where I think mayors and the federal government have an obligation to come together and try and help another city that's in desperate need of support. And I think that anything that we can do from the city of Boston through the White House, which we're doing right now, we're going to offer any support we can. I think that's our obligation as mayors, to work with the administration. That's not a partisan issue; that's something that's right for the American people and for the people of Flint.\nMAYOR JAMES: I'd say that any time that you get more than three mayors in a room, there will be two subjects that are always going to be discussed. One is education and the other is infrastructure -- because we deal with infrastructure. And I know that these mayors will tell you that the businesses that reside in our cities are very keen about the infrastructure that's available to them and the impact it has on their ability to conduct business.\nInfrastructure has been neglected in this country and it needs to change, because if it does not change, we're going to be in serious trouble. At some point, it's going to become a national security issue, if it's not already. But infrastructure is huge, not just roads and bridges, but water infrastructure. In Kansas City, we're engaged in an EPA mandate now of an overflow control project; it's about 25 years on the horizon and about $4 billion. It's a very expensive and costly thing, but it's something, frankly, that we probably should have done 30 years and didn't do. Now we're paying extra to catch up. That's what happens when you neglect things -- that old thing that we had that our mothers taught are a \"stitch in time saves nine,\" we're going that with infrastructure, except it's a lot more serious and it's across the board.\nSo by addressing infrastructure in a positive and concrete way, we accomplish a couple things. We become stronger, we become more agile. We become more able to support our business and security needs. But we also put people to work. So infrastructure is huge. We don't have the water infrastructure problems that are going on in Flint, Michigan. That's also a very serious health problem. And frankly, it's horrible. There should not be people -- there should not be children in this country, in this day and age, drinking leaded water, especially with what we know, and certainly not for as long as it's been going on.\nSo we have to take care of our business, and that's a basic thing. Water is essential to life in this country, and it's something that should never have happened and hopefully will be rectified soon.\nMAYOR SWEARENGIN: I think about it every day. I see the reports every night on the news. And as I'm watching what's unfolding, I am stunned by the tragic circumstances. And I'm also grateful that in Fresno we took significant steps over the last three years to raise the rates, which nobody likes. No mayor ever wants to champion increasing water rates. But we knew in Fresno, for 25 years there has been talk about the need to upgrade our infrastructure, take better advantage of our surface water, stop pulling water up out of the ground, which is potentially contaminated.\nAnd it took us ultimately five years to get the rates passed. We went through lawsuits. We went through a voter referendum. But ultimately, those rates were passed. And as a result, we've got $600 million of infrastructure being spent to upgrade our water infrastructure. And frankly, I think ultimately Fresnans came to grip with the fact that we were going to have to invest in our water infrastructure, but all you have to do is turn on the TV and see what's happening in Flint to know that was the right decision. And while painful in the immediate term, it is the right thing to do for our kids, our grandkids, and our great-grandkids.\nMR. EARNEST: We have time for one more. Mike, do you want the last one?\nQ: Governor Brown is giving his state of the state address again today, and speaking of water, he's going probably address his Delta Fix plan. I wonder if you want to weigh in on that and what you think the impact might be. And then also, a political question -- it's not often you hear a Republican praising the White House and talking about their cooperation with the White House. To the extent that you might be on a statewide ballot again, I know there's this top two system, which is a little bit more unpredictable, but are you not worried about this clip being played down the road?\nMAYOR SWEARENGIN: Well, I'll take the second question first. And you know, my mom and my grandmother were always big when I was growing up in saying give credit where credit is due, and you always tell the truth. So it is the case that Fresno has been substantially supported and improved as a result of the work and our partnership with the Obama administration. To say otherwise would not be telling the truth.\nThat doesn't mean that in every circumstance I may agree with the administration. But it is absolutely the case that there's been good work done on behalf of the residents of Fresno. So I, as mayor, need to be the first one to help tell that story and speak the truth about what's been going on.\nWhether or not there are political consequences, there always are, but it doesn't matter. At some point, you have to choose a different path and choose leadership and do the right thing.\nAs far as the Governor's state of the union goes, I'm sorry to miss it. I've got other things going on here. But, look, I don't know that there is a more complicated issue in the United States than water issues in California. And I really applaud the Governor for taking on a comprehensive water fix. I know there will be lawsuits, challenges -- there are all kinds of complicated issues that have to be worked out.\nFresno is south of the Bay Delta, and so, obviously, we would benefit from more water coming south. But I certainly respect and appreciate, if that were my water in the Bay Delta, I would be fighting every bit as hard as we see people fighting there.\nSo, ultimately, my hope is that cooler heads can prevail, that there are technological solutions, that there are policy solutions. And honestly, if anybody can help figure this out it's going to be Governor Brown. So I'm certainly rooting for him to be successful in this effort.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, thank you for spending the time with us.\nQ: Mayor Walsh, any chance you can take Papelbon back with you? (Laughter.)\nMAYOR WALSH: We're focused on one football game right now at a time. (Laughter.) We'll focus on the Red Sox later on.\nMR. EARNEST: All right. I think the only thing I would add to their presentation is I drew a similar conclusion and made a similar observation I think, Kathleen, that you alluded to, which is that I think you saw three local leaders in different parties standing up here telling about how optimistic they are about the future of their communities. And I think that was indicative of the kind of optimism that most people are feeling about the direction of the country. And surely there is more work to be done, and the President is certainly looking forward to all the things on his to-do list over the course of this year, but there's no denying the important progress that's been made and the kind of momentum that we have built up.\nThe challenge for this country and the leaders of this country right now is how do we capitalize on that momentum, and how do we build on it.\nSo, with that, Kathleen, let's go to your questions and our regularly scheduled programming here.\nQ: Well, to change topics, I want to ask you about a British judge coming out with a report that says that President Vladimir Putin probably approved a plan to poison a Russian critic and spy, and I'm wondering if the White House had something to add to that.\nMR. EARNEST: Obviously, we've seen the reports about this inquiry and the conclusions that were drawn. This is a high-profile case for a variety of reasons. There are some salacious details involved and it does look to be lifted right out of a spy novel of one form or another.\nBut what it also points to is the way in which the political environment that currently exists in Russia seems to also extend, at least in some occasions, beyond Russia's borders. Inside Russia, we see that critics and political opponents of the Russian government are often subject to threats, intimidation, and in some cases, death. And this willingness to flout basic conventions around human rights and free speech and the ability to speak out and make your political views known, even if they are critical of the sitting government is something that we've long been concerned about inside of Russia.\nAnd I think this particular investigation is a reminder of why this is a source of such serious concern not just here in the United States but on the part of many countries around the world.\nQ: But you don't expect to take any particular action or issue any sort of direct warning to -- do you support Cameron --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we obviously -- in this case, the concerns that are expressed by the British government are unique because the incident took place on British soil. So their concerns are understandable and I think it makes sense that they're going to take some specific actions to try to address some of those concerns.\nI don't have any actions to announce today in direct response to these findings, but I certainly wouldn't rule out any relevant future steps. And some of that will involve a closer look at the actual investigation.\nQ: And then I also wanted to get your reaction to Sarah Palin's comments today. She was very critical, as a mother of a veteran, of this administration's support for veterans, particularly veterans suffering from PTSD. She blamed the President for some of her son's troubles. Did the President see those remarks? Do you know if he's talking to anybody about them? What's your response?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know if the President saw the remarks. I can tell you that the reaction of some people I think is to make light of some of the rhetoric that we see on the campaign trail, particularly from Governor Palin. But the fact is domestic violence is not a joke. Gun violence is not a joke. Problems with addiction are not a joke. And the consequences -- or I should say the sacrifices that many of our men and women in uniform make for our safety and security are not a joke. And these are issues that this administration is quite focused on. We take them all very seriously.\nAnd there are many communities and families that are dealing with these very difficult challenges in a way that sometimes is difficult to talk about publicly. But certainly this administration, over the course of the last seven years, and I'm confident over the year that remains, will be focused on many of the issues that are raised by this particular case.\nQ: So was she out of line? Are you saying she was taking it lightly?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I'm just saying that instinct that some people have when hearing her rhetoric is to make light of it. And sometimes those jokes come pretty easy. But in this case, the issues that she's talking about are quite serious. And they're certainly issues that we take quite seriously here.\nAyesha.\nQ: So on to another topic. There have been reports that the White House has granted the Pentagon a new authority to target ISIL in Afghanistan. Can you confirm those reports? And if so, why grant this authority now? And what will this new authority allow that wasn't allowed before?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any new details to share with you in terms of the rules of engagement that our men and women in uniform in Afghanistan are operating under. Obviously, they have been given a mission by the President of the United States to do two things. The first is to conduct counterterrorism operations to target the remnants of al Qaeda and other terrorists that are operating in that region of the world. And a lot of that is to prevent any sort of resurgence by al Qaeda or other extremist groups that want to try to plot against the United States or the homeland.\nThe other thing that we've obviously been focused on is supporting the Afghan government and trying to enhance their capability to provide for the security situation in their own country. And as a part of those missions, we've been pretty aggressive in taking terrorists and extremists in Afghanistan off the battlefield, both to protect the United States, but also to protect our men and women who are serving in Afghanistan.\nAnd these are serious tasks, and there are American men and women in uniform who are in harm's way right now that are making us safer. And we certainly owe them a debt of gratitude for their work. But I don't have anything new to announce in terms of any greater authority or any sort of change in the missions that they've been given.\nQ: On another issue, health officials have confirmed the first birth of a baby in the U.S. affected by the Zika virus. How concerned should Americans be about the spread of the Zika virus in the Americas? Should they be concerned? Obviously right now the focus is on women who travel to these affected areas. Is the White House doing anything to make preparations or expecting more cases?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what we are trying to do at this state is to communicate with the American public about the precise nature of the risk. I know Dr. Fauci was discussing this earlier today.\nWhat the CDC has concluded is that it would be appropriate at this point for pregnant women or women who may become pregnant to be mindful of the risk associated with traveling to other countries in the Western Hemisphere that have had -- where we know the Zika virus is being transmitted. This is a mosquito-borne illness, and this is a mosquito-borne illness that traditionally is found in tropical areas.\nAnd the concern is not as much about the impact of the virus itself on an individual who is bitten by a mosquito, but rather the linkage that our public health professionals are concerned between contracting this virus and birth defects -- a particular kind of birth defect that has been seen in Brazil and has been -- and there's reason that some public health professionals are concerned that the spike that we've seen in a particular birth defect in Brazil may be connected to the Zika virus.\nAnd so we are at the stage now where we are trying to educate people about the risk that exists and to allow them to take the necessary precautions. Again, the impact of the virus on somebody who is not pregnant or on men are symptoms that are rather mild. And the concern is just the focus on the possible linkage between this virus and a particular birth defect that could have an impact on women who are pregnant or may become pregnant.\nJustin.\nQ: Tomorrow is the anniversary of when the President in 2009 signed his order to close Guantanamo Bay. I'm wondering do you guys have plans to ruin our snow day with a release of your Gitmo plan -- (laughter) -- or any update on when that might go out to Capitol Hill?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any update for you in terms of the timing of a new plan that would be presented to Congress to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. What I have committed, though, is that when that report is presented to Congress that we'll make it available publicly. And what I'll do is I'll make sure that if that comes tomorrow, we'll put it on the Internet so that even if you are snowed in, you'll still be able to cover this remotely.\nI'll just say I don't have the expectation that it's coming tomorrow. But I don't have a specific guidance to share with you.\nQ: I wanted to ask about Vice President Biden's talks with the leader of Pakistan and Afghanistan today. One of the elements that you guys read out was that he was encouraging them to restart talks with the Taliban towards kind of a peace accord. I'm wondering how viable you see those types of negotiations, especially in light of the Taliban attack on the university in Pakistan a couple days ago, and also whether the U.S. should get directly involved or if the U.S. is directly involved in those talks.\nMR. EARNEST: The United States has long been supportive of an Afghan-led reconciliation process. And the conclusion that we've drawn here is one that I guess, based on the incident that you've just cited, is pretty obvious, which is that the Taliban poses a security threat to both countries, and that the nations of Afghanistan and Pakistan are going to be able to more effectively confront that threat if they're able to more effectively cooperate. And that's what we're hoping to do and that's what we're hoping to facilitate.\nAnd any sort of decisions about how the continuation of those talks and any sort of agreement that could be produced by those talks about whether or not that's in the interest of those countries to pursue -- those are decisions that will be made by the leaders in those two countries, as it should be.\nBut certainly the United States will continue to play the role that we've played for some time now in supporting reconciliation talks that are led by those individual countries.\nQ: Lastly, Secretary Kerry said earlier today that it's likely that some of the sanctions relief that Iran is getting will go to terrorist groups inside of Iran, but that you haven't seen that yet. So I'm wondering if you could describe how or if the U.S. is tracking the money that's been unfrozen and going back to Iran, whether you're planning to do so going forward, and if there's anything you can do -- you're seeing that money go to groups that obviously pose some sort of security issue to the U.S. -- to kind of stop that, or if that would violate the terms of the nuclear agreement in any way.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, that's a difficult question to answer primarily because I don't have much that I can say about any possible intelligence programs or intelligence capabilities that we may have here.\nI think the point that Secretary Kerry is making is that we know that Iran supports terrorist activities. And that's why they're on the list of the state sponsors of terrorism. That is why there are a number of individuals and entities in Iran that are under significant financial sanctions by the United States and by the international community because they support terrorism.\nSo the United States has chosen to confront this threat in a variety of ways. The first and most important way that we've confronted this threat is making sure that the government that supports terrorism doesn't have access to a nuclear weapon. And that's that essence of the agreement that was reached and successfully implemented over the weekend.\nThe other thing that we have tried to do is to work effectively with the international community, including at the United Nations Security Council, to counter this threat. And we have found -- I would say not consistently, but certainly there have been important moments where we've been able to work effectively at the United Nations Security Council to demonstrate international opposition to terrorism and to governments that support terrorism.\nWhat we have also sought to do is to build up the capacity of our allies and partners in the Middle East to mitigate the threat that is emanating from Iran -- whether it's in the form of terrorism or other destabilizing activities that Iran engages in.\nAnd so one thing I can tell you is that there have been these talks between the United States and Israel about renewing the memorandum of understanding between the United States and Israel when it comes to the security assistance that's provided by the United States. Next week there will be another delegation of senior administration officials, including some White House officials, traveling to Israel to continue those conversations.\nSo obviously the President has made that a priority. He said that when he was sitting in the Oval Office with Prime Minister Netanyahu at the end of last year. And that continues to be a high priority for his team, and they're traveling there next week.\nWe also continue to deepen our cooperation with our Gulf partners, as well. And that work also continues. So we're mindful of the risk that is posed by Iran and their support for terrorism and we're serious about confronting it.\nJon.\nQ: Just picking up on Iran, Secretary Kerry also made some comments about the Supreme Leader, essentially praising him for making statements that were critical of the attack on the Saudi embassy in Tehran. I'm wondering, does the administration think the Supreme Leader is softening, turned over a new leaf? Kind of surprised -- I never heard a Secretary of State kind of say positive things about the actions of the Supreme Leader of Iran.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Jon, I think what is clear is that any government around the world, including the government of Iran has an obligation to provide security for diplomatic installations in their country. And so when I was asked about this after there was this incident at the Saudi embassy inside of Iran, I noted with marked displeasure that Iran had not fulfilled their responsibilities to protect those embassies -- or to protect that embassy or those diplomatic institutions. And so that's a basic responsibility of any government, including the Iranian government.\nAs it relates to turning over a new leaf, as you described it, I don't think that's something that we're going to be able to judge based on three or four days of public statements after the implementation of the agreement. I think this is -- most importantly, as we've long said about the Iranian government, we're going to judge them by their actions. And we will not do that based on any single action, but rather based on an observation over the long term about whether or not they want to start fulfilling their international obligations when it comes to things like their ballistic missile program or their support for terrorism, or start joining the rest of the free world in doing a better job of protecting the basic human rights of their people.\nSo there is -- we're certainly going to be watching the actions of the Iranian government moving forward. But as we've said a number of times, this nuclear agreement was not predicated on Iran improving their behavior. Rather, this agreement was implemented primarily because of our concern about Iran's behavior.\nQ: And then two other quick ones, entirely different subjects. As I'm sure you saw, the ATF has reportedly identified a .50-caliber rifle that was found in El Chapo's hideout. I'm wondering, the administration, frustrated -- from the Fast and Furious program -- is the administration frustrated to again see weapons from this program show up at crime scenes?\nMR. EARNEST: Jon, I can tell you that I've seen those reports. I haven't actually been able to confirm them independently, so let me take a look at that.\nObviously, more generally, we've been quite concerned about the ease with which arms tend to flow across the border between the United States and Mexico. And we have obviously worked -- we've gone to great lengths to work with the Mexico government to try to shut down the flow of arms back and forth between our two countries.\nQ: Okay. And then I understand the President's motorcade had a slight delay given the snowstorm in Washington yesterday that was it about an inch or two?\nMR. EARNEST: They were not the only vehicles affected by the snow last night. I can personally attest to that.\nQ: Yes, I can, too. (Laughter.) Does the President have confidence in the city of Washington as this storm is about to hit? And what are his plans for being snowed in here at the White House?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't know if local officials -- what seems to be the case is that local officials were a little surprised by the amount of snow that the region received last night. I feel confident, based on all the reporting that all of you are doing, that they will not be surprised about the amount of snow that will be hitting the region starting tomorrow. So it is clear -- I've already seen that Mayor Bowser has announced that a local snow emergency will begin tomorrow morning. I think that is an indication that the city is taking this quite seriously and already beginning to mobilize the kinds of resources that will be needed to deal with what sounds like a pretty significant storm.\nI know that that Governor McAuliffe and Governor Hogan have made similar announcements and are already beginning to make similar preparations. Again, based on the forecast, it looks like we're going to need it.\nQ: And the President's plans?\nMR. EARNEST: My guess is the President will stay warm and toasty here inside the White House. (Laughter.) I suspect we'll all be doing that a little bit, too.\nJuliet.\nQ: Just one follow-up on that. As a result of that motorcade, the President spent 74 minutes driving from Andrews to the White House -- longer than his usual commute. Do you have any insight on what he did in terms of spending his time during that extra-long travel time?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't. I didn't have a chance to talk to Schultz about that. I think what it probably was --\nQ: He's right there.\nMR. EARNEST: He is. He is. (Laughter.) I think probably what it is, Juliet, is a reminder of how much the President is going to miss having access to Marine One a year from now. He often talks about how that Marine One is something that makes his travel much more efficient and is something that -- helicopter travel is not something he's likely to have regular access to as a former President. So last night may have been a reminder of how painful that transition could be.\nQ: And then on the question of the visa waiver policy that was just implemented, I was wondering if you could just talk a little about how the White House sees this compromise that was obviously struck with Congress, and if you could say anything about specifically how it affects dual nationals, which is certainly one of the key questions.\nMR. EARNEST: I spent a lot of time talking with our staff about this earlier today to try to understand exactly how this is implemented. And there's no denying that there are a lot of complexities here.\nI think there are a couple things I want to start out by saying because these are the real priorities. The goal of this legislation that Congress passed at the end of last year was to improve and tighten the screening measures that were in place for those individuals that had recently traveled to countries that were the state sponsor of terrorism.\nAnd I guess I want to start there because, prior to that -- more than a year prior to that, the Department of Homeland Security had taken steps on more than one occasion using their own executive enforcement authority to actually tighten screening measures for individuals traveling to the United States through the visa waiver program.\nAnd that involved running more information through more databases and also collecting more information from travelers. So the need to try to tighten these security requirements is something that has been a priority for the administration for more than a year before Congress acted. And we obviously sought to work closely with Congress to develop some additional measures that Congress could pass. And the legislation that passed reflected a compromise.\nAnd let's talk about what that compromise is. And, frankly, this is what makes it complicated, Juliet, is that everyone shares the priority of protecting the homeland. That's everyone's top priority, and I think that's something that -- that's one of the few things that transcends partisan differences here in Washington.\nThe other thing, though, we want to be mindful of is we also want to be mindful of the fact that the United States has the strongest, most durable economy in the world in part because U.S. businesses do a lot of business overseas, particularly in visa waiver -- countries that are in the Visa Waiver Program. And we're talking about a lot of traditional allies of the United States that are included in this program.\nSo we want to make sure that we are doing everything that is necessary to keep the country safe. That is the top priority. But we also don't want to unnecessarily disadvantage American businesses that are trying to do business overseas, because ultimately that's good for our economy, it's good for creating jobs here in the United States.\nSo there are a number of -- consistent with those two goals in mind, there are some additional work that's already underway to try to work with members of Congress on refining the measure that was passed at the end of last year. And again, the goal here is to, number one, make sure that the country is safe and that we have in place appropriate screening for those individuals that have recently traveled to the nations of Iran, Iraq, Sudan and Syria; but at the same time, we don't want to undermine the ability of U.S. businesses to interact with and to do business with partners or counterparts in countries like the UK, France, Germany, and other countries in Europe that are allies of the United States, that are part of the Visa Waiver Program.\nAnd I guess the last thing I just want to be clear about is the restrictions that were put in place both by the administration and by Congress over the last year and a half do not prevent individuals from traveling to the United States. What they do is they subject individuals that have recently traveled to these countries to more screening. And that's an important thing for people to understand.\nQ: And is there anything you can say specifically about dual nationals, just because there seems to be a little uncertainty about how that's --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think that's a good example of how we feel the system can be improved. So let me give you one example. In some cases, there may be individuals who are dual nationals -- so one example, somebody who was born in France, so is a French citizen, but was born to a parent who was an Iranian citizen -- therefore that individual is a dual national. And even though that individual has never traveled to Iran -- just to use one example -- they would be subjected to additional screening measures because of their status as a dual national. And our view is that that is something that could be refined to ensure that our screening system is applied in a way that prioritizes national security but also makes the system as efficient as possible.\nScott.\nQ: Just to follow up on that. DHS has left some room to make exceptions on a case-by-case basis for people whose travel was for humanitarian purposes. There's been some criticism from Congressman Goodlatte that that's -- you're stretching a loophole that was supposed to be smaller. Can you just talk about the balance you're trying to strike?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think this sort of falls under the realm of common sense, too. The other example that we've used, Scott, that may I think resonate some more in this room is with journalists. Journalists who traveled to Iraq, for example, to cover the Iraq war, those are individuals who don't pose as much of a risk as other individuals for whom the system was designed.\nLook, we have talked for a long time about the threat that is posed by foreign fighters. These are individuals -- fortunately it's a relatively small number of Americans who have traveled to Iraq or Syria to take up arms alongside ISIL. And the concern that we have is that there are individuals who hold Western passports. And we want to know if they're planning to travel back to the United States, and in some cases, we may not want them to travel back to the United States.\nAnd so here is the broader concern. The number of U.S. citizens who have made that trip is relatively small, but we know that there are other countries, including in Europe, where the number is substantially larger. And these are countries with whom the United States participates in the Visa Waiver Program. And so the concern is that an individual who is a European citizen, has traveled, fought with ISIL, and now may want to use that Western passport to enter the United States with very little screening -- that is the situation that we want to try to prevent. And that is the goal of these measures.\nThat's obviously much different than a journalist or an aid worker or somebody who has traveled as a part of a regional or some national government -- someone who had traveled for official government purposes. And so the more that we can try to draw those distinctions -- again, which makes implementing the law extraordinarily complex, but we also want to make sure that we're doing this in a way that reflects our most urgent national security concerns and reflects the economic realities of the global economy.\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, on Guantanamo, I understand you laid out the public disclosure, but can you tell us internally where the President is in his review of Secretary Carter's proposals to shut down the prison?\nMR. EARNEST: Obviously, the Pentagon has been working on putting this report together for a number of months now. Part of this report included some site visits that were made by Department of Defense personnel to a couple detention facilities around the United States to evaluate the security measures that were in place and to evaluate whether or not these were places where Gitmo detainees could potentially be transferred.\nBut, look, their work has primarily been focused on developing some of those kinds of options and trying to put some hard numbers around the fiscal impact of closing the prison. Part of our case has been that taxpayers can save some money. And that's a responsibility that we all have, is to be good stewards of taxpayer dollars. The longstanding concern that the President has -- and this is a concern that is shared by Democrats and Republicans, including the President's Republican predecessor -- that we know that terrorist organizations continue to use the prison at Guantanamo Bay in their recruiting materials. And effectively closing the prison is one way that we can make it harder for extremist organizations to recruit people to their cause.\nSo both for that obvious national security reason, but also for fiscal reasons, that's the reason that the President promised seven years ago tomorrow to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, and it's why every day since, his administration has made that a national security priority.\nI think all of what I have laid out also underscores why there's no surprise ending to the report. I think those of you who have covered this closely -- and I think most people in this room have -- you understand what our strategy is here. And the development of a plan is not an attempt to implement a radically different strategy, but rather to provide some more texture and detail about the benefits of the strategy that we're pursuing.\nAnd you'll have an opportunity to take a look at that when the report is completed and presented to Congress.\nQ: So it's in the final stages?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, as I mentioned earlier, when I was first asked about this over the summer, in July, I noted that the plan was to present the report to Congress \"very soon.\" That obviously didn't happen, so I just don't want to be in a position of making additional promises about timing that, frankly, I've already broken. So when we have additional details about that, then once the plan has been presented to Congress we'll make sure you all have an opportunity to take a look at it.\nQ: Can I go back to you on Iran? There are some questions -- and I understand you can't talk about where the monies that have been released have gone and hypotheticals like that. But the Secretary specifically said -- Secretary Kerry -- \"I think some of the money will end up in the hands of the IRGC or other entities, some of which are labeled terrorists.\" Do you agree with the Secretary of State?\nMR. EARNEST: He began by saying, \"I think,\" and I think that reflects his I think rather logical conclusion that a nation that supports terrorism may use some of the money that's coming into the country to further support terrorism.\nNow, the thing that's important for people to recognize is that critics of this agreement often exaggerate the sanctions -- the value of the sanctions relief that Iran will obtain, and they often overlook the rather severe economic priorities that are badly underfunded inside of Iran. There are a number of bills that are already past due that Iran needs to pay. There are significant investments in their infrastructure that also need to be made because they are already having an impact on their economy. And I've seen at least one economic analysis that indicates that Iran is not going to immediately bring all of the available money into the country because it would have the effect of artificially appreciating their currency, which would further weaken their economy.\nSo I guess that is why we have been pretty honest about the fact that this agreement is not going to resolve all of our concerns with Iran's bad behavior, and it is entirely likely and I think it is even expected that Iran will continue to support terrorism. But because of Iran's intention that we assess to continue to support terrorism, that's what makes it so important that we prevent them from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\nLook, that's not just a case that we've made. This is also the case that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, himself, has made. He, himself, made it a priority, I think for very good reason, to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. And the President concluded that the best way to do that is through a diplomatic agreement like the one that we've recently implemented.\nAnd that's what's motivating this action. And it is why the implementation of this agreement was one that we celebrated, because it did represent substantial steps that Iran had to take to scale back significantly their nuclear program, and to cooperate with the kinds of international inspections that will verify that they're not developing a nuclear weapon. And those are kinds -- that is access and that is a change in their nuclear program that could not be achieved through military action.\nQ: To be clear, what you're saying is while some may conclude, and it would be logical to conclude, that some monies may flow to groups like terrorists -- and you think you could mitigate the threat -- but you do say it could flow there?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we've been candid about that possibility, and that assessment is drawn from Iran's longstanding support for terrorism. And again, that longstanding support for terrorism is what motivated us to prevent them from obtaining a nuclear weapon. And it's also what motivates us in part to ramp up our efforts to provide additional support to our closest ally in the region, Israel, and to seek to better integrate the defense and security capabilities of our Gulf partners as well.\nQ: On a totally different note -- on the President's commute home on the treacherous roads that were not necessarily plowed or salted and all the rest, were there some security concerns that he was sitting on the road for 74 minutes in traffic, where others are swerving and having accidents all around him? I mean, isn't there some serious safety concern around that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there's no doubt that these kinds of road conditions pose a hazard to everybody who's on the roads. And obviously the President was being driven in a heavy SUV with a highly trained professional driver at the wheel, and surrounded by a number of other vehicles as well. The assessment that was made by the President's team, including the military and Secret Service, is that driving home from Andrews would be much safer than flying home from Andrews in a helicopter. And the President's security when he travels is a top priority and that's what led them to choose to drive home from Andrews last night.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. The ICIG has been in the news a little bit of late, and I just wanted to ask you how would you characterize the President's level of confidence in the Intelligence Community's inspector general?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, these kinds of reviews that are conducted by inspectors general are done independent of the administration. The decisions to pursue a particular review and the results of those reviews that are presented to Capitol Hill or made public are entirely decisions made independent of the administration.\nSo it's hard for me to pass judgment on them one way or the other. Ultimately, it's the responsibility of the inspector general to describe what he or she is doing and to explain why it's part of their scope of responsibilities.\nQ: But you would agree that the President values that position, because if he didn't value that position there wouldn't be one.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what I can say is, in principle, the President does believe that independent inspectors general who fulfill their responsibilities consistent with the law are an important part of holding government in general accountable to the taxpayers. And that's an important position. But because of the independence of the inspector general at the Intelligence Community, I don't want to be in a position of rendering a judgment one way or another about the decisions that are made by that individual or the office that they run. Ultimately, the American public will have to arrive at their own conclusions about that.\nI can just say that, in general, the administration is quite strongly supportive of the principle of having independent oversight of the government, primarily because of the obligation that we have to taxpayers.\nQ: Well, then, can you think of another example in history of someone with the stature and the experience of Secretary Clinton publically criticizing such a position -- a leader in that position -- in a way that she did recently, and basically accusing this high-ranking official of colluding with a political party to influence an election? Can you think of another example of this happening to anyone?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what I can say is this, is I think that while people who have a position like I do have a responsibility of protecting the independence of the inspectors general in the administration. And that's one of the reasons I try not to comment on them too much, is because I don't even want to leave you with the appearance of trying to influence some of their activities.\nBut there's a responsibility on the part of the inspectors general themselves as well to avoid both in deed and in appearance actions that would be carried out to politically benefit one side or the other, or one party or another. And so that responsibility -- the responsibility to protect the independence of the inspector general is certainly one that I take seriously. And the inspectors general should do the same thing.\nQ: And rightly so. But isn't this unprecedented, that a former Secretary of State, for example, would accuse someone at that level of essentially colluding with a political party to try and influence an election? That seems extraordinary if nothing else.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I will leave it to all of you to sort of assess the actions of the inspector general. I don't know if this latest report that's been the subject of a number of news stories is something that's been made public yet, but when it is, obviously the American public will have the opportunity to evaluate for themselves whether or not the decisions that were made by the inspector general were appropriately independent and unbiased and consistent with their responsibility to be looking out for taxpayers.\nQ: Last one. I just want to make sure I give you a good run at this one on the EPA situation in Flint. I've been looking at a number of different stories that have sort of gone through a tick-tock from February when a tester originally raised the issue, then again confirmed it in April, then again sent a memo in June, and yet it's been now into January these people have been drinking this contaminated water. The process seems to have played out very slowly and, frankly, in a dangerous way for the people of Flint. What is your assessment of the process? Did the EPA get it right?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, there are a number of factors here that are important to consider. The first is, and state officials have acknowledged this, that it is state and local officials inside of Flint who are primarily responsible for the safety of the water supply in Flint.\nQ: Primarily, but not solely, right?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what the President acknowledged yesterday is that we need to take a look at the relationship that EPA has with state and local governments across the country to make sure that that process doesn't impede unnecessarily the ability of the EPA to present information that may have a significant impact on the health and safety of the American people.\nSo that's one of the things that the President talked about in his conversation with the EPA Administrator earlier this week, is to take a look at the procedures in place and determine if we need to make some changes to those procedures to make sure that if the EPA is aware of information that could have a direct impact on the health and safety of the American public, that they're not somehow prevented from sharing that information with the public. And the President believes that that's an important principle.\nThe other thing that this underscores is the value of -- or the role of government in keeping us safe and protecting our health. And there's a pretty vigorous debate going on on the campaign trail right now about the proper role of government. But I think this highlights the fact that there is a role to play to protect our public health and safety and to keep our water clean and to keep our air clean. And we also need to make sure that we're holding that government accountable for fulfilling their responsibilities.\nQ: Last one. Do you agree then that the EPA was prevented from alerting the public to the danger in Flint?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what is true is that there continues to be an ongoing investigation, including one that's led by the Department of Justice, about what exactly transpired in the months since the water supply -- or the source of the water in the city of Flint was transferred from one source to another. And so I don't want to get out ahead of that investigation by sort of commenting one way or another about the propriety of the actions that were taken by state and local officials or by the EPA. But certainly the President believes that the principle of accountability is important, particularly when the stakes are this high. And the President does want to make sure, and will make sure, that if there were errors or wrongdoing that was carried out by officials at the EPA that they're held accountable for those actions.\nChris.\nQ: Josh, you mentioned earlier that you spent a bit of time preparing for the -- Visa Waiver Program. Obviously a lot of questions are being raised about just how dual nationality is going to be applied. And I wonder if the administration is anticipating problems and implementation of this.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think based on the exchange that I had with Juliet and Scott, it's apparent that implementing this law is complex. And I think the thing that we want to be sure of is that complexities associated with implementing this law do not affect our ability to keep the country safe. And so that's why you've seen DHS and the State Department enter into a rigorous process here in evaluating the law and determining the most effective way to implement it. And they'll continue to be rigorous as they implement the law moving forward, because keeping the American people safe is our top priority.\nQ: And where does fair and equitable treatment factor into that in terms of -- there are obviously a lot of people upset who feel that they are already being unfairly targeted. So where does the White House see that balance?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think that is a balance that we believe could more effectively struck by refining the law that was passed at the end of last year. What you saw at the end of last year was Democrats and Republicans work together in a good-faith effort to find a compromise for imposing tighter screening on individuals from Visa Waiver countries who had recently traveled to Iran, Iraq, Sudan or Syria. The administration, for a couple of years, has been focused on tightening the screening that was in place because we were mindful of the threat that was posed by foreign fighters. Congress weighed in, as they appropriately should.\nBut what is clear in our view is that there are some refinements to the program that we make it more effective. And we're going to try to work together with Democrats and Republicans in the same spirit that allowed us to pass these reforms in the first place at the end of last year to try to pass some refinements to the program that we believe would make it more effective.\nQ: And if I can just one more, to yesterday's motorcade and the upcoming storm. The President, back in 2009, when school was cancelled for Sasha and Malia, had some comments that some Washingtonians --\nMR. EARNEST: \"Flinty\" was the word he used, I think.\nQ: Yes. They were somewhat disparaging to the personal nature of people who live in this city, and I wonder if he still thinks that Washington needs to toughen up. And more broadly, what's the role of the federal government in all of this, if it's as bad as they're predicting?\nMR. EARNEST: What I think is clear is that local officials here last night were dealing with a pretty difficult situation, that the amount of snow that was received was not, on its own, significant, but based on the amount of snow exceeding expectations and coming right at the onset of the evening rush hour, it made dealing with the surprise rather challenging.\nThere's no denying that 18 to 24 inches of snow would be a challenge to any metropolitan area in the United States -- certainly one like the Washington, D.C. area that doesn't have as much experience dealing with situations like this as the city of Boston does, for example. But the President is confident that the local leaders in the area -- Governor Hogan, Governor McAuliffe and Mayor Bowser -- are all appropriately attuned to the risk and of the forecasts, and are taking the kinds of precautions they need to take to keep the country -- or keep the citizens of the Mid-Atlantic region safe.\nQ: -- any federal conversation on standby?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any specific federal request for assistance that had been made at this point. But if there are ways that we can offer up some assistance, then I'm confident that we'll do that.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, does the White House consult with OPM about when to let federal workers in the area go home tomorrow or whether they need to come to work?\nMR. EARNEST: OPM does have a regimented process in place where they consult with a variety of government agencies, and they consult with other local officials as well, both in D.C., Virginia and Maryland, but also at Metro, to evaluate the impact of the weather on the variety of modes of transportation here in the city. So the process will run as it normally does. They will look at the latest weather forecast, and I'm sure they are hoping for additional information about when the storm is expected to begin here, or the effects of the storm will begin to be felt here in Washington. And that certainly will have a significant impact on the decision that they make tomorrow about -- or the decision that they will make either tonight or first thing in the morning about the operating status of the federal government tomorrow.\nQ: Back on Flint. Is the White House willing to reconsider Governor Snyder's request to reconsider issuing a disaster declaration?\nMR. EARNEST: Mark, there's a formal process for evaluating those requests, and I'm confident that officials at FEMA will do their due diligence on this. But as I mentioned earlier in the week, the case that Governor Snyder has to make, even based on my own layman's reading of the law, is not a strong one, simply because the statute says that that kind of designation can only be used for essentially natural disasters or acts of God. And the tragedy that we're seeing in Flint is a manmade crisis.\nSo there is already significant assistance that's been provided by FEMA. There was an emergency declaration that the President issued earlier this week that freed up $5 million in assistance for Flint. But the truth is, FEMA had actually been on the ground in Flint prior to that request for emergency assistance, providing some logistical support and providing bottled water that was drawn from stockpiles that FEMA maintains.\nMichelle.\nQ: On the same subject. It can be frustrating for people not just in Flint but around the country to hear things like, well, local and state authorities are primarily responsible for that -- when the EPA is really supposed to be kind of the gatekeeper to make sure that things like that aren't happening, especially when they knew about it. And when you say this shows the value of the role of government, but this seems to be the ultimate example of government failing at every single level, when most people would consider the primary -- the very basic role of the government, what their money goes to, is to protect them.\nNow we know, based on the EPA's own admission, that they could have done things faster, that they did know about this. We heard some strong words from the President on it briefly, though, yesterday. Is this not enormously concerning to the administration that the EPA very clearly knew about it and didn't alert the public? I mean, we're talking about long-term contamination here. It just seems like the way it's described it's very -- I'm not sure that in the public view it really matches the level of emotion that people feel when they see this.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Michelle, I think that there are some more facts that need to be learned to substantiate all of the claims of responsibility that were included in your question.\nQ: But on its face, we know that the EPA knew about it. We know that the EPA did not alert the public. Isn't that enough to know that this was a big failure on the part of the EPA?\nMR. EARNEST: No, it's not. There is more information that needs to be learned. But what the President has been quite clear about -- and I think the President was pretty blunt in talking about his reaction to this situation -- as a parent, as he mentioned yesterday, he'd be beside himself if he knew that the water that he'd been giving to his child was poisoning them. That's an outrage that something like that would happen in the greatest country in the world.\nAnd so the question is, essentially -- there are a number of questions. The first is, what do we do to make sure that this is something that's not happening in other places? And that's why, because we know in this situation that state and local officials had primary responsibility for the safety and integrity of the water system in Flint, what are the guiding principles for the way that the EPA interacts with state and local officials who are themselves responsible for the health and safety of people who are drinking the water in their communities.\nSo the President wants to get to the bottom of that, and he wants to get to the bottom of that quickly. Again, we don't want a situation where the EPA is unnecessarily obstructed from being able to share information with the public that has a direct impact on the health, safety and wellbeing of the public. So the President certainly has that concern, and the President has made clear to his EPA administrator that he is concerned that this is not happening anywhere else.\nThe second things is, we should be take a look at the actions that were taken at the EPA. And if there were individuals who made mistakes, or did not do their job appropriately, then there should be some accountability. The President is quite serious about that as well. I think we're also gratified to see that the state and local officials -- again, who are primarily responsible for water supply in Flint -- are taking a similar posture. That's to their credit.\nWhat's also important is that the federal government is doing what's necessary to assist state and local officials as they respond to this situation. I mentioned to Mark the steps that FEMA has taken to try to enhance their response by providing some bottled water and some logistical support. The President has tapped the Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services to lead -- or to coordinate the federal efforts to support the state and local response. He tapped that individual because there clearly is a significant public health problem here, and so having somebody with that kind of expertise to coordinate the federal assistance is important.\nLet me say the last thing. As it relates to the role of government, the President does believe that the government needs to be held accountable, and government does have a basic responsibility for the health and safety of the American people, particularly when it comes to keeping our air and water clean. I think that, in some ways, this situation underscores the danger of the approach that is advocated by some Republicans of doing things like eliminating the EPA. That doesn't seem like a very smart thing to do either. And I think the consequences of something like that are on full display in Flint, Michigan right now.\nQ: And we're talking about this as this -- I don't know mega-monster storm, whatever we're calling it -- is barreling down on us. And the President slipped and slid in his own motorcade after what about an inch of snow fell, and that prompted an apology by the mayor of the Nation's Capital the next day. Does that bode okay for how the Eastern Seaboard is going to handle this several feet of snow? Do you have real concerns about that? I think it kind of seemed like a bad omen this morning.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what is clear is that local officials were caught a little off guard last night. And I think the likelihood that they are caught off guard in advance of this significant storm is quite low. They've already taken significant steps to prepare for the oncoming storm. And I think the advice that we would share with people is the advice you hear me offer up quite frequently, which is that it's important for people to listen to the mayor and for emergency officials here in the area for steps they should take in advance of the storm to prepare for it. And if they do that, then even if it's a record storm, we'll be able to all weather it together.\nQ: My apologies. Now that the Litvinenko report is out, based on what is in there, that it's a legal process that came to that conclusion, based on what has been shared between the U.S. and Britain, based on U.S. intelligence, does the administration share that assessment that President Putin probably had a role in this killing?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the evidence that we have seen that was put forward by the British government is pretty compelling. But we have not thoroughly reviewed the report to draw our own conclusions at this point. But once we've done that, we'll let you know.\nAndrew, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: I wanted to go back to the administration's assumptions on how Iran -- or predictions about how Iran might spend the cash gleaned from sanctions relief. It's emerged that Iran's budget for next year, there is going to be a 15 percent increase in funding for the Revolutionary Guards, and a doubling of intelligence spending. I was wondering if you think it's time to revisit your assumptions about how they might spend the money that they're getting.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think the only assumption that we have made about how they intend to spend the money was based on the observation from the Secretary of State that it certainly seems possible if not likely that they will use some of those funds to support acts of terrorism. That possibility certainly exists.\nThat is precisely why we have implemented an agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. As dangerous as their ongoing support for terrorism is, it would be even more dangerous -- even catastrophic if Iran had access to a nuclear weapon. And they don't right now because we successfully implemented this agreement that caused them to dismantle thousands of centrifuges, to ship out 98 percent of their enriched uranium stockpile, and to agree to a whole set of intrusive inspections that will verify their ongoing compliance with the agreement, and verify that they're not actively working to build a nuclear weapon, that their nuclear program exists solely for peaceful purposes. That's the goal of this agreement.\nWe're going to continue to have significant concerns with Iran's behavior, particularly when it comes to supporting terrorism, developing a ballistic missile program, or even threatening Israel, our close ally in the Middle East.\nAnd we're going to continue to take steps to further isolate Iran for any sort of continued efforts they make with regard to those things. That's why on Saturday, even as we were -- or Sunday, even as we were announcing the completion of this agreement, the Treasure Department was announcing an additional round of sanctions that would be imposed on those individuals who are connected in one way or another to Iran's missile program because Iran continues to engage in activities that are in violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions that govern their missile program.\nSo I think our approach to this has been quite realistic and quite consistent with achieving our top priority which is preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\nQ: -- rather more specific about your assumptions on what Iran would do with the cash. You said today and administration officials have said repeatedly that you think that a good proportion of the money will go toward propping up the riyal, towards building infrastructure, towards addressing some of the more fundamental macroeconomic issues that exist in Iran. And it looks like that might not be the case.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think we'll have to see exactly what happens. And I think the observations that we have made are that -- at least that some have made -- I don't know that this is an official government conclusion, but there is reason to doubt why it would not make good economic sense for them to immediately bring all of the money that will be made available to them back into Iran because it would cause the currency to artificially appreciate in a way that could further damage their already weakened economy.\nThe same thing applies to a number of bills that have come due. There are a number of infrastructure projects that Iran has engaged in but not paid for. And their creditors are going to be interested in collecting the money that they're owed.\nWe also know that the state of the Iranian economy has been significantly weakened by these international sanctions. And that after all is what pressured them to come to the negotiating table in the first place.\nAnd Iran is going to have to use at least some of that money to address those economic weaknesses. And again, the reason that Iran was compelled to the negotiating table is because -- is quite obviously driven by their concerns about the state of the economy.\nAnd we know that there has been an ongoing commitment inside of Iran to supporting terrorism. But I don't think they came to the negotiating table so they could get access to more money to carry out acts of terrorism. They came to the negotiating table because they were concerned about the economic pressure that was being applied to their country and the impact that could have on their domestic political situation.\nSo ultimately the government of Iran is going to have to make their own decisions about how they use the money. But I think that there are a lot of reasonable assumptions based on our knowledge of their economy, and based on our knowledge of basic economic principles like how currency is -- the value of currency is affected by significant flows of cash, but also affected by our knowledge of their ongoing support for terrorism.\nAnd so I think the administration has been quite realistic about what our priorities are and what our expectations are out of this agreement. And again, for those who say that our concern should principally be about Iran's support for terrorism, we agree. And that's exactly why the President did as much as possibly can be done to verify and to prevent Iran from obtaining an nuclear weapon because a nuclear-armed Iran that supports terrorism would be very dangerous to the United States and to allies in the region and around the world. And that's why we've gone to such great lengths to prevent that from happening. And all of that was accomplished without the United States having to wage another land war in the Middle East. And I think that is why the President noted over the weekend that the implementation of this agreement is something that can and should be celebrated here in the United States.\nThanks a lot, everybody. Good luck with snow tomorrow.\nQ: You going to brief, Josh?\nMR. EARNEST: We'll see what OPM decides. If the government is closed, we will not have a briefing. But if it's open, we will.

By the end of his extensive answer, as Christie thanked the stroke victim for his bravery to ask the question, the stroke victim rose to his feet, eyes glistening, to shake Christie's hand.\n...\nAnd as if to seal in the emotional impact of his town halls, Christie often closes with the story of his mother's death, recalling that he cut a work trip short to rush back to his mother's deathbed in the final days of a battle with lung cancer.\n\"She reached over she grabbed my hand and said to me, 'Christopher go to work, it's where you belong, there is nothing left unsaid between us,'\" Christie says, causing more than a few eyes to well up in the audiences. \"Other than the birth of our four children it was the single most powerful moment of my life.

Bernie Sanders issued the following statement Thursday on the environmental crisis caused by a gas leak in Porter Ranch, California:\n\"The massive and tragic natural gas leak in Porter Ranch, California, is yet another example of the urgent national need to transition away from fossil fuels and toward energy efficiency and sustainable, renewable sources of power.\n\"The Porter Ranch gas leak is an absolute climate disaster. More than 87,000 metric tons of methane gas have escaped into the air. Methane traps more than 85 times the heat of carbon dioxide. The scale of the Porter Ranch leak would equal the emissions of six coal-burning power plants or an additional 7 million cars on the road. In climate terms, this leak compares with the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\"More directly, thousands of residents have been put out of their homes and local schools have been closed. And the health risk is real – methane exposure can cause headaches, vomiting and bloody noses.\n\"Today I am calling for a sense of national urgency and action to stop this leak. The EPA needs to expedite action on its investigation. Southern California Gas Company needs to do much more, apply more resources to close the leak and release complete air quality data. It is simply unacceptable that a gas leak which began last October is still poisoning the air and that the company continues to profit from the storage facility.\n\"It also appears fracking of nearby wells could have contributed to this disaster. It is yet another reason why I have called for a ban on all fracking. \"Porter Ranch is simply one more tragic cautionary tale in our dependence on oil and gas.\n\"That is why I have put forth the most far-reaching climate plan of any candidate for the presidency. I opposed Keystone XL from Day One. I am the only candidate for president who has opposed the Bakken Pipeline in Iowa, and the proposed pipelines in New Hampshire and Vermont carrying fracked gas.\n\"I will continue to stand up to the big money and lobbying power of Big Oil and fight for a new energy system based on clean sources of power like wind and solar, creating millions of new jobs – and saving our planet.\"", "timestamp": "2016-01-21", "title": "Statement by Senator Bernie Sanders on the Porter Ranch, California Gas Leak"}

However, thanks to the NRA's lobbying efforts, the bill includes a loophole stating that if the FBI cannot process the background check within three days, the dealer can legally sell the gun to the buyer—regardless of the person's record.\nThe shooter who slaughtered nine people in a South Carolina church bought his weapon thanks to this so-called Charleston loophole.\nLicensed gun dealers are required to conduct a background check before each gun purchase—but many private sellers are not. That means guns sold over the internet or at gun shows are rarely regulated.\nAccording to the best data available, as much as 40 percent of annual gun sales occur without a background check because the sale occurs over the internet, at a gun show, or are person-to-person sales.\nFederal law does not bar those the FBI suspects are terrorists from buying a weapon. The U.S. Senate recently had a chance to close this loophole—but Republicans, including three running for president, voted against the measure.\nEven though federal law prohibits felons from purchasing or possessing guns, that prohibition does not apply to many convicted stalkers—because federal law does not prohibit people convicted of misdemeanor stalking offenses from buying guns.\n\" This epidemic of gun violence knows no boundaries, knows no limits of any kind.

[applause]\nThank you so much for coming out this evening. This is a wonderful, wonderful turnout.\nLet me also thank my dear friend Bill McKibben. I trust all of you know that Bill is not only an outstanding writer, he really is a great writer, and not only the subject matter that he deals with so thoroughly, he really writes very, very well, but Bill is also not just one of the leaders of the movement to combat climate change in this country, Bill is one of the international leaders.\nHe founded, as you know, 350.org, which has played a role all over the world in bringing people to stand up in the fight to save our planet. [applause]\nAnd when Bill talks about organizing at the grassroots level, there is nobody I know who does it better than he does. About a year- and-a-half ago, I think it was, we were in New York City, 400,000 people, a lot of young people, a lot of people of color, people from all over the world were marching to demand that Congress and governments all over this planet recognize the seriousness of what we are going through now and move aggressively to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. [applause]\nSo when you hear from Bill, you're hearing from a guy who is an international leader on one of the most important issues facing our country. And I'm going to get into that in a moment.\nLet me say a few words about our campaign, before I get into the thrust of my remarks. We began this campaign about nine months ago. And when we began we had no money, no organization and, frankly, my name recognition around much of the country was not very, very high. And a lot of the media pundits were saying, well, you know, Bernie Sanders combs his hair outstandingly. [laughter]\nAnd I want some recognition. I just got a haircut here. That's worth something, you know? [applause]\nMy wife said enough is enough, you gotta get a haircut, so we did that. [laughter] And you know, and I was considered, this campaign was considered to be a fringe candidacy. Interesting, but not significant. Well, I think a lot has happened in nine months. [applause]\nWith your help, we've got a real shot to win here in New Hampshire. We're are doing better and better in Iowa. A recent poll, actually a poll a few hours old, had us ahead in Iowa. [applause]\nAnd I think it is fair to say that we have a lot of momentum. In my view, we will win in Iowa, we will win in New Hampshire if -- and here is the big if -- if there is a large voter turnout, if working people and young people and older people decide that it is important enough to make a statement, and that's what your state does, that's what Bill was saying, you're making a statement that will be heard not only all across our country, it will be heard all over the world.\nAnd the statement is that we have had enough of establishment politics, establishment economics, we need to move in a new and bold direction. [applause]\nNow, when you come within a week or two weeks or two-and-a-half weeks of an election, suddenly you start hearing a lot of strange things being said. And one of the things that my opponent, Secretary Clinton, is saying is that Bernie Sanders is unelectable, he just cannot defeat a Republican candidate in a general election.\nSo it gives me some pleasure to give you some facts that suggest that that might not just be the case. [applause]\nHere in your state of New Hampshire, a state where people know Hillary Clinton very well, she ran here in 2008, she's running hard now, a state where people know me well, when we were compared in a recent poll from CNN and WMUR just the other day, in terms of how well we would do against Republican candidates, this is the result from New Hampshire. Secretary Clinton loses to Marco Rubio by one point; we beat him by 18 points. [applause]\nSecretary Clinton and Governor Kasich are tied; we beat Kasich by 21 points. [applause]\nAnd here is my favorite. [laughter] Because it deals with my good, good friend Donald Trump. Secretary Clinton defeats Mr. Trump by nine points, we beat him by 23 points. [applause]\nAll of which -- all of which -- reaffirms my love for the smart people in the state of New Hampshire. But it's not just New Hampshire. The results are not quite as strong, but they're also strong in Iowa where we do a lot better than Secretary Clinton against Republicans, in polls, and also nationally. There was an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll that came out the other day. Secretary Clinton defeated Trump by 10 points; we defeated him by 15 points. [applause]\nAnd the main -- even more importantly than polls, polls go up and down, but even more importantly is the thrust of our campaign. Here is a political fact, and the fact is that Republicans win national elections when people are demoralized and they don't come out and vote.\nAnd last year in the midterm election, Republicans won a landslide victory, they won a huge victory all over this country because 63 percent of the American people didn't vote, 80 percent of young people didn't vote.\nAnd what is going on in this campaign, I think any objective observer would note, that the campaign that has the excitement, that has the energy, that's bringing working people, that's bringing young people in, a campaign that has spoken to 450,000 already, all over America, that has spoken to over 27,000 people in meetings like this in New Hampshire, that our campaign is the campaign of excitement, energy, momentum, which will result in a large voter turnout, which mean victories for the Democrats from the top on down. [applause]\nAnd let me also say this. When we began this campaign, as I said, we didn't have money and we didn't have an organization, name recognition not all that high. And one of the problems that we had to face right away is the fact that, as all of you know, to run for president of the United States, sad but true, you need to raise an unbelievable amount of money.\nAnd what the pundits and the experts were saying, well, the only way that a candidate in this day and age with this disastrous Citizens United decision, the only way that a candidate can raise the kinds of money you need is to set up a super PAC. And the truth is that my Democratic opponents set up super PACs and that almost all Republican opponents set up super PACs.\nBut to my mind, as somebody who does not represent the billionaire class, does not represent corporate America, I decided that I was not going to establish a super PAC, I was not going to ask them for millions and millions of dollars in money. [applause]\nBut then, you know, that's a very lovely statement, but that still doesn't bring you any money. So how do you do it?\nWell, what we did is kind of an old-fashioned way. We reached out to the middle class and working families of this country. And what happened is -- and this I would not have in a million years dreamed that we could do. In the last nine months, we have received 2 1/2 million individual contributions. [applause]\nThat is more than any candidate in the history of the United States of America, up to this point in a campaign. [applause]\nAnd at a time when candidates are so proudly leaving rooms with millionaires and coming out with 5 million or 10 million bucks, our average contribution is $27. [applause]\nSo what all of that means is we have already accomplished something enormous, and that is we have shown the American people that despite this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision, despite all of the super PACs, one can still run a strong and, I believe, winning campaign based on the support from working families and the middle class. And I'm very proud of that. [applause]\nAnd today in New Hampshire, we have many thousands of volunteers, and we have a wonderful, wonderful organization. And with your help, if we can get a good voter turnout on February 9th, I believe we can win this state and I ask for your help to make that happen. [applause]\nNow, one of the reasons that I think our campaign is doing well is because we are treating the American people as if they were intelligent human beings. [laughter]\nNow, that's a radical idea for a politician. You know, when we we are often seen on TV in six-second sound bites or when the media will tell you what the most important issues are, we have chosen to go a different direction. And what we have tried to say is the most important issues facing us is not what appears on television tomorrow, the most important issues are the issues that you are struggling with today in terms of your lives, your children's lives and your parent's lives. Those are the issues that we have got to address, whether the media finds them interest or exciting or not. [applause]\nNow, what do I mean by that? I'll just give you a few examples, OK?\nA couple of weeks ago I was in Nevada. A woman, early 30s, I think, came up to me. She has a 5-year-old child and she said, Bernie, I am trying to make it with a 5-year-old kid, earning $10.45 an hour and paying off my student debt. And tears started running down her cheeks. I don't know if I can do that, I don't know what happens to my child.\nIn my state, and it's no different here in New Hampshire, we have many, many seniors who are trying to get by on 11, 12, $13,000 a year Social Security. And if you just do the arithmetic, you can't get by on 11, $12,000 Social Security. And some of those seniors are literally cutting up their medicine, their pills in half, which is not a good thing to do, but they don't have the money they need to buy the medicine that they require.\nI fought very hard to expand the Meals on Wheels program; Republicans resisted. But all over this country, there are seniors who are on waiting lists trying to get Meals on Wheels because they're having a hard time eating at least one decent, nutritious meal a day. [applause]\nAnd what a disgrace that is. And then I go all over the country and I talk to people. Young people stand up. I spoke to a kid the other day. Senator, I will be graduating college very shortly. I'm going to be $60,000 in debt, having a hard time finding a job. I'm supposed to pay back $1,200 a month. I have no clue as to how I can do that.\nSaw another young man, late 20s, two kids, married. He's working in sustainable energy. He's devoted to the environment. He says he's paying 53 percent of his limited income on student debts.\nTalk to moms and dads all over New Hampshire, all over Vermont, all over this country, who desperately want quality, affordable child care for the little ones, can't find that.\nTalk to 55-year-old workers who are scared to death about going to work someday and finding the employer say, Joe, thanks for working for us for 30 years, but we can hire somebody at half your age for half the wages.\nTalk to the kids graduating college and have a hard time finding jobs commensurate with their education.\nTalk to people, and I do all of the time, who are working two or three jobs, trying to cobble together some income and some health care.\nTalk to husbands and wives whose marriages are being stressed out and strained because people are working so hard and they don't have enough time to spend with their kids.\nNow, the truth is, although my Republican friends deny it, our economy today is obviously today in a lot better shape than it was when George W. Bush left office. [applause]\nWhen Bush left office, we were hemorrhaging 800,000 jobs a month. That is unbelievable. Our deficit was a record-breaking $1.4 trillion. And oh, by the way, the world's financial system was on the verge of collapse. Other than that, we were in really good shape. And these people have the nerve to attack Barack Obama. [applause]\nSo we have made progress. We've cut the deficit by more than two-thirds. The world's financial system is now, at this moment anyhow, not on the verge of collapse. And we are growing jobs rather than hemorrhaging jobs.\nBut having said that, what we must also be honest about and that is is to acknowledge that under Republican administrations and Democratic administrations for the last 40 years, the great middle class of this country, the middle class that was once the envy of the entire world, has been disappearing -- has been disappearing.\nIf you are a male worker in the middle of the American economy, half the people on top, half the people below, you are earning today in inflation-adjusted-for dollars 700 bucks a year less than you made 41 years ago. Productivity expanding, technology exploding, and yet you're making $700 less than you made 41 years ago.\nIf you are a woman, you are making a thousand dollars less in adjusted income than you made in 2007. Well, that's the reality.\nNow, the reality is also and why people are so angry is they're working harder and harder, many of them are slipping into poverty, everyone is worried about the future of their kids -- which, by the way, if we do not get our act together, the kids, our kids, will be the first generation in modern American history to have a lower standard of living than we do.\nSo what people are asking is, what's going on? Technology exploding, global economy, worker productivity going on, but the middle class for 40 years has been in decline and more and more people living in poverty.\nWell, I would suggest to you that a lot of why that is happening has to do with the fact that we have seen in the last 30 years a massive transfer of wealth from the middle class and working families of our country to the top one-tenth of 1 percent, trillions of dollars that were owned by the middle class are now gone while the top one- tenth of 1 percent has seen a doubling of the percentage of wealth that they own.\nAnd to my mind, together, as we try to turn this country around, one of the areas that we absolutely must focus on is the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality we are experiencing today. [applause]\nNow, let me just blur you for a moment with a few facts, but I think it's important for you to know it. They don't usually get reported in the media, but it's important that people know it. And that is, in America today the top one-tenth of 1 percent, not 1 percent, one-tenth of 1 percent, owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. Got that?\nToday in America, the wealthiest 20 people -- 20 people -- that's the front row here, not these guys, though... [laughter]\n...the wealthiest 20 people in America own more wealth than the bottom half of America, 150 million people.\nToday in America, one family, the Walton family that owns Walmart, one family owns more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of the American people.\nAnd by the way, when I walk about the Walton family, let me mention to you that I know that you hear a lot from politicians about welfare reform. Right? We hear a lot about welfare reform, people ripping off the welfare system. So let me tell you who the major welfare recipient family in America is. It's not some poor family down the road. The major welfare recipient in America is the Walton family, the wealthiest family in America. And they are the major recipient because you as taxpayers are paying taxes for Medicaid and food stamps and affordable housing that Walmart employees need because the Walton family is not paying them a living wage. [applause]\nSo when we talk about a rigged economy, an economy where the rich get much richer while almost everybody else gets poorer, it seems a little bit absurd that the middle class has got to subsidize the wealthiest family in this country. [applause]\nSo I say to the Walton family, the owners of Walmart, get off of welfare, start paying your workers a decent wage. [applause]\nThat's wealth. When we talk about income, despite the fact that so many of our people are working such long hours, turns out that 58 percent of all new income generated goes to the top 1 percent.\nSo you ready for a radical idea? Why not. What about creating an economy that works for working families and not for the 1 percent? [applause] But when we talk about the economy, it is not only the grotesque level, and it is a grotesque level of income and wealth inequality, it is also about jobs.\nNow, every month, the federal government issues a set of reports on unemployment. The report most of you see on the front pages of the paper is the official unemployment report, which is now about about 5 percent. What the official unemployment report does not include are those people who have given up looking for work and those people who are working part time who want to work full time. If you add that together, we're close to 10 percent unemployment.\nAnd here's something that is almost never discussed at all, but it is a huge and tragic issue, and that is the problem of youth unemployment -- youth unemployment. A couple of months ago, I asked some economists to do a study for me. And I said, tell me what real youth unemployment is in this country for kids who graduate high school, not drop out.\nAnd this is what they said: Kids who are white, 33 percent unemployed or underemployed, 33 percent; Latino 36 percent; African American 51 percent.\nNow, if anybody in this room thinks there is not a connection between that outrageously high level of youth unemployment and the fact that we have more people in jail than any other country on earth, I believe you would be mistaken. [applause]\nToday in America, we have 2.2 million people in jail. We spend $80 billion a year locking them up. So here's my second radical idea of the evening, and that is maybe it makes a lot more sense for us to be investing in education and jobs rather than jails and incarceration. [applause]\nOur goal should be to have the best-educated population on earth, not more people in jail than any other country on earth. [applause]\nAnd when we ask ourselves why it is that people are working such long hours, why? You know, it's a funny story, but it's not really so funny. If you remember the history books that we read when we were in school, there were pictures of workers a hundred years ago, marching down streets, holding up big placards. And you know what those placards were saying? They were saying we want the 40-hour work week.\nWell, a hundred years have come and gone and we still want the 40-hour work week. [applause]\nTurns out that we in the United States work the longest hours. I don't know if you know this. We work the longest hours of any people in the industrialized world. The Japanese are very hard workers, we work longer hours than they do. And one of the obvious reasons as to why people work such long hours is that wages in this country are too damn low. [applause]\nSo let me be very clear. The federal minimum wage today of $7.25 an hour is a starvation wage. We need to raise the minimum wage to a living wage, 15 bucks an hour over the next few years. [applause]\nAnd when we talk about equitable wages, I hope that every man in this room will stand with the women in the fight for pay equity for women workers. [applause]\nThere is no rational economic reason why women should be making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men. That is just old-fashioned sexism, and together we are going to change that. [applause]\nNow, in New Hampshire, for better or for worse, you see a whole lot of politicians trotting through your state. And if they are Republicans, you may hear them talking about family values. They just love families. Stay up nights worrying about families. [laughter]\nEspecially if they're very wealthy families who can contribute to their campaigns.\nBut you all know what they mean by family values, which is not a laughing matter. What they mean is that no woman in this room, in this state, in this country, should have the right to control her own body. I disagree. [applause]\nWhat they mean by family values is that we should defund Planned Parenthood. I think we should expanding funding for Planned Parenthood. [applause]\nAnd what they mean by family values is that our gay brothers and sisters should not have the right to get married. I disagree. [applause]\nNow, my wife, Jane, and I have been married for 27 years, we have four great kids. You saw my son Levi. We've got seven beautiful grandchildren, three of them here in New Hampshire, and we're very proud of our family. And we believe very strongly in family values.\nBut when I talk about family values, my values are a little bit different than the Republicans. And when I talk about family values, I talk about ending the international embarrassment of the United States of America being the only major country on earth that does not provide paid family and medical leave. [applause]\nNow, the good and beautiful news is that here in New Hampshire today and in Vermont and all over this country, women are giving birth and for those of you who are parents you know what an extraordinary day that is. And it's a pretty big day for the baby as well. [laughter]\nBut here's the story. If that woman who gives birth today is a working-class woman or a lower-income woman, the likelihood is that she will have to basically give up her baby, lose contact with her baby, separate from her baby and go back to work in a week or two in order to earn enough money to take care of her family. That is not a family value. That is the opposite of what a family value is. [applause]\nVirtually every government on earth, and not only wealthy nations, developing nations, poor nations, understand that mom and dad should have the right to stay home with their newborn baby in what amounts to the most important weeks and months of that human being's life.\nBut it's not just childbirth. All of you know that kids get sick. It happens once in a while. And mom or dad should have the right to stay home with their child when their child is sick. Parents get sick. Sons and daughters should have the right to tend to their mothers or fathers.\nThat is why I am strongly supporting and will make happen as president three months of paid family and medical leave for every family in America. [applause]\nThat is not a radical idea. My goodness, every other country on earth could do it, or virtually every country. I think we can as well.\nAnd when we talk about the economy, obviously we're talking about job creation. And when real unemployment is 10 percent and youth unemployment is higher than that, in my view, we need a massive federal jobs program to put our people back to work. [applause]\nWe should be hiring teachers, not firing teachers. [applause]\nWhen we have a dysfunctional child care and pre-K system, which for many families is unaffordable and where child care workers are earning minimum wage or a little bit more, we need to create hundreds of thousands of jobs for well-trained, well-paid child care workers in this country. [applause]\nAnd when we have an infrastructure, roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, and I'm not just talking about Flint, Michigan, I'm talking about municipalities all over this country where water systems are leaking and in bad trouble, we need to rebuild our rail system to catch up with Europe and Japan and even China. [applause]\nWe can create 13 million decent-paying jobs rebuilding our infrastructure with a $1 trillion investment. And I intend to make that investment. [applause]\nWell, people say that's a great idea, but it's an expensive proposition, even in Washington. A trillion dollars is a lot of money. Where are you going to get the money? I will tell you where we get the money. We are going to end this outrageous tax loophole that allows major, billion-dollar, profitable corporations to stash their money in the Cayman Islands and other tax havens. [applause]\nWe are losing a hundred billion dollars a year. You have corporations that make billions of dollars in profit, not paying a nickel in a given year in federal income tax. That's wrong. We're going to change that. We are going to invest in our infrastructure, create millions of good-paying jobs. [applause]\nAnd by the way, not only do we need to create millions of good- paying jobs, we need to stop the loss of millions of jobs through a disastrous trade policy that allows corporate America to shut down plants here and move to low-wage countries abroad. [applause]\nWhen I talk about an economy that is rigged, when I talk about a campaign finance system that is corrupt, when I talk about a criminal justice system that is broken, it turns out that we see all of that in a recent story that was in the papers about a week ago. And here is the story that tells you how corrupt our economic and political and criminal justice system is.\nAbout a week ago, it was announced that Goldman Sachs, one of the major financial institutions on Wall Street, was going to reach a settlement with the federal government for $5 billion -- $5 billion -- and they were reaching that settlement because they had sold subprime mortgage packages that were worthless and cheated investors. Investors thought they were buying something that was worth something, but it was worthless and Goldman Sachs knew that.\nNow, over the last 30 years, Goldman Sachs has operated what we call a revolving door. A revolving door means that people leave Wall Street and corporate America, go into government, do the bidding of Wall Street and corporate America, and then go back to the private sector. In fact, in the last 30 years, Goldman Sachs has given this country two secretaries of the treasury, one under a Republican administration, one under a Democratic administration. That's how the system works. Big money gets their people into government, works for big money.\nAnd then it turns out that the guy who is head of Goldman Sachs, the financial institution that has paid $5 billion in settlement with the government, is a billionaire who a couple of years ago went to the Congress and he said, you know what, Congress, you have got to cut Social Security, you've got to cut Medicare, you've got to cut Medicaid, we can't afford to sustain these programs. This is coming from a billionaire whose company now paid a $5 billion fine for ripping off the American people.\nNow, when we talk about why the American people are angry and why they are increasingly alienated from the political process, it has a lot to do with the fact that there are kids in New Hampshire, kids in Vermont, who get arrested for possessing marijuana and they get... [applause]\n...and they get a police record. And you know what? When you get a police record, sometimes it's a little bit hard to go out and get a job. And yet, when you are the CEO or a major executive of a multi-multi-billion-dollar financial institution which helped crash the economy because of their greed, recklessness and illegal behavior, helped create a situation in which millions of people lost their homes, their life savings, their jobs, when you are that person, somehow you do not get a police record. That is wrong. That has got to change. [applause]\nAnd by the way, to make a bad situation even worse, this particular company, Goldman Sachs, spends huge amounts of money on campaign contributions and on speakers fees to unnamed candidates. [laughter]\nBut that's how the system works. That is how the system works. That's what power is about. That's why the 1 percent gets richer and while everybody else gets poorer.\nAnd when I talk about a political revolution and when I talk about bringing millions of people into the political process, what our job is to end that type of corruption and power-mongering and to create a government that works for all of us, not just a handful of people. [applause]\nAnd speaking about campaign contributions, it turns out ironically that today is the sixth anniversary of one of the worst Supreme Court decisions in the history of this country, and that is the Citizens United decision.\nAnd what Citizens United did was to say to the very wealthiest people in this country you already own much of the economy, now we're going to give you an opportunity to purchase the United States government, and that is precisely what they are trying to do.\nYou have one family and a few of their friends, the Koch brothers, second-wealthiest family in America, and they're very, very nervous and unhappy. You see, they're trying to catch up to the Waltons and they're only in second place, so they're working really hard and figure they could become even richer if they can elect candidates who hold their views, which is not just to cut Social Security or Medicare, it is to end Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid and the Environmental Protection Agency. That's a family that is spending $900 million on this campaign cycle.\nNow, when you've got one family, second-wealthiest in America, spending more money in a campaign than either the Democratic Party or the Republican Party, you're not looking at a democratic society, you're looking at an oligarchic form of society. And together, we are going to stop that. [applause]\nAnd the reason, the reason that that issue is so important, is that it touches on every other issue. You name the issue. And if people are elected to office to represent the wealthy and the powerful, the needs of the middle class and working families, the needs of women, the needs of children, the needs of the environment, will not be addressed.\nAnd then there are -- so let me conclude that by telling you, and here's a promise, that no nominee of mine to the United States Supreme Court will get that nomination unless he or she is crystal clear that they will vote to overturn Citizens United. [applause]\nEverybody in this room knows we live in a highly competitive, global economy. And if we're going to succeed, we need the best- educated workforce in the world. There was once a time when we did. That time is not anymore.\nNow, it seems to me to be totally absurd, beyond comprehension, that when we need the intellectual capabilities of all of our people, we have hundreds of thousands of young Americans who are able, who are qualified, but who cannot get to college for one reason and one reason alone, and that is their families lack the money.\nThat is why I believe that in the year 2016 we must make public colleges and universities tuition free. [applause]\nAnd I say that not just for the obvious reason, that it means that bright young people will be able to go to college and people will not leave school deeply in debt, but there is a more profound reason. I grew up in a family that never had a lot of money. And my dad came from Poland, he had dropped out of high school, my mom graduated high school.\nBut the people, like every milieu, the people you associate with, your family associates with, in my family and other families, you associate with people with similar economic backgrounds. And the people that we associated with just did not have college education. And that's true all over America. There are kids who don't know anybody who went to college.\nIf we can make public colleges and universities tuition free, if every parent in this country, every teacher in this country, every child in this country, kids who in the sixth grade, the eighth grade, understand that if they do their schoolwork seriously, if they pay attention in school, that they will be able to get a college education regardless of the income of their families. That is revolutionary. [applause]\nAnd when we talk about our responsibilities as adults, as inhabitants of this earth, as parents, as grandparents, it seems to me that we have a moral responsibility to make sure that the planet that we leave our kids and grandchildren is healthy and habitable. [applause]\nI sit on the Senate Environmental Committee and on the Senate Energy Committee. And in that capacity, I've met scientists all over our country, all over the world. And what they say is very clear: Climate change is real, it is caused by human activity, it is already causing major problems in our country and around the world.\nAnd what they also say, and this is scary stuff, is that if we do not get our act together, this planet earth, our only planet, could become five to 10 degrees warmer by the end of this century. And what that means is more drought, more floods, more extreme weather disturbances, more acidification of the ocean, more rising sea levels, more international conflicts as peoples fight for limited natural resources.\nIf elected president, I will lead our country into working with Russia, China, India, countries all over the world, to take on the fossil fuel industry, transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. [applause]\nAnd let me connect some dots here and show you how everything is related to everything else. Today we have a major political party, it's called the Republican Party, where not one of their candidates for president, and they have many candidates for president, not one of them has stood up and said, you know, I've read the literature, I've talked to the scientists, we've got a problem, climate change is real, we better do something about it. Not one. And in the Congress, there are very, very few of them. There are some, but very few who are prepared to talk the truth about climate change.\nNow, some may say, well, you know, Republicans are dumb or something like that. But that's not the case. Some of you may think it's the case, but it's not the case. Not here.\nI'm on a lot of committees and I serve with Republicans and we discuss issues, like cancer and Alzheimer's disease and heart disease, on the Health Committee and so forth, and they ask the same rational questions anybody else would ask. They don't go around attacking cancer researcher or Alzheimer's researchers.\nBut on this issue, on this issue things are very, very different. And the reason for that is a corrupt campaign finance system which tells the Republicans that if one of them were to stand up and say, you know what, climate change is real, we've got to do something about that, on that day they would lose their funding from the Koch brothers and the fossil fuel industry. [applause]\nAnd that is just one example of many as to why we need campaign finance reform. [applause]\nWhen we talk about America and when we talk about the future of our country, what I am trying to do in this campaign is to get people to think big, not small. In other words, if we were an impoverished country, we would have one type of discussion. But we are the wealthiest country in the history of the world. And that calls for a different type of discussion.\nToday there is one major country on earth -- one -- the country that you live in, that does not guarantee health care to every man, woman and child as a right. [applause]\nNow, I have been criticized for believing that health care is a right, not a privilege. People want to criticize me, that's fine, that is what I believe. [applause]\nNow, I am a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pension Committee, and in that capacity spent an enormous amount of time working on the Affordable Care Act. And in my view, the Affordable Care Act has done some very, very important things. It has ended the private insurance company obscenity of preexisting conditions. [applause]\nAnd in 20 years from now or 50 years from now, people will look back and they'll say I really cannot believe you had a system where insurance could tell somebody, oh, you had breast cancer five years ago, we will provide you insurance, but not for breast cancer because it may recur. It's like saying I'm going to give you fire insurance, except if you have a fire. [laughter]\nYou know, it is totally, totally insane. That's gone.\nWhat we have also done through the ACA is provided health insurance for some 17 million Americans who otherwise would not have it. We have made it much fairer to women, who do not have to pay higher prices for insurance than men.\nSo there's a lot of good stuff in there. But let's also be clear. Today, 29 million Americans have no health insurance. Many more are under-insured with high deductibles and co-payments. There are people in this room who have high deductibles.\nAnybody have a high deductible? Would you mind telling us? Anyone want to tell us what their deductible is? Six thousand, $4,000, $10,000. OK. [laughter]\nWhatever I do, they say I always feel like a Vermont auctioneer, you know. [laughter]\nSorry to say, you won unless somebody can go higher than $10,000.\nBut what that means is that all over this country people do have insurance, but they have high deductibles and they have high co- payments. And what does that mean? It means in real world that people hesitate to go to the doctor when they're sick because they just don't have the money in their pocket.\nAnd what that also means, and I've talked to a whole lot of doctors in Vermont and all over this country, is sometimes people go into the doctor's office and they are really, really, really sick. And the doctor said, why didn't you come in here six months ago? And the person says, well, I didn't have any health insurance or maybe I had a high deductible and I couldn't afford it. Sometimes those people do not make it. Sometimes they end up in the hospital at great expense and at great suffering.\nIn my view, when we have a system which has 29 million people uninsured, more under-insured, when we pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, which is a huge problem, when we end up spending almost three times more than the British spend, who provide health care to all of their people, 50 percent more than the French spend to provide health care to all their people, far more than our Canadian neighbors spend who provide health care to all of their people, I think we need to move forward toward a Medicare-for-all single-payer program. [applause]\nAnd because Medicare for all takes the private insurance companies out of the equation, and you all know their function is simply to make as much money as possible, when we'll be able to negotiate prices with the drug companies, we end up through a Medicare-for-all program saving middle-class families thousands of dollars a year on their health care costs. [applause]\nWhen we talk about issues in America, I know that all of you share with me our fatigue, our disgust, our anger at seeing videos on television of innocent people being shot to death by police officers. [applause]\nAnd often, those people are African American or Latino.\nNow, I was, as you all know, the mayor of Burlington, Vermont for eight years and in that capacity worked very, very hard with our police department. And in my view, the vast, vast majority of police officers in this country are honest, hardworking and are asked to do an enormously difficult job. [applause]\nIt is not easy being a police officer in the year 2016. But as is the case with any other public official, if a police officer breaks the law, that officer must be held accountable. [applause]\nWe need major reforms in our criminal justice system. We need to demilitarize local police departments. [applause]\nWe need to make police departments look like the diversity of the communities that they serve. [applause]\nWe need to take a hard look at the so-called war on drugs. [applause]\nRight now under the Federal Controlled Substance Act, marijuana is listed as a Schedule I drug, right next to heroin. Now, I don't have to tell the people of New Hampshire about the horror of heroin. I don't have to tell the people of my state about the horror of heroin. It's a growing problem all over this country, a problem, by the way, in terms of opiate addiction and heroin addiction we have got to get a handle on. [applause]\nWhich means that we need a revolution in mental health treatment in this country. [applause]\nWhich means that when people need treatment for substance abuse, they get the treatment when they need it, not six months from when they need it. [applause]\nAnd I am aware -- I just met a mother earlier today, lost, I believe, it was her daughter to drugs, and I know how serious that problem is in your state and how serious that problem is in my state.\nBut when you have marijuana next to heroin, I think that makes no sense to me at all. [applause]\nAnd what I worry about is young people who get police records for possession of marijuana and then find it really hard to go out and get a job and get their lives together. And that is why I have introduced legislation to take marijuana out of the Controlled Substance Act. [applause]\nIn America today, we have about 11 million undocumented people. Many of them are being exploited and many of them are living in fear. I have talked to young Latinos with tears running down their cheeks who worry that their parents could be deported or that they could be deported. As president, I will be as aggressive as I can in moving toward comprehensive immigration reform and a path toward citizenship. [applause]\nNow, we can have honest disagreements about any issue, including immigration reform. But what we should not be having in the year 2016, what we should not be having are candidates using racism and bigotry to attack... [applause]\nThe idea that somehow in the middle of the night we're going to pick up and round up 11 million people and throw them out of the country, the idea that people like Donald Trump are referring to Latinos who come into this country as criminals and rapists is unacceptable -- unacceptable. [applause]\nThis campaign is about not just electing a president. It is about transforming America. Bill McKibben mentioned to you a little while ago that it's not good enough to elect a president. What we need to do is to transform this country. And no president can do it alone. We need to be working together, we need to raise political consciousness, we need to have an understanding about what's going on in Washington and politically in a way that we have not had for a very, very long time. [applause]\nBut here is the bottom line. The bottom line is that we are the wealthiest country in the history of the world. We are a country in the last 30 years that has seen a massive transfer of wealth away from the middle class to the top one-tenth of 1 percent. I believe that if we stand together, if we do not allow the Donald Trumps of the world to divide us up, if we are Latino or if we are Muslim, but if we stand together, there is nothing, nothing, nothing that we cannot accomplish. [applause]\nPlease don't tell me that the United States of America, our great country, cannot guarantee health care to all people as a right.\nDon't tell me that we cannot make certain that all of our young people, regardless of the income of their families, are able to get a college education if they have the ability to do so.\nAnd don't tell me that we can't train carpenters and plumbers and sheet metal workers who need that training to get good jobs.\nDon't tell me that we have to have more income and wealth inequality than any other major country on earth at the same time as we have more childhood poverty than any other country on earth.\nDon't tell me that we have to maintain a crumbling infrastructure. Don't tell me that cannot address the fact that the wealthiest people in this country often pay an effective tax rate lower than what you pay.

In addition to working to cut carbon pollution, build a clean energy economy and protect our natural resources, the Administration has taken unprecedented steps to better prepare communities across the country for the increasingly destructive impacts of climate change.\nToday, the Administration is announcing historic commitments to building climate resilient communities, including announcing the winners of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) National Disaster Resilience Competition (NDRC). 13 states and local communities across the country will receive a combined $1 billion in disaster recover funds to rebuild and better prepare for future extreme weather and other climate change impacts. To build on our continued commitment to investing in the resilience of the most vulnerable communities, the Administration is also today announcing the expansion of the Resilience AmeriCorps and Climate Action Champions programs. The Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) will commit an additional $4 million over three years to expand the Resilience AmeriCorps program to the 27 finalists that did not receive funding through the NDRC competition.\nHUD Announces Winners of the National Disaster Resilience Competition\nThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today announced nearly $1 billion in HUD Disaster Recovery funds to the winners of the National Disaster Resilience Competition. The communities selected will use the funding to recover from prior disasters in 2011, 2012 and 2013 by deploying solutions that will improve their ability to withstand and recover more quickly from future disasters, hazards, and shocks. Out of 40 finalists, the winners include states and local communities that will invest in innovative coastal protection and storm water management, relocation assistance for the most distressed communities, and economic development and job creation through adaptation.\n• State of California, $70,359,459: Following extreme wildfires in 2013, California will pilot its Community Watershed Resilience Program to support healthy, resilient forests, develop a bioenergy and wood products facility and build support centers to serve rural communities during emergencies.\n• State of Connecticut, $54,277,359: Connecticut is focused on building support for economically-isolated coastal neighborhoods by investing in green streets and exploring opportunities to utilize microgrids and alternative energy systems.\n• State of Iowa, $96,887,177: Iowa, which has experienced extreme flooding and torrential rainfall—both expected to increase in frequency and intensity with rising temperatures—is focused on a watershed-based approach to increase water quality upstream while sustaining its valuable agricultural economy and protecting vulnerable residents in downstream communities.\n• State of Louisiana, $92,629,249: Louisiana, which has increasingly suffered from extreme weather in coastal communities, will enable a tribal community on the Isle de Jean Charles, which has experienced a 98 percent loss of land relative to 1955, to relocate to a resilient and historically significant community.\n• Minot, North Dakota, $74,340,770: A major regional agricultural, energy and economic hub, Minot, ND experienced extreme flooding in 2011 that overwhelmed the city's levee system and damaged close to a third of the area's housing. Minot will launch three integrated projects to reduce flood risk and increase resilience, build affordable and resilient neighborhoods that meet ENERGYSTAR certification and foster economic diversification.\n• State of New Jersey, $15,000,000: New Jersey plans on developing a comprehensive planning process to identify and address vulnerabilities and promote sustainable development, and work with university partners to develop a toolkit of best practices to assist other communities across the country.\n• New Orleans, Louisiana, $141,260,569: Following Hurricane Isaac in 2012, the City of New Orleans identified major gaps in resilience and risks to vulnerable communities. To address these gaps, the city is looking to reduce flood risk by incorporating green infrastructure, investing in reliable energy and water systems, restoring coastal ecosystems, expanding workforce development and create a citywide performance management program.\n• New York, New York, $176,000,000: As part of the city's policy to create a stronger, more resilient and affordable city, New York City will invest in the Lower Manhattan Protect and Connect Project to construct a coastal flood protection system. The System will increase coastal protections while also enhancing the connection between the neighborhoods and to community facilities.\n• State of New York, $35,800,000: In response to significant damage from extreme weather like Superstorm Sandy and Hurricane Irene, New York State will invest in repairs from past damage and pilot new and innovative approaches to build resilience in low-income public housing.\n• Shelby County, Tennessee, $60,445,163: Shelby County, which borders the Mississippi River, will focus on a series of open space and green infrastructure activities that will help make the greater Memphis area more resilient in future disaster and flooding events.\n• Springfield, Massachusetts, $17,056,880: The City of Springfield, where increased rainfall and extreme weather has overwhelmed the city's water and energy infrastructure, will invest in a series of projects to ensure clean redundant energy sources, restore affordable housing stock, invest in job training and workforce development, and increase public engagement in conservation activities and the development of the city's climate change plan.\n• State of Tennessee, $44,502,374: Tennessee plans on blending traditional infrastructure and nature-based approaches in an effort to build resilience in communities along the Mississippi River.\n• Commonwealth of Virginia, $120,549,000: Virginia will build water management solutions such as green infrastructure projects to strengthen vulnerable neighborhoods and improve economic vitality.\nExpanding Resilience AmeriCorps Program to Include Finalists of the National Disaster Resilience Competition\nToday, the Administration is also announcing the expansion of the Resilience AmeriCorps and Climate Action Champions programs to the NDRC finalists, including the commitment from the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) to make at least $4 million available over the next three years to more than double the current size of the Resilience AmeriCorps program.\n• More than Doubling the Size of the Resilience AmeriCorps Program: Following the announcement of the National Disaster Resilience Competition winners, the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) will make $4 million available over three years to expand the Resilience AmeriCorps program to the finalists that did not receive funding through the competition. The Resilience AmeriCorps program recruits, trains, and embeds AmeriCorps VISTA members in communities across the country, where the effects of climate change are often most acutely felt, to help develop preparedness plans and assist local leaders as they plan for and address the impacts of extreme weather events. This commitment will place new Resilience AmeriCorps members in up to 27 low-income communities that the NDRC process has identified as promising candidates for additional federal resources. The 27 finalists will have the opportunity to receive direct, on the ground assistance from Resilience AmeriCorps members, who are already helping build resilience in communities across the country.\n• Growing the Climate Action Champions Program: In addition, the Administration is announcing that all NDRC Finalists that have the opportunity to receive Resilience AmeriCorps volunteers will also be able to participate in the Climate Action Champions program, one of the Administration's community-based initiatives operating across the country. The Climate Action Champions Initiative was launched by the White House and the Department of Energy in 2014 in collaboration with a broad range of Federal agencies, and in 2016 it expanded in partnership with CNCS. These communities will have the opportunity to receive peer-to-peer support to further their resilience efforts and technical assistance from an inter-Agency working group launched in 2015 to focus on the Champions and leverage existing Federal resources in a meaningful way.", "timestamp": "2016-01-21", "title": "Fact Sheet: The Administration Announces Historic Commitments to Build Climate Resilient Communities"}

During their visit to the White House this evening, the President will thank the Mayors for their steadfast partnerships over the past seven years and will outline the Administration's priorities for cities across the country in the year ahead. The convening will also focus on the economic progress that each city has made since the President took office.\nThroughout the week, senior White House officials and members of the President's Cabinet participated in plenary sessions and panel discussions on priority issues, including: trade, manufacturing, veteran homelessness, transportation, paid leave, climate change, affordable health care, workforce development, education, My Brother's Keeper and immigration. Today at the White House, Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates and senior White House officials will interact with Mayors in a panel discussion on criminal justice reform.\nThis morning, First Lady Michelle Obama will deliver remarks at the U.S. Conference of Mayors to discuss the Mayors Challenge to End Veteran Homelessness. In 2010, the Administration set the goal of preventing and ending homelessness among veterans. Through the Mayors Challenge to End Veteran Homelessness, launched in 2014 by First Lady Michelle Obama, more than 800 mayors and other state and local leaders across the country have committed to marshal federal, local, and non-profit efforts to end veteran homelessness in their communities.\nBelow are some of the ways Mayors are helping to make President Obama's agenda a reality in cities across the country.\nCriminal Justice Reform and Community Policing: Providing a Second Chance and Building Collaborative Relations Between Law Enforcement And Communities\nThe President has repeatedly highlighted the need for meaningful juvenile and criminal justice reform in the United States that makes our system, fairer, smarter and more cost-effective while keeping the American people safe and secure, and has been joined in that call by leading mayors and local elected officials. The Administration is working with communities across the United States on reforms to address the vicious cycle of poverty, criminality and incarceration that traps too many Americans and on putting into practice the recommendations of the President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing Task Force, which set out a blueprint for strategies to promote effective crime reduction while building public trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.\n• Over 40 local jurisdictions attended the White House Community Policing Convening in July 2015.\n• In November 2015, the U.S. Conference of Mayors sent a letter to Congress urging them to pass a criminal justice reform bill.\n• Since the launch of the  Police Data Initiative (PDI) in May, five additional agencies have joined PDI: Denver, Spokane, Orlando, Tucson, and Fayetteville—bringing the total number of agencies to 26, with more than 40 data sets released.\n• In November, Newark, NJ Mayor Baraka (D) and Shelby County, TN Mayor Luttrell (R) co-authored an op-ed supporting criminal justice reform with a focus on re-entry.\n• In November, five cities, including Memphis, TN and New Orleans, LA took on the TechHire Initiative by expanding tech training and jobs for individuals with criminal records.\nAdvanced Manufacturing and Tech Innovation: Paving The Way For Jobs And Skills Of The Future\nMayors are creating new opportunities for entrepreneurs looking to make the next world-changing product, and for students interested in hands-on engagement with Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM). Through the Mayor's Maker Challenge over 100 cities including Columbus, OH, Scottsdale, AZ, Rockford, IL, and South Bend, IN are changing the landscape of American manufacturing in small towns and big cities. Last March the President announced his  TechHire initiative, which aims to train Americans with 21st century skills. Since that time 31 new cities, states, and rural communities with over 150,000 open tech jobs, and 500 employer partners, have joined the President to help give all Americans who work hard a fair shot.\n• In St Louis, MO a network of over 150 employers in St. Louis' rapidly expanding innovation ecosystem will build on a successful MasterCard pilot to partner with local non-profit Launchcode to build the skills of women and underrepresented minorities for tech jobs.\n• Anderson, IN, in collaboration with Purdue University and the Flagship Enterprise Center, is building a 90,000 square foot facility - to be called the Purdue Polytechnic Institute - that will include a 12,000 square foot maker space and a 35,000 square foot incubator.\nTrans-Pacific Partnership: Leveling The Playing Field For American Workers\nThe Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is a new type of tough trade agreement that will put American workers first by including the strongest enforceable labor standards of any trade agreement in history, including in areas like child and forced labor and wages. TPP levels the playing field for American workers and American businesses, leading to more Made-in-America exports and more higher-paying American jobs here at home. Mayors have been on the frontlines, advocating for TPP since they are closest to the innovation and growth that TPP can spur.\n• In June, the U.S. Conference of Mayors passed a resolution in support of both Trade Promotion Authority and a Trans Pacific Partnership deal that contains enforceable labor and environmental standards, a uniform tariff system, transparency, and protection of intellectual property rights. Following the resolution's passage at the conference, the U.S. Conference of Mayors wrote a letter to congressional leadership urging passage of Trade Promotion Authority, with over 100 signatures from mayors across the U.S.\n• In October, a group of Mayors toured a manufacturing facility in downtown Atlanta and called on negotiators to complete a TPP deal before leaving the city. Atlanta, GA Mayor Kasim Reed, who hosted the event and chairs USCM's Transportation and Communications Committee, was joined by United States Trade Representative Ambassador Michael Froman, Little Rock, AR Mayor Mark Stodola, Chair of the Conference's Exports and Ports Task Force, Tampa, FL Mayor Bob Buckhorn and Columbia, SC Mayor Steven Benjamin. Upon completion of the trade negotiations in October the U.S. Conference of Mayors reaffirmed their support for TPP.\n• Across the county, mayors have been touring small businesses in their cities, speaking with the media, and writing op-eds explaining exactly why they believe TPP benefits the people in their city. Mayor Mitch Landrieu of New Orleans, LA hosted Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Robert Hamilton for a small business roundtable at a local economic development group. Mayor Marilyn Strickland of Tacoma, WA hosted Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker for a small business tour, in addition to taking every opportunity to promote the President's trade agenda. Mayor Chris Cabaldon of West Sacramento, CA testified before the International Trade Centre on behalf of the U.S. Conference of mayors and has spoken in regional press outlets about the benefits to his city and the region. Countless other mayors have written op-eds, toured businesses, and spoken to media about the benefits of TPP.\nEducation: Furthering The President's Early Childhood and Community College Education Agenda\nSince the President laid out his proposal to expand early childhood education in his 2013 State of the Union Address, cities have taken significant steps to expand high-quality preschool in their communities. Cities like Chicago, IL and Philadelphia, PA have amplified the President's free community college proposal and advanced free community college programs.\n• In March, over 50 mayors signed a letter to Congress supporting the President's America's College Promise proposal.\n• Since the President's announcement on free community college last January, seven communities have announced their own free community college programs.\nVeterans Homelessness: Marshaling Efforts To End Homelessness For Our Veterans\nThrough the Mayors Challenge to End Veteran Homelessness, local leaders across the country are ending Veteran homelessness in their communities. Since First Lady Michelle Obama launched the Mayors Challenge on June 4, 2014, more than 684 mayors have stepped up to the challenge.\n• Just six months after the announcement of the Mayors' Challenge, three major American cities - Salt Lake City, Phoenix, and New Orleans - had eliminated Veteran homelessness.\n• Since the First Lady's announcement, 19 communities and the Commonwealth of Virginia have effectively ended Veteran homelessness.\n• In November, Virginia was announced as the first state to end veteran homelessness, helping 1,432 homeless veterans in the past year. When Norfolk Mayor Paul Fraim signed up for the challenge, an estimated 50,000 veterans were homeless on any given night in Norfolk. By November 11, 2015, the city had met their goal to effectively end veteran homelessness.\nMinimum Wage and The Working Families Agenda: Expanding Opportunity For Middle Class Families\nSince the President's 2013 State of the Union Address, about 40 local jurisdictions have taken action to raise wages. Twenty-six cities and counties have approved city-wide increases in their minimum wages for both public and private employees. Fourteen other cities and counties including Palo Alto, CA, New Orleans, LA, Portland, OR and Syracuse, NY raised wages for their city/county workers or contractors.\n• More than 65 mayors signed a letter from the U.S. Conference of Mayors Cities of Opportunity Task Force urging Congress to raise the minimum wage.\n• Since President's 2014 State of the Union Address, 21 cities and counties have taken action on paid sick leave, and 19 cities and counties have taken action on paid family leave.\nClimate and Energy: Launching New Programs and Policies On Climate Change and Energy Efficiency\n• 122 U.S. cities have signed the Compact of Mayors, committing to reduce local greenhouse gas emissions, enhance city resilience to climate change and track their progress transparently.\n• Cities like Little Rock, AR, Portland, ME, Dearborn, MI, St. Petersburg, FL, Flint, MI and San Diego, CA have partnered on the Better Buildings Initiative to make substantial improvements to the energy efficiency of buildings and lighting to save money and replace over 500,000 lighting fixtures from May 2014 to May 2016.\n• A coalition of 18 states, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National League of Cities and a number of individual cities has joined the legal defense of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Power Plan as intervenors and amicus.\n• In December 2014, the White House announced 16 Climate Action Champions, selected for their leadership in climate mitigation and adaptation, and their ability to demonstrate successful examples of climate action for other communities across the United States. The Champions included Boston, Dubuque, Knoxville, Minneapolis, Montpelier, Portland, Salt Lake City, San Francisco, and Seattle, and have been receiving targeted federal support to accelerate greenhouse gas emission reductions and climate resilience.\n• Today, the White House announced 10 Communities participating in the Resilience AmeriCorps Program: Anchorage, Boulder, Chicago, El Paso, Minot, New Orleans, Norfolk (VA), Phoenix, Pittsburgh, and Tulsa. These cities will have the opportunity to opt into the Climate Action Champions program. In keeping with the Climate Action Champions' mission, designated communities will exemplify how underserved areas can work with the Federal government and strategic partners to develop plans for becoming more resilient to extreme weather events, increase civic engagement and community resilience, and become champions of environmental leadership for other under-served communities nationally.\nTransportation and Infrastructure: Expanding Ladders of Opportunity Through Infrastructure\nThe President will continue to act when he can to promote job growth in the transportation sector and put more Americans back to work repairing and modernizing our roads, bridges, railways, and transit systems.\n• In December, the President signed the 5-year Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act), which reauthorizes the Highway Trust Fund through 2020, reauthorizes the Export-Import Bank through 2019 and improves the Federal permit review process for major infrastructure projects.\n• Since 2009, the Department of Transportation has awarded 381 TIGER projects in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Cities across the country have been able to break ground on projects to make their communities more livable and sustainable, including the Bronx River Greenway Project and the Phoenix Grand Canal Bike and Pedestrian Improvements Projects.\n• In January 2015, Secretary Foxx challenged city leaders to raise the bar for bicyclist and pedestrian safety by joining a year-long \"Mayors' Challenge for Safer People and Safer Streets\" effort. Today, over 240 cities have signed on to the challenge and are taking significant action to improve safety for bicycle riders and pedestrians of all ages and abilities over the next year.\n• Mayor Muriel Bowser announced Washington, D.C.'s Vision Zero Initiative to eliminate transportation-related fatalities.\nSmart Cities: Launching The Metrolab Network and The Smart City Challenge\nIn September 2015, the Administration launched the Smart Cities Initiative to help communities leverage technology to tackle key challenges such as reducing traffic congestion, fighting crime, fostering economic growth, managing the effects of a changing climate and improving the delivery of city services. As part of that initiative, over 25 mayors have formed the MetroLab Network in collaboration with their local universities to harness university technical expertise to address city challenges:\n• The founding members - including cities from Atlanta to Seattle and South Bend - have collectively committed to undertaking more than 60 projects over the next year, which will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of infrastructure and services in our cities and communities and increase the productivity and competitiveness of our regional economies.\n• The Department of Transportation launched the Smart City Challenge, which will concentrate federal resources into one medium-sized city, selected through a nationwide competition. Up to $40 million in funding will go to one mid-sized city that puts forward bold, data-driven ideas to improve lives by making transportation safer, easier, and more reliable.\nAffordable Care Act: Opening Access To Quality, Affordable Health Care For All Americans\nOn November 6th, the White House launched the Healthy Communities Challenge to engage key communities with large numbers or high percentages of uninsured in states across the country where strong federal, state and community collaboration can have a meaningful impact on reaching the uninsured.\nLocal elected officials from 20 cities and counties across the county are participating in the challenge to get their uninsured constituents covered:\n• New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu challenged barbers and hairstylists to connect their customers to free, in-person enrollment assistance; Kansas City Mayor Sly James recorded a PSA which will play 333 times throughout January; Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia has recruited community organizations to undertake large canvasing efforts in areas with high uninsured subsidy eligible populations; and thanks to Detroit Mayor Duggan, the City of Detroit sent out an ACA mailer with the water utility bills that was mailed to over 200,000 households.\nMy Brother's Keeper: Expanding Opportunity For All Youth\nIn 2014, the President launched the MBK Community Challenge, an effort to encourage communities to implement their own coherent cradle-to-college and career strategy aimed at improving life outcomes for all young people. More than 230 communities in 49 states have taken the challenge and over 130 communities have hosted local action summits.\n• Over 50 communities have completed their local action plans\n• Boston Mayor Marty Walsh launched the Mayor's Mentoring Movement, an initiative in collaboration with Mass Mentoring Partnership to recruit 1,000 new caring adult mentors for Boston's youth. The effort will offer new empowering relationships for boys and girls ages 7 through 18\n• The city of Lansing and its Mayor Virg Bernero accepted the My Brother's Keeper Challenge as part of its \"Mayor's Young Lansing\" (MY Lansing) Commission and Partnership. The Lansing Board of Water & Light is partnering with MY Lansing MBK to replicate its apprenticeship program across industries. A series of community engagement events in 2014 led to the creation of a new coalition that is working with the Lansing Police Department and regional law enforcement officials to develop strategies and solutions that are improving relationships between police and community.\nImmigration: Making Progress in Communities Across the Country\nCities across the country have taken significant steps to welcome immigrants and take other important steps on immigration.\n• In April, the White House launched the Building Welcoming Communities Campaign to create communities that allow all residents to thrive and advance local immigrant and refugee integration efforts. Forty-eight big and small communities from across the country have signed on to date.\n• Cities also worked with the Administration to promote the rights and responsibilities of U.S. citizenship through the Stand Stronger Citizenship Awareness Campaign in September.", "timestamp": "2016-01-21", "title": "Fact Sheet: President Obama Hosts Over 250 Mayors to Strengthen Partnerships and Grow the Economy"}

{"author": "Michelle Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=120943", "text": "MRS. OBAMA: Thank you so much. You all rest yourselves. You work hard. You deserve to sit a little bit. I'm glad it's warm in here.\nWell, good morning, everyone. It is beyond a pleasure to be here with you for your 2016 Winter Meeting. I want to start by thanking Mayor Rawlings-Blake for that very kind introduction, but more importantly for her outstanding service to her city and to this nation. Absolutely. (Applause.)\nI also want to recognize your other terrific leaders -- Mayor Landrieu and Mayor Cornett, who I saw earlier. You guys, thank you so much. (Applause.)\nI see so many familiar faces -- so many mayors and local leaders who we've worked with over the years. Because when it comes to our toughest problems and our most important policies, you all are often the first people we call. You are the ones dealing with these issues on the ground, every day. And so often, you're already leading the way.\nAs Mayor Rawlings-Blake just said, when we launched Let's Move! to address childhood obesity, you all were out there building bike paths and playgrounds and serving healthier food in your schools. When we started Reach Higher, our initiative to inspire young people to pursue higher education, you all stepped up to host College Signing Days for high school seniors.\nAnd when it comes to Joining Forces, our initiative to honor our servicemembers, our veterans, and their families, so many of you have been hitting it out of the park for years -- helping vets and their spouses find employment, supporting our military kids, and working to ensure that every veteran in this country has a place to call home.\nAnd that's exactly what I want to talk with you about today. I want to talk about the work that you've already done and the work that lies ahead for our veterans, particularly on the issue of homelessness.\nNow, as you all know, the overwhelming majority of our veterans come home and they pick up right where they left off -- as leaders in their workplaces, as pillars of their families and communities.\nBut others aren't so lucky. For generations, too many of our veterans -- from Korea and Vietnam to Iraq and Afghanistan -- have fallen on hard times and wound up with nowhere to call home. I know we can all agree that this is an absolute outrage. It is a horrifying stain on our nation, particularly when you think about all that these men and women have done for our country.\nWe all know the stresses that military life can put on them and their families -- how they often have to move from base to base every few years; how they've dealt with multiple deployments, leaving their spouses to juggle things at home for months on end. And then long after they return home and hang up their uniform, some of them wind up dealing with the visible -- and invisible -- wounds of war. And despite everything these folks have done for this country, too often the powerful truth of their service and sacrifice gets lost in all the noise.\nThese days we hear a lot of folks arguing and debating about the threats our country faces -- and they're real. But we must remember that after all that talk, it's our men and women in uniform who are the ones that head to the frontlines and actually walk the walk. (Applause.) They're the ones out there doing the dangerous and heroic work of keeping us safe.\nSo, again, I think we can all agree that if a single veteran returns home and doesn't have a roof over his or her head, that is an affront to everything this country stands for -- because no one who's worn this country's uniform should ever have to spend a single night -- even a single hour -- out on the streets. (Applause.)\nAnd that's why, since launching the Mayors Challenge to End Veterans' Homelessness nearly two years ago, more than 800 leaders have signed up. Through this challenge, we set a clear and incredibly ambitious goal: to end veteran homelessness in your communities by the end of 2015. And once that goal was set, you got to work. And let me just say, I am blown away by what you all have achieved, truly.\nIn Syracuse, Mayor Miner pulled together folks from all across the city -- from government, social service agencies, non-profits -- and she built a team that identifies and houses homeless vets in just 45 days.\nIn Las Vegas, Mayor Goodman rallied governors and mayors from across the region to participate in the challenge. And her team created a list of every homeless veteran in her city, and they enlisted partners to canvass neighborhoods every week to find and house the folks on that list.\nIn just two years, communities of all sizes in all parts of this country have met the goal you set and they've ended veterans' homelessness. Small cities like Biloxi, Mississippi and Rockford, Illinois -- they've done it. Big cities like Philadelphia, New Orleans, Houston -- they've done it. And the entire state of Virginia, they did it too. That's good stuff. (Applause.)\nIn just the last year alone, you all have helped more than 157,000 veterans and their families secure or remain in permanent housing. So you have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that every single community -- large and small, rural and urban -- every kind of community in America can end veterans homelessness. Now, did we meet the goal to solve this problem by the end of last year? No, we didn't. But do we regret having set that goal? Absolutely not.\nI am proud to have stood with you to set the goal. And I am proud that you all took the risk and made yourselves publicly accountable for solving this problem. And I stand here today feeling even more inspired and even more confident in our ability to solve this problem once and for all. See, because when you set ambitious goals, you create a sense of urgency, and then you start taking ambitious action. And even if you fall short at first, you've started to create the momentum you need to ultimately succeed.\nThat's what's happened in San Antonio, where USAA just pledged $2.1 million to fund local non-profits that are working to end veteran homelessness -- because often, when city leaders steps up, businesses and non-profits will be right there beside them. And as Mayors strive to meet our goal, we're seeing that kind of partnership, that kind of momentum all across the country.\nJust take the example of Los Angeles. Now, L.A. has the largest homeless population in this country, but that didn't stop Mayor Garcetti from boldly committing himself and his city to this challenge. So far, they've found permanent housing for over 5,500 veterans. (Applause.) Yes! And in September, Mayor Garcetti announced that L.A. is committing an extra $100 million to ending homelessness. He's also enlisted Wells Fargo as a corporate partner. He's forged relationships with landlords across the city. He's rallying the public to chip in with donations.\nSo while L.A. might have the biggest problem, Mayor Garcetti isn't getting discouraged. Instead, he's making the biggest investment to find a solution in his city. And as he put it -- (applause) -- one of the things he said -- and this is his quote -- he said, \"We will not stop until the men and women who have served and protected our country have a place to call home.\"\nSo I'm not just here today to celebrate the extraordinary cities and mayors who've met the goal we set nearly two years ago. I'm also here to celebrate every city that still has work to do, but has refused to give up and has committed to trying even harder. Because none of us -- even those who have met the goal -- none of us are ever really finished with this challenge.\nAs long as Americans serve in harm's way, we'll always have new veterans transitioning to civilian life who just might need our support. And a veteran in your community who's doing just fine today could fall on hard times tomorrow. So let's be clear: Your work is not finished on the day you have a home for every veteran in your city.\nMayor Landrieu of New Orleans knows that. His city became the first major city to end veteran homelessness last year. I had a chance to go to New Orleans and celebrate with his phenomenal team. But Mayor Landrieu didn't just declare victory and move on. No, no, he kept his city's rapid response system running at full force. And they continue their nightly homeless veteran searches. And since their official announcement, New Orleans has housed an additional 156 veterans.\nSo when it comes to ending veterans' homelessness, we can't just check the box and move on. We need to keep on solving this problem every single day by moving forward. That's why you all just launched a new Task Force on Veterans' Homelessness, which is holding its first meeting this week.\nAnd I want to commend Mayor Rawlings-Blake for her leadership in creating this bipartisan task force, as well as co-chairs, Mayor Giles and Mayor Landrieu. You all, thank you so much for that great work and what you all are doing. (Applause.)\nSee, these leaders know that solutions to this problem are right here in this room, right now. And it is so important for you all to keep coming together at events like this to share best practices and good ideas. Because your peers have provided you all with a roadmap for how to get this done. Whether you're a big city, a small county, or an entire state -- someone just like you has done it. So today, no one can ever again doubt that it's possible and that we know that we can solve this problem. And now that we know, we have no excuse for falling short.\nSo we need to keep pushing forward until we are no longer asking how do we achieve this goal, but instead we're asking, how have we not? That's the very least that we can do for our men and women in uniform. These folks risked their lives for this country. And in return, all they ask is for a chance to get back on their feet, find their next mission, and keep on serving the country they love.\nJust take the story of Matthew Smith from Los Angeles. Growing up, Matthew was always the responsible one -- looking out for his brothers and sisters, doing everything he could to take some of the burden off of his single mother. Then he enlisted in the Army because he wanted to serve and protect the country just like he protected his siblings. But then, in his third year of service, Matthew's grandfather passed away. And while he was home for the funeral, he was caught in the crossfire of a gang shootout. Matthew spent six months in the hospital, and when he emerged with discharge papers and chronic pain from his injuries, he found himself adrift and alone. Matthew's life fell apart. He turned to drugs; wound up living on the streets.\nBut after 24 long, hard years, Matthew finally checked himself into the New Directions for Veterans center. And today, not only is Matthew in permanent housing, and not only has he gotten treatment for his substance abuse, but Matthew is a husband. He is a father. He's a preacher. He's a three-time employee of the month. And best of all, he's working to help his fellow veterans.\nAs a Resident Services Coordinator with the same organization where he sought help, it's now Matthew's job to advocate for other veterans. (Applause.) Yes! He is working to get them into permanent housing, to show them the power of his example that there are better times ahead. And I had the pleasure of meeting Matthew at an event out in L.A. in 2014 where he spoke. And he closed his remarks with the simple motto that he says he uses in his work. He said, \"Whatever it takes, for as long as it takes.\"\nAnd I can't think of a better way to describe the courage, resilience and work ethic of our veterans. That's who they are. Now let's show them who we are. Let's show them what it means to do whatever it takes for as long as it takes. So if you haven't yet signed up to this challenge, please do it today. Do it right now. If you've signed up, but you haven't met the goal, please keep on pushing until you reach it. There are so many Matthew Smiths in our communities right now. You know them. You've seen them. And we need you all to keep on working to find them; keep on doing everything you can to get them back on their feet.\nThat's how we'll meet our goal of ending veterans' homelessness in this country. And that's how we'll serve our veterans as well as they have served this country.\nSo thank you all again. Thank you for everything you've done, everything you will continue to do. I look forward to standing with you in the months and, yes, years ahead, continuing to shine a bright light on your extraordinary work. Thank you all, and God bless.

Rawlings-Blake of Baltimore, MD, in her capacity as president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors; and Mayor Stephen Scaffidi of Oak Creek, WI.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111483", "text": "The President. Thank you so much. Thank you.\nAudience member. We love you!\nThe President. Love you back. Everybody, have a seat, have a seat.\nWell, Stephanie, thank you for that wonderful introduction. Welcome to the White House. It is great to see so many familiar faces, people who I have not only worked with, but who have become friends over the years. And I want to welcome all of our newly elected mayors as well. Congratulations. The rest of you, keep hazing to the minimum. [Laughter] If they tell you you've got to carry their stuff and all that, that's not true. So don't let them take advantage of you.\nI'm not going to speak long at the outset, primarily because you already heard from Michelle, and I always suffer from the comparison. [Laughter] I know that she spoke to you today about ending veterans' homelessness, which is an issue that we all care so deeply about. But I did want to just make a few remarks at the top, and it echoes what Stephanie said in her introduction.\nWhen I took office, I made it a priority to build a strong partnership with mayors in this room and all across the country. And thanks to all of you, America has made extraordinary progress over the past 7 years.\nMayors can't wait for Congress. Mayors can't get stuck in partisan gridlock. We've got Republican mayors here and Democratic mayors, but frankly, if you're a mayor, nobody cares what your party is, they care what you're getting done. You don't have time for a lot of bluster and baloney. [Laughter] Your constituents expect results.\nAnd that's why I think on so many issues—from fighting for working families to combating climate change, to expanding high-tech jobs, to increasing the minimum wage—we have been able to work together to get a lot of things done. In fact, about 40 cities and counties have taken action to raise the minimum wage. Forty have taken action on paid family leave and paid sick leave. Twenty cities and counties are competing in our Healthy Communities Challenge to get more uninsured folks signed up for health coverage. From Little Rock to San Diego, cities are putting people to work retrofitting buildings so that they're more energy efficient. Earlier today, my Administration announced that we are going to award 13 cities, States, and counties $1 billion to help build more climate-resilient communities.\nAnd unlike, sometimes, government officials at other levels, mayors understand that the services and the effectiveness of local governments and government generally is something that we can't take for granted, that we have to work for and fight for and invest in every single day.\nSome of you know I was in Detroit yesterday, but the day before that, I was meeting with Mayor Weaver, newly elected in Flint, Michigan, to talk about what has been a inexcusable situation with respect to drinking water there. In last month's bipartisan budget agreement, we secured additional funding to help cities like yours build water infrastructure. And we're going to have that funding available to you by the end of next week, and that includes more than $80 million for the state of Michigan. Our children should not have to be worried about the water that they're drinking in American cities. That's not something that we should accept.\nAll of you are facing some chronic challenges. They preceded your term in office, and we don't expect that we're going to solve all of them immediately, but the goal here is consistently to make progress. One of those areas where we all have concerns is when it comes to violence on our streets and what happens to our young people. And here, again, we've been blessed with outstanding partnerships with so many of you.\nIn places like Columbia, South Carolina, Mayor Steve Benjamin is implementing recommendations from our Task Force on community policing. In Oak Creek, Mayor Steve Scaffidi, after seeing a terrible tragedy of gun violence in his community, has been working to implement steps that can reduce gun violence in his area. The U.S. Conference of Mayors, understanding the importance of a global economy and making sure that U.S. businesses are creating U.S. jobs and that we're exporting, have been outstanding partners with us on promoting the trade—the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is going to cut 18,000 taxes, tariffs, on American-made goods and products. And that means that we're going to be able to sell more to other people. They're already selling to us. We want to make sure that we're out there writing the rules of the road so that American businesses and American jobs are not left behind in one of the most dynamic, fastest growing regions of the world. So many of you have worked together with us on \"My Brother's Keeper\" and recognizing that we are going to have stronger cities, stronger states, and a stronger country if we make sure that every young person, particularly so many of our young men, are steered away from crime and away from prison and are getting the skills they need to live out productive lives.\nSo we've accomplished a lot together on behalf of the American people. I could not be prouder of the work that we've done together. There's a lot more that I want to get done this past—this last year. I still am pushing hard and we have, I think, a real opportunity to get criminal justice reform done this year. We have to work together to combat the scourge of opioids and heroin that is spreading through so many of our communities across the country. We still have a lot of work we can do to improve our schools. We can work together to break down rules that stand in the way ofbuilding new housing and that keep families from moving to growing, dynamic cities. And as I said last week, we need to keep fighting for a political system that reflects our best selves. And that, by the way, includes making it easier for people to vote, not harder.\nSo bottom line is, all of you are doing outstanding work. You are in the trenches every single day. You're not always getting a thank you; instead, you're getting why didn't you get that done. [Laughter] Or if you got it done, why didn't you get it done earlier. [Laughter] And I know the pace is relentless for mayors because people expect to see you every single day, but just in case you're feeling a little underappreciated—[laughter]—I hope that you understand how heartfelt my words of thanks are. I think that we have seen our cities take leadership and we have seen transformations of communities across this country. And when cities are strong, the states that they're in are strong. And when cities are strong, America is strong. You're helping to fuel that strength.\nSo thank you so much. I appreciate you. Thank you. Thank you, everybody.", "timestamp": "2016-01-21", "title": "Remarks to the United States Conference of Mayors"}

{"author": "Jeb Bush", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=112615", "text": "Forty-three years ago on January 22, the Supreme Court took the issue of abortion out of the people's hands in order to impose its own view. It swept away the laws of all fifty states, inventing a right to abortion that could not be found in the Constitution.\nEven many pro-choice legal scholars have criticized that decision, admitting that the Constitution clearly allows states to enact protections for the unborn. And so Friday's March for Life is also a march for democracy: for the right to use democratic means to advance justice.\nI applaud the marchers, and even more I applaud their noble cause.\nI strongly believe that we should build a culture that respects the dignity of all human life from conception to natural death.\nAs president, I would move, through patient persuasion, toward protecting more and more unborn children from abortion. Many of my fellow citizens disagree with that goal, of course, but I think most Americans can agree that we should at least protect unborn children at 20 weeks of development, when they may be able to feel pain.\nIn an age when parents and grandparents post sonogram pictures of their unborn children to their Facebook pages, and modern medicine allows doctors to save premature babies born earlier than we ever thought imaginable, most people understand that these are young lives worthy of our protection. Nearly all European countries protect children at this late stage of development, and it is time we joined them.\nI believe, as well, that taxpayers should not be the largest source of funding for the organization that performs the more abortions than any other entity in our country.\nWhen I am president, we will reinstate the rule that family-planning money goes to organizations that do not perform abortions. Americans who oppose Planned Parenthood should not be forced to fund it.\nI used persuasion and incremental change to build a culture of life in Florida. We banned partial-birth abortion and required parental notification before minors could have abortions. We forced abortion clinics to abide by basic health and safety standards for women.\nWe required that women considering abortions after their first trimesters be allowed to review ultrasound images.\nWe supported crisis pregnancy centers, so that pregnant women in difficult circumstances—too often lacking support from the fathers of their children—would have the material and emotional help they need. Some of the funding for these groups came from Florida's \"Choose Life\" license plates: something I am proud to say I was the first governor to sign a law to allow. We ended Medicaid funding for abortion.\nAll of these measures faced serious opposition, but had strong public support. And they helped us bring the abortion rate in our state down twice as fast as the national average. Meanwhile we more than doubled the number of adoptions in our state. And I ensured that we defunded Planned Parenthood in our state, too.\nOn all these issues, Hillary Clinton has a different view. When Americans from both parties and both sides of the abortion debate came together to ban partial-birth abortion as a truly barbaric procedure unworthy of our country, she defended it. She said that the voters had no right to decide the issue.\nToday she opposes banning late-term abortions, again siding with the most extreme advocates of abortion. It is a stance that has recently won her the endorsement of the two biggest supporters of unrestricted abortion in this country, Planned Parenthood and NARAL.\nHer vow to keep taxpayer dollars flowing to organizations that perform abortions—a truly perverse example of cronyism—surely helped seal the deal. She says that government should not be involved in abortion, but she means the opposite: government must force all of us to finance it.\nGovernment exists first and foremost to protect our rights and our lives. That's the conservative philosophy. It's also the philosophy of our Declaration of Independence, which declares that we have God-given rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\nThe order Jefferson chose was no accident. The right to life comes first because it is the most fundamental of our rights, the one without which we cannot enjoy the others.\nThousands of people are marching in Washington, D.C., on Friday, January 22 because they understand that we must protect everyone, including the weakest and most vulnerable of all. They know that our country is better than abortion on demand.\nThat is why they will succeed. And it is why I am proud to stand with them.\nOriginally Posted on Fox News", "timestamp": "2016-01-22", "title": "Press Release - Jeb: As President I will Move to Protect More Unborn Children from Abortion"}

{"author": "John Kasich", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=113037", "text": "By Ed O'Keefe\nThe Washington Post\nBOW, N.H. — It was a very good week for John Kasich in New Hampshire.\nLargely forgotten in the nationwide presidential race, the Ohio governor almost got kicked off the main stage at the most recent GOP debate. But a series of recent polls now rank Kasich second or third behind Republican front-runner Donald Trump in the Granite State, a feat he achieved after months of quiet methodical campaigning here.\nThe sudden uptick drew the attention of a multimillion dollar super PAC supporting Jeb Bush's presidential campaign, which unloaded a new attack ad on Thursday that faults Kasich for expanding Medicare in Ohio and for voting as a congressman to cut military spending that forced the closure of a New Hampshire military base.\nIn response, a super PAC backing Kasich produced an ad that literally slings mud on to a likeness of Bush and calls the former Florida governor unpresidential. The Kasich campaign also released a web video Friday mocking Bush's record as Florida governor, claiming he raised fees on doctors' visits for poor children, increased college tuition and hiked the cost of owning a pet snake.\nAmid the sniping, though, Kasich has mostly been striving to keep it clean and nonpartisan in a state that demands intimate retail campaigning — and where voters like to hear lines like the ones he delivered this week.\n\"I happen to be a Republican, but so what?\" he said during an appearance at a logistics company here in Bow. \"The Republican Party is my vehicle, not my master.\"\nEarlier, at a town hall in Concord, N.H., he told a crowd of about 80 people, \"We don't get energy by being negative. I am so tired of my colleagues out here on the stage spending all their time talking about Barack Obama. His term is over!\"\nThat message stands in stark contrast with his GOP establishment-friendly rivals — Bush, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) — all of whom are statistically tied with Kasich in recent surveys here but deliver a more partisan message overall on the trail. Taking note of that contrast, four New Hampshire newspapers bucked the better-known candidates and endorsed Kasich this week.\nRead the full article here.", "timestamp": "2016-01-22", "title": "Press Release - The Washington Post Highlights John Kasich's Dominant Ground Game in New Hampshire"}

Mr. Trump began his campaign focused on this issue, which has resonated with the American people, and he has maintained his strong stance, releasing detailed policies to address this issue posing a threat to America's national security and economic growth.\nMr. Trump stated, \"Ted Cruz is a total hypocrite and, until recently, a Canadian citizen who may not even have a legal right to run for President. He didn't disclose loans, pretending he's Robin Hood, when he's just another all talk, no action politician. Had I not brought up the subject of illegal immigration, an issue which Ted Cruz is very weak on, nobody would even be talking about it.

Bauer served as Under Secretary of Education and head of the White House Office of Policy Development for President Reagan. He later served as Senior Vice President of Focus on the Family and as President of the Family Research Council.\nOver the course of ten years, Bauer led the Family Research Council from a three person, one million dollar operation, to a 120 person, $14 million operation. In 2000, Bauer was a candidate for the Republican nomination for President of the United States.\nAfter the campaign, he founded and now serves as the president of American Values, a non-profit educational organization committed to defending life and traditional marriage. Bauer additionally serves as chairman of the Campaign for Working Families, one of the nation's largest conservative political action committees, focused on electing conservatives to Congress. He holds a law degree from Georgetown and, along with his wife Carol, is the father of three children.\n\"Today, with great pleasure, I am endorsing Ted Cruz for President,\" Bauer said. \"Ted Cruz is a courageous conservative who has built a consistent record on the issues that matter most. He has fought for religious liberty at home and abroad. He believes all of our children should be welcomed into the world and protected by the law. Ted knows that government is too big and that taxes and regulations are too high. He will rebuild our military strength and pursue a foreign policy that repairs our frayed alliances. Ted Cruz understands that Israel is our friend and that Iran is our enemy. He understands that border security is national security. Last, but certainly not least, Ted Cruz is committed to restoring the rule of law and repealing President Obama's outrageous executive orders.\"\nBauer continued, \"Ted Cruz can be trusted to nominate judges who will respect their proper constitutional role and resist the temptation to legislate from the bench. He is the clear choice of Reagan conservatives.\"\n\"I have the highest respect for Gary and his impact on American culture and political life,\" said Cruz. \"As Chairman of President Reagan's Special Working Group on the Family, Gary brought national attention to the importance of marriage and the family.

The campaign additionally announced the endorsements of Assemblymembers Shannon Grove of Bakersfield and Matthew Harper of Orange County together with former Chapman University Law School Dean John C. Eastman. Los Angeles investor Dan Palmer will serve as California state co-chair.\nThe endorsements of Congressmen Dana Rohrabacher and Tom McClintock were recently announced.\nWhat they're saying:\n\"Conservative leaders trusted by the grassroots of our party are uniting behind Ted Cruz for President as we build the campaign organization to win the June 7th primary here in California. Our state will send the largest delegation to the Republican National Convention and our mission is for that delegation to be a Cruz delegation,\" said California campaign chairman Ron Nehring, who served as Chairman of the California Republican Party from 2007 to 2011 and as the party's 2014 nominee for Lt. Governor.\n\"Ted Cruz is the generational principled conservative we have been waiting for since Ronald Reagan. A Republican will win the presidency in this election. As conservatives this is our opportunity to make a difference and make sure that president does the right thing because he is grounded in our values,\" said campaign co-chair Michael Schroeder, who served as Chairman of the California Republican Party from 1997 to 1999.\n\"I support Senator Cruz because he proves his conservative bona fides every day he serves the people of this country. We don't have to wonder if we will get the real thing with Senator Cruz, he shows all of us he is the real thing with every word he says and every action he takes,\" said former legislator Ray Haynes, who served in the California legislature from 1993 to 2007.\n\"I have listened to each of the candidates and reviewed their records and Senator Cruz is the clear choice for President.

I look forward to being a part of the grassroots movement for Senator Cruz here in California,\" said Assemblyman Matthew Harper.\n\"To me, the most important job the President of the United States has is to protect our God-given rights, hallowed in the Declaration of Independence and enshrined in the Constitution and Bill of Rights. Ted Cruz understands this. Our founders pledged their lives, fortunes, and sacred honor to those ideals. Most Americans, and all who wear the uniform, make that same pledge – to safeguard and keep those sacred rights unsullied by human hands. We expect the same from our president. I trust Ted Cruz to protect and defend America's freedom, borders, and way of life from all who wish us harm, foreign, or domestic. That is why I support Ted Cruz for President without hesitation or reservation,\" said Assemblymember Shannon Grove.\n\"I wholeheartedly endorse Ted Cruz for President. I've known Ted for 20 years, dating to our time as co-clerks for Judge Michael Luttig on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Virginia, and then at the Supreme Court of the United States, where he clerked for Chief Justice William Rehnquist while I was clerking for Justice Clarence Thomas. He was then, and is still, a strong, principled, constitutional conservative. This man has the ability to win both the nomination and against whomever the Democrats put up in November, and by so doing pick up where Ronald Reagan left off in restoring limited, constitutional

Wade, thousands of sojourners march for life in Washington, D.C.\n\"Our hearts are heavy as we remember that grave decision – one that has wrongfully denied more than 56 million unborn children the right to life. No judge, president, or lawmaker has any authority to disregard life as knit together by God. We should instead embrace life as a precious gift from God and do everything within our power to defend the most vulnerable among us. This is a question of national character, and an opportunity for families, churches, and communities to stand united and restore the promise of the Declaration.\n\"Millions of Americans recognize the fundamental right to life, and they have fought tirelessly to rectify this injustice and defend the unborn. Their heroic efforts continue to speak the truth in love and make great strides in restoring the sanctity of life throughout the 50 states. I thank them for their unwavering stand for life. Together, we will bend the arc of history towards justice.\"\nIn light of both Martin Luther King Jr. Day and the Roe v. Wade anniversary this week, Ted Cruz penned an op-ed in The Resurgent. See excerpt below:\n\"We cannot neglect the current climb towards justice for all – especially for children.\n\"Just five years after Reverend King's death, another grave injustice stained our nation. The Supreme Court ruled that unborn children have no right to life. That decision defied the very essence of freedom – without life, there is no liberty. Without life, there is no pursuit of happiness. Yet, since Roe v. Wade, that right has been snatched away from 56 million unborn children.\n\"As Reverend King's niece, Dr. Alveda King, has rightly stated: 'Abortion and racism are evil twins, born of the same lie.' The lie that there is no inherent worth in humanity. The lie that some people do not deserve the chance to become the next musicians, scientists, architects, leaders, and service members. The lie that not every life is equally valuable to our Creator.\n\"This is the lie that Reverend King devoted his life to not simply dispelling, but to displaying to the world its utter perversion. He did so powerfully – with grace and conviction. Today, we are called to do the same with any degradation of human dignity.\n\"This week, as thousands gather from across the country to march for life, passing those same steps upon which Martin Luther King, Jr. stood, let us remember his call: 'Now is the time to make justice a reality to all of God's children.'\n\"May we honor this noble wish by cherishing each life – born and unborn – and by working tirelessly to defend those who cannot defend themselves. So that we march onwards and upwards, grounded in prayer and inspired by truth, to recognize the gift of life.\"", "timestamp": "2016-01-22", "title": "Statement by Senator Ted Cruz on the 2016 March for Life"}

[Volunteer, John Shaull] \"Well I'm going to be here making more calls. I know Governor Huckabee has been across the state. About 150 events across the state of Iowa in January. We call it the 'Full Grassley,' when you visit all 99-counties.\" Huckabee's volunteers have been keeping busy, as he announced at the beginning of January that he would host 150 events throughout Iowa.

He started by talking about the economy and the nation's military. \"As president, one of my goals would be to get this country back on track monetarily, fix the economy, make it so people aren't punished for working and rewarded for sitting on their backside and doing nothing,\" he said. He also stressed the country needs to get its military back. \"I tell everyone even if we succeed in getting the country back monetarily and military, we are not going to be the America we need to be, want to be and have to be if we don't get ourselves back in shape morally. Because that's where the heart and soul of this country comes from,\" Huckabee said. In response to what he would do about Common Core in education, Huckabee said education should not be governed at the federal level. \"The federal government should have zero role in education. There is no federal role in education. That agency shouldn't be there,\" he said. \"You don't want that decided by the president and Congress. You don't want the federal government dictating education. You want it decided by the parents, local school boards and the states.\" \"You cannot create a one-size fits all. That's the logic of Obamacare and that's a failure as well,\" he said. One audience member asked his views on renewable energy. \"The RFS in place is a program that works. The federal government wants to end it cause it works.\" He said getting rid of the RFS would put over 75,000 Iowans whose jobs depend on ethanol out of work. One of the quickest ways to do that, is vote for a candidate who opposes RFS. Other topics included the Veterans Administration and its healthcare, Federal Reserve policies and the national debt.\nCBS, Mason City, Iowa—Several presidential candidates will be calling Iowa home until voters cast their votes in the state caucuses... and that includes former Gov.

Huckabee told those gathered that it would be a more fair tax, because it would also collect taxes from some who avoid taxes now by accepting wage payments under the table. He said that, not only do those workers avoid paying income tax, but their employers avoid paying Social Security taxes, as well. Huckabee then spent about thirty minutes or so answering questions from the crowd, that ranged from Second Amendment issues to dealing with ISIS. Huckabee left the gathering after about 45 minutes to head to two additional campaign appearances that were scheduled for Thursday evening.\n\"Mike Huckabee: God Will Judge Ted Cruz's Christian Faith\"—Brietbart News\nGOP presidential candidate former Arkansas Gov.

Huckabee told Fox News's Bill O'Reilly, \"Nobody has caught me saying something different in New York than I say in Sioux Center. If I tell somebody something in Marshalltown, Iowa, they will hear the exact same things in Manhattan.\" Huckabee, a former Southern Baptist Minister, was referencing an earlier report from Politico that Cruz allegedly said he would make protecting marriage a priority while on the campaign trail, but said something different during a fundraiser in New York. \"I have been asked a lot of questions,\" Huckabee told O'Reilly about Cruz. \"And I have pointed out that if someone is going to say they are consistent, they need to be consistent. One of the things that I feel I have brought to this race is that nobody has caught me saying something different in New York than I say in Sioux Center.\" O'Reilly said, \"You are a straight-talking guy….\nCampaigning Safely in Iowa Winters- Sioux City Journal\nThe Iowa caucuses occur every four years in the midst of winters that can be filled with cold and snow...Republican Mike Huckabee was the first candidate to come through Sioux City following the sad death. I asked him Thursday about how candidates juggle the desire to meet as many people as possible with trying to keep safe during travels. Presidential candidates typically plan out events days in advance, when the weather ahead may not be known. Huckabee said safety governs all decisions on whether to hold to a campaign event during poor winter conditions. \"There is no event that is worth taking a chance with....We have to put the people first,\" Huckabee said.He said he immediately sent an email to all campaign workers reminding them to be careful, and if they encounter dicey driving conditions to pull back and wait for a better time. Huckabee noted some of the staffers are not from Iowa and may have limited experience in driving on snow. He told the workers, \"We want to run with every ounce of energy...but put your safety first.\"Huckabee said the weather during his Iowa stops during the 2015-16 winter months have worked out well, as no bad conditions have necessitated cancellation of a planned event...\nFoxNews Local Broadcast \"Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee: You Decide 2016\"\nFamily: Married to Janet Huckabee with three children...Religion: Southern Baptist...On the issues:...Economy: Huckabee wants to abolish the IRS and create FairTax, which he says would lower taxes, bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. and guarantee criminals pay their share. He prides himself on his track record of cutting taxes as Arkansas' governor….Education: According to Huckabee, the high cost of college threatens middle class families and students. He says colleges must be reformed and the U.S. Department of Education should be abolished….Environment: The former Arkansas governor supports the Keystone pipeline, exploring the Arctic, and pursuing wind and solar energy options….Gun control/rights: As president, Huckabee says he will defend the Second Amendment, oppose new gun control laws and protect the rights of gun owners. \"This issue is crystal clear. Abolishing guns because of reckless abusers makes as much sense as abolishing cars because some people drive drunk,\" he says on his website….Health care: He wants to repeal Obamacare and tackle what he calls out-of-control health care costs. Huckabee says he believes life begins at conception….Immigration: Huckabee opposes amnesty for illegal immigrants and supports securing the board. \"If you reward people who play outside the rules and punish people who live within the rules, pretty soon nobody is going to play by the rules. We are a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of laws,\" says the former TV host….National security: As president, he wants to rebuild U.S. military superiority, restore our country's role as leader of the Free World and defeat radical Islam….Social issues: He says he will defend and protect traditional marriage.\nBill O'Reilly Confronts Mike Huckabee Over Controversy Surrounding Cruz's 'Tithing' History—The Blaze\nFox New host Bill O'Reilly confronted Republican presidential contender Mike Huckabee on Thursday night... O'Reilly questioned whether Huckabee has been too critical of Cruz, with the candidate pushing back and defending himself after a BuzzFeed story in which he was quoted saying that \"it's hard to say God is first in your life if he's last in your budget….I was asked a question generally and I said, 'I don't think you can put God last in your budget if you claim that he's first in your life,\" Huckabee told O'Reilly. \"Christian stewardship is something that I believe in\"...As TheBlaze previously reported, some critics are taking aim at Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz's \"tithing\" history, claiming that he contributed less than 1 percent of his income to charitable causes between 2006 and 2010 — much less than the 10 percent that is embraced as the standard by many Christians...A new evangelical group called Americans United For Values is slamming Cruz in a 60-second radio ad, questioning the Texas senator's authenticity and dubbing him a \"phony.\" The spot comes as the state's caucuses are just two weeks away, according to Politico.", "timestamp": "2016-01-22", "title": "Press Release - Huckabee Iowa War Room Update: Jan. 22 Edition"}
{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116773", "text": "The right to safe and legal abortion is on the line—a Republican president would make sure of it.\nWhen the Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade on January 22, 1973, it recognized that the U.S. Constitution protects a woman's right to safe and legal abortion. It's a decision that has withstood 43 years of politically motivated attacks in the courts, in Congress, by state legislatures, and at the hands of violent extremists.\nThanks to Roe, more than four decades of women have had the right to make the most fundamental decisions about their lives, families, and futures. This is about women's health and women's rights—and the fight for reproductive rights is also a fight for economic opportunity.\nToday, on the 43rd anniversary of the Court's decision, the future of reproductive rights in America is more vulnerable than ever before. And it's not an exaggeration to say that if we elect a Republican president to the White House, this could be one of the the last Roe v. Wade anniversaries we mark.\nA Republican president would stack the Court with anti-choice justices\nOver the past five years, states have enacted 288 abortion restrictions (and counting). That's more than the previous 15 years combined.\nThese restrictions—which keep abortion access out of reach for many women and even shutter clinics altogether—undermine women's fundamental rights and health.\nLet's be very clear about one thing: The onslaught of attacks on these rights is not a coincidence; it's part of a deliberate strategy to chip away at the right to abortion altogether, until the Supreme Court has the chance to eviscerate the decision.\nThat may come sooner than you think: An abortion case the Court will hear later this year from Texas, Whole Women's Health v. Cole, is the biggest challenge to Roe we've seen in a generation—one that would be devastating to women in Texas and could significantly affect reproductive rights across the country.\nThis is what's at stake in the 2016 election. When the next president takes the oath of office next January, three of our current Supreme Court justices will be 80 or older—already older than the average justice retirement age. That means our next president could have the power to transform the Court, our laws, and our rights for generations to come.\nJust imagine the damage a Republican president could do. Marco Rubio has said he will appoint justices that will overturn Roe v. Wade. Ted Cruz has referred to today as \"the dark anniversary of Roe v. Wade.\" Ben Carson said he would \"love\" to see the decision overturned. All three of them would support a ban on abortion—even in cases of rape or incest.\nWe need a president who will appoint justices who will protect Roe. We need someone in the White House who will fight for women, who will build on the progress we've made over the past four decades—and who will keep going. We need Hillary Clinton.\nThis fight is far from over\nOur reproductive rights are by no means \"established.\" We fight for them every day. Women's health clinics, doctors, and advocates have been the targets of arson, shootings, and blockades for decades. And just last year:\nAnd we still have laws on the books like the Hyde Amendment, which makes it harder for low-income women—and low-income women of color in particular—to exercise their full reproductive rights. Hillary will fight to repeal it as president. We need a leader who understands that a fight for reproductive rights is also a fight for economic opportunity.\nHillary has been fighting back against these attacks her entire career. As first lady, she led the U.S. delegation to the U.N. Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, where she proclaimed that \"women's rights are human rights.\" As senator from New York, she championed access to emergency contraception and introduced bills to strengthen a woman's right to make her own health care decisions. And as secretary of state, she made women's rights a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy.\nOn the 43rd anniversary of Roe, let's remember the fights we have waged and the hard work that lies ahead. Let's work to elect a leader that never takes the rights we have won for granted and has made protecting them a priority. Let's stand with Hillary. She stands with us—and she's been fighting alongside us on these issues for a long, long time.", "timestamp": "2016-01-22", "title": "Press Release - Today Could Be Roe V. Wade's Last Anniversary"}

Federal programs that serve seniors are not working and many are getting even worse without needed reforms. I have proposed a number of policies to fix these programs and improve the financial security and health of millions of our citizens.Preserve and Protect Social Security and Medicare\nMany retirees rely on Social Security and Medicare for critical health needs and financial security. Unfortunately, Washington politicians have put the Social Security and Medicare trust funds on a course to be drained as soon as 2030, at which point benefits will need to be cut. My detailed plan preserves and protects Social Security and Medicare by implementing a number of reforms, including encouraging private saving, valuing work, slowing cost growth, and giving seniors better choices when it comes to health care benefits. My plan will ensure that no current retiree, or senior approaching retirement, will see a cut in Social Security benefits and that many seniors will benefit from lower Medicare premiums.\nHonor Our Veterans\nThe nation has a responsibility to care for former service members throughout their lives. Yet a series of deeply troubling revelations has shown the government is not keeping that commitment, especially to our older veterans. Under the Obama Administration, we have seen incidents of grave conditions throughout the Department of Veterans Affairs' health care system. I have put forth a detailed seven step plan to restore faith with our veterans and improve the quality of care they receive. My plan includes overhauling the Veterans Health Administration, expanding choice, and improving healthcare for female veterans. For instance, currently, only certain veterans are allowed to choose their doctor. That number should be increased. If a veteran wants to see a neighborhood physician, he or she has earned that choice.\nProvide Tax Relief for Seniors\nI have offered a complete overhaul of the U.S. tax code so we can grow our economy, provide tax relief to more Americans and make it easier to start a business. An important element of my plan lowers taxes on employed seniors. Currently, working seniors who are eligible for Social Security must continue to pay 6.2 percent of their income (up to specified levels) to Social Security. This discourages seniors to stay in the workforce. My tax plan eliminates this tax for employees who have reached full retirement age.\nPromote Innovation in Health Care\nAmerican entrepreneurs have achieved transformational innovations that have greatly improved and prolonged our lives. Medical research remains on the verge of producing breakthrough treatments and therapies for serious ailments, but more investment is critical. For example, Alzheimer's is now the sixth leading cause of death in America and not only causes tremendous suffering but, in aggregate, burdens the nation with hundreds of billions of dollars in additional costs each year. As President, my health care plan will promote innovation by modernizing the morass of federal regulations that stifles new medical discoveries and increase the effectiveness of, and funding for, National Institutes of Health research.", "timestamp": "2016-01-23", "title": "Press Release - Jeb on Top Issues Facing Seniors"}
{"author": "John Kasich", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=113032", "text": "By Thomas Kaplan\nThe New York Times\nWOLFEBORO, N.H. — At a Rotary Club meeting in Laconia, N.H., on Thursday, a woman confided that she feared whether the United States would be safe for her children and grandchildren, citing dangers like the Islamic State.\n\"First of all, we have to stay very calm about this,\" Gov. John Kasich of Ohio replied, before laying out his plans in measured terms and wrapping up, \"Now, do I sound panicked? I'm not.\"\nIn a Republican primary filled with bleak assessments of the country's problems and dire predictions about its future, Mr. Kasich has largely been overshadowed by more fiery competitors. But the conspicuously nonangry candidate is now enjoying a wave of attention in New Hampshire, with some polls showing him gaining strength here, several newspapers in the state endorsing him and, in a sure sign that he is no longer an idle threat, a new attack ad directed at him.\nBy talking of balancing budgets and working with Democrats, Mr. Kasich is appealing to New Hampshire's large proportion of independent voters, who can participate in either party's primary, and the state's centrist tradition of embracing moderate candidates. Mr. Kasich, who was a congressman and the chairman of the House Budget Committee before he was governor, leans hard on his fiscal experience, displaying a national debt clock at town hall-style meetings.\nBut what seems to be stirring support is his strikingly different tone; he even described himself as \"the prince of light and hope.\"\n\"He's not an alarmist,\" said Sharon Norby, a retired teacher who came to a campaign event Mr. Kasich hosted on Thursday night in the lakeside town of Wolfeboro. An independent, she left the meeting having decided to vote for Mr. Kasich.\n\"Yeah, there are big problems,\" she said. \"But he's not saying, ‘And therefore we have to carpet bomb these people.' No. You have to be calm. I like that.\"\nSome of the other candidates, she added, were \"making people more nervous than they need to be.\"\nMr. Kasich's presidential ambitions depend on New Hampshire because he remains far behind the front-runners in national polls, Donald J. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. There are also questions about the reliability of some polls in New Hampshire that have Mr. Kasich as high as second.\nHe is hoping that a strong showing in the Feb. 9 primary here would give him the kind of national attention that has so far been elusive. Asked whether they had a favorable or unfavorable impression of Mr. Kasich in a Monmouth University poll released on Wednesday, half of Republican voters nationally had no opinion.\nWhen a woman at one of his events on Thursday described the primary season as \"particularly entertaining,\" Mr. Kasich, who has sometimes seemed to be a spectator in his own race, playfully responded, \"I may have a little different view.\"\nMr. Kasich has largely avoided being bloodied in recent weeks by attacks from other candidates, unlike some of his rivals for the so-called establishment vote, such as Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey.\nBut in a sign of the competition to attract these voters, Mr. Kasich is now being targeted with a negative television ad from a \"super PAC\" supporting former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, which shows him with President Obama and asserts that he is \"wrong on New Hampshire issues.\" (A super PAC supporting Mr. Kasich has its own ad going after Mr. Bush, accusing him of \"desperately slinging mud on fellow Republicans.\")\nCompared with some of his rivals, Mr. Kasich has a markedly different view of how voters are feeling — and what they are looking for, and not looking for, in the country's next president.\n\"If you turn on the television or if you read, people say that the voters are all angry,\" he said at the Rotary Club meeting, addressing a small crowd gathered inside a 19th-century textile mill. \"I must be going to the wrong meetings because I don't really pick that up.\"\nInstead, Mr. Kasich said, \"I find that people want to have answers and they want to be hopeful.\" People, he added, \"don't want to be angry about things.\"\n\"We never enjoy our lives when we're mad about things all the time,\" he said.\nRead the full article here.", "timestamp": "2016-01-23", "title": "Press Release - The New York Times: With Calm and Experience, John Kasich Connects in New Hampshire"}

Don't vote for me.\"\nLittle about Kasich's message is standard political operating procedure. He is more apt to mention God on the campaign trail than he is his Democratic opponents, much less his Republican ones.\n\"This is not a political speech — this is a life talk,\" Kasich told workers at a warehouse in the town of Bow, observing that \"the Lord has put his hand on me for some reason. But he's got his hand on everybody in this room if you let him.\" Then he wondered, \"What do you think? Am I out of my mind here telling you this stuff?\"\nHis style is folksy and meandering, bordering at times on goofy.

Did you ever notice how long it takes them to leave that space? Huh?\"\nKasich has a reputation for prickliness, yet he seems the happiest warrior on the 2016 campaign trail, with a message that is distinctly populist and bipartisan. The Kasich stump speech invariably begins with his roots: his mailman father, his coal-miner grandfather who died of black lung, his grandmother who could barely speak English.\n\"I come from a blue-collar Democrat town, and all the people I grew up with, most of them are doing exactly what you're doing,\" Kasich told the workers in Bow. \"So . . . who do you think I respond to?

Barack Obama. \"It reminds me of what happened here in Iowa eight years ago,\" Sanders said of the doubts she tried to plant about Obama's and now his experience and electability. \"But you know what, people in Iowa saw through those attacks then and they're going to see though those attacks again.\"\nIn fact, polls show Sanders is far more electable. In general election matchups with Republican frontrunner Donald Trump, Sanders substantially outpolls Clinton. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll in mid-January, for example, found that in Iowa, a battleground state, Sanders was 13 points over Trump, 51 percent to 38 percent. Clinton's margin over Trump was only eight points.\nSanders also spoke here and earlier Saturday in Davenport, Iowa, about Wall Street jitters about his growing success.\n\"It appears that we have Wall Street a little bit nervous and that is a good thing,\" Sanders told volunteers at a field office in Davenport, Iowa, as they prepared for a day of door-knocking to bring people out to the Feb. 1 precinct caucuses.\nHe was referring to a Wall Street Journal interview, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, with Stephen Schwarzman, the head of the Blackstone Group, a global private equity firm. Schwarzman blamed Sanders for rattling stock markets because of his growing support coupled with a sense that \"we have Republicans on the other hand who don't inspire enormous confidence in terms of their ability perhaps to handle that job.\"\nSanders has made Wall Street reform a major issue in the contest for the Democratic Party presidential nomination. In a speech in New York City earlier this month, Sanders said Wall Street's business model is \"fraud\" and questioned whether Clinton's plan to regulate the financial industry would work. He also spoke about \"very generous speaking fees\" Clinton accepted from financial institutions, a reference to more than $3 million she took in 2013 alone from Goldman Sachs and other big banks.", "timestamp": "2016-01-23", "title": "Press Release - Clintons, Wall Street Getting Nervous as Sanders Gains in Iowa"}

{"author": "Joe Biden", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=121178", "text": "THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much, Mr. Prime Minister. And I want to thank you and your wife, Dr. Davutoglu, for your hospitality. When you come to Washington and visit me and the President, I can't promise you something as magnificent as this, although we're incredibly proud of -- (laughter) -- you look out over the Bosphorus, you look -- I say to the press my greatest problem was concentrating on our conversation. Fortunately the chairs were facing the wall, not the windows. It's just absolutely magnificent.\nAnd I sincerely mean it, Mr. Prime Minister, you and I have -- I think it's not presumptuous to say -- built a close personal relationship, as well. I trust you. We trust one another. And I should say to the press, we always scare the living devil out of our respective staffs because we start taking out maps. (Laughter.) And he and I start pointing. And I can see the military guys on both sides going, oh, my God, what are they going to do? But we usually get it right. And I thank you very much for the -- for not only the discussion, but the precision of the discussion.\nThe Prime Minister and I have -- I hope a number of things in common -- but one is that we want to make sure -- because it's such an important relationship, Turkey and the United States, that there is no misunderstanding -- that there is no misunderstanding; that where we agree, we agree with precision; where we have a disagreement, we state it flatly.\nAnd the truth is on the strategic questions we're discussing, there is no disagreement. We do agree with you, Mr. Prime Minister, that in terms of their actions, Daesh and PKK, and al-Nusra, there's no substantive -- they're terrorist groups. They're simply terrorist groups.\nAnd here in Turkey, they threaten and do harm and are of severe consequence to the interests of the people of Turkey. And we do recognize that.\nAnd I want to begin by offering, though, my deep consolences to the Turkish people, as referenced yesterday after I came out of the Blue Mosque and the wonderful hospitality of the mufti. And I was able to become -- the American press traveling with me is used to my saying things like this, but you made me a hero. I was able to show my wife and my granddaughter the Blue Mosque, and they now think I'm important that I was able to do that. But it was -- it is such a moving, incredible experience.\nAnd again, thank you for the hospitality.\nBut we did place a carnation at the site of the most recent bombing, the most recent atrocity committed by Daesh, where 10 German tourists were blown up. But I said at the time, and I'll say again, we Americans don't fail to understand how many Turkish citizens have been the victims of terror and continue to be. So our hearts go out to the Turkish people and the families of the foreigners, in this case the Germans, who lost loved ones. And we are determined collectively and together to wipe out these terrorist organizations.\nWe spent a great deal of time in our discussion -- we ran over -- because we were talking about our shared mission on the extermination of ISIL. And we've gotten very precise -- very precise. We do believe that our plans together have matured. They've gotten more coordinated. And we're increasingly making progress. And I am confident that we will -- that that progress will be sped up as a consequence of our meeting today and our continued collaboration.\nAnd there is a thorough understanding that ISIL presents a clear and present danger not only to Europe, to the neighborhood, but particularly to Turkey. And we have shown robust cooperation in the commitment to defeat ISIL in Turkey, and we've taken -- Turkey has taken some very important steps, very important steps to improve the security at its border. And America and other coalition aircraft are now operating out of Turkish air bases so we can gather better information about ISIL activities. We can ramp up our air campaign against ISIL targets to the highest tempo since the beginning of the campaign. And we can better support local forces on the ground that we jointly support as they take back territory.\nBut today we agreed to do even more. Today we discussed how we can improve the support of local Sunni Arab forces working to cut off what remains of ISIL's access to the Turkish border. And that's a priority for both our nations so that we can prevent new fighters and equipment from reaching ISIL and conducting attacks against Syria and so that the control now and after we defeat ISIL of the border is within Turkish control, that it's secure, that there are no separate states sitting on your southern border.\nAnd so together we continue to work toward a political resolution of the situation in Syria. We are neither optimistic nor pessimistic. We are determined in terms of how this beginning. John Kerry is meeting in Saudi Arabia as we speak. We're meeting, all of us, in Davos. The Prime Minister and I separately met with our counterparts, and we do know that it would be better if we could reach a political solution. But we are prepared. We are prepared if that's not possible to make -- to have a military solution to this operation in taking out Daesh.\nAnd again, ISIL is not the only existential threat to the people of Turkey. The PKK is equally a threat, and we are aware of that. Although we believe the vast majority of Kurds want to live in peace with everyone in society, I have to be absolutely clear, the PKK has shown no desire or inclination to do that. And it a terrorist group plain and simple. And what they continue to is absolutely outrageous.\nAnd I know -- we know, the world knows that your government, Mr. Prime Minister, has in the past tried to find a negotiated peace with the PKK, to lay down arms or leave. And they have not, and you've been left with no option.\nBut I hope and I'm certain that you will not give up the possibility of continuing to try to encourage a political solution. But in the meantime, you must do what you need do to protect your people.\nAnd we talked about the contribution that can be made in Iraq. I've spent a great deal of time in Iraq. One of the things we talked about is the way -- there is an expression, an old expression in America, there is more than one way to skin a cat. But we talked about, and we hope we can work out with Ankara and Baghdad and all parties included is a joint and coordinated effort to defeat ISIL, take back Mosul, and make sure it does not become a proxy for any other country in the region, that it's returned to the people of Mosul. And that's who will occupy that city.\nAnd so we talked about potential modus vivendi to be able to do that. I am not authorized, but I am sort of self-appointed to see if I can work out something between my good friend the Prime Minister of Turkey and my good friend the Prime Minister Iraq as to where we can work out a modus vivendi because we're all on the same page.\nAnd so there's much more to talk about. We went into great deal, but I'm not going to take your time because we're all hungry. (Laughter.) No, because we're about to go to lunch. And there's a couple more subjects that we're going to raise. I want to just mention, Mr. Prime Minister, how much I appreciate your commitment to try to end years of deadlock in the conflict on Cyprus. Both -- I met with both parties on the island, they're moving toward a negotiated agreement. I think it may be -- may be, God willing -- finally within the reach to see if we can reach a settlement. Turkey is playing a critical role in advancing a just and lasting settlement. And I want to thank the Prime Minister for the strong support of what has turned out to be, in my view after dealing with this for years and years and years, genuinely Cyprus-led discussions, which is the key ultimately.\nAnd we're also working together to strengthen the energy security of Europe. But it is our view that Turkey has an opportunity to play a historic role, a critical role as a lynchpin and a potential transit hub connecting the region from Azerbaijan to Israel to Iraq to Europe. And it holds great potential. And we are prepared to work with and be of any assistance we can in putting Turkey in that position.\nSo I greatly appreciate this opportunity to meet with the Prime Minister and I believe to genuinely make progress on a number of issues that are important to both our people. So the partnership between our two nations is enduring. It's rooted in history. It's in the hearts of our people. There are hundreds of thousands of proud Turkish Americans who make my nation stronger every day. And I want to close by saying: Turkey is a strategic partner. The success of Turkey -- economically, politically, and physically -- is overwhelmingly in the self-interest of the United States of America. And I hope our Turkish friends feel that reciprocally, that our success is theirs, as well.\nSo thank you, Mr. Prime Minister. And thank you all for taking the time to come and listen.", "timestamp": "2016-01-23", "title": "Remarks by the Vice President Following a Meeting with Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu in Istanbul, Turkey"}

The transcript was made available by the Office of the Press Secretary on January 22, but was embargoed for release until 6 a.m. on January 23.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111487", "text": "Hi, everybody. When I took office 7 years ago this week, more than 15 percent of Americans went without health insurance. For folks who did have coverage, insurance companies could deny you coverage or charge you more just because you'd been sick. And too many Americans gave up their dream of changing jobs or going back to school because they couldn't risk giving up their employer-based insurance plan.\nWe've changed that. As the Affordable Care Act has taken effect, nearly 18 million Americans have gained coverage. In fact, for the first time ever, more than 90 percent of Americans are covered. Up to 129 million Americans with preexisting conditions no longer face the risk of being denied coverage or being charged more just because they've been sick. A hundred and thirty-seven million Americans with private insurance are now guaranteed preventive care coverage. We've done all this while cutting our deficits and keeping health care inflation to its lowest levels in 50 years. And we've begun filling the gaps in employer-based care so that when we change jobs, lose a job, go back to school, or start that new business, we can still get coverage.\nIf you want to know how important that is, just ask an American like Heather Bragg. Heather's a small business owner in Bluffton, South Carolina. Last year, she wrote me a letter and told me how, for years, her family had depended on her husband's job for their insurance. But thanks to the Affordable Care Act, her husband Mike had the freedom to switch jobs and join Heather at the small business she'd launched a few years ago.\nThrough the health insurance marketplace, they found better coverage that actually saved them hundreds of dollars a month. Today, Heather only pays about $10 for the asthma inhaler she needs. \"For the first time,\" Heather wrote, \"we're not living paycheck to paycheck; we're able to pay our bills and put some money back into savings.\" And because Mike doesn't have to work nights or weekends anymore, he can coach their son's soccer team and tuck the kids in at night. And you can't put a price on something like that.\nIf you haven't looked at your new coverage options, you've still got time to get covered on the health insurance marketplace for 2016. In fact, you have until January 31, next Sunday, to enroll. Just go to healthcare.gov or cuidadodesalud.gov or call 1-800-318-2596. Most folks buying a plan on the marketplace can find an option that costs less than $75 a month. Even if you already have insurance, take a few minutes to shop around. In fact, consumers who switched to a new plan for 2016 ended up saving an average of more than $500.\nThat's what the Affordable Care Act did. This is health care in America today: affordable, portable security for you and your loved ones. It's making a difference for millions of Americans every day. And it's only going to get better. Thanks, and have a great weekend.", "timestamp": "2016-01-23", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}
{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111436", "text": "TODD: This morning, there is some good news though for Clinton. She won the endorsement of the \"Des Moines Register\". By the way, as did Marco Rubio on the Republican side but one would argue the \"Des Moines Register\" will probably have a greater impact among Democratic caucus goers.\nSo joining me from Cedar Rapids, Iowa is the former secretary of state Hillary Clinton. Madam Secretary—welcome back.\nCLINTON: Thank you—Chuck. It's good to talk to you this morning.\nTODD: You got it.\nLet me just start with this. Your opponent 74 years old, calls himself a socialist, started this campaign with next to zero name recognition. You have 38 of 44 U.S. senators endorsing, 12 of 18 Democratic governors. He has zero.\nWhat happened? What's gone wrong? Save me the \"we always knew this was going to be a close race\" answer.\nCLINTON: Well Chuck—look, I think it's actually good for the debate that we're having that there is so much interest and energy that I feel on my side and I know, obviously so does senator Sanders on his.\nWe have a big choice to make. And it's exciting. I had a great couple of events yesterday. I'm enthusiastically pursuing the opportunity to reach every single voter in Iowa and we're going to see what happens. I feel good about where we are. Obviously, we'll find out a week from tomorrow.\nBut if you look at the differences between Senator Sanders and myself, I just don't think we can't wait. We can't wait to make progress on the myriad of issues that I think we're going to be facing in the next administration. I want to build on the progress that President Obama has made and he has a different approach. And that's what voters are trying to determine, which they prefer.\nTODD: Look, as you know, the caucuses sometimes are about passion, enthusiasm. Let me read you something that was in the \"New York Times\" from Gayle Collins. \"Nevertheless, you can't ignore the fact that Hillary Clinton is now the candidate of the aging Democratic establishment whose supporters pray for a low turnout on the Election Day. That might get her nominated in the long run but it's not really the kind of image that makes you go whistling into the election booth.\"\nBy the way, she wrote that in 2008. By the way, she wrote that in 2008, Madam Secretary. Is there a deja vu happening here?\nCLINTON: No, there isn't. I just have to tell you, can only react to what I'm doing, feeling, getting responses from people. And you know, I feel great that we have the level of enthusiasm that we do and we also have a really good team on the ground that has been working for months to make sure that it's not just here today, gone tomorrow. But people are involved. They are really reached out to and yes, we believe they're going to come caucus. So, you know, the speculation and all the rest of it is entertaining, I admit that. But we're just going to keep moving forward and do the work that we think is going to be successful on February 1st.\nTODD: Are you worried that experience, your long resume, is not an asset in this wild year?\nCLINTON: No, I'm really not. Because I think at the end of the day people take this vote seriously. They know they're voting for who they prefer to be the next president and commander in chief, and I believe that when I am out there talking with people about what we have to go up against here at home, get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top, begin to raise incomes, which hasn't happened, deal with health care, going from 90 percent coverage, which is what we have under the Affordable Care Act now, to 100 percent and I lay out what intend to do to get there.\nI can only tell you they see people nodding. I know people are signing up as they leave my events. That's what matters here. It's very personal, and people look and they think, can we imagine this person to be president and commander in chief? And because of my experience, particularly my years as secretary of state working with President Obama, I think that's something that people really take into account.\nTODD: What are you willing to—you know, it's interesting, your husband used a lot of political capital—you and your husband used a lot of political capital to do health care. President Obama, arguably, used all of his political capital to get health care passed.\nWhat is it? What is the one issue you are going to be willing to use all your political capital to focus on? You and I both know you basically have one big shot at one big issue. What is it that you're willing to use all your political capital to do with?\nCLINTON: Well, Chuck, first of all, I don't agree with you on that. I think that there are several really important issues, health care being one of them. We've got to get costs down. I met a man on Friday who no longer can afford to pay for his HIV medication. I met a woman yesterday whose bill for the drugs she must take and has taken for 25 years has gone from a couple hundred to over $14,000 for the same amount of the drug.\nThat really hits my heart. I know what people are going through. I'm going to use whatever tools I can to get us lower prices, cap those prescription drug companies and take that on.\nBut I'm also going to focus on the economy because unless we create more jobs and get incomes rising and fix the tax system so that it doesn't in so many ways tilt toward the wealthy, people are not going to get ahead, they're not going to feel they're getting ahead and they're going to still believe that the government, the economy is rigged against them which is bad for our democracy. TODD: As you know, your opponent Senator Sanders has been hitting you on Wall Street contributions and including some paid speeches that you did for Goldman Sachs among other banks. Let me ask you this—why do you think one of these big banks paid you over $200,000 for a speech?\nCLINTON: Well, look, I gave speeches to a wide array of groups from health care groups to auto dealers and many, many more, and I think what they were interested in because what we talked about was the world coming off of four years as secretary of state in a complicated world, people were interested in what I saw, what I thought, they asked questions about matters that were on their minds. A lot of interest in the bin laden raid, how such a tough decision was made and what I advised the President. You know, I think Americans who are doing business in every aspect of the economy want to know more about the world. I actually think it's a good conversation for people to be having.\nTODD: You don't think they expect anything in return?\nCLINTON: Absolutely not. You know, first of all, I was a senator from New York. I took them on when I was senator. I took on the carried interest loophole. I took on what was happening in the mortgage markets. I was talking about that in 2006. They know exactly where I stand.\nAnd I'll tell you, Chuck, it's really interesting to me that now Karl Rove has taken money from the financial interest to run an ad against me to try to influence Democrats not to support me. Why? Ask yourself why.\nBecause he knows number one I know what must be done, and number two I know how to get it done to make sure that Wall Street writ large, not just the banks but the investment banks, the hedge funds and everybody else, no longer can wreck our economy the way they did in 2008.\nTODD: All right. Two more quick questions.\nThe \"Des Moines Register\" editorial, in praising you and your experience, did bring up the e-mail issue as one of those things that they're frustrated with how you responded to it.\nLet me just ask you this question. Last week you were asked about the FBI investigation. Are you concerned? You said you haven't been contacted by them. Are you concerned this investigation is taking too long? That it's putting an extra cloud over your candidacy and until it gets behind you, you're sort of going to have these issues and Michael Bloomberg even cited it as a reason why he's thinking about running.\nCLINTON: No, I'm not concerned because I know what the facts are. I never sent or received any material marked classified. I cannot control what the Republicans leak and what they are contending. And I said it was interesting, Chuck—you'll as a political observer understand why. You know, back a couple of months ago Kevin McCarthy spilled the beans that the Benghazi investigation was all about bringing me down, something that I suspected but I went ahead, testified for 11 hours, answered all their questions, and even they admitted there was nothing new.\nAnd now Senator Grassley shows up at a Trump rally yesterday in Iowa. He's the chairman of the judiciary committee who has—and his staff have been behind and pushing a lot of these stories, and announces he's there for the simple reason, to defeat me.\nI can't control what the Republicans are doing. But I know what the facts are and I will just keep putting them out there. This is something that I think is very clear about what happened and I know it will be over and resolved at some point.

{"author": "Jeb Bush", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=112482", "text": "The next presidential election will help to determine whether we move further away from constitutional government, or make a critical course correction. Most Supreme Court watchers agree that the next president will significantly influence the court's course for at least the next decade, maybe longer. With vacancies possible across the Supreme Court's ideological spectrum, and in the lower federal courts as well, the stakes are high. Nothing less than preserving the form of government our Founders gave us—with limited powers, and accountability to the people—is at stake.My Commitment\nAs president I will take an oath to \"preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.\" Appointing judges who believe in the rule of law is a vitally important part of that job, and one that I intend to do to the utmost of my ability.\nToo often the Supreme Court has, in effect, rewritten the Constitution. Sometimes it has invented rights that are not found in the Constitution and used them to strike down legitimate laws with which five Justices disagree. At other times it has failed to enforce parts of the Constitution. When it does either of these things, the Court erodes our system of government and short-circuits the democratic process\nOur Founders gave us a limited government and divided its powers to protect liberty and accountability. They also gave us an amendment process to change the Constitution when needed. But because too many justices have viewed the Court as a kind of permanent constitutional convention, we have drifted far away from these wise arrangements.\nIf the Court goes the wrong way, we face a troubling future. Our strong tradition of religious liberty, which is already under assault, could erode precipitously. The right to bear arms could be read out of our Constitution. School-choice programs that have given hope to children all over our country could be ended by judicial fiat. The states could be reduced to mere administrative sub-units of the federal government. Liberal dogma could be placed in the way of reasonable protections for unborn children, even when most people agree on them.\nI will do everything in my power to avert that fate. In my view, the federal courts have a vital but limited role in our national life. Their job is not to second-guess laws or to substitute their own judgment for the provisions of the Constitution. It is to apply the laws as written, and follow the Constitution above all. Because many cases present genuinely difficult questions, judges who share these convictions will not always agree with one another on how to apply the law in particular cases. But they will look to the text, original understanding, history, and structure of the Constitution for their answers—not to their own views about which public policies would be better, not to their sense of the zeitgeist, and not to what might win favor on editorial pages. They will defer to the elected branches on issues the Constitution leaves to them to resolve. But when laws conflict with the Constitution, they will not hesitate to strike them down.\nAs president, I will search for nominees who agree with this job description—nominees in the mold of such Justices as Samuel Alito, Antonin Scalia, and Clarence Thomas—and I will fight for their confirmation.\nWe should not have any illusions about this fact: It will be a fight. Long gone are the days when we could count on Senate Democrats to accept conservative nominees who are well-qualified and have records that testify to their character and integrity. These days, their desire to have courts that will impose the liberal agenda they favor trumps such old-fashioned notions. A nominee with a record of applying the law as written—the kind of nominee I will select—is guaranteed to draw opposition from them, whether that nomination is for the Supreme Court or a lower appellate court. I am eager to have that debate when I am president, and I am confident that those of us who believe in judicial fidelity to the Constitution will win it.\nMy Record\nFor months now, I have been telling voters across the country that, as president, I would welcome the opportunity to nominate and fight for judges who will enforce the Constitution as an enduring document, not as a living document that constantly changes to accord with liberal fashions. Voters need not take my word for it, however. They can simply look to my record as a two-term governor of Florida.\nAs governor, judicial appointments were one of my top priorities. When I took office, Florida's judicial selection process was subject to excessive influence by special interests. Together with the Florida legislature, I created a new process better geared toward filling the state courts with jurists who had a sound understanding of their limited, but important, role.\nMy administration devoted substantial time to the vetting process and made appointments with the utmost care. I detailed publicly the criteria I would use to select people for the bench: humility, courage, an appreciation of the duties of a judge, a respect for the will of the people, and devotion to full application of the law without equivocation. And then I scoured Florida for people who met that test. While the reforms did not give governors a free hand in appointing judges, I was able to make a dramatic change for the better in the state's courts.\nMy two appointments to the Florida Supreme Court, Raul Cantero and Kenneth Bell, are strong examples of my philosophy of judicial appointments in action. Both Justice Cantero and Justice Bell have earned reputations as the Florida Supreme Court's most consistent conservatives. I also looked to the future with my appointments: Two of the appellate judges I named, Charles Canady and Ricky Polston, are now serving with distinction on the Florida Supreme Court.\nI would approach nominations to the federal courts and the U.S. Supreme Court with the same rigor and care as I approached appointments to the Florida Supreme Court. My strategy:\n* Assemble the broadest possible pool of candidates who meet the core qualifications.\n* Scour their records and vet their references.\n* Keep on the list only those people with a proven history of respecting both the limits of federal power and the will of the people.\n* Identify those most willing to stand up for the law, even if it runs contrary to their own policy preferences.\n* And fight to confirm the most qualified candidates who meet those criteria.\nThe federal courts are at a crossroads. I want to ensure they go down the right path. We cannot afford to elect a president who will pack the courts with politicians in robes willing to subvert the legal process to advance their political agendas. We need a president who is committed to nominating people who clearly understand the difference between judges and legislators, and who have demonstrated records of respecting the Constitution's limits on federal authority. That is what I am committed to doing, that is the record I built in Florida, and that is how we will ensure that our courts are realigned with the Constitution.\nNotable Public Statements on Judicial NominationsLiberty University Speech:\n* Judges must not \"mistak[e] themselves for elected legislators and impos[e] restrictions and rights that do not exist in the Constitution.\" (Breitbart 5/10/15)\nOpen Letter to Florida Bar Outlining Philosophy:\n* \"All else being equal, I will appoint judges whom I believe share such values as a belief in judicial restraint, limited government, a respect for the will of the people, and devotion to the full application of the criminal law without equivocation.\" (Florida Bar News 11/1/99)\nStatement on Appointment of Raoul Cantero to Florida Supreme Court:\n* \"Increasingly, courts have seized control over policy decisions that are not theirs to make. I'd prefer that judges distinguish themselves by their adherence to the fundamental principle of the separation of powers. I do not know of any Americans or Floridians who have consented to government by judiciary.\" (Statement of Governor Bush re appointment of Raoul Cantero to Florida Supreme Court 7/10/02)\n* \"The increasing power of courts…should not come at the expense of institutions that have a more legitimate claim to govern our lives. As the courts grow ever more powerful, there is an even greater need for judges who are humble about the judicial role. Humble in the sense that they know courts are not mini-legislatures or governors.\" (Statement of Governor Bush re appointment of Raoul Cantero to Florida Supreme Court 7/10/02)\n* \"Courts exist to protect freedom. This includes the individual rights that each of us holds dear. But freedom also means the shared right of the people to govern themselves through their elected representatives in the Legislature and the Executive Branch. A healthy respect for the people's right of self-government, and a strong dose of humility, are absolute prerequisites for a good judge.\" (Statement of Governor Bush re appointment of Raoul Cantero to Florida Supreme Court 7/10/02)\nCourts as Protection for Individual Rights:\n* \"Judges have a really difficult job. They must balance judicial independence, which is a guiding principle for democracy, with a respect for the primacy of the legislative and executive branches as policymakers. They must guard our individual rights . . . but not at the expense of our collective right to self-government. And perhaps their greatest challenge is to resist the urge to substitute their own values and policy preferences for those embodied in the law.\" (Florida Bar News 1/15/03)\nOne of the most important responsibilities of the judiciary is to safeguard the individual rights that the people have enshrined in our Constitution. But that is precisely the point: a judge must enforce the Constitution that the people have actually adopted, not the Constitution that the judge wishes the people had adopted. It is only through faithful adherence to this principle that courts can respect both individual rights and the people's collective right to self-government. Problems arise when courts attempt to impose their personal values and policy preferences on the rest of us. This is the very definition of judicial arrogance. In all my judicial appointments, I have sought men and women with the humility and intellectual integrity to subordinate their own will to the rule of law.\nJeb Bush\nJanuary 12, 2003", "timestamp": "2016-01-24", "title": "Press Release - Realigning the Courts with the Constitution"}

I believe every American voter has an obligation to pick a commander in chief worthy of the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform and someone with the experience, judgment and temperament to keep our nation safe.Jeb Bush is that leader. Jeb is ready to be commander in chief during these dangerous times.\nAs a transformational two-term governor of America's largest swing state, Jeb Bush has been tested, time and again. In the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Florida's tourism-driven economy took a major hit. Jeb successfully brought Republicans and Democrats together in support of a series of economic reforms that jump-started Florida's economy and resulted in his state becoming the national leader in job creation and small business creation.\nGov. Bush also set the gold standard for emergency management and disaster preparedness when he mobilized the Florida National Guard and led an unprecedented recovery effort after eight major hurricanes hit his state from 2004-2005.\nJeb Bush knows how to make tough calls when under fire. This is why 30 retired admirals and generals and 12 Medal of Honor recipients, including South Carolinians Maj. Gen. James Livingston and Corp. Kyle Carpenter, have joined me in endorsing Jeb's candidacy.\nAs a retired colonel in the United States Air Force Reserves and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I know how important it is to have a commander in chief who is committed to rebuilding our military.\nBarack Obama's devastating defense cuts are undermining our national security. In a commanding speech before cadets at The Citadel, Gov. Bush outlined a comprehensive strategy to strengthen our military and ensure that our soldiers have the training and equipment they need to execute their missions successfully.\nGov. Bush has also outlined a detailed strategy to destroy ISIS. Unlike many of the other Republican candidates, Jeb has been honest about the need to put more American boots on the ground in the Middle East to take out ISIS. He deserves credit for having the courage to tell the truth about what is needed to destroy ISIS. This will not be an easy fight, but it is one that America must lead to restore stability to the Middle East and to protect our homeland from terrorist attacks like the mass shootings in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif.\nGov. Bush also understands that American leadership is necessary to mobilize a coalition of our Middle Eastern partners and European allies to take the fight directly to ISIS. America must lead, but we cannot fight this war alone. The Bush strategy would embed our soldiers with the Iraqi military, arms the Kurds, re-engage with the Sunni tribal leaders and send a clear and unmistakable message to Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Jordan that America is all in when it comes to destroying ISIS — but they must step forward as well.\nGov. Bush recognizes that Bashar Assad, the butcher in Syria, must be toppled in order to take out ISIS and restore stability in Syria. Assad's brutality is a recruiting tool that ISIS uses to radicalize Sunnis in Syria. Donald Trump mistakenly believes that we can sit back and allow Assad, Putin and Syria to fight it out. However, he misunderstands the complexity of the region, what is needed to restore order and how to end the slaughtering of innocent Syrians that has led to one of the worst refugee and humanitarian crises in recent memory.\nGov. Bush's Syrian strategy embraces many of the ideas that I have advocated such as establishing a no-fly zone to prevent Assad from barrel bombing innocent civilians.\nGov. Bush would also create safe zones in Syria for refugees, and he would provide military and logistical support to moderate forces in Syria. Jeb knows that American leadership is also required after Assad falls to ensure that the country doesn't lurch deeper into chaos or fall into the hands of radical Islamists. After all, the infamous \"leading from behind\" foreign policy of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton already led to the fall of Libya, and we cannot allow that to happen again.\nIt is easy to talk tough on foreign policy and give sound bites about carpet-bombing the Middle East. However, it takes deep thought, humility and an understanding of how to project American military power to chart out a clearly defined strategy that will successfully destroy ISIS and protect America.\nJeb Bush stands head and shoulders above the rest of the field in meeting the commander in chief test, and I encourage my fellow Republicans in South Carolina to join me in voting for him.\nOriginally Posted on The Post and Courier", "timestamp": "2016-01-24", "title": "Press Release - Lindsey Graham: Jeb Bush is Best Choice for Commander-in-Chief"}

A CBS News Battleground Tracker poll released earlier Sunday showed Sanders holding a one-point edge over Clinton. The same survey had Sanders 19 points ahead in New Hampshire and gaining ground in South Carolina.\n\"On Feb. 1 you have the opportunity to say that it is just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics and together we are going to take this country in a very different direction and that in fact we are going to make a political revolution,\" Sanders said.\nOn foreign policy, Sanders contrasted his vote against the war in Iraq with Clinton's support for the 2002 invasion. \"That is a difference in judgement in what turns out to be the most important foreign policy moment in the modern history of the United States,\" Sanders said.\nOn Wall Street reform, Sanders has introduced legislation to break up the biggest banks to protect consumers and spare taxpayers from future bailouts like the 2008 taxpayer rescue of Wall Street. \"In my view, the business model of Wall Street is fraud,\" he said. \"Today three out of the four largest banks in this country are larger than when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail. The time is now to break them up. That is not the position of Secretary Clinton,\" Sanders added.\nOn paid family leave, Sanders laid out his support for bills in Congress to provide three months of paid leave. The legislation, introduced by leading Democratic women in the Senate and House, would pay for the program with a $1.61 payroll tax. \"I think it's a good investment,\" Sanders said. \"Secretary Clinton does not support that legislation.\"\nOn Social Security, Sanders detailed his plan to expand and extend the retirement and disability program by making the wealthiest Americans pay the same share of their income into the system as everyone else. He agrees with President Barack Obama's proposal to lift the cap on wages subject to the payroll tax. His legislation would make those earning more than $250,000 pay the same tax rate as those who earn $118,500 or less. \"On that issue, I support lifting the cap. Secretary Clinton does not,\" Sanders said.\nOn the planetary crisis of climate change, Sanders was a leader opposing a pipeline to ship some of the dirtiest oil on the planet from the tar sands region of Alberta, Canada, to refineries in Texas. \"If we are going to transform our energy system and move away from fossil fuel we cannot support the Keystone pipeline,\" he said. \"I was out front on that issue, Hillary Clinton did come out late in opposition to the Keystone pipeline. I would have appreciated it if she had come out earlier.\" Sanders also has opposed the proposed Bakken Pipeline that cuts through Iowa and three other states. Clinton has not taken a position. Clinton also refused to release a comprehensive plan to stop the worst effects of climate change, despite saying she would in July 2015.\nOverarching all other issues, Sanders said, is the corrupt campaign finance system which allows millionaires and corporations to try to buy elections so they can control Congress and protect their special interests.\n\"We are living with a rigged economy and a corrupt campaign finance system,\" Sanders said. \"The people of Iowa will have to determine … which candidate is willing to stand up to Wall Street and the billionaire class and represent working families.\"\nThe CBS poll released today showed that 91 percent of Iowa Democratic voters believe Sanders would pick regular people over big donors.", "timestamp": "2016-01-24", "title": "Press Release - Locked in Close Contest in Iowa, Sanders Details Differences with Clinton"}

Let's jump right in.\nThe first question is from Jeremy and he asks about my new cyber security plan, \"how does this tie into 'national security'?\"\nI'm glad you asked Jeremy. This has everything to do with national security — the job of the President of the United States, first and foremost, is to secure our country and defend its borders from all enemies, foreign and domestic. And I mean all borders, physical and digital. We live in a new age of tactics and an evolving battlefield — it is unconventional and asymmetrical.\nNot only do we need to have the most robust military fighting force in history, with the intention of peace through strength, but also the capabilities to thwart both domestic and international terrorism through our digital infrastructure. With so much of our data and information being stored and transmitted electronically, we must be able to secure our national interests by putting in place safeguards to prevent theft. Our financial stability and future rests on the assuredness and proactive thinking our country deserves — and, I know the spirit of American ingenuity will shine in this new frontier.\nThe next question is from Emily who asks about the \"importance of our 2nd Amendment, the right to bear arms.\" She stressed to me how important this issue is to her and wanted to know if I am committed to protecting her right to defend both herself and her family.\nNo question Emily, I fully support the Second Amendment. 100%. This question ties back into the previous one about \"security\". It is paramount that a free society be able to defend itself, that is the distinguishing characteristic of a free people. It is also important that you elect a leader that understands the paramount nature and genesis of our right to bear arms: not only do we need a \"ready and able\" citizenry for the militia if need be, but even more importantly, it is for the people to be able to defend itself against a tyrannical centralized government which might oppress its people. History is a great reminder and we need look no further than the formation of our own nation to see an example of this. Lest we forget.\nLet me be clear: I will not infringe upon the guaranteed right of our law-abiding citizens to keep and bear arms. Period. We have vilified those who look to protect themselves and their families long enough, it's time we started focusing our attention to those who openly call for our destruction.

But don't let her know it, I like to tell her I let her win, but the truth is, she actually beats me at games more often than not, even at pool! That's what I love about her; she's dignified even when she beats me, that's the kind of woman she is. Humble and loving, she can make me laugh like no one else. The smile on her face when she can tell exactly what I'm thinking. She is my best friend, and if I'm going to get beat by someone, who better than the one who makes me a better person. But, I still like to think I'm better at pool, but she has me beat when it comes to musical talent!\nAgain, thank you for letting me into your homes to spend this time with you.

Much like the National Aeronautic and Space Administration (NASA) coordinated and unified America's space exploration efforts, the NCSA will unify and drive a national effort to secure personal, private and government computers against the many threats facing the country. Rather than a new bureaucracy, this administration would streamline existing programs, consolidate efforts and eliminate stovepipes that hinder cooperation.\nWith estimates that internet traffic will soon eclipse a zettabyte, earning more than $1 trillion annually for the American economy, the need to secure U.S. interests online is more urgent now than ever. Recent hacks of personal data, sensitive weapons plans and the Ukrainian electrical grid demonstrate just how vulnerable we are. Dr. Carson's plan will put this issue in the forefront, educating and empowering the American people and their government to respond to cyber threats forcefully and effectively.\n\"We need a new space race for the 21st century; a cyber space race,\" said Dr. Carson. \"When President Kennedy said he'd land an American on the moon, it brought together every part of America, from ordinary citizens to the highest levels of government. That is the kind of effort we need to drive American cyber leadership. My plan to unify cybersecurity efforts behind a National Cyber Security Administration will bring more accountability and efficiency to our government's cyber initiatives. There is no challenge too great when 'We the People' set our minds to a solution. We must turn our attention to securing America's cyber leadership for generations to come.\"", "timestamp": "2016-01-25", "title": "Press Release - Dr. Ben Carson Releases Policy Plan for Cyber Security and Innovation"}

His state's economy is on the march. He has built a big budget surplus, with a rock-solid credit rating that is stable. He has stuck with his core convictions in this race, even when he's going against the grain, as with his endorsement of bipartisan immigration reform and Common Core education standards.\nChristie's flip on Common Core was an obvious sop to the GOP base that reflects a character flaw: Excess ambition.\nAs a bonus, he served for 18 years on the House Armed Services Committee, and never threatens to shoot down Russian warplanes.\nTo read the full article, click here.", "timestamp": "2016-01-25", "title": "Press Release - New Jersey Star Ledger Does a Tough, Jersey-Style Comparison of Christie & Kasich"}

John Kasich is also the only candidate with a realistic plan to balance the federal budget. Skeptical? In Congress he led the effort to balance the budget for the first time in a generation as chair of the Budget Committee in 1997.\nAs a U.S. congressman he spent 18 years on the Armed Services Committee, where he was a strong proponent of President Ronald Reagan's security agenda. Today we face a myriad of threats to our security, and we need a leader with the resolve and experience to stand up to our enemies. Gov. Kasich has a detailed plan for strengthening our military, renewing our alliances and standing up to bullies like China and Russia.\nFinally, Gov. Kasich is the most electable candidate in the presidential race. Time and again, Hillary Clinton's advisors have publicly admitted that John Kasich is the candidate they are most afraid of facing in a general election.

Rick Perry is a friend and a remarkable public servant,\" said Cruz. \"He is a proud veteran who bravely served our nation, and he was an extraordinary governor of Texas.

We're ready to rock the house! #HuckBass\"\nFACEBOOK=> The political attacks are never-ending, leaving many to ask, \"Who is telling the truth?\" \"Which way is up?\" I'm reminded of Proverbs 22:28: \"Remove not the ancient landmark which your fathers have set.\" This verse refers to ancient boundary stones that served as critical navigation points - the GPS of Biblical times. If these landmarks were moved, travelers might become hopelessly lost. Our culture has inherited invaluable political boundary stones from the Founding Fathers. What looks like confusion and darkness in America is a result of moving cultural boundary stones. We have moved the boundary stones of freedom, by trading liberty for government dependency. We have moved the boundary stones of marriage and family, by redefining them. We will become hopelessly lost as a culture unless we return to the Judeo-Christian values this country - by the providence of God - was built on.\n\"Huckabee continues 150-event Iowa campaign whilrwind Sun., Mon. & Tues.\"….DES MOINES, Iowa—Mike Huckabee will continue his 150-event January campaign schedule for Iowa, with events tomorrow, Monday and Tuesday….\"Authenticity and conviction matters, and I will never say one thing in Marshalltown, Iowa and another in Manhattan,\" said Gov. Huckabee. \"As others launch nasty attacks, our positive message is resonating and our momentum continues to grow across Iowa with a week remaining before the caucuses.\" Since January 19, Huckabee has held Iowa events every single day, and he will continue campaigning daily in Iowa until the caucuses. Huckabee will be joined by actor, Jim Labriola, often noted for his role in the popular television show \"Home Improvement,\" from January 26—31….\n\"Huckabee joins Firehouse at the Surf\"—Mason City Globe Gazette...Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee took some time off from traditional campaigning Friday night when he took the stage to perform with FireHouse at the Surf Ballroom. Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas and 2008 winner of the Iowa caucuses, played the bass guitar with the rock band. It marked a return appearance for Huckabee at the Surf. In 2008, he played with Boston's Barry Goudreau...\n\"Janet Huckabee campaigns and greets voters\"— Mason City Globe Gazette...Several presidential candidates will be calling Iowa home until voters cast their votes it the state caucuses and that includes former Gov. Mike Huckabee and wife, Janet. We caught up with her today in Mason City at Cabin Coffee. There she helped campaign on behalf of her husband, by speaking with voters about the values her family stands for. Janet says she enjoys meeting voters one on one, because it creates a more open and honest dialogue about the issues they want to see fixed. \"We have some major problems in America. This is not the time for on-the-job training. We need people with leadership skills people back and say I've been there and done that. We have some difficulties in America. Mike has a proven record. You can look at the state of Arkansas and see that he has been through difficulties,\" said Janet Huckabee. Friday, you can catch the Huckabees in Clear Lake at the Surf Ballroom. Mike is scheduled to play bass guitar for the 80's rock band Firehouse. Janet says beyond playing the bass, Mike sets himself apart from other candidates by having conviction toward issues like abortion. \"We have been saying for a long time that we are pro-life. Others are pro-life, but Mike wants to use the constitution, the fifth and the 14 amendment to say now we can use the Constitution to protect life and that is because the Constitution guarantees people or persons due process,\" said Huckabee. The Huckabee campaign has 150 Iowa events planned for the final month before the caucuses...\n\"Huckabee's 5 grandkids inspired him to seek presidency\"—Des Moines Register... Mike Huckabee stood in the middle of the moving RV and pointed to the 23 photos of his five grandchildren stuck onto the walls around the inside of the vehicle. The photos \"remind me about why I'm doing this,\" the former Arkansas governor and Fox News talk show host said as he rattled off the children's names and ages, their likes and dislikes. He sees the photos each time he gets onto the RV and each time he disembarks to talk with Iowans about why they should support him in the Feb. 1 Republican caucuses….None of Huckabee's grandchildren had been born eight years ago when he made his first run for president….\"I'm not convinced that the America they are growing up in is one that is going to give them the same level of opportunity and freedom that I have been so blessed in this country to have grown up with,\" he told a group at the Ogden senior citizens center in January. He left his job at Fox News a year ago and in May announced he was running for president. The day after his announcement, Huckabee was in Iowa. Since then, he's spent 65 days in the state, stopping in all 99 counties... What gives Huckabee hope is that the poll also showed that 56 percent of likely caucusgoers could either change their minds about their first-place choice or had not settled on a first choice. \"He surprised us all in 2008; it could happen again,\" said Jayme Neiman, assistant professor of political science at the University of Northern Iowa. Huckabee was trailing in the polls until a month before the 2008 Iowa caucuses but pulled out a win, garnering nearly 41,000 votes, the most ever for a Republican... Huckabee remains optimistic. \"My sense is, folks haven't nailed it down yet,\" he told The Des Moines Register. \"Some of them won't until the night they go to the caucuses.\" That's why at each town hall, he tells audiences to go the caucuses regardless of the weather. \"But, if you're not going to caucus for me,\" he says, only half-jokingly, \"stay home and watch it on TV because it will be cold outside….\"\n\"Huckabee tells Fort Dodge group there's always a surprise caucus night\"—Des Moines Register...If you aren't going to caucus for him, then don't caucus at all, former Gov. Mike Huckabee told a group that gathered to him here on Saturday...Halfway through his stump speech, one of the \"I Like Mike\" signs taped to the window behind him fell. \"There's always a surprise on caucus night. Just go ahead and prepare for another one,\" Huckabee said. He told them to encourage people to caucus, unless they aren't supporting him….\"I really believe one of the things you hire a president to do is to react to things they don't know are coming,\" Huckabee said. He later added that his governing philosophy is to follow the Golden Rule. The former governor of Arkansas came down heavily on the U.S. Supreme Court, criticizing it for its ruling on same-sex marriage. When a president sees a ruling as unconstitutional, it is his responsibility to ignore it, Huckabee said. \"Courts can't make law,\" Huckabee said, adding that responsibility belongs to elected officials. He later told the Register that a court can review law, but giving it an absolute iron-clad say would be tyranny. \"I've followed Huckabee ever since I first heard of him,\" said Marcia Johnson, a Fort Dodge resident who attended the event. \"He has never changed his mind on anything.\" Johnson said she plans on caucusing for Huckabee. Jim Oberhelman, Webster County chairman of the Republican Party of Iowa, said projections he has seen for Webster County anticipate there will be 25 percent more participation than the last caucus. \"Weather may dictate that,\" said Oberhelman, who does not endorse any candidates. After his speech, Huckabee took answers from the crowd. When a man asked where he stands on the Renewable Fuel Standard, Huckabee said he supports it….\n\"Candidate touts experience, laments political correctness\"—Fort Dodge The Messenger\nNearly 11 years as the governor of Arkansas helped to prepare him to be president of the United States, Mike Huckabee told a group of Fort Dodge supporters Saturday. Governors, the Republican candidate said, \"know what it is like to have to make tough decisions in a crisis\"...The candidate, who was a Baptist minister for 12 years, said he's not a career politician financed by corporate donors….\"I'm a guy that got fed up with a system that I saw walking all over people,\" he said. He said he's heartbroken by the deep divisions he sees in American politics today, and frustrated by the climate of political correctness. \"We're turning this country into a politically correct warehouse of nonsense,\" he said. Huckabee said he wants to impose term limits on members of Congress and federal judges. He said Congress will never do that on its own, so he believes the states should press for a constitutional convention to impose that change. The president, he added, should ignore Supreme Court rulings that are unconstitutional. As an example, he cited the ruling which legalized same-sex marriage. He said if he's elected, he'll appoint an attorney general who will \"start protecting human life from conception.\" The candidate said he supports the Renewable Fuels Standard, which he described as a government mandate that actually worked. He said it helped to drive fuel prices lower and stabilized the farm economy. The Renewable Fuels Standard requires a certain amount of ethanol to be used in the nation's gasoline supply…..Huckabee won the 2008 Republican caucus and on Saturday he raised the possibility that he'll repeat the feat this year. \"There's always a surprise on caucus night,\" he said. \"Just go ahead and prepare for another one.\" In a brief interview following his speech, Huckabee said national defense, preserving Social Security and taking care of veterans would be his budget priorities….He described his focus on veterans as \"keeping our promise to the people who keep us free.\"\n\"Every breath of free air we all take is thanks to them,\" he said. The replacement of the income tax with a nationwide sales tax he calls the fair tax would be one of the major changes all Americans would see during a Huckabee administration, the candidate said….He added that he would secure the nation's borders in less than a year….Huckabee also said he would rebuild the nation's military. The candidate was joined by his wife, Janet….\n\"Huckabee expecting Iowa caucus voters to shock national media,\" Spencer Daily Reporter\nDon Andrews, opened with prayer before introducing former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee to a group gathered at the Terrazzo Coffeehouse in the Spencer Dream Center Friday morning. The GOP presidential candidate's visit kicked off a day of travel as part of his 150-city schedule with the Iowa caucus 10 days away. Huckabee kept the crowd laughing, reminding, \"It's so cold ... by Feb. 1, it will probably be colder and there will probably be another foot of snow.\" He insisted that regardless of the conditions those who are going to caucus for him need to overcome any of nature's obstacles. He also suggested bringing a friend or family member on his behalf….He added, \"If you're going to caucus for someone else, remember it's going to be very cold, and there could be another foot of snow. You might want to just stay home and watch it on TV.\" This marked Huckabee's second visit to Spencer during the campaign. The former Arkansas governor was joined by a longtime family friend who has joined Huckabee for these final days on the caucus trail, Debbie Hack, spoke to the audience about her support for Huckabee….\"Mike is a leader. He has lead us as a pastor. He lead us as a governor. He doesn't lead from behind. ... His wants to be elected, but he wants you to see his heart,\" she said...Hack shared a story about talking to a young woman on the campaign trail yesterday who didn't know one person running for president. \"The country is counting on you, get out and caucus,\" she said... \"Shock the media in New York. They think they've got it figured out. It never works out like they tell it. Every four years the people of Iowa vote their conscience,\" he said. \"There has never been a short cut to the Iowa caucus. If this year marks the first time someone can buy the election, it's the end of the Iowa caucus.\" After doing so well in the 2008 caucus, Huckabee said the country has economic and military issues, but he said an even bigger concern is the moral issue of the \"uncivilized surgery that has become normal in America. In this country we kill 4,000 babies a day. How can we ask for ... or sing 'God Bless America?'\" From an economic standpoint, he noted, \"That's 60 million people who would be in the workforce.\" Huckabee fielded a series of questions while sitting on a stool on the coffeehouse stage. Questions covered the Affordable Healthcare Act, Syrian refugees, immigration, medical marijuana and his flat tax plan. The Arkansas native said he would focus health care dollars on a 10-year target to eradicate heart disease, diabetes, cancer and Alzheimer's with as much dedication as America demonstrated to put the first man on the moon and eliminate polio. \"That's not a Democrat or a Republican issue,\" he said. \"There's a lot of things we don't agree on, but we can agree on this. Let's go to work.\" Huckabee took time from his campaign topics to recognize the dream center, speaking about his relationship with Rev. Tommy Barnett and Matt Barnett who founded the dream center concept in Los Angeles. \"It was the most amazing place I've ever been,\" he said of the West Coast outreach. \"People who have no hope find there is hope when they get to know the Lord.\" \"... And they do it without a dime from the government,\" Huckabee added….Addressing the Spencer Dream Center, the lone site not built in a metropolitan area, \"What a blessing. It gives life. Pray for them. Support them. And be thankful to God they're in your community\"….\n\"Huckabee: Prove pundits wrong again\"—WCF Courier...Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee praised Iowans for ignoring the \"talking heads in New York,\" who have already decided the Iowa caucuses before the first vote has been cast. And as the 2008 surprise winner in the Iowa caucuses, Huckabee also urged them to make up their own minds as they have in previous cycles. \"I would love for you to just shove it up the nostrils of the national media on Feb. 1,\" Huckabee told a crowd of about 40 people at Jack & Arnie's Steakhouse in Reinbeck on Saturday, earning amens from the audience. \"I like the independent, stubborn streak in Iowa farmers.\" Huckabee knows better than most that 10 days before the caucus is plenty of time to make his case to Iowans, and he spent his town hall Saturday showing he's got his own independent and stubborn streak. \"If there is any short cut, I've never found it,\" Huckabee told The Courier after the event about winning over Iowans. \"I've always believed that you don't win the caucus just by throwing a bunch of New York-raised money at TV and radio ads, that you have to go meet voters.\" It's a strategy that has worked before, particularly in Grundy County, where Huckabee won all seven precincts eight years ago as part of his 2008 win…...Amanda Aswegan, an organizer in Grundy County for Huckabee now and in 2008, said she's hoping for a repeat again in 10 days. \"We've seen a lot of repeat support, but we certainly don't take it for granted, because there are a lot of candidates running this time,\" Aswegan said. \"It's a week out; this is when we're starting to be serious about making a decision, so the timing of this event is great.\" Huckabee is holding 150 events across the state in the final month before the caucus and has so far completed about 80 of them. Huckabee contrasted himself with the other Republicans running, without naming them, in trying to make his final pitch to voters…..He said he is one of \"only about three\" contenders who are not getting their funding from Wall Street and blamed big money influences for why Republicans have seen so few changes even after electing members of their own party. \"I think it's time to say that big money in politics has really corrupted our system,\" Huckabee said. \"Folks, there's a bunch of politicians that have been bought and paid for by the same check writers.\" In answering one of several questions on saving Social Security, Huckabee also criticized the United States senators running for the presidency who he said have neglected doing their jobs. He proposed, to applause, that elected officials should resign their current position before running for the next one. \"It's getting out of hand,\" Huckabee said. \"People use their public paycheck so they can go campaign and ask for another job. If somebody wants to be a senator, they've asked for a six-year job; on their sixth minute in office, they turn around and start running for president, I just don't think that's fair to the taxpayers who sent them.\" Republican Sens. Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Rand Paul are all first-term senators who are running for the presidency. Donna Cannon of Reinbeck said she likes Huckabee because of his experience and would like him to be, if not the president, the vice president. Cannon said some of the other younger candidates are \"brilliant\" but could use a mentor like Huckabee before they're ready for the presidency. \"He's got the heart. He's really got a good heart,\" Cannon said of Huckabee. \"We need somebody like that.\"\n\"Defunding Planned Parenthood not enough, Huckabee says in Cedar Rapids\"—Cedar Rapids Gazette - Taking a strong stand against abortion, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee told the audience Sunday at an Iowa Right to Life event that he isn't satisfied with just ending government funding for Planned Parenthood. For more than 40 minutes…he said he'd put a stop to abortion — contrasting himself with other GOP candidates calling to defund the women's health provider. \"If all a candidate can promise is stop funding to Planned Parenthood, that isn't enough for me. That's low-hanging fruit,\" Huckabee said. \"Let's do something bolder than that. Let's stop abortion completely.\" Iowa Right to Life is the largest organization in the state opposing abortion rights….\"I was very pleased with the turnout, and the messages Gov. Huckabee said,\" Executive Director of Iowa Right to Life Jenifer Bowen said. \"It was a great opportunity for the people in the Cedar Rapids area to hear more about Gov. Huckabee's pro-life issues. I am very grateful he made the time to speak to our organization.\" Huckabee said he is passionate about the issue. \"The question of protecting life transcends any political views I have,\" he said. \"I have been involved in the pro-life movement far before I got into politics\"... Giving him hope this time, he said, are the people who can still be persuaded in the week before the caucuses. \"We have been going full throttle, calling supporters and making sure they will come and try to close the sale with as many people they can,\" Huckabee said. \"We all know it's a last- minute decision for a lot of people.\" The day after Huckabee announced his campaign for presidency in May, he left for Iowa and has spent 65 days in the state, making stops in all 99 counties. \"I have watched and listened to Gov. Huckabee for years. He is the only candidate that is walking the nearest on the path with my Lord,\" Craig Kroupa of Cedar Rapids said…", "timestamp": "2016-01-25", "title": "Press Release - Huckabee Iowa War Room Update: January 24 Edition"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118064", "text": "In July 2015, the President announced that he had asked the Attorney General to review \"the overuse of solitary confinement across American prisons.\" Since that time, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has undertaken a thorough review to determine how, when, and why correctional facilities isolate certain prisoners from the general inmate population, and has now developed concrete strategies for safely reducing the use of this practice, also known as \"restrictive housing,\" throughout our criminal justice system. That review led to a Report to the President setting out Guiding Principles that would responsibly limit the use of restrictive housing at the federal, state, and local level, as well as specific recommendations for policies that the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) can implement for federal prisons. The Report identifies ways to further humane and safe conditions for both inmates and the correctional officers charged with protecting them.\nToday, the President announced that he is adopting the recommendations in the Report, which is now available HERE and will be directing all relevant federal agencies to review the report and report back on their plan to address their use of solitary confinement.\n\"Guiding Principles\" For All Correctional Systems\nThe Report sets out more than 50 Guiding Principles, which cover a range of important reform areas including the use of the restrictive housing as a form of punishment, the appropriate conditions of confinement in restrictive housing, and the proper treatment of vulnerable inmate populations, such as juveniles, pregnant women, LGBTI inmates, and inmates with serious mental illness. These principles are informed by the best practices developed by the Association of State Correctional Administrators (ASCA) and the American Correctional Association (ACA) and include:\n• Inmates should be housed in the least restrictive setting necessary to ensure their own safety, as well as the safety of staff, other inmates, and the public.\n• Correctional systems should always be able to clearly articulate the specific reason(s) for an inmate's placement and retention in restrictive housing.\n• For every inmate in restrictive housing, correctional staff should develop a clear plan for returning the inmate to less restrictive conditions as promptly as possible. The plan should be shared with the inmate, unless doing so would jeopardize the safety of the inmate, staff, other inmates, or the public.\n• An inmate's initial and ongoing placement in restrictive housing should be regularly reviewed by a multi-disciplinary staff committee, which should include not only the leadership of the institution where the inmate is housed, but also medical and mental health professionals.\n• All correctional staff should be regularly trained on restrictive housing policies. Correctional systems should ensure that compliance with these policies is reflected in employee-evaluation systems.\nNew Policies Addressing BOP's Use of Restrictive Housing\nIn recent years, the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) has reduced its use of restrictive housing by 25 percent without compromising the safety of its correctional officers and its facilities. The Report makes concrete recommendations that will accelerate this trend and change the conditions for thousands of inmates through a multi-pronged strategy. The recommendations that DOJ has proposed and the President has adopted include:\n• Ending restrictive housing for juveniles. BOP is ending the practice of placing juveniles in restrictive housing—in line with the standards outlined in the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act, now pending in the U.S. Senate.\n• Diverting inmates with serious mental illness to alternative forms of housing. BOP will be expanding \"secure mental health units\" for inmates with serious mental illness who cannot function in the general prison population, and hire additional staff psychologists to provide mental health services to inmates who require restrictive housing. The President's Fiscal Year 2017 budget will include a request for $24 million to support these efforts.\n• Diverting \"protective custody\" inmates to less restrictive conditions. Currently, inmates who face legitimate threats inside the prison are placed in restrictive housing, often in conditions similar to those faced by inmates placed there for disciplinary reasons. BOP will build \"Reintegration Housing Units\" at multiple prisons, providing additional space to house \"protective custody\" inmates in less restrictive conditions.\n• Limiting the use of punitive segregation. BOP will undertake across-the-board reductions of maximum penalties when restrictive housing is used as a disciplinary sanction in prison, including an outright ban on the use of the practice for inmates who commit low-level infractions.\n• Holding the most dangerous inmates accountable through federal criminal prosecutions. Working closely with BOP, U.S. Attorney's Offices will ensure that inmates who engage in serious criminal activity—especially those who assault or kill correctional staff—face criminal prosecution when appropriate.\n• Directing wardens to expand out-of-cell time. Wardens at all BOP facilities will be directed to develop institution-specific plans for increasing the number of hours restrictive housing inmates spend outside of their cell, and allowing greater opportunities for rehabilitation and reentry services.\n• Limiting releases directly to the community. BOP will be developing policies that specifically discourage the placement of inmates in restrictive housing during the final 180 days of their prison terms, making it easier for inmates to adjust when they return to the community.\n• Increasing transparency. BOP will begin publishing monthly system-wide restrictive housing data on its public website, and will finalize upgrades in data-collection software to improve tracking of restrictive housing inmates.", "timestamp": "2016-01-25", "title": "Fact Sheet: Department of Justice Review of Solitary Confinement"}

We have screened them to make sure they cover a variety of important issues, and they do. However, the candidates do not know what the questions will be.\nMany of the voters joining us tonight are undecided. Some are leaning toward a particular candidate. Now in a bit, we're going to talk with Governor Martin O'Malley and Secretary Hillary Clinton, but first, please welcome Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. [applause]\nSANDERS: Hi, Chris. How are you?\nCUOMO: Good to see you, Senator. Busy day?\nSANDERS: Yes. [laughter]  And my wife told me to button my coat but I think I'm too fat, so I'm going to keep it like this. [laughter]\nCUOMO: I'll do the same then. I'll do the same.\nSo do you remember when we first started talking about this election many months ago, you weren't sure that you wanted to run. You were not sure, you said, that there was an appetite in this country to discuss the problems between rich and poor.\nHow surprised are you by #feelthebern and all that has followed?\nSANDERS: Chris, our message has resonated much faster, much further than I thought it would.\nAnd I think what the American people are perceiving is there is something very wrong in this country when ordinary Americans are working longer hours for lower wages, when we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country on earth, and almost all new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent.\nAnd then on top of that, people see that that rigged economy is sustained by a corrupt, and I use that word advisedly, a corrupt campaign finance system that allows billionaires today to spend as much money as they want through Super PACs to elect the candidates of their choice. And, all over this country, and it's not just Democrats, it is conservatives, it is Republicans, that are saying that is not what America is supposed to be about.\nSo, if you're asking me why is it that our campaign has created the kind of momentum that it has, I think we are touching a nerve with the American people who understand that establishment politics is just not good enough. We need bold changes, we need a political revolution.\nCUOMO: So, you have... [applause] ...You have centered your campaign on this idea of income inequality. Interestingly President Obama talking about the job just this morning says, \"You do not have the luxury of focusing on just one thing when you're President of the United States. You have to be able to handle many different priorities.\"\nDo you think you are up to the whole job?\nSANDERS: President Obama is obviously right. Being president is an enormously difficult job. It's a job that entails dealing with a million different issues. I think I have the background, I think I have the judgement to do that.\nI would remind you, and remind the viewers that in 2002, when George W. Bush and Dick Cheney said we should go to war in Iraq, Bernie Sanders listened very carefully and I said no. I think that war is a dumb idea. I helped lead the opposition to that war.\nAnd, if you go to my website, listen to what I said, and sadly enough - it gives me no joy. Much of what I feared would happen did happen. I do believe I have the background for the job.\nCUOMO: Well, it is time for you to make the case. [applause] Let's do it with the people that will matter, the voters. The first question for you, Senator Sanders, comes from Gerry Ohde. She says she is an undecided voter. Gerry?\nQUESTION: Yes, Senator, some of your detractors have called you a socialist on occasions, and you don't seem too troubled by that, and sometimes embrace it. I wondered if you could elaborate on that...\nSANDERS: ... Sure...\nQUESTION: ... And just to show us what the comfort level you have your definition of it so that it doesn't concern the rest of us citizens.\nSANDERS: Well, what Democratic Socialism means, to me, is that economic rights, the right to economic security is - should exist in the United States of America. It means to me that there's something wrong when we have millions of senior citizens today trying to get by on $11, $12,000 a year Social Security. It means there's something wrong when the rich get richer, and almost everybody else gets poorer. It means there is something wrong, and government should play a role in making sure that all of our kids, regardless of their income, are able to get a higher education.\nWhich is why I'm calling for free tuition at public colleges and universities, and why we have to deal with this horrendous level of student debt that people are having.\nNow, what's going on in countries around the world, in Scandinavia, and in Germany. The ideas that I am talking about are not radical ideas. So, what Democratic Socialism means to me in its essence is that we cannot continue to have a government dominated by the billionaire class, and a congress that continues to work for the interest of the people on top while ignoring working families.\nWhat this campaign is about, and what I believe, is creating a government that works for all of us, not just a handful of people on the top. That's my definition of Democratic Socialism. [applause]\nCUOMO: Next question. Renea Seagren. She's a nurse, she says she's undecided. She sees how healthcare plays out everyday. She has a concern for you. Please, Renea.\nQUESTION: Senator Sanders, you have branded your program, your single payer health program as \"Medicare for All\", and Medicare has a reputation of having some problems. Let me cite one example, a man in our clinic went into the Donut Hole in September and could not afford the $1,200 a month it would cost him for insulin. So, he had to decrease his dose to make his insulin stretch. So, what do you - why do you think that people would support your medicare for all program?\nSANDERS: Well, I think people will support my medical - Medicare for All program because the United States today is the only major country on Earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people as a right.\nNow, I'm on the committee that wrote the Affordable Care Act, and I think the Affordable Care Act has done a lot of good things.\nBut yet we have 29 million people without any health insurance. Your point is there are seniors today - and I meet them every day - who cannot afford the outrageously high cost of prescription drugs because in America - everybody should know this - we pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.\nLast year, while one out of five Americans cannot afford the prescriptions their doctors write, last year, the three major drug companies made $45 billion in profit because they spent hundreds of millions of dollars on lobbying and campaign contributions.\nSo I believe we should draw in the rest of the world. I believe, as a principle, everybody should be entitled to health care as a right, comprehensive health care.\nAnd, by the way, if we move toward a Medicare for all, not only do we cover the needs of all people, including that gentleman, we will save middle class people thousands of dollars a year on their health care bills, because now we pay, by far, per capita, much, much more than any other country on Earth.\nIt is time, in my view, for us to have the courage to take on the insurance companies, take on the drug companies and provide health care to all people at an affordable cost.\nCUOMO: The criticism is... [applause] ...The criticism is to pay for this, what you're really asking for is one of the biggest tax hikes in history. And that is the criticism.\nSANDERS: But, Chris, that is an unfair criticism for the following reason. If you are paying now $10,000 a year to a private health insurance company and I say to you, hypothetically, you're going to pay $5,000 more in taxes - or actually less than that, but you're not going to pay any more private health insurance, are you going to be complaining about the fact that I've saved you $5,000 in your total bills?\nSo it's demagogic to say oh, you're paying more in taxes. Let's also talk about we are going to liminate - eliminate private health insurance premiums and payments not only for individuals, but for businesses, as well.\nAgain, we are the only country on Earth that allows private insurance companies to rip us off. We spend three times more than the British, 50 percent more than the French. We can do better than we're doing right now. [applause]\nCUOMO: But just to be clear, you are going to raise taxes to do this?\nSANDERS: Yes, we will raise - we will raise the - we will raise taxes, yes, we will. But also let us be clear, Chris, because there's a little bit of disingenuity out there, we may raise taxes but we are also going to eliminate private health insurance premiums for individuals and for businesses.\nCUOMO: All right, next question.\nSean Collison, law student at Drake, says he's undecided.\nWhat do you have?\nSEAN COLLISON: I think you've introduced a lot of programs that could help a lot of people.\nMy question is realistically, how do we fund those programs?\nSANDERS: Good.\nCOLLISON: Where can we reallocate or cut spending on other programs to...\nSANDERS: Sean, great question and a very fair question.\nAnd I start off with the premise that in the last 30 years, although my Republican friends don't like the term, there's been a massive redistribution of wealth in this country. It's gone from working families, trillions of dollars, to the top one tenth of 1 percent.\nSo, yes, what this campaign is about is to say to profitable corporations who, in some years don't pay a nickel in taxes, to the wealthiest people in this country who sometimes have an effective tax rate lower than truck drivers or nurses, yes, you are going to start paying your fair share of taxes.\nNow how am I going to pay to make certain that public colleges and universities are tuition-free and we substantially lower interest rates on student debt?\nI pay for that because we're going to ask Wall Street to pay a tax on speculation. We are also believing, I believe that after the working families of this country bailed out Wall Street, maybe it's their time to help the middle class of this country. [applause]\nNow, I believe that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling. That's roads, bridges, rail, airports, levies, dams. We all know what's happening in Flint, Michigan. Water systems, wastewater plants.\nI believe that if we end this absurdity of allowing corporations who make billions of dollars a year in profits to stash their money in the Cayman Islands, Bermuda and other tax havens, we eliminate that, we're going to bring $100 billion into the Treasury. That money goes into rebuilding our infrastructure, creating 13 million jobs in five years with a trillion dollar investment.\nI have paid for all of our proposals.\nCUOMO: Right. Senator, then the pushback becomes how you pay. Now, in this room, you're preaching to the converted, somewhat, right? These are presumptively Democrats. But, you will hear people say that you're paying for it is actually punitive. You're going to punish people who make money, you're going to punish the financial district, you're going to punish and wind up changing the idea of an open and free economy because you're going to punish them for speculating. Which means they won't speculate as much, which means you won't get as much activity.\nAnd, if you do a checklist of how you pay for everything, what you're doing is amassing the biggest government ever after President Clinton said the era of big government was over. It seems like Bernie Sanders is saying, Not only it's over, I'm going to do it bigger than ever.\nSANDERS: Alright, we got to put what I am doing in context. And, here's the context. Today in America we have more income and wealth inequality than we have had since 1928. There has, Chris, been a massive transfer of wealth, I'm talking about trillions of dollars, from the pockets of working families into the hands of the top one-tenth of one percent. That's a fact.\nSo, if you are telling me that at a time when - Wall Street's recklessness, greed and illegal behavior brought this country to its knees, than I am going to say to them that they're going to have to start paying their fair share of taxes. Fine, if that's the criticism I accept it. I demand that Wall Street start paying its fair share of taxes.\nSecond of all... [applause] ...What about the idea that you're bringing back the era of big government, and making it bigger than ever?\nSANDERS: Again. I believe, and you know, Iowa has played a very interesting role in the fight for public education. And, for a 100 plus years, what we have believed public education to be is up to the twelfth grade. Free public education up to the twelfth grade. Guess what? The world has changed.\nA college degree today is the equivalent of what a high school degree was 50 years ago. People want to criticize me, fine. I believe that every kid in this country who has the ability and the desire should be able to get a higher education regardless of the income of his family. And I will pay for that through a tax on Wall Street speculation.\nCUOMO: They don't criticize the goal, they criticize the method of how you achieve it. Give me a yes or no on that. Is the era of big government back with President Sanders?\nSANDERS: The era of protecting the middle class, and working families is certainly something that I will make happen. I believe, for example, that when my Republican colleagues talk about cutting Social Security, I say that when you're living on $12,000 a year in Social Security, no, we shouldn't cut it. We should expand Social Security. And, we do that by lifting the cap on taxable income. [applause]\nSo, Chris, this is what I think. When we live in a nation of so much income and wealth inequality, where the top one tenth of 1% owns as much as the bottom 90%, when the 20 wealthiest people own more wealth than the bottom half of America, that is not, to me, what the American economy should be about. So, yes. People want to criticize me, OK. I will take on the greed of corporate America and the greed of Wall Street, and fight to protect the middle class.\nCUOMO: Next question, Ron Edwards says he's undecided. Ron, what's your question for the Senator.\nQUESTION: Senator, given the ongoing gridlock in Washington, and the continuing Republican resistance toward President Obama's initiatives, and the likelihood that Republicans will win control over at least on house of Congress. As President, what specifically will you do to overcome the resistance, cure the gridlock, and garner the necessary support to implement your initiatives and actually get something done in Washington.\nSANDERS: Great question. Let me answer it, if I might, in two ways.\nI am probably the most progressive member in the U.S. Senate. But, I have over the years, not only in the Senate, but in the House, worked with Republicans when there was common ground. When I was in the House, in a number of years I got more amendments passed on the floor of the House working with Republicans than anyone else. That was number one.\nNumber two. In the Senate, just a couple of years ago, in a dysfunctional congress I worked with people like John McCain, people like Jeff Miller over in the House, to pass the most comprehensive Veterans Health Care legislation in the modern history of the United States of America.\nI have worked with Republicans when there is common ground throughout my career. But, this is what I also want to say. But this is what I also want to say. In my view, you have a Congress today that is much more worried about protecting the interest of the wealthy and the powerful and making sure they get campaign contributions from the wealthy and the powerful.\nIf we are serious about rebuilding the American middle class, if we are serious about providing paid family and medical leave to all of our people, if we are serious about ending the disgrace of having so many of our children live in poverty, the real way to do it is to have millions of Americans finally stand up and say, enough is enough, for people to get engaged in the political process, to finally demand that Washington represent all of us, not just a handful of very wealthy people.\nThat's the way you bring about real change. [applause]\nCUOMO: Next question, Alexis Kulash, Drake University student, a Bulldog, leaning in favor of Hillary Clinton, but she wants to explain why.\nSANDERS: Give me a shot here, Alexis. [laughter]\nALEXIS KULASH, DRAKE UNIVERSITY STUDENT: Senator, recently you named Planned Parenthood and the Human Rights Campaign as part of the political establishment that you plan to take on. How are you going to fight for women's rights more effectively than a female candidate with endorsements from organizations like these?\nSANDERS: No, no, no. That's not quite accurate. I have a 100 percent pro-choice voting record. In every speech that I give, what I say is not only do we stop the Republican efforts to try to defund Planned Parenthood, we should expand funding for Planned Parenthood. [applause]\nNow what I said, what I said on a television program, and I did not say it well, is that sometimes the base of an organization looks at the world a little bit differently than the leadership.\nSo if you have 100 percent Planned Parenthood voting record, 100 percent pro-choice voting record, there are people who are asking, why is the leadership not either supporting Bernie Sanders or why are they, you know, opposing him?\nAnd my point is that I will fight - these are great organizations. I met with Planned Parenthood. They do a fantastic job not only in defending women's rights in general, but talking about sexuality in America.\nThey are a fantastic organization. Count me in as somebody who strongly supports them.\nSo this was simply a question of endorsement policy, not whether or not I strongly support these organizations. Do I have your vote yet?\nCUOMO: Correct, she's saying, as to the purpose of the question, not to whether or not you have her vote. I think she's going to have to decide on that.\nSANDERS: I know. I'm just kidding, but that is the difference. I support the organization.\nCUOMO: Alexis, second aspect to your question though, right? You said then the first female president. How do you think that you would be as helpful to women as a woman president would?\nWhat about that aspect? That's what Hillary Clinton represents on one level to voters, that she would be the first female president, and there is something special in that, especially when it comes to women's issues.\nSANDERS: And of course, I understand that.\nBut I think if you look at my record in terms of fighting for women's rights, I think there are very few members of Congress who have a stronger record. It's 100 percent lifetime, and I've been there for a while.\nIn addition to that, you know, there have - as you know, women are making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men. That is nothing but old-fashioned sexism, and I am a strong advocate and will fight for pay equity for women.\nI believe that - and it's not only women, although it impacts women and women of color even greater, this level of pay inequality, inequity, is extraordinary. So we're going to fight for pay equity, make sure that everybody earns the same amount for the same work.\nAlso, what we have got to do is people cannot make it on 8, 9, 10 bucks an hour. We have got to raise the minimum wage in this country to a living wage. That will impact all people. It will impact women more than men as we raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour. [applause]\nCUOMO: All right. So...\nSANDERS: Well, one more point, one more point, Chris. I'm trying to win her vote. Leave me alone here. [laughter]\nAll right. Hillary Clinton and I have a disagreement on a very important issue that impacts everybody, but especially women. I believe that we should expand Social Security benefits by lifting the cap on taxable income.\nThat will help millions of low-income seniors, especially women. Ask Hillary Clinton if she's prepared to lift the cap on taxable income. [applause]\nCUOMO: All right, Alexis, I want to put you a little bit on the spot. Now that you heard the answer... [laughter] ...what do you think now - and he looks like that even when he's happy, so don't worry about his particular reactions. [laughter]\nSo after the answer, where are you, same place, open-minded, what are you at?\nALEXIS: It definitely means I'm going to have some hard thinking to do in the next week, but it reassures me and it was a good plan to speak about.\nThank you.\nSANDERS: Thank you very much. [applause]\nCUOMO: Take progress where you find it.\nAll right, we'll give Alexis some time to think, the rest of you as well.\nWe have more questions for Senator Sanders and his final pitch to these Iowa voters when we come back.\nStay with us.\n[commercial break]\nCUOMO: Welcome back to the CNN Democratic Presidential Town Hall here at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa.\nWe're here with Senator Bernie Sanders.\nWe've been talking about the issues.\nYou were working on a young woman there, trying to get her vote.\nI have another woman. I think you've got some work left to do on.\nHer name is Secretary Clinton.\nShe has an ad out now. You both put out big ads. I know how you feel about yours.\nLet's take a look at Secretary Clinton's ad and get your take on it, Senator, right here in this room.\n[begin video clip]\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: The world a president has to grapple with - sometimes you can't even imagine. That's the job and she's prepared for it like no other, a tireless secretary of State, standing up against the abuse of women and girls, negotiating a cease-fire in Gaza, leading the diplomacy that keeps us out of war.\nThe presidency is the toughest job in the world and she's the one leader who has what it takes to get every part of the job done.\nCLINTON: I'm Hillary Clinton and I approved this message.\n[end video clip]\nCUOMO: The argument is sure, Bernie's got the heart, but I have the head. You have to be experienced, you have to know what to do. [laughter]\nIs Secretary Clinton simply better prepared for the job than you, sir?\nDon't leave. We have another 15 minutes. [laughter]\nSANDERS: No, this calls for a standing up response.\nCUOMO: OK.\nSANDERS: That's all. [laughter]  All right, let me shock everybody here. This is true. I've known Hillary Clinton for 25 years.\nYou know what?\nI like Hillary Clinton and I respect Hillary Clinton. And Hillary Clinton has devoted her life to public service and I have tried, as I hope you all know, not to run a negative campaign, not to be attacking every other day, to keep this discussion on a high level, where we debate the issues facing this country. [applause]\nAnd by the way, with a few exceptions, we're doing a lot better than the Republicans in that regard. [applause]\nBut on the other hand, that's not a very high bar to reach, so... [laughter] ...all right.\nBut what is - what is this?\nAll right, what do I think?\nLet me just give you a couple of examples.\nThe truth is that the most significant vote and issue regarding foreign policy that we have seen in this country in modern history was the vote on the war in Iraq. OK, that's the fact.\nI voted against the war in Iraq and if you go to my Web site, listen to the speech that I gave when I was in the House in 2002, saying, yes, it's easy to get rid of a dictator like Saddam Hussein, but there's going to be a political vacuum, there will be instability.\nAnd it gives me no pleasure to tell that much of what I feared, in fact, happened.\nHillary Clinton voted for the war in Iraq.\nAll right, in terms of Wall Street, I fought against deregulation, led the opposition to doing away with the Glass-Steagall legislation. Unfortunately, my side lost. Wall Street became deregulated. The rest is history.\nWall Street has operated, in a very significant way in a fraudulent way, and obviously their greed and recklessness helped destroy our economy and create the worst recession since the Great Depression.\nI led the effort against Wall Street deregulation. See where Hillary Clinton was on this issue.\nIn terms of climate change, which everybody here knows - and apparently everybody in the world knows except Republican candidates for president, is one of the great environmental crises facing this nation.\nOn day one, I said the Keystone Pipeline is a dumb idea. [applause]\nCUOMO: Senator...\nSANDERS: OK. I think the Bakken Pipeline and pipelines in Vermont and New Hampshire are dumb. I think we've got to break our dependence on fossil fuel.\nWhy did it take... [applause] ...Why did it take Hillary Clinton such a long time before she came into opposition to the Keystone Pipeline?\nTrade policy - I have understood from day one that our trade policies have cost us - NAFTA, CAFTA, PNTR with China, millions of decent-paying jobs. I didn't have to think hard about opposing the Transpacific Partnership. [applause]\nIt took Hillary Clinton a long time to come on board that.\nCUOMO: So...\nSANDERS: In other words, yes, I do think I have the background and the judgment to take this very, very difficult job of being president of the United States.\nCUOMO: One point of push back... [applause] ...we know we're in the final stretch here. Intensity gets higher when you're in the final stretch like we are right now.\nSANDERS: Yes.\nCUOMO: But on January 19th, you were talking about Secretary Clinton's experience argument and you referred to Dick Cheney. You said he had a lot of experience, too.\nSANDERS: Right.\nCUOMO: Now... [laughter] ...referring to Dick Cheney when talking about Hillary Clinton not exactly the most high brow way to conduct the election...\nSANDERS: Look...\nCUOMO: - some might suggest.\nSANDERS: - my - my only point was, look, Secretary Clinton was secretary of State of this country for four years. That is a lot of experience. There's no debate about that. I was not secretary of State.\nBut, experience is important, but judgement is also important. And, my own point was in talking Dick Cheney, he had a lot of experience too. His policies with regard to foreign affairs was an absolute disaster. So, experience is important, but it is not the only thing. And, I would urge people to check out my views on foreign policy, how we deal with ISIS, and I think they will make a lot of sense to the people of Iowa, and the people of our country.\nCUOMO: Let's get a question. Carrie Crawford says she's undecided. Mother of three grown kids. What is your question?\nQUESTION: Hello, Senator Sanders. In light of the recent mass shootings, I'm intered to know how you're going to make inroads with the powerful gun lobby to establish more effective gun control legislation.\nAnd, the second part of my question is how will you support easier access to mental health care clinics.\nSANDERS: Good. Excellent questions. Now, I have been attacked - in fact, this is an issue that Hillary Clinton has focused on, and that's politics. And that's fine.\nAlthough, some of you might recall that back in 2007, when she was running against Barack Obama, she also focused on that issue. But she thought that Obama was too strong on gun issues. You may remember him referring to her as \"Annie Oakley\", alright?\nToday, Hillary Clinton's running a lot of advertisements on gun issues. Interestingly enough, she's running most of them in New Hampshire where she thinks it'll work, not running so many of them in rural Iowa. Well, you can form your own judgement as to why that is the case.\nTo answer your question, in 1988 I ran Vermont's lone seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. I ran as an Independent against a Democrat and a Republican. The gun lobby said vote for either the Democrat or the Republican, don't vote for Bernie Sanders. This is 1988. Because Bernie thinks that we should not be selling military style assault weapons in the United States of America. Back in 1988. I lost that election by three percentage points. I cannot tell you that that was the only reason, but I had the gun groups working against me back then.\nSince then, I have supported instant background checks, the expansion of instant background checks because I believe our job, if we're going to end these horrific mass murders, or at least have some impact in lessening the occurrence of them, we have got to do our best to make sure that guns do not get into the hands of people who should not have them. Criminals, people with mental instability.\nI believe as President Obama does that we got to deal with this gun show loophole, and that's what he's working on now with his executive order. People should not be able to circumvent the instant background check through the gun show, or through the Internet.\nI believe that we should make a federal crime of the so-called, \"Strawman Situation\", where people are buying guns legally, going through the instant background check, and then selling them to criminals.\nCUOMO: Senator, address your shift on the issue regarding manufacturers and their liability...\nSANDERS: ... Here is the issue...\nCUOMO: ... Just to remind you guys. Tell them where you were first, and what you just said recently.\nSANDERS: I voted for the bill, and the reason I voted for the bill is you got a bill which has a number of elements in it, among other things it has a section which says we should not be selling ammunition which will pierce policemans armor and protection. I think that's a right thing.\nIt had a section in it which said that we want to have safety locks for children on guns. That makes sense to me.\nIt also had a provision in it which says the following - and people may disagree with me, this is my view. Is that if you are a small gun shop in Vermont, and I legally sell you a weapon, OK? You go out, buy that gun legally, and then you go out and kill somebody. I think the gun shop owner should not be held liable to your criminal act. That's what I believe.\nNow, within that bill also there was some onerous provision. Not good provisions. What happens if a gun manufacturer is selling a whole lot of guns into an area, far more guns than that area can consume? And, what happens if that gun owner - that gun manufacturer should know that those guns are going into criminal hands. Should that gun manufacturer be held liable? Yes, he should.\nSo, I am willing now to look at that legislation, maintain what was good in it, get rid of what is bad in it.\nCUOMO: But isn't that having it both ways? Like, either they have liability as a manufacturer or they don't. The first argument seems to make sense. Why would they be exposed to liability that other manufacturers are not? But are you having it both ways?\nSANDERS: I don't think so, Chris. If you sell, if you are a small gun shop owner and you sell somebody a gun, legally, all right, you don't do anything wrong. That's what you do. You sell guns.\nSomebody buys the gun and then goes out and kills somebody, do I think that gun shop owner should be held liable? I don't.\nCUOMO: What's the difference between selling one or selling 1,000?\nSANDERS: No, but the point is - ah, but here's the point. If a gun shop owner should know, why should somebody be buying 1,000 guns? Somebody should be thinking that does not make a lot of sense. In that case, that gun shop owner or the gun manufacturer should be held liable, OK?\nAnd that's the issue that I want to - now you're asking me also about mental health. When I talk about health care for all, I absolutely include in that the fact that mental health should be treated as part of health care, should be available to all people. [applause]\nI get calls - I have gotten calls in my office, and I'm sure other senators have as well. This is the call. Somebody calls us up and said, I'm very worried about my brother. I'm worried what he might do to himself or, to answer your question, to somebody else. He may be homicidal. He may be suicidal.\nWe have searched desperately to find health care - mental health treatment for him. We cannot find mental health treatment which is affordable, which is accessible.\nIn my view, we have got to move in the direction of making sure that everybody in this country who has a mental health crisis gets health care when they need it, not two months from today.\nCUOMO: Carrie, how do you feel about the answer?\nCRAWFORD: I like the answer. That's sufficient. Thank you very much.\nSANDERS: Thank you.\nCUOMO: Have a seat, Senator. I'm tired following you around there. [laughter]\nSANDERS: If you followed me around today, you'd be a lot more tired. [laughter]\nCUOMO: CNN today, your brother was on.\nSANDERS: Excuse me?\nCUOMO: Your brother was on CNN today.\nSANDERS: Yes.\nCUOMO: Gave a great interview. He said that back in the day you were a great athlete. Is that true? And if so, what was the sport? I'm not saying I don't believe it to be true. I'm saying, is it true and what was the sport?\nSANDERS: You know families exaggerate a little bit. I was a very good athlete. I wouldn't say I was a great athlete. I was a pretty good basketball player. My elementary school in Brooklyn won the borough championship. [laughter and applause]\nHardly worth mentioning, but we did, yes. And, yes, I did take third place in the New York City indoor one mile race. OK, well, you know, I would - I was a very good long-distance runner. I would say not a great runner, but I was captain of my track team and won a number of cross-country meets and certainly won a whole lot of races.\nSo good, very good, not great.\nCUOMO: Right. Now this is what they call a bait and switch. I don't really care about your athletic record. [laughter]\nIf you were elected president, you are 75 now. You would be...\nSANDERS: Seventy-four! [laughter] [applause]\nCUOMO: You are 74 going on 75. You are close to 75.\nSANDERS: I'm going on 75. So are you! You're going to be 75 some day. [laughter]\nCUOMO: That's true. That's true. You would be the oldest person elected president. You have medical records. You say you're going to release them. Should you release them, to be fair to the voters of Iowa, before they vote?\nSANDERS: Absolutely. They're sitting - where are they, Jane? They're on our table right now? All right. We will release them.\nThat's my wife. Yes, of course, we'll release them.\nCUOMO: And you're going to do it before Iowa?\nSANDERS: Yes, sure.\nAnd, you know, I am - you know, if there's wood here, I would knock on it.\nCUOMO: My head is close enough. [laughter]\nSANDERS: I have been blessed with good health and good endurance. And there's nothing in the medical records that is going to surprise anybody. And we will get them out as soon as possible.\nCUOMO: All right. Thank you for clarifying that.\nSomething else your brother said. He got emotional. He was saying, boy, would our parents be proud of the success that Bernie has had. You have to think about that as well. When you think about why you are doing this and what it means, what does it mean to you about what your parents would think if they saw you now?\nSANDERS: That they wouldn't believe it. I mean, we grew up - my dad came from Poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket, couldn't speak English and he never made a whole lot of money.\nAnd my brother and I and mom and dad grew up in a three-and-a-half-room rent-controlled apartment in Brooklyn, New York. And we never had a whole lot of money.\nAnd if you ask me, you know, Chris, this would be so unimaginable the fact that I'm a United States senator would've been beyond really anything that they would have thought possible. The fact that I am running for president of the United States, you know I do think about it and you know think they're very proud. But it's certainly something that I don't think they ever believed would've happened.\nCUOMO: You got 30 seconds. Tell the voters of Iowa what you want them to know.\nSANDERS: Look, Hillary Clinton is a very good person. Martin O'Malley is a very decent guy. So I'm not - you know, this is not a - personal stuff.\nIt just seems to me that the crises that we face as a country today, and we didn't even get into climate change to a significant degree: inequality, poverty in America, an obscene and unfair campaign finance system. These problems are so serious that we have got to go beyond establishment politics and establishment economics.\nIn my view we need a political revolution where millions of people stand up and say you know what, that great government of ours belongs to all of us, not just the few. That's why I'm running for president. Thank you. [applause]\nCUOMO: Sen. Sanders, thank you for taking the opportunity. Good luck to you in the Iowa caucuses next week. [applause]\nAll right. Our thanks to Sen. Sanders.\nComing up, Hillary Clinton and Martin O'Malley get their turns on stage. And our audience of Iowa voters is ready with a new slate of questions. Stay with us. [applause]\n[commercial break] [applause]\nCUOMO: Welcome back to the CNN Democratic Presidential Town Hall here at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa.\nThis is the last best chance for the candidates to face Iowa voters and answer their questions directly before they caucus next Monday.\nNow, we've heard from Senator Sanders.\nIn a bit, we're going to hear from Secretary Clinton.\nBut right now, the floor belongs to former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley. [applause]\nCUOMO: Hey.\nO'MALLEY: Chris, how are you?\nCUOMO: Good to see you, Governor.\nO'MALLEY: Good to see you, too, man.\nCUOMO: [inaudible]. [applause]\nO'MALLEY: I think.\nHey. [applause]\nO'MALLEY: Thanks a lot.\nCUOMO: Have a seat, Gov. [applause]\nO'MALLEY: Thank you. [applause]\nCUOMO: How you feeling a week out?\nO'MALLEY: I'm excited. It's Iowa Caucus time. And Chris, I've seen this before. Once Iowans get into that decision-making pocket, none of the pollsters back East can tell you how it's going to turn out. [laughter]\nAnd - and... [applause] ...I wish you could be out there with me. I have been campaigning the Iowa Caucus way. I've been to over 120 events and getting up on the chair, doing town halls like this.\nAnd we're seeing larger and larger crowds. And the - the beauty of the people of Iowa is they're not intimidated by polls, they're not intimidated by pundits and they have this birthright, they feel, to upset the apple cart.\nAnd with only three of us in this Democratic primary, there's only one of us who can still upset the apple cart. Come on, Iowa, right? [applause]\nCUOMO: \"The Des Moines Register.\"... [applause] ...they gave the nomination - their endorsement to Secretary Clinton, OK. They gave their endorsement to her.\nIn it, they talk about you. And they say that you are, quote, \"better suited as one of her cabinet secretaries than as president.\"\nWhat do you want to tell Iowans right now to prove that their state's biggest paper is wrong?\nO'MALLEY: Yes, well, this - the - this is what I have to say. Look, I'm in this, Chris, to win this. I'm running for president of the United States. And the reason I'm running is this.\nOur country is facing big challenges. And we have deep divisions in our country. And we need a candidate who can actually pull us together, who can heal these divisions, who can get things done. That's what I've done all my life. I'm not a divider. If I were, I would not have been able to accomplish the things we accomplished in a very troubled city or in our state through a recession.\nAnd that's what I believe the people of Iowa are looking for, a president who will move us forward, who will build on the good things that President Obama has done and actually take that job creation legacy and turn it into rising wages again for every American family.\nThat's what we need. And we need new leadership to do that and break through the gridlock of Washington.\nCUOMO: You mentioned President Obama. He was speaking this morning about the election a little bit more deeply than he has in the past.\nAnd he was doing an analysis of Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders. And he referred to the senator as kind of this bright shiny new object and that has a fascination for people.\nI thought you were supposed to be the bright, shiny new object in this.\nO'MALLEY: Yes.\nCUOMO: What happened?\nO'MALLEY: Well, look, I'm honored to be able to offer my candidacy in the company of Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders. If you look at our Democratic primary and the debates we've had, we're certainly doing a much better job of speaking to the goodness within our country rather than to fear and anger and loathing like we've heard from Republicans. [applause]\nCUOMO: Are you ready to make a case to the people?\nO'MALLEY: Yes. [applause]\nCUOMO: All right...\nO'MALLEY: [inaudible].\nCUOMO: - let's take a question.\nWe have Joy Lassen, a student at Iowa State University.\nShe's originally from St. Louis. Her parents work in Ferguson.\nShe says she's undecided.\nWhat's your question for the governor?\nO'MALLEY: Is this Q&A time?\nAm I allowed to stand?\nCUOMO: You can do whatever you want.\nO'MALLEY: I'm not capable of doing Q&A in Iowa...\nCUOMO: Yes, please.\nO'MALLEY: - from a seat.\nCUOMO: Wherever you want to do it.\nO'MALLEY: OK.\nCUOMO: All right. I'll take [inaudible]. [applause]\n[cross-talk]\nJOY LASSEN: Good evening.\nO'MALLEY: Hi.\nLASSEN: Hi.\nYour history as mayor of Baltimore and governor of Maryland show that you pushed for zero tolerance policing and felony punishments for low level drug offenders, which usually affects the black population.\nHow are you planning to ensure racial equality when your history in office contradicts your current platform to fight structural racism?\nO'MALLEY: Yes, well... [applause] ...Well, look, let's talk about this. In 1999, our city of Baltimore had become the most violent, the most addicted and the most abandoned city in America. And when very few other people would step up who could bring us together and turn it around, I did.\nAnd that year, and for about the 12 years leading up to that point, we were burying over 300 young, poor, black men every single year. And, yes, black lives matter. And I told the people of my city look, we did not have to accept the reality of 24/7 drug dealer occupation over our poor neighborhood. When you call from a poor neighborhood for a police service, they should respond the same way that they do in wealthier neighborhoods, black and white.\nThere are a lot of things we got right. There were a lot of lives that we saved. I promise to improve how we police the police. We actually did start closing down open air drug markets.\nAnd in the course of my executive service both as mayor and as a governor, I never stop searching for the things that work so we can do more of them to save and redeem lives, and the things that don't work so that we can stop doing them. So we greatly increased drug treatment. We saved hundreds and hundreds of lives from overdose deaths.\nWe started tracking discourtesy, excessive force. I drove down use of fatal police-involved - fatal police-involved shootings to three of their four lowest years in Baltimore history.\nAnd as governor, I restored voting rights to 52,000 people. I repealed as a crime and decriminalized the possession of marijuana. I banned the box on people who are applying for state employment. And... [applause]\nAnd not the first time, not the second time, but the third time, by bringing people together, including a few Republican votes, I made my state the first state south of the Mason Dixon Line to repeal the death penalty in America. [applause]\nSo...\nCUOMO: Governor...\nO'MALLEY: Look, it's hard to appreciate at the time. But one true story, and quickly, Chris...\nCUOMO: Right.\nO'MALLEY: There is a family of seven people, a mom, dad and five kids who in East Baltimore were firebombed in their sleep and killed by a drug dealer. And the reason? Because they were picking up the phone and calling 911 and asking for relief for their kids from this sort of 24/7 drug dealer occupation.\nLook, I think all of us have a responsibility. I know I feel a responsibility to constantly look for the things that work and the things that don't work. By the end of my time as governor we had driven down violent crime to a 30-year low. And we had also driven down our incarceration rate to a 20-year low. You can do both of them at the same time by doing the things that work. [applause]\nCUOMO: Next question, Dan Conick (ph). He owns small two businesses in Des Moines. He says he's leaning toward Bernie Sanders, but he's here to give you a shot. And he has a question.\nWhat is it? [laughter]\nQUESTION: Hello. Yes. I'm a small business owner...\nO'MALLEY: Tell me your name again.\nQUESTION: Daniel Conick (ph). And I - you know you run the numbers and you try and figure out OK. Well at the end of the day when you're spending as much on your health care every month as you do your mortgage. What ways would you choose to try to lessen that burden on the middle class and just you know small business owners like myself?\nO'MALLEY: Look, I think we need to build upon the good things that President Obama has done with the Affordable Care Act. But no program ever came into existence in a perfect condition. So we have to improve it. And one of the ways I think we need to improve it is by covering those high value sort of early out-of-pocket expenses that people are experiencing.\nWhat I hear from a lot of folks all over Iowa is that maybe while their premiums have leveled off, they're paying more out-of-pocket, more - and their deductibles are higher. So we need to - we need to push the insurance companies to actually offer products that pay for those early, those first out-of-pocket expenses.\nBut let me take you up to a slightly larger and higher level, and it is this. Look, we need to - we need to change what it is that we actually pay for, to put wellness at the center.\nIn my own state we moved all 46 of our acute care hospitals out of fee-for-service and started paying them global payment for all of their Medicare and Medicaid patients. Why? Because the biggest driver of your high health insurance costs, and throughout our country, is the hospital costs at the center.\nAnd we told our hospitals that if you reduce avoidable hospital readmissions, you can share in those savings. And the New England Journal of Medicine did an article about four weeks ago and said I'll be damned, it actually works. [laughter]\nWe can dial up wellness. We can reduce the expense here. And that's the future, I believe. And every state has a role to play in moving that way because clearly we're still paying too much for health insurance.\nOur system's called an all-payer system. We have a rate-setting commission. And we're able to replace the institutional profitability. I mean, the hospitals aren't going bankrupt by any means, but we're able to put wellness at the center.\nAnd that's what we need to do as a country to bring down the high cost of health care. [applause]\nCUOMO: Thank you, Daniel.\nAnother question for you, Gov. Jenna Bishop, she's from Drake University. She says she's undecided on which candidate she's supporting. And she has a question about young voters for you.\nO'MALLEY: Well, it's still early, there are six days. [laughter]\nJENNA BISHOP: Hi, Governor. I'm 23 years old. And I care about a lot of issues, other than just the cost of college. So I'd like to know what issue you think should be most important to young voters and why.\nO'MALLEY: Thank you. Great question.\nI have put forward a plan for debt-free college within the next five years. And as the one candidate among the three of us with 15 years of executive experience, we went four years in a row in my state without a penny's increase to college tuition. So you can check out my plan for that on my Web site, martinomalley.com.\nBut you know what I believe is the biggest issue that I think you should be concerned about as a young person who has more time on this planet than I do? And that is climate change. [applause]\nClimate change is the greatest business opportunity to come to the United States in 100 years. And I am the first candidate in either party to put forward a plan to move us to a 100 percent clean electric energy grid by 2050, and create 5 million jobs along the way.\nAnd this is another one of those instances, Chris, where Iowa is pointing the way forward. Look at what you have already done in your state. Thirty to 35 percent of your energy now comes from clean Iowa wind, which wasn't there 15 years ago.\nAnd you employ 5,000 people in the new industry, and the great thing about those big component parts you see rumbling down the highway on I-80 is they're too darn big for it to make a whole lot of sense to import them from other countries.\nSo you have to build them here. [applause]\nAnd it's a big - and it's a big differentiator among the three of us. I mean, we're all - we're all decent people, we all want to do the right thing for our planet, but there is a generational perspective here. And we're not going to get to 100 percent clean electric grid with an \"all of the above\" strategy, any more than we got to the moon with an \"all of the above\" strategy.\nIt was an engineering challenge. And we are up top this as Americans. But incrementalism, half steps, splitting the loaf, that's not going to get us. And that's not what your generation wants. You want the straight truth and you want us to face our challenges fearlessly and make this new reality ours.\nCUOMO: What works for you in that, Jenna, do you like the answer?\nBISHOP: I think that's great. I think the environment is huge, obviously, especially for those of us that are going to be living a lot of years, hopefully. So, thanks. [laughter]\nCUOMO: Hopefully we'll still be there.\nAll right. Arnold Woods, he is the president of the Des Moines NAACP. He is an Air Force veteran who served in Vietnam. And he says he is still undecided.\nYour question, sir.\nARNOLD WOODS: Yes, I am undecided. And the question I have is, because of the extreme number of our military personnel returning from war zones, combat zones with PTSD, what is your feeling towards reestablishing a military draft?\nAnd for those who are not deemed worthy to go to military draft or to be drafted into the military, do you have any options for them where they can serve our country for a couple years prior to going to college?\nO'MALLEY: Thank you.\nI have put forward in your state 15 strategic goals to move our country forward again, to rebuild the truth of the American dream to get wages to go up, to make college more affordable and debt-free within the next five years, cut drug overdoses in half in the next 10 years, gun deaths in half in the next 10 years.\nBut one of the goals is to cut youth unemployment in half in the next three years. And I propose to do that by making national service a universal option for every kid in America, to serve their country in environmental restoration, or in public health, or in other avenues in addition to the military.\nAnd I believe that that will not only allow our kids to go to college in a more affordable way, giving them an increased Pell grant benefit, but I also know that it will do a great deal to tap that goodness within the next generation and bring it forward, bring their ethic forward.\nLet me talk a little bit about veterans because another one of our - my strategic goals is full employment for the veterans of ours who come home from Iraq and Afghanistan.\nWe do a very poor job of transitioning our veterans back to civilian life. And I have found, as a governor attacking this problem, that the key is employment. Talkingalking to our veterans about employment.\nThere is absolutely no hand-off between the Defense Department and Veterans Affairs, let alone our state departments of Veterans Affairs.\nAnd, in fact, on the DD-214, the discharge form that veterans fill out, there's not even a box on there for an email address. And a lot of our veterans become ghost people. We might catch up with them eventually at the hospital. We might catch up with them at a county jail.\nWe're a better nation than this and we need to have a transition program so that none of our veterans slip through the cracks and we need to make the first goal so that we can then get to the Post-Traumatic Stress issues, mental health and other things.\nThe first goal needs to be for employment, because every person needs to be needed. And we need our veterans back here every bit as much as we needed them abroad. [applause]\nCUOMO: We've got another question for you, Governor.\nDeborah Plummer is from Drake University, undecided, has a question about the economy for you.\nDEBORAH PLUMMER: Good evening, Governor.\nO'MALLEY: Hi.\nPLUMMER: Hi.\nMy question is, do you have any specific plans to grow the economy at a rate that will increase job growth for those - so that those who are long-term unemployed or have fallen out of the workforce will have an opportunity to get back in?\nO'MALLEY: Sure. Yes. The - let me talk a little bit about our economy.\nPrior to President Obama's good work - and he's done great work. He saved us from a second Great Depression, from the recklessness and the greed on Wall Street. Our nation's creating jobs again and we're the only species on the planet without full employment, so jobs are important, right?\nWithout jobs, nothing works very well.\nBut here's another thing that doesn't work very well in America, unless it's going in the right direction, and that is wages.\nFor the first time this side of World War II, 70 percent of us are earning the same or less than we did 12 years ago. So as I look at this, I believe that we need to first and foremost remember that our economy is not money. It is people. It is all of our people.\nAnd we need to restore common sense wage and labor policies that make wages rise again. Things we used to do, Democrats and Republicans together all the time, like keeping the minimum wage above the poverty line, paying overtime pay for overtime work.\nHow about this, the long deferred promise of equal pay for equal work for men and women? [applause]\nMaking it easier for people to join labor unions instead of harder. And then... [applause] ...And here's another one to make wages go up instead of being a drag on wages, let's get 11 million of our neighbors out of the underground shadow economy by passing comprehensive immigration reform... [applause] ...with a pathway to citizenship for all.\nCUOMO: Governor, but there's...\nO'MALLEY: Chris, and two other brief ones on this.\nI'm the first candidate in either party to put forward a new agenda for America's cities. America's cities are where we have some of the worst problems of structural unemployment and where we can do the most good with investments in mobility, mass transit, a new era of workforce housing, making our cities the leading edge to this clean green environment.\nAnd then the third piece I come back to again is squaring our shoulders to climate change and training people to actually be part of the retrofitting and the distributed energy future that is America's.\nCUOMO: Governor, talk to the audience about points of contrast between you and Senator Sanders when it comes to the economic plan.\nSo much is made of him being a self-described Democratic socialist.\nDo you see yourselves as that different from him when it comes to the economy?\nO'MALLEY: You know, the - look, my story is not the story of the - of a Democratic conversion. My story is the story of a Democratic upbringing. And my parents taught me that the stronger we make our country, the more our country can give back to ourselves and to our children.\nAnd so I believe in fair market American capitalism. And I also, as part of those 15 strategic goals, believe, as Woodrow Wilson believed, that freedom - economic freedom also means freedom from monopoly.\nI would agree... [applause] ...I would actually agree with Senator Sanders in this sense, Chris. We have reached the point where there's been such a concentration of corporate wealth and power in the hands of so few that it's taking opportunity out of the homes of the many. And whenever that happens, there's only two paths forward. And only one of them is good. And that is a sensible rebalancing based on the common good we share.\nWe need to push back on these concentrations of corporate power, Wall Street, big banks, but other places, as well.\nYou know, here in Iowa, a farmer told me that 12 years ago they used to have about a dozen packing houses. Now, they only have four or five. Hog farmers are more productive than ever, but they're getting a lower price than ever.\nOur economy is an ecosystem, you know? And the center of that ecosystem is a stronger middle class. In other words, the stronger we make our middle class, the more our economy grows. And, that's what we've lose track of in these 30 years of trickle down economics. The more our workers earn, the more they spend, the more our economy grows.\nI will say this though, Chris, I think that I do believe that the fundamentals of American capitalism are still strong. But we need to shake ourselves out of this trickle down nonsense. This is concentrate wealth, remove regulation, and keep wages low. Low wages for America is not an America that's working. We nee wage policies... [applause] ...that make wages go up again.\nCUOMO: The gentleman standing up on your right is Brian Carlson, he's a student at Drake University. He says he's leaning toward supporting Hillary Clinton. He says he wants to talk about discrimination in the workplace, and he has a question about it. What do you have?\nQUESTION: Last years Supreme Court decision granting full marriage equality was truly monumental for the LGBT community across the nation.\nBut we still face a hard battle ahead, especially in the areas of employment and housing. In many states we still face discrimination. I was wondering what would you do as president to help us to acquire full equality in those areas on the federal level? [applause]\nO'MALLEY: I believe that the genius of this American experiment of ours is that in every generation we take actions to include more people more fully in the economic, the social, and the political life our country. That's the broader arc of American history. We've yet to arrive at a perfect union, but every generation we have the opportunity to make it a more perfect union.\nIn my own state we were one of the very first to pass at the ballot marriage equality. I also passed the Transgender Anti-Discrimination bill in the state of Maryland as well. [applause]\nAnd, it's interesting, you know? The common ground we found to get these things done was this. It's really about our kids. It's about all our kids. And, there was some people in Maryland who said we might not be able to pass marriage equality, and we made the argument all about the truth, that there is dignity in every child's home, and every child's home needs to be protected equally under the law.\nOne of the most powerful beliefs we share is our belief in the dignity of every person. That's what's motivated me, and the common good that we share. And, I will do everything in my power to move us forward as a nation, and make us more inclusive in every possible way I can across the board because that's what makes us stronger as a country. [applause]\nThank you.\nCUOMO: Governor, you were talking about farming earlier, and the status of it here in Iowa. We have a question for you about that. This is Jana Linderman, she's President of the Iowa Farmers Union, she says she's leaning toward Clinton, but she's a fourth generation farmer and she has a question about the industry for you.\nQUESTION: First, I just want to say that I love that you mention the problem of market concentration in the egg sector. Thank you so much for bringing up that point...\nO'MALLEY: ... Yeah, not good for family farms, is it?\nQUESTION: Not, too great no. There's not nearly as many of us as there used to be.\nO'MALLEY: Right?\nQUESTION: My question is about beginning farmers. I'm a beginning farmer. The average age of farmers in the United States right now is about 57 years old, and that number goes up a little bit each year. For beginning farmers, a group that includes a growing number of veterans, women farmers like me and other groups. We do have some opportunities with innovative business models that include more diversified farms, or sustainable farming practice, but there aren't nearly enough of us. We know that a lot of farmers are going to be retiring in the next decade, and there aren't enough people to replace them, so my question is after decades of rural outmigration, and farm consolidation, what can we do? What would you do to provide opportunities and invest in a new generation of family farms for the country?\nO'MALLEY: Thank you. [applause]\nI think this is a big part of the future for rural America, sustainable economies. The ability to consume and to grow, and to do that within the footprint of this place that we call home. So, I would like to work with congress, and I plan to work with congress, to do more in the Farm Bill to reduce the barriers of entry to new farmers as they start up. Huge capital costs that go into buying the land and buying the equipment. But it's also what's best for keeping our rural economies, and it's best for America. So I've seen in my own state a whole movement to the \"buy local\" movement and the sort of farming that you describe. We need to do more as a nation to encourage young farmers to go into farming to reduce those barriers and those capital costs, even at the same time that we push back against the concentration monopoly power in the agricultural sector. And that's what I intend to do. [applause]\nQUESTION: Thank you.\nO'MALLEY: Thank you. [applause]\nCUOMO: All right. I have a question for you. [applause]\nWe know that you are working this whole state and you're going for the goal. You're in it to win it. I understand that. But you can make an argument that you are the most important person that we're going to have in this room tonight, whether or not you win or not. Here's why.\nAs you know, there is a 15 percent rule in a lot of these caucuses. So if you don't have 15 percent of the caucuses in that room, those men and women have to go to a different candidate. So if you don't have that and your followers now have to go to somewhere else, the people that support you, what is y our suggestion to them? [laughter]\nO'MALLEY: This sounds like a process question. Look, here's my suggestion to them.\nWhat I - I have put together a terrific organization, or we have put together a terrific organization all across this state, Chris. And one of the reasons why the polls back east can never figure out how the caucuses work is because it's a very organic thing.\nAnd so my message to the O'Malley supporters across this state is this. Hold strong at your caucus. [applause]\nHold strong at your caucus because America's looking for a new leader. America's scanning the horizon. We cannot be this fed up with our gridlocked, dysfunctional national politics and think that a resort to old ideologies or old names is going to move us forward. So I tell my people hold strong.\nI know this is a tough fight. But I've always been drawn to a tough fight. I believe the toughness of the fight is the way the hidden god has of telling us we're actually fighting for something worth saving.\nOur country's worth saving. The American dream is worth saving. This planet is worth saving. America needs new leadership. And I need the O'Malley supporters out there on caucus night to hold strong and move forward like Iowa does. [applause]\nCUOMO: All right. Let's bring in Benjamin Foladore (ph). He grew up in Iowa, is now a law student... [applause]\nHe says he's leaning toward supporting you on Monday. And he has an important question for you.\nQUESTION: Yes. So, Gov. O'Malley...\nCUOMO: This is going to give you a chance to wrap up your main pitch. This is Benjamin Foladore (ph). We'll give you 30 seconds, the same thing we gave to Sen. Sanders. But go ahead.\nQUESTION: So, yes. Right on cue with that, you're aware that national polls continue to show you trailing Sec. Clinton and Sen. Sanders.\nSo to those that are still you know undecided like me, or maybe just less informed about politics, on top of what you've already talked about, what's the last thing that you would try to tell them to convince them that you are in fact the best candidate for the Democratic Party?\nO'MALLEY: Thank you. This is what I would say. I would say that time and time again in the history of the state of Iowa, Iowa has found a way to sort through the noise and to sort through the national polls and to lift up a new leader for our country at times when that was critical and essential.\nThat's what you did eight years ago when you lifted up Barack Obama to lead our country forward. And we need to build upon his good work by continuing to move forward.\nAnd that I am the only - I am the only one of the three of us who has a track record not of being a divider, but of bringing people together to get meaningful things done: raising the living wage, making college more affordable, creating jobs, healing wounds and divisions. That's what our country needs right now.\nWe are a great people. We are a generous and we are a compassionate people. And we are far better than the sort of fascist rhetoric that you hear spewed out by Donald Trump. The enduring symbol of our country is not the barbed wire fence. It is the Statue of Liberty. And we... [applause]\nAnd so I'm not here to praise you, Iowa, I'm here to challenge you. Lift up a new leader, because you can change the course of this presidential race. You can shift this dynamic on caucus night. I know you can, I've seen you do it before.\nThere is nothing so divided about our national politics that it cannot be healed with the renewed faith in one another and new leadership. That's what I have to offer. My candidacy is in your hands. Do with it as you will.\nBut I think it's important in order to move our country forward that once again Iowa lift up a new leader so we that can make America the compassionate, generous, and inclusive place that we need it to be. Thanks. [applause]\nCUOMO: Thank you, Governor.\nO'MALLEY: Thank you.\nCUOMO: Our thanks to Governor O'Malley.\nHillary Clinton is in the wings. She's ready to face these Iowa voters, next.\n[commercial break] [applause]\nCUOMO: Welcome back to the CNN Democratic presidential town hall here at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa.\nAs you've seen, tonight is something different. It is a chance for the voters of Iowa to question the candidates directly.\nNext up, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. [applause]\nCLINTON: How are you?\nCUOMO: Good to see you.\nCLINTON: Great to see you!\nHi everybody.\nCUOMO: Interesting weekend for you. Boston Globe endorsement. Demoin Register endorsement. Maybe the best accolade, President Obama gave an interview; talked about this race. Seemed to get more into it than he has in the past. He said your, quote \"Wicked smart. Knows every policy inside and out.\" Sounds like an endorsement.\nCLINTON: [laughing] Well, I was really touched and gratified when I saw that. You know, people here in Iowa remember we ran a really hard race against each other, and then I had the opportunity when he asked me to serve as a Secretary of State.\nAnd, it not only was a great working relationship, but it turned into a real friendship, and he knows how hard the jobs is. He knows it first hand. So, I really appreciated what he said, and how he said it because it was a positive reflection on what we have to get done, and how hard it's going to be, and therefore the stakes in the election are really high. And, I think that's what voters are beginning to really tune in to starting here in Iowa.\nCUOMO: He says also in there you get undue criticism, and he says, and by the way, I have some regrets about my campaign and some of the things we did. Was that surprising.\nCLINTON: Yes, that was surprising. [laughter]\nYou know, I really appreciated him saying that because he said that - he had that great line which I love. I think he said something like, you know, she had to do - he said I was like Fred Astaire and she had to do everything I had to do, only she was Ginger Rogers doing it backwards in high heels. And, I thought that was a really... [applause]... A very cute remark.\nBut, you know, I understand that you get into the arena, and you are going to get pummeled, and pushed, and criticized. I wouldn't be doing it if I didn't think it was absolutely necessary to try to build on the progress that we've made. That we've made under President Obama against great odds, and that we've got to do everything we possibly can not to let the Republicans rip away the progress and turn us backwards.\nThat would be such a loss for our country. We need to build on it, and go further, and that's what I'm trying to do with my campaign in talking about all the issues that I think are on the minds of all the people I talk to across the state.\nCUOMO: And you get to do that tonight. We're going to get a question right from the voters. 2008 we're talking about, here you are again, another election. Praise and promise coming your way, but another nail biter...\nCLINTON: ... Right...\nCUOMO: ... With a self-described socialist named Bernie.\nCLINTON: Right.\nCUOMO: How did that happen.\nCLINTON: [laughter] Look, it's a great country, despite what one of the Republicans says. It's a great country, and we are all on the Democratic side having a spirited debate about the issues we care about. I'm so proud you've seen my two Democratic opponents, and the three of us have run a campaign talking about the differences we have on issues. That's totally fair, that's what we want you to know.\nThe other side is not talking issues, they're talking insults. So, I'm proud of the campaign we've run, and what we've put out there before the American people.\nAnd, it's a tough campaign, and it should be because it's the hardest job in the world. You have to pick a president, and a commander in chief, and you want to really vet the people that are running, and I'm really having a good time going around talking, and listening to folks. And, on Monday the people in Iowa get to be the first people in the world, Chris, to express an opinion about who should be president, and commander in chief, and what they want to see as our nominee to go up against the Republicans.\nCUOMO: So, let's do that right now. Let's help them.\nCLINTON: OK.\nCUOMO: We have Taylor Gipple, Iowa native. First time caucus goer, leaning Sanders, but has a question for Secretary Clinton\nCLINTON: [laughing] Let me help you up here.\nQUESTION: It feels like there is a lot of young people like myself who are very passionate supporters of Bernie Sanders. And, I just don't see the same enthusiasm from younger people for you. In fact, I've heard from quite a few people my age that they think you're dishonest, but I'd like to hear from you on why you feel the enthusiasm isn't there.\nCLINTON: Well, I think it really depends upon who you're seeing and talking to. You know today in Oskaloosa I spent time with about 10 high school students who are enthusiastically working for me. I see young people across the state who are doing the same. But I'm totally happy to see young people involved in any way. That's what we want.\nAnd we want to have a good primary to pick a nominee. And then we want to have everybody join together to make sure we win in November, which after all is the purpose... [applause]... of this whole campaign. And so... [applause]\nYou know look, I've been around a long time. People have thrown all kinds of things at me. And you know I can't keep up with it. I just keep going forward.\nThey fall by the wayside. They come up with these outlandish things. They make these charges. I just keep going forward because there's nothing to it. They throw all this stuff at me and I'm still standing.\nBut if you're new to politics, if it's the first time you really paid attention, you go oh my gosh, look at all of this. And you have to say to yourself, why are they throwing all of that?\nWell, I'll tell you why. Because I've been on the front lines of change and progress since I was your age. I have been fighting to give kids and women... [applause] ...and the people who are left out and left behind a chance to make the most out of their own lives. And I've taken on the status quo time and time again.\nI have had many, many millions of dollars spent against me. When I worked on health care back in 1993 and 1994, and I don't know if you were born then. I can't quite tell. [laughter]\nBut if you'd been around and had been able to pay attention, I was trying to get us to universal health care coverage, working with my husband.\nBoy, the insurance companies, the drug companies, they spent millions. Not just against the issue, but against me. And I kept going.\nAnd when we weren't successful, I turned around and said at least we're going to get health care for kids. And we got the Children's Health Insurance Program working with both Democrats and Republicans. And eight million kids have insurance because of that today. [applause]\nSo you got to keep going. You can't give up. You can never get knocked off course.\nThat's my hope for you and for all the young people who are getting involved this first time. Don't get discouraged. It's hard. If it were easy, hey, there wouldn't be any contest. But it's not easy.\nThere are very different visions, different values, different forces at work. And you have to have somebody who is a proven, proven fighter. Somebody who has taken them on and won and kept going, and will do that as president. That's why I hope you'll reconsider. [laughter and applause]\nCUOMO: We have another voter for you to work on, Elena Deets, and Iowa native, first-time caucus goer. She says she's also leaning toward Bernie, but she's giving you a chance with a question.\nCLINTON: Great.\nQUESTION: Sec. Clinton, earlier this month Vice President Joe Biden said you were a newcomer to the issue of income inequality, while praising Sen. Sanders for his authentic voice on the issue. How do we know that you will keep this issue a top priority?\nCLINTON: Well, I have the greatest respect for the vice president. But I think it's fair to say that I have a 40-year record of going after inequality. And not only economic inequality: racial inequality, sexist inequality, homophobic inequality. The kinds of things that go after people to put them down and push them back.\nSo since I was a young lawyer my first job in the Children's Defense Fund, I took on the problem of juveniles in adult jails. What kind of inequality can you imagine that's worse than that, taking a child and putting them in with adult prisoners? And we went right after that to change that.\nI went after schools that were being turned into private schools that were really there because they wanted to escape integration in the south. I went by myself down to Alabama to do investigations because again, inequality stalks our education system.\nI was on the Legal Services Corporation. I chaired the board. Inequality's also about not being able to get a lawyer. You can't afford them. You can't stand up and have your voice heard and have your case adjudicated.\nSo I have a really long history of taking on all kinds of inequality. And when I went to Beijing in 1995 and said human rights were women's rights and women's rights were human rights that was a statement about inequality: economic inequality, education inequality, cultural inequality... [applause] ...every kind of inequality you can imagine. [applause]\nNow, when you focus just narrowly on economic inequality, I've also been in that fight. I was in that fight during my husband's administration. And let's remember what happened there.\nAt the end of eight years, we not only had 23 million new jobs, what was most important is incomes grew for everybody, not just those at the top, more people were lifted out of poverty, incomes rose, in the middle and working people.\nAnd today in Knoxville, in my town hall, I called on a man. He said, we never had it so good except when your husband was president. Because we tackled income equality and produced results, not talk, action. And that's what I will do as president. [applause]\nCUOMO: Another question for you. Secretary, Dick Goodson. He's the chairman of the Des Moines Committee on Foreign Relations. He's likely going to caucus for you next week, unless you mess it up right now...\nCLINTON: OK. I'll try not to. [laughter]\nHi.\nCUOMO: Your question, sir.\nDICK GOODSON: Madam Secretary, before I ask my question, I have a quick comment, and that is that I was a lukewarm person for you before the Benghazi hearings, I watched all 11 hours, every second of it, and came away from that a gung ho supporter of yours. [applause]\nCLINTON: Thank you. Thank you. [applause]\nGOODSON: I woke up one night thinking that maybe I could see, if Donald Trump was sitting here, maybe he'd punch Gowdy out. [laughter]\nOK. Here's the question, practically all of the comments that have been said for both - all three candidates tonight, about 99 percent, have been on some form of domestic policy.\nAnd yet, you know, as the former wife of a president and as the secretary of state, that the president of the United States is going to just spend more than 50 percent of his or her time on foreign policy issues.\nSo therefore, I think it's important for the public to kind of get a sense of where you may be coming from across the board philosophically. And the way I look at it is you could have a scale of say, one to 100, and on that scale, you would have none interventionist on one side at one, and total interventionist on the other side as 10.\nAs you think about all the issues that you've confronted as secretary of state, and then as the possibility of looking at issues into the future, where do you think you'll land on that scale of one to 10?\nCLINTON: I'll tell you what. I want to start by saying thank you for asking about foreign policy because you're absolutely right. In fact, President Obama in his interview said something about that. He said, you know, you don't get to the pick the issues you work on when you're president, a lot of them come at you.\nThey come in the door whether you open it or not, and even gave the example of working on a State of the Union, being at the desk in the Oval Office when one of his aids came in and said, the Iranians have just captured two of our naval vessels and have taken our sailors prisoner.\nYou can't say, oh, OK, don't bother me now, I'll deal with that later. You have got to immediately be able to switch gears. You've got to do all aspects of the job.\nSo let me tell you how I think about it. I think it's imperative you do your very best, every president, and certainly, I will, to avoid military action. It should be the last resort, not the first choice, to use diplomacy, even if it's slow, boring, hard to continue to persist and be patient to get results.\nAnd that you also should use the enormous capabilities that we have to project our values around the world, our cultural values, our freedoms, our human rights, and respect for the dignity of all people.\nI want to give you two quick examples. When I became secretary of state, what President Obama and I found was that the Iranians were on their way to a nuclear weapons program. This despite all of the bluster from the George W. Bush-Dick Cheney administration.\nThey had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle. They had built covert facilities. And they had stocked them with centrifuges that were rapidly whirling along trying to create enough highly enriched uranium to have a weapon.\nNow our choices were, oh, my gosh, just fulminate about it, or turn our backs and just figure out that somebody else is going to do something, or try to get up a new strategy. We chose the third.\nWe said, look, we've got to get the world behind us to force them to the negotiating table. So I spent 18 months putting together the coalition that imposed international sanctions on the Iranians that forced them, finally, to begin negotiating with us to get an end to their nuclear weapons program, to put a lid on it.\nIt took 18 months to get the sanctions. It took me about another year to travel around the world convincing other countries to actually obey the sanctions. And then I began the negotiations, testing whether the Iranians would actually come and seriously negotiate.\nAnd then Secretary Kerry and the president did a great job bringing the agreement into fruition.\nYou cannot - you cannot imagine how tense it was because a lot of our friends and partners in the region basically just wanted to end that program by bombing them. Just bomb them. Send them back a couple of years. Just stop it.\nI spent a lot of my time explaining to our friends why that was not a good idea.\nAnd we got the negotiation successfully done. We did put the lid on.\nSo that's how I thought about it.\nAnother quick example.\nWe had another unfortunate spate of rockets going from Gaza into Israel in 2012. I'm on the phone with the Israelis. They're trying to knock them out of the sky with their missile defense system. But they're still landing and everybody is really worried that, you know, one of them is going to hit a big group of people, take out a big building somewhere.\nSo the Israelis are telling me, look, we've got to go back in. We have to have a ground invasion again in Gaza.\nI'm saying, no, please, don't do that. Let's try to figure out how do we resolve it?\nWe don't think we can resolve it.\nI flew from Cambodia, where I was with the president, to Israel, middle of the night, go see the Israeli cabinet, work with them on what they would accept as an offer, go see the Palestinian president, work with him to make sure he'd back it up, go back to Jerusalem, finalize the deal, fly to Cairo, meet with President Morsy, the Muslim Brotherhood president of Egypt, hammer out the agreement, announce it at about an hour before the deadline that we were facing.\nThey got a cease-fire. There was no invasion. That's what you have to do.\nSo every situation is different. So I want to make sure I stay as close as possible to the non-intervention. That's why I say no American ground troops in Syria or Iraq. Special Forces, trainers, yes. Planes to bomb, yes. No ground forces.\nEvery part of this has to be done in accordance with our values, our interests and our security and partnership with other countries.\nCUOMO: All right, two points of... [applause] ...Secretary, two points of push back. [applause] One general, one specific.\nCLINTON: Um-hmm.\nCUOMO: Your critics will say they see the Obama administration, of which you were, of course, a part as secretary of State...\nCLINTON: Um-hmm.\nCUOMO: - as a period where now things are less stable around the world, certainly in the war on terror.\nSpecifically, Senator Sanders, earlier tonight, said, yes, a lot of experience, but it doesn't always translate into the best judgment. And he cited your vote on the war in Iraq.\nHow do you respond to those two criticisms?\nCLINTON: Well, first of all, I have a much longer history than one vote, which I've said was a mistake because of the way that that was done and how the Bush administration handled it.\nBut I think the American public has seen me exercising judgment in a lot of other ways. And, in fact, when that hard primary campaign was over and I went to work for President Obama and he ended up asking me to be secretary of State, it was because he trusted my judgment.\nAnd we worked side by side over those four years.\nAnd think about where we were when he became president. As I just said, Iran on the way to a nuclear weapon, which would have destabilized the entire Middle East, created an arms race the likes of which we have never seen.\nWe had hundreds of thousands of American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Our best allies and friends in Europe and Asia were really put out with us because of the way they'd been treated by the Bush administration and were very skeptical that the United States was a good ally any longer and wanted to lead the world toward peace, prosperity and security.\nI spent so much of my time getting back the confidence and the trust of our friends and allies around the world.\nSo I think we made a lot of progress.\nNow, do we have a terrorist threat?\nYes. We had a terrorist threat on 9/11, before President Obama took office. Yes, we were attacked. So this is not something new. This is a long-term challenge. That's why I've laid out a plan to defeat ISIS and the radical jihadist terrorist networks that I think has the best chance of achieving that.\nThere is no time in human history where everything is going well. And we now live in a very interconnected world where we know everything that is going on and where people look to the United States to help.\nSo we have to be leading. And that means we've got to be smart about how we try to assert our power so that it is constructive, makes a difference and does lead to greater peace and prosperity.\nBut I am very proud of my record as secretary of State and what we accomplished, not only on specific trouble spots, but advancing women's rights, advancing gay rights, advancing religious freedom, Internet freedom and so many of the other values that we hold dear. [applause]\nCUOMO: We have another question for you about the example that the United States provides.\nOn our left, Erin Tariq-Monir (ph), she's an American Muslim from outside Des Moines. She served in the U.S. Air Force. She says she's undecided. And she has a question.\nCLINTON: Hi.\nQUESTION: Hi, Sec. Clinton. America today is formed by a very diverse group of people, and over the current horizon, Islamophobia and the #BlackLivesMatter movement.\nHow can we make sure that the United States today is - that we protect the constitutional rights of all groups of people without marginalizing any one community? Specifically as a mother of three young children, as an American Muslim, how can I make sure that this country is the best place on earth to raise my family?\nCLINTON: Thank you. [applause]\nAnd thank you for your service in the military.\nQUESTION: It's my pleasure.\nCLINTON: And one of the... [applause]\nOne of the most distressing aspects of this campaign has been the language of Republican candidates, particularly their frontrunner, that insults, demeans, denigrates different people. He has cast a wide net. He started with Mexicans. He's currently on Muslims. But I found it particularly harmful the way he has talked about Muslims, American Muslims and Muslims around the world. And I have called him out continuously about that.\nIt's not only shameful and contrary to our values to say that people of a certain religion should never come to this country, or to claim that there are no real people of the Muslim faith who share our values, and to have the kind of dismissive and insulting approach. It's not only shameful and offensive, which it is. I think it's dangerous. And it's dangerous in several ways.\nIt's dangerous because American Muslims deserve better. And now their children and they are the target of Islamophobia, of threats. I've met a number of parents who said their children are afraid to go to school because they are worried about how they will be treated.\nAnd we cannot tolerate this. And we must stand up and say every person in this country deserves to be treated with respect. And we must stand up against the... [applause] ...bullying... [applause]\nBut there's another element to this that I want to mention. I was recently in Minneapolis where I met with a big group of Somali-Americans. And I sat down and talked with them, and they shared some of the very same concerns you just did.\nBut they are also on the front lines of trying to protect their children from radicalization. They are in the front lines in Minneapolis of working with law enforcement to make sure that what they see and hear they report in case there are any problems.\nWe have to protect ourselves in America in a unified way. That means making sure our Muslim friends and neighbors are part of us. They are with us. They are on the front lines of defending themselves, their families, their children and all the rest of us.\nAnd the same is true with Muslims around the world. We need a coalition that includes Muslim nations to defeat ISIS. And it's pretty hard to figure out how you're going to make a coalition with the very nations you need if you spend your time insulting their religion.\nSo we need to stand up... [applause] ...and point out how wrong this is. [applause]\nCUOMO: All right. We have another question for you, secretary.\nMaria Diaz. Drake Law School student who says she's deciding between you and Sen. Sanders.\nMaria Diaz, you have a question.\nCLINTON: Hi.\nQUESTION: Good evening, secretary. Sec. Clinton, when you're elected the next president of the United States, what will you say to Republican voters?\nCLINTON: That I want to be the president for everyone. And I believe that is exactly what any president should do.\nYou know, Chris Cuomo's father said one of the smartest things. He said many, many smart things about politics. But you might remember he said \"you campaign in poetry, you govern in prose.\"\nYou know, you can say all the kinds of things you want in a campaign. And we are drawing distinctions with the Republicans, and we should because I have very deep disagreements, as I just pointed out, with a lot of what they're saying and doing.\nBut, once the election is over we must come together to work to solve the problems facing our country. That is what I did. I did it as a First Lady when I worked, as I said, to get the children's health insurance program. I did it to reform the foster care and adoption system with one of the most partisan Republicans in the house, Tom DeLay. I did it when I was in the Senate.\nAnd, nearly every Republican I served with co-sponsored legislation that I introduced, and we worked to pass. And, I did it as Secretary of State. Reaching out, talking with Republicans all the time about what we were doing, enlisting their support, getting their advice.\nSo, I know in order to deal with the problems I want to, to get the economy working, creating more good jobs, getting in comes rising, making sure we build on the affordable care act. Get costs down, but improve it, get to 100% coverage. Everything I want to do, I want to start from the belief that we can find common ground, and that is exactly what I intend to do.\nAnd, I see my friend Tom Harkin sitting there, and he knows from his years in the Congress, you always have to hope you can find common ground. You got to bring people together like he did. The Americans With Disabilities Act, what an amazing accomplishment. [applause]\nCUOMO: I have a question for you, as a point of push back. You were talking earlier about how it's difficult to form a coalition with people who are being insulted at the same time. Let's apply that to the Democrats and the Republicans.\nCLINTON: Right.\nCUOMO: You say you want to work with them, but you were quoted not too long ago, you were listing (ph) people that you saw as adversaries, NRA, health insurance companies, probably the Republicans.\nCLINTON: Yes.\nCUOMO: They did not like that when you said that...\nCLINTON: ... Well...\nCUOMO: ... It makes them feel that, well, Secretary Clinton doesn't like us. Why would she work with us? Understandable.\nCLINTON: Yeah, well, Chris, it was kind of tongue-in-cheek, and I consider them more the adversaries because they are. They have their set of objectives, we have ours in the Democratic side. But, that's why I gave you a short overview. I work with all of them.\nYou know, when I'm actually in office, they say really nice things about me. [laughter]\nWe have a whole long list of the nice things they say, what a good colleague I am, how easy I am to work with, how willing I am to try to find common ground. And, then when I run, Oh my goodness it's just unbelievable. [laughter]\nSo, I have no - I have no problem in saying, yeah, we have political differences. We're on opposite sides. But, we're going to work as hard as we can, and here's what I know about how to get that done.\nIt takes building relationships, and that is one of the hardest things to do in politics over ideological and partisan lines. So, I'm going to be just giving them all bear hugs whether they like it or not. We're going to get together, we're going to talk about what we can do. Maybe we can get something done together, if not, maybe I can find that slice of common ground to find somebody who will work with me on achieving a goal that we want.\nSo, that's the way the process should work, constantly looking for ways to make a difference and putting together the coalitions within the congress to pass laws.\nCUOMO: So, what is it inside you that can separate the human feeling of doing the Benghazi hearings, and then going back to that same group of people and saying, \"OK, you know what? Let's put that in the past.\"\nIt sounds a little hard to do.\nCLINTON: Well, I don't know, I came out pretty well so I think it'd be very... [laughter] ...It would be very gracious of me to go back and talk to them. [applause]\nCUOMO: Alright, let's get you another question. Zach Pieper, grew up in west Des Moines. He says he's undecided. What's your question for the Secretary.\nCLINTON: Hi.\nQUESTION: Secretary Clinton, kind of on the same issue as the Bear Hugs. I think one thing that they might have a hard time bare hugging with the other side, and certainly a concern that a lot of Democratic voters have at this point, as far as going to the general election, and looking forward to working with Congress is the Benghazi issue. So, how are you planning on dealing with that going forward, not only in the general election, but also if you became President working with Congress.\nCLINTON: Well, look. This is only still an issue because the Republicans want to keep it an issue. [applause]\nThey know it, I know it. And, I think it's very easy to answer, and as the gentleman who stood up before said, if you watched any of it, I answered every question. And, at the end of it, the Chairman said, \"No, we didn't learn anything new.\"\nNo, well, because there was nothing new to learn. Why? Because there had already been eight investigations. Most of them by Republicans in the Congress. The House Intelligence Committee, the House Armed Services Committee, and what did they conclude? That there were problems that night, but they were ones that we should look at not from the perspective of placing blame or pointing fingers. But how do we make sure that never happens again?\nThat is what I said immediately after it happened. That's why I put together an independent board to tell me as secretary of State what I needed to know and what we could do to fix it. And I accepted all 29 of their recommendations. And we were on the way to implementing them when I left, and that has continued.\nSo I am well aware that for partisan political purposes this continues. But let me tell you why this makes me not - it makes me sad. It makes me sad because we've had terrorist attacks many times before in our country, haven't we? And we've had American, both civilians and military personnel the subject of attacks.\nWhen Ronald Reagan was president in 1983, our Marine barracks, our embassy were attacked in Beirut. More than 250 Americans were killed. The Democrats didn't make that a partisan issue. We were horrified. We were heartsick that Americans doing the work they were sent to do, civilians and military, were murdered by terrorists.\nSo, the Democratic Congress worked with the Republican president to say what can we do? How do we fix this?\nFast forward. My husband was president. Al-Qaeda attacked two of our embassies in Tanzania and Kenya. Car bombs blew them up, killed 12 Americans and hundreds of Kenyans and Tanzanians.\nMadeline Albright was secretary. She said we got to get to the bottom of this. She did the same as I did, commission an independent report. When the report came out she made it public. I made the report I commissioned public. That's the only two times those reports have ever been made public.\nSo again, it was terrible. What can we do? How can we fix it? It wasn't the subject of this kind of partisan, media-driven attack. People wanted to come together.\nAnd even after 9/11 when nearly 3,000 Americans and others who were working in New York City, the Pentagon, on that plane that crashed in Pennsylvania, were killed, we formed a commission. We said what went wrong? What can we learn? And then we moved on to try and do better.\nSo look, I understand that they will try to make this an issue. I will continue to answer. And my best defense is the truth. And that's what you will hear from now until I am elected president. [applause]\nCUOMO: On that issue, the Des Moines Register, as we said earlier, gave you an endorsement. [applause]\nDid it question your judgment, though, when it came to the email issue? They said, and you know this, but for the audience, in 2008 \"when she says\" - \"when she makes a mistake she should just say so.\" This weekend they said that's a lesson that you have not learned. Yes, you apologized, but only when you needed to, not when you first could have. Fair criticism?\nCLINTON: Well, I think that they're - you know, look, I was delighted to get the Register's endorsement. And it was a very generous one. And yes, I think that's a fair criticism.\nYou know I had no intention of doing anything other than having a convenient way of communicating, and it turned out not to be so convenient. So again, we've answered every question and we will continue to do so.\nBut you know maybe being faster, trying to scramble around to find out what all of this means, I probably should have done that quicker.\nCUOMO: You're willing to say it was an error in judgment, you should've apologized...\nCLINTON: No. I'm not willing to say it was an error in judgment because what - nothing that I did was wrong. It was not - it was not in any way prohibited. And so...\nCUOMO: Not apologizing sooner I mean.\nCLINTON: Well, apologizing sooner, as soon as you can. But part of the problem, and I would just say this as, not an excuse but just as an explanation.\nWhen you're facing something like that you got to get the facts. And it takes time to get the facts. And so when I said hey, take all my emails, make them public. That had never been done before, ever by anybody. And so we've been sorting our way through this because it is kind of a unique situation.\nI'm happy people are looking at the emails. Some of them are you know, frankly a little embarrassing... [laughter]\nYou know. You find out that sometimes I'm not the best on technology and things like that. But look, I think it's great. Let people sort them through. And as we have seen there is a lot of - you know a lot of interest. But it's something that took time to get done.\nCUOMO: Earlier tonight we played Sen. Sanders your ad and asked him a question about it, one of the ads that you're putting out here in the last run up to caucuses...\nCLINTON: OK.\nCUOMO: We'll now do the same for you.\nCLINTON: OK.\nCUOMO: Here's the senator's ad.\n[begin video clip]\n[music playing, \"America\" by Simon & Garfunkel]\nSANDERS: I'm Bernie Sanders, and I approve this message.\n[end video clip]\nCLINTON: I think that's great. I think that's fabulous. I loved it. [applause]\nYou know, look, you campaign in poetry, you govern in prose. And we need a lot more poetry in this campaign and in our country. So, I applaud that. I love the feeling. I love the energy.\nI obviously respect Senator Sanders greatly and appreciate what he has done in this campaign.\nBut I believe that I'm the better person to be the Democratic nominee, and to be the president and commander-in-chief of the country because... [applause]\nCUOMO: Got another question for you. Brett Rosengren. He's from Logan, Iowa. He's going to school, works as a supervisor for a janitorial company, says he's undecided, has a question.\nCLINTON: Great.\nBRETT ROSENGREN: Secretary Sanders - or, Clinton, sorry. [laughter]\nCLINTON: It's OK.\nROSENGREN: I can see why they gave you this question. I just wanted to know which of our previous presidents has inspired you most and why.\nCUOMO: You can only pick one. One you can pick. [laughter]\nSorry, let me jump your question, one president, one.\nCLINTON: OK.\nCUOMO: Just one. [laughter]\nCLINTON: OK. Sorry, President Obama, sorry, Bill, Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln.\nYou know, I - wow, when I think about his challenges, they paled in comparison to anything we have faced or can imagine. You know, more Americans died in the Civil War than, you know, the wars of the 20th Century put together.\nSo here was a man who was a real politician. I mean, he was a great statesman, but he also understood politics. And he had to work to put together, you know, the support he needed to be able to hold the country together during the war.\nAnd while he was prosecuting that war to keep the Union together, he was building America, which I found just an astonishing part of his legacy. The transcontinental rail system, land grant colleges, he was thinking about the future while in the middle of trying to decide which general he can trust to try to finish the war.\nThat's what I mean, when you've got to do a lot of things at once, what could be more overwhelming than trying to wage and win a civil war?\nAnd yet, he kept his eye on the future and he also tried to keep summoning up the better angels of our nature. You know, he was willing to reconcile and forgive. And I don't know what our country might have been like had he not been murdered, but I bet that it might have been a little less rancorous, a little more forgiving and tolerant, that might possibly have brought people back together more quickly.\nBut instead, you know, we had Reconstruction, we had the re-instigation of segregation and Jim Crow. We had people in the South feeling totally discouraged and defiant. So, I really do believe he could have very well put us on a different path.\nAnd, as I say, our challenges are nothing like what he faced, but let's think ourselves about not only what we have to do right now, especially to get the income rising in America, especially to make college affordable, do something about student debt, keep health care growing until we get 100 percent coverage and so much else.\nBut let's also think about how we do try to summon up those better angels, and to treat each other, even when we disagree, fundamentally disagree, treat each other with more respect, and agree to disagree more civilly, and try to be inspired by, I think, the greatest of our presidents. [applause]\nCUOMO: Secretary Clinton...\nCLINTON: Thank you.\nCUOMO: ... thank you very much for taking the opportunity.\nCLINTON: Thanks, Chris. Great to see you.\nCUOMO: Appreciate it, the pleasure is mine.\nCLINTON: You doing OK?\nCUOMO: Everything is great. Thank you.\nCLINTON: Good.\nCUOMO: We want to want thank Secretary Clinton, Governor O'Malley, and Senator Sanders, and everyone who made this town hall possible.

{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111414", "text": "CLINTON: Oh, thank you all so much. Thank you. Oh, you are great. Thank you.\nOh, my goodness. I'll tell you, it was worth it, trying to get here. You have been so generous with your time. And I'm just so grateful to be back in Marshalltown and to have this chance to talk with you, now less than a week until the caucus on Monday night. But it's just really meaningful to me that you would be here and be part of this process, and I really am grateful to each and every one of you.\nI've learned a lot in the last months, and I really think that spending all this time in small groups and big ones is going to make me a better president. So I thank you for everything you've done to make that possible. [applause]\nAnd I really want to thank Mark Smith for his endorsement. I'm thrilled. Thank you so very much, Representative. And I have a—I have a plan that I hope will come to pass when it—that affects Mark. And that is I hope that we will be able to make him the majority leader of the House of Representatives in the state legislature. [applause]\nThink of all the good things that he could do for you and for people across Iowa.\nWell, it's getting close. And when all of you decide to go caucus on Monday, you're going to be the first people in the world to get to express an opinion about who should be the next president and commander in chief for our country.\nAnd I know how seriously Iowans take this because I've been talking with you and listening to you. But I want to just spend a few minutes really discussing what's at stake, because this is one of the most consequential elections that we've had in quite some time.\nWhen you think about it, there are some very big differences between us and the Republicans, and that puts a special responsibility on you and voters to try to decide where you stand. Well, I will tell you where I stand.\nI believe that the Republican policies that are being promoted by this crop of candidates that are traveling across our state and country would set our country back, rip up the progress we've made, and undermine our future. And that is true across the board, but let me just pick a few of the most important issues. Let's take the economy.\nYou heard from them, they are spouting the same failed economic policies: trickle-down economics; cut taxes on the wealthy; get out of the way of corporations. We have tried that, it does not work. And it's important to know the facts. And the facts are that our economy does better when we have a Democrat in the White House who cares about creating jobs and raising incomes for Americans. [applause]\nAnd the last two Democratic presidents we've had, both of whom I know, which I kind of am proud of, they each inherited economic problems from their Republican predecessors.\nYou know, in my husband's case, it was a recession, a huge national debt that had been quadrupled in the prior 12 years and a big deficit. So when he got to Washington, people said, \"OK. So, what do you especially bring to Washington that can make a difference?\" He said, \"Well, I guess I bring arithmetic. We're going to make it add up again for the American people.\" And at the end of eight years, we did.\nTwenty-three million new jobs, but most importantly, incomes went up for everybody. Not just those at the top, hard-working middle-class families, working families, poor families. More people were lifted out of poverty than in any recent time in our history. And we ended up with a balanced budget and a surplus. We were on the right track.\nWell, back came the Republicans and back came trickle-down economics. George W. Bush slashed taxes on the wealthy and got out of the way of corporations to the extent that the man he put in charge of keeping an eye on Wall Street took a chainsaw to a big stack of regulations and had a great big smile on his face.\nNow we know what happened, don't we? We went into the greatest financial crisis since the Great Depression, and when Barack Obama became president, we were losing 800,000 jobs a month. I don't think President Obama gets the credit he deserves for digging us out of that big ditch that the Republicans put us in during their administration. [applause]\nAnd it was not easy. I know; I talked to him about it. When he asked me to be secretary of State, he said, \"We got to focus on the economy here at home and we got to fix all the problems that we also inherited around the world.\"\nAnd what did he do? Well, we're back on track with 14 million new jobs. The Affordable Care Act was passed. We're now at 90 percent health care coverage in America for the first time. [applause]\nHe passed and signed the toughest regulations on Wall Street since the 1930s, the Dodd-Frank law; saved the auto industry, which was on the brink of collapse which would have taken another, you know, couple of million jobs down with them. We ended up losing 9 million because of that Great Recession, 5 million homes were lost and $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.\nNow, if you want to go back there, you got a lot of folks, including one who was here today, who are spouting that same stuff, because that's where we'll end up again. In fact, you are four times more likely to see a recession in America when you have a Republican in the White House.\nSo the economy is going to be at the core of this election. So you should ask everybody who's running what they're going to do about it. And I got to tell you, I'm proud of what we've been doing on the Democratic side. We have our differences, but we have differences over issues, and that's what we talk about, not insults, which is what happens among the Republicans.\nSo I've put out a plan. Here is what I think we need to do. We need more infrastructure jobs. Our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports, our rail systems, our sewer systems, our water systems. We have work to do in our country, and those are jobs that can't be exported, they need to be done right here and put Americans back to work building our economy, making us more competitive.\nAnd then we're going to take the tax system and get rid of the incentives that actually encourage people to take jobs and move them overseas, take factories and build them overseas. We're going to reverse that so we start investing in America again, advance manufacturing. I know it can be done because I've been to some of your community colleges. I have seen the work that is happening there, the training that is going on.\nI also know it can be done because while we are going to combat climate change, we're going to create more clean, renewable energy jobs. And that will be a huge economic opportunity—[applause]—that is directly linked to what Iowa has been doing.\nYou know, the Republicans, when you ask them about climate change, they all say the same thing. \"Well, I don't know, I'm not a scientist.\" You know, there's an easy way to remedy that. Go talk to a scientist, listen to a scientist, learn about what's going on. And, you know, that's bad enough that they're into denial. What really is troubling is they're missing this huge economic opportunity.\nAnd when I tell people that, I see, you know, sometimes folks around the country have a little bit of skepticism on their faces, and here's what I tell them. I know we can create those jobs because look at what Iowa has done.\nAnd I want you to thank Representative Smith. Thank you. And it started with Tom Vilsack and the Democrats making a commitment. Iowa now gets one-third of your electricity from renewable sources, mostly wind.\nYou have 7,000 people already working in the wind industry in this state. You are doing research on advanced biofuels that the Defense Department thinks may be able to fuel Navy vessels and Air Force planes. So Iowa is in the forefront of the energy revolution because some country is going to be the 21st century clean energy superpower. It's either going to be China, Germany, or us. I want it to be us, and we need to make up our minds that it is going to be us and we're going to be doing the technology, the innovation and exporting to the rest of the world. [applause]\nWe also need to be focusing on small business because that's where most of the jobs come from in America. And I want to be the small business president. My dad was a small businessman, so I want to clear away all the underbrush so people can start businesses again. And especially young people. S lot of young people tell me they'd love to go into business, but they can't get credit. Part of it is they have such student debts they can't get credit; we've got to fix that. So we need to make it easier to start and grow a small business.\nNow, there are two ways we can raise incomes real quick. One, we've got to raise the minimum wage. People who work full time should not still be in poverty. [applause]\nThere should be a ladder of opportunity. And the other way is to guarantee equal pay for women's work, and that will raise incomes and families will be better off, the economy will be. [applause]\nNow, everything I've just said to you the Republicans don't agree with it, every bit of it. They don't believe in any of it. They don't really tell you what they will do except just, you know, get out of the way and let corporations do whatever they want and let their, you know, big donors do whatever they want. Well, that's not going to work. We know it won't, and we can't be sold that bill of goods again.\nThe other thing we have to do is to change the tax system so that it is fairer. And I'm am the only candidate running on either side who has made this pledge. I will raise your incomes, I will not raise middle-class taxes. I do not think it is right—[applause]—to be going to people who suffered because of the Republican recession and asking for you to help us make the investments for the future. I want you to take advantage of them, but I want to go where the money is, and the money is at the top, and that's where we need to be shifting our tax system. So we need to close the loopholes and the special gimmicks that corporations and the wealthy use, like this thing called the \"carried interest loophole\" that I've been against for years.\nWe also need to do what Warren Buffett suggested. I was really very happy that he endorsed me, and I went to Omaha with him. And we were standing there and he—[applause]—he said, you know, I'm not too popular among my rich friends these days because I think people like me should pay more money into our tax system to support our country. And he has something he calls the Buffett rule. Anybody who makes $1 million should have to pay a 30 percent effective tax rate. So I've adopted the Buffett rule and we're going to go right at it and try to get that done. [applause]\nAnd then I want to go further, I want to impose what I call a fair share surcharge on incomes of $5 million or more. Now, there aren't very many of those, but there's a lot of money there because I want to use that money to make college affordable. I want to use that money to invest in clean energy. I want to use that money to move toward paid family leave so that families get more support to be able to do their work at home and take care of their families. I want to use that money to help bring down the cost of child care, which in some states is as expensive as college tuition. There are things we can do that will relieve the burdens on middle-class families, and the money should come from those who have it.\nNow, people say to me, \"Well, how are we ever going to get that done?\" Well, I do have a political strategy. I've seen a little bit of this in the last 20-plus years. There are not that many people who make $5 million or more in America, and I think we can make a very clear case.\nMr. Congressman over there, are you in favor of clean energy and affordable college? Are you in favor of early childhood education and the way we're going to get it is to tax the two people in your district who make more than $5 million? Or are you going to deny that to the 350,000 people who live in your district?\nWe're going to make a very tough case about why we have to make the tax code fairer. You know, you can talk about it, but I have a plan to do it. Not just a plan on the substance, but a political plan because I want you to know what I aim to do for you and what it will cost you. And I want everybody to be able to look at that and make your own judgment.\nI also have what has been described as the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan to go after Wall Street.\nNow, I totally agree with my two esteemed opponents, Senator Sanders and Governor O'Malley, that we've got to keep our eyes on the big banks. And no bank is too big to fail and no executive is too powerful to jail. But we already have the authority to go after them. That was in the Dodd-Frank bill. We don't have to do that, we just have to implement it. And I have said if they pose a systemic risk to our economy, I will go after them and I will use the process President Obama signed into law.\nBut here's where I differ with my two friends—that is not enough. And this is what we've been arguing about on the debate stage. You see it wasn't just the big banks that caused our problems, it was an investment bank like Lehman Brothers. It was a big insurance conglomerate called AIG. It was a mortgage company called Countrywide. It was another bank, not one of the big five, called Wachovia, and others who are in what is called the shadow banking sector.\nSo what I've is we're going after risk wherever it is in the financial system. And Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, said I have the best plan. Barney Frank, who is actually the Frank in Dodd-Frank, said I have the best plan because I'm trying to look not just at what happened in the past to prevent that from happening again, but what could happen in the future.\nAnd you know, the best evidence I have that I have the best plan is that the Republicans and their billionaire allies are running ads against me. You know, it started a few weeks ago. These two hedge fund billionaires formed a super PAC to run ads against me to convince Democrats not to support me. And then along came Karl Rove, you know, the errand boy for the billionaires, and he's now running an ad against me. And now another billionaire has jumped in, and he's now running an ad against me.\nNow you got to stop to think, why are they spending all this money to try to convince Democrats not to support me? Well, I think you know the answer, because they know that I say what I mean, I do what I say I will do, and I know how to get it done, to take after them, to prevent them from—[applause]—pushing an agenda on us that hurts the economy.\nNow, another area where I have very strong feelings and share exactly the same goal as Senator Sanders is health care. You know, I believe in universal health care coverage. Every American should have it. You know, before it was called Obamacare it was called Hillarycare back in '93 and '94 when I was trying to get universal health care, and we were not successful. And that was really disappointing.\nI mean, the drug companies, the insurance companies spent millions of dollars against us. So we didn't succeed. And then I got to thinking, well, what can I do now? Because, you know, my view is when you're knocked down, you share the human experience because everybody gets knocked down about something. The real question is whether you get back up. So I started thinking, what can I do that can help somebody make a difference in their lives.\nAnd I remembered when I was traveling around the country trying to get universal health care, meeting so many people who did not have health insurance, they couldn't afford it, they had a pre-existing condition and the insurance companies wouldn't give it to them. And I met so many really good, decent people who are so overwhelmed by what was happening to them. And I remember I was at the Children's Hospital in Cleveland. I was meeting with a group of parents whose kids were really sick with chronic diseases. And one man said to me, he said, \"You know, I've gone everywhere to try to get insurance for my daughters. I have two girls with cystic fibrosis, and nobody will sell it to me.\"\nI said what do they say when you go ask them and you tell them you want to try to pay for something? They say no. He said, I'll tell you what the last person told me at the insurance company I visited. He said, we don't insure burning houses. This man said, they called my little girls burning houses. And that stuck with me, that and the stories I heard. So I started to work with Democrats and Republicans and we created the Children's Health Insurance Program, and it now insures eight million kids because when you get—[applause]—you encounter an obstacle, you run into a problem, you've got to keep going. You can't ever stop if you're trying to accomplish something that will help other people. And I was thrilled when the president passed and signed the Affordable Care Act.\nWe've been trying to get that—the Democratic party has been trying to get that accomplished since Harry Truman. And now, I meet people all the time who are benefiting from it. I want to build on it and I want to improve it. You know, the Republicans want to repeal it, and that's what they'll do if they get the White House back. We can't let that happen.\nHere is what I want to do. I want to decrease costs, out-of-pocket costs; decrease prescription drug costs. [applause]\nI want to make sure that we get the authority for Medicare to negotiate for lower drug costs with the drug companies. I want to go after the predatory pricing that drug companies are using to raise the price of drugs. I want to take away their tax benefits. They actually get a tax benefit for advertising all that stuff on TV to us that we never—I can't understand what they're talking about.\nThey have people walking through fields of wildflowers, walking on beaches. They have the name of the drug which, you know, is unpronounceable. And then in a low voice, under the music, they have somebody saying if you take this drug, you know, your nose will fall off. I mean, it—[laughter]—drives you crazy. And they spend more money advertising on TV than they spend on research. So we're going to go right at them. We're going to take them on on this.\nBut I don't want to start over, my friends. That's the disagreement I have with Senator Sanders. I want us to build on what we have and make it better, and go from 90 percent coverage to 100 percent of Americans. I don't want to start at zero and have to—[applause]—fight it all over again, have to have the national battle we that we had on health care over the last 25 years. So I'm determined that we're going to make this work for everybody, and I know it's the right thing to do. And I hope that, you know, we will be able to get your costs down, your co-pays, your deductibles, what, you know, a lot of people are telling me are starting to pinch again.\nI also will defend Social Security against privatization. The Republicans still want to privatize it. They're still talking about that. It's a terrible idea. And you know the worst part of the idea is they want to turn the entire Social Security trust fund over to Wall Street. That's what this is all about. Take all that money that people have been paying in for, you know, 75, 80 years and turn it over to Wall Street. I will never let that happen. That is the worst—[applause]—idea that is imaginable.\nI will also not let them voucherize Medicare, something else they want to do, and I will not let them privatize the VA. We have to fix the VA, but we are not going to take away guaranteed benefits from our veterans who have earned them through their service. That's not going to happen. [applause]\nAnd when it comes to foreign policy and national security, well, I think we have a lot to do to keep our country safe, and I have some ideas that I've been putting out based on what I did in the Senate after 9/11, based on my work as secretary of State.\nIt's imperative that we do everything we can to defeat ISIS, to stop the flow of foreign fighters and funding to fight them on the Internet where they're quite effective without putting American troops back on the ground in either Syria or Iraq. [applause]\nThat will not happen. It's not—it's not going to happen on my watch. And then we have to do a better job working with federal, state, and local law enforcement to keep us safe at home, and we have to do a better job sharing intelligence, getting intelligence that will help us prevent attacks.\nWhen I was a senator after 9/11, I'd be kept up-to-date on all the threats that still were facing New York, and we had a very, very dedicated group of police and federal law enforcement and everyone who worked together. But, you know, one of the best things we did was a campaign which said, If you see something suspicious or you hear something suspicious, report it. And so people were picking up the phone and telling the police or maybe calling the FBI, and it really provided kind of the—the eyes-on help that we needed. And people could then follow up, and we prevented attacks. We foiled attacks.\nWell, the reason I mention that is because of this. The Republican candidates, led by their frontrunner, have been attacking Muslims, right? You've heard that, attacking American Muslims, attacking Muslims around the world. That's not only shameful, it's dangerous. We need everybody in this country to be on the same team when it comes to preventing terrorist attacks. [applause]\nAnd we need people who are in the community who hear something, see something to report it and not feel like they're being demonized, defamed, insulted, pushed out. And certainly, if we're going to defeat ISIS, we need a coalition that includes Muslim nations.\nNow, I can tell you I built the coalition that imposed sanctions on Iran. I know a little bit about how you do this. You don't start by insulting people's religion and then ask them to be part of your effort to defeat a common adversary. [applause]\nThat's not the way it works in the real world. So we have to be smart about how we protect ourselves, and that will be my highest priority.\nI also want to continue to move toward comprehensive immigration reform, which I think is in the best interest of our country and our economy. [applause]\nAnd I want to let you know where I stand on a lot of the issues that the Republicans have taken positions on because they seem to be against so many of the fundamental rights that I support.\nI am for a woman's right—a woman's right to make her own health decisions, and I am against defunding Planned Parenthood. [applause]\nI am for marriage equality and against discrimination against the LGBT community. I am against Citizens United, which is a terrible decision that has opened the doors to floods of unaccountable money from the Koch Brothers and others. And I would do everything I can to reverse that decision.\nI also want to keep pushing for criminal justice reform and reform in the incarceration system. And I want to fight for common sense gun safety measures that will help keep— [applause] —Americans safe without infringing on gun owners' rights.\nWe are a smart—we are a smart people. We can do this. And what I don't understand is how when we know we have, on average, 90 people a day dying from gun violence, 33,000 people a year, we cannot figure out how to protect people, protect first-graders going to school, people going to a movie theater, churchgoers going to Bible study. We can do this. We can't stop every murder or every suicide or every tragic, avoidable accident, but we can stop a lot of them without infringing on anybody's rights.\nAnd 92 percent of the American people agree with that, and 85 percent of gun owners agree with that. So we need somebody who will stand up to the gun lobby and stop them from intimidating common sense reforms in our country. [applause]\nSo we have a lot of work to do, my friends. And you have been really patient. The children who are still here have been especially patient, and I don't want to keep you any longer.\nI just want to say a few closing comments, and then for those of you who want to stay, I will shake your hands and take pictures and you can ask me questions. But everybody else can go home and not feel bad about it because I need you to get up tomorrow and help work to get more people to go to the caucus next Monday. [applause]\nAnd, you know, I am all about—I am all about making progress against the odds. I am all about working with people. I worked with Republicans as first lady, as senator, as secretary of State. I worked to get results for the people I represented in the Senate as well as our country. I worked when I was secretary of State to make our country safe and to have our values and interests promoted. And I know how to find common ground because I've done it.\nI don't think that—I think I—I do believe that probably every Republican I served with at one time or another sponsored a piece of my legislation. Actually, when I'm not running for something, they say nice things about me. [laughter]\nEven in the case of Mr. Trump, they give me money because they think I'm so good as a candidate and a senator. So, you know, this is politics. This is all that that goes on.\nBut once the election is over, I will work as hard as I can to find that common ground, to get good things to happen for you, for your families, for your country and make it possible for young people to feel like I felt, that, you know, really the American Dream was available. You had to work for it, but if you did, you could get ahead and stay ahead. That's what I think about when it comes to my granddaughter. You know, I am the granddaughter of a factory worker, she is the granddaughter of a former president. I think it shouldn't matter. The grandchildren of everybody should have the same opportunities in our country. [applause]\nAnd that's what I am going to stand up for and fight for. And with your help, starting at the caucus next Monday night, that's what we will do together. Thank you all so much.

By expanding people-to-people ties, business opportunities, and greater access to information, we are promoting the transformation of our relationship in ways that advance U.S. interests and improve the lives of the Cuban people.\nThe President has repeatedly underscored that our Cuba policy has changed, and supports increasing connections between the people of the United States and Cuba. The Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security, in coordination with the Department of State, previously issued amended regulations to support the President's policy of empowering the Cuban people and creating conditions for more economic opportunities between Cubans and Americans.

These changes will remove financing restrictions for most types of authorized exports, amend regulations to increase support for the Cuban people and facilitate authorized exports, and further facilitate authorized travel.

{"author": "Ben Carson", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111643", "text": "Hello everyone, it's another night that we get to spend together during our nightly fireside chat. It's been another great day in Iowa — from getting to meet so many of you at Revive 714 and talking to Sean Hannity about how We the People will restore faith in our great nation to seeing so many of our team hitting the ground hard, the February 1st Iowa Caucus can't come soon enough! Remember, keep sending me your thoughts and comments by texting the number 275-236 (ASKBEN).\nThe first question tonight comes from Ryan who asks \"what are your thoughts concerning the Justice Department going after the people who exposed Planned Parenthood's negligent practices?\"\nRyan, thank you for this important question. As I have said repeatedly — the moment we start devaluing human life is the moment we lose our humanity. Without life, we have no hope for a future, tomorrow will never come — we must not allow ourselves to become callous and indifferent to the slaughter of our most precious little ones. They are our hope. They are our future. No longer can we let these children's unrealized potential go unchecked into perpetuity.\nWe have witnessed those who tried being a voice for the voiceless now being targeted by this administration's Justice Department, an attempt to silence their plea for increased scrutiny regarding these heinous acts performed by Planned Parenthood — I will not stand idly by and allow this to go unnoticed or brushed aside. I ask that you visit crsn.co/1KD9FBH and stand with me against these barbaric practices.\nThe next question comes from Ruth. She asks \"do you feel the same way about the government and its overreach as I do?\" Ruth commented that she feels our government has become far too large and overreaching, especially for small businesses.\nYes, Ruth, I agree. The truth of the matter is government has come to resemble a 'Leviathan' presence in America. It is lethargic and inefficient, reaching into our lives in ways our Founding Fathers never intended. Though, this is not \"something new under the sun\" — we have been having this very discussion for far too long, only to have politicians promise \"reform\", as if they are listening… The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, expecting a different outcome. We the People have been ignored and pandered to enough, now it is time for the government to listen to us!\nOur nation cannot afford to keep kicking the can down the road, allowing the pervasive hand of government to dictate our prosperity or outcomes: not from our homes, not from our places of business, and certainly not our places of worship.\nAmericans are innovators and entrepreneurs, when given the proper free-market environment for individuals, families and businesses the opportunity to thrive, We the People outperform the competition time and time again. It is in our national DNA — we are an accomplished people with so much to share, if only the government bureaucrats would cut the red tape, that would be the real stimulus needed to jumpstart the American engine of ingenuity. I am ready to fuel this restoration with you and return this country back into the hands of We the People. Enough is enough.\nFinally, Eddie asks \"what is the hardest thing about running for President?\"\nEddie, I won't lie — running for President is not easy and I often have to spend a lot of time away from my family. They keep me centered and grounded. At the end of the day, there is nothing like spending quality time with them, and without their support, this would not be possible. I am blessed to have them by my side. The next hardest thing is seeing the trajectory of our country and being so passionate about \"sounding the alarm\" — often, we can feel as if \"I'm only one voice, does it make a difference?\". I can tell you with absolute certainty: one voice can echo throughout history. You are that voice that is multiplied many times over. I can see it in the eyes of everyone I meet — it is passion, zeal and a resolute mindset that will fight for this country at each and every impasse. Americans have a distinct quality of fighters, and they wear many different uniforms, many without nametags. I am so proud to fight by your side and We the People are stronger now more than ever.\nAs always, thank you for spending the evening with me for our nightly chat. I look forward to tomorrow and beyond.\nGoodnight,\nBen", "timestamp": "2016-01-26", "title": "Press Release - #AskBen Fireside Chat - January 26"}

The one with the best record to support his case is John Kasich.\nThe Ohio governor began his career in public service in 1978, when he became a state senator at age 26. Four years later, he was elected to the first of his nine terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, where he served 18 years on the House Armed Services Committee and six years as chairman of the Budget Committee. In 2010, he was elected governor of Ohio and was re-elected four years later in a landslide.\nThe economic turnaround Ohio has experienced since Kasich took the reins should appeal to fiscal conservatives. The multi-billion-dollar budget hole he inherited is now a $2 billion surplus; his administration oversaw $5 billion in tax cuts; and his record on helping to create and retain jobs in Ohio – including 385,000 new private-sector jobs since 2011 – is impressive. He has also consistently shown his dedication to helping his state's most vulnerable citizens through actions such as expanding Medicaid.\nKasich's plan for his first 100 days in the White House is ambitious and should resonate with Republican voters who embrace conservative economic principles.\nHe vows to put the nation on a path to a balanced budget and slash the size of the federal government by transferring resources back to the states \"with fewer strings attached.\" He promises to cut individual and business taxes, reform the tax code and launch a thorough review of the Internal Revenue Service.\nOn national security, Kasich is more alliance-builder than hawk. He believes that wiping out ISIS will require a NATO and regional coalition of ground troops, no-fly zones and support for the Kurdish military. He also believes, however, that the United States must reassert itself as a world power by standing up to the \"expansionist agendas\" of China and Russia.\nThroughout his political career, Kasich has committed himself to many of the values that Republicans hold dear. But what really separates him from his New Hampshire primary opponents, other than his solid record as governor of Ohio, is his desire and ability to find common ground with politicians and voters of all stripes.\nRead the entire endorsement here.\nThe Monitor's endorsement follows yesterday's Boston Globe endorsement and comes only a week after four other New Hampshire newspapers' endorsements, including the Nashua Telegraph, Valley News, Portsmouth Herald, Foster's Daily Democrat and Bow Times.", "timestamp": "2016-01-26", "title": "Press Release - Endorsement: The Concord Monitor Supports John Kasich for President"}

It is pretty thin. (CNN, 1/26/15)\nThe Washington Post Fact Checker: \"Here's Why The Marco Rubio's Corporate Card Saga Isn't Really A Scandal.\"\nRubio's carefully worded explanation doesn't quite rise to the level of a Geppetto Checkmark, but it is accurate enough that it does not warrant even a single Pinocchio. Perhaps the release of the 2005-2006 card statements will change the outcome. We'll be keeping an eye on this issue but based on the information released so far, a mountain's been made out of molehill, by the media and Rubio's opponents. (The Washington Post, 11/6/15)\nThe Wall Street Journal's Kim Strassel: \"If this is a scandal, we've found a cure for insomnia.\"\nThe card was used primarily for political expenses—which were covered by the party. Mr. Rubio occasionally used it for a personal expense, which he then paid for each month by writing a check to the card company. No one is suggesting that the party paid a dime toward Mr. Rubio's expenses, or that the candidate was a dime short in promptly paying back his personal charges. If this is a scandal, we've found a cure for insomnia. . . .\nThe press for its part is more interested in presenting Mr. Rubio's financial history as some evidence of scandal. The New York Times has devoted near novel-length inches to the non-news (this was all covered in Mr. Rubio's Senate race in 2010) that as a Florida legislator he used a Republican Party charge card for personal purchases. (Kimberly A. Strassel, WSJ, 11/5/15)\nNational Review's Charles Cooke: \"And the scandal is . . . what?\"\nThis story has been doing the rounds for five years now, since Rubio first ran for the Senate. And now, as back then, I am struggling mightily to determine what exactly is supposed to be scandalous about it. Per the Times, the card in question was a Republican-party-linked American Express that was tied to Rubio's 'personal credit.' Primarily, it was used 'for political expenses, which were covered by donations to the party.' Occasionally, however, 'a few personal expenses were charged to the card as well.' Thus, when the bill came in, it contained a mixture of outlays that needed to be carefully sifted through.\nAnd the scandal is . . . what? Did the GOP pick up the tab for those personal charges? Did a group of secret donors bankroll Rubio's home expenditures? Did Rubio and his wife benefit from a line of untaxable private income? Nah. Not even close. Rather, as the Times flatly notes, Rubio made sure to identify all of the personal purchases and ultimately paid for them himself. He wrote a monthly check to the credit card company to cover the personal costs, and the party wrote a check to cover the political ones, according to his staff.\nIn other words, he did what millions of Americans who work for corporations do each and every month. He didn't borrow money. He didn't ask his backers to pick up his personal tab. He didn't default on his obligations. (Charles C.W. Cooke, National Review Online, 11/5/15)\nRed State: \"Rubio lived on the income of a pretty ordinary person.\"\nThe other financial issues, however, serve mainly as a reminder of the fact that, at least until a couple years ago, Rubio lived on the income of a pretty ordinary person. Maybe they provide one of the reasons that he can talk with authenticity about the struggles people face in terms of paying their student loan debts and living paycheck to paycheck, because they are real life struggles that Rubio himself has faced.\" (Red State, 11/6/15)", "timestamp": "2016-01-26", "title": "Press Release - Jeb Bush's Super PAC Is Recycling an Incredibly Desperate Attack on Marco Rubio"}

They were written by corporate America to benefit corporate America, people who could care less about working families,\" Sanders said at the United Steelworkers of America Local 310L union hall. \"The simple truth is, and it's indisputable, these trade agreements have been a disaster for working families in this country and they have benefited the CEOs of major corporations.\"\nSanders is leading the opposition in Congress against the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would be the biggest trade pact in history. He also was at the forefront in earlier battles against the North American Free Trade Agreement and permanent normal trade relations with China — trade agreements that Secretary Clinton supported which have led to the loss of more than 30,000 good-paying jobs in Iowa. \"Can you be a great country when everything we buy is made in China?\" he asked the union workers.\nIn the closing days before Iowans go to precinct caucuses to begin the process of picking a Democratic nominee for president, Sanders is in a neck-and-neck contest in Iowa with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\nClinton has praised past trade agreements and once called the Pacific trade deal \"the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field.\" Last Oct. 8, however, she said that \"as of today, I am not in favor of what I have learned about it.

Perkins is the Family Research Council's (FRC) fourth and longest serving president, joining the organization in August of 2003. He is one of the nation's leading voices on pro-life and pro-family issues and has been a crucial leader in promoting policies that support conservative values. Perkins hosts a daily, nationally syndicated radio show, Washington Watch with Tony Perkins and is the author of No Fear: Real Stories of a Courageous New Generation Standing for Truth.\n\"Tony is a man of incredible principle and faith,\" said Cruz. \"His unwavering commitment to fight for life and marriage, and religious liberty have reverberated throughout the nation and continue to awaken a culture of life and faith throughout our communities. Tony is a steadfast fighter for the principles that have made this country a shining beacon for liberty. I am honored to have his blessing and endorsement for 2016 so that we can together coalesce conservatives and restore the values upon which this nation was founded.\"\nPerkins served two terms in the Louisiana Legislature, where he authored and passed the nation's first Covenant Marriage law in 1997. He is a veteran of the United States Marine Corps and a former police officer. As President of FRC, Perkins has expanded the organization's reach across the nation by building a major network of pastors and churches, encouraging them to impact the culture by thinking nationally, but acting locally.\n\"Ted is a constitutional conservative who will fight for faith, family and freedom,\" said Perkins. \"He will defend our right to believe and live according to those beliefs. Our families will be protected and freedom will once again mean something in America. I trust Ted to fight to pull America out of the political and cultural tailspin that President Obama's policies have put us in. This is no normal election; this election is about the very survival of our Constitution and our republic.\"\nPerkins is also an ordained minister and remains active in Christian ministries serving as an elder in his home church and frequently filling pulpits across the country. He is a board member of Caring to Love Ministries, one of Louisiana's largest pregnancy resource centers, a trustee of Louisiana College and a member of the Louisiana Commission on Law Enforcement. Additionally, he serves as president of the Council for National Policy.\nPerkins joined Cruz for the Cruz Campaign's Rally for Religious Liberty in South Carolina at Bob Jones University in Greenville last November. The rally highlighted recent acts of government-sanctioned religious persecution against Americans of faith, and in particular recent attacks against evangelical Christians.\nThe Family Research Council was founded in 1983, inspired by Dr. James Dobson, who endorsed Cruz in December. Past FRC President Gary Bauer endorsed Cruz last week. FRC's vision is \"a culture in which human life is valued, families flourish, and religious liberty thrives.\"\n*Titles and affiliations of Tony Perkins are provided for identification purposes only.", "timestamp": "2016-01-26", "title": "Press Release - Tony Perkins Endorses Ted Cruz for President"}

The announcement marks the final milestone in Cruz's impressive Iowa organization. The campaign is putting its massive Iowa organization to the test this week by mobilizing the grassroots and turning them out to caucus for Cruz.\nLeading up to the Iowa Caucus on February 1, the Cruz for President campaign has put together an unmatched ground game throughout the Hawkeye state. It has named a county chair for each of Iowa's 99 counties. The campaign has recruited 247 notable activists, pastors, and lawmakers including Congressman Steve King, Bob Vander Plaats, Steve Deace, and Cruz's chairman Matt Schultz, former Iowa Secretary of State.\nAs of last week, over 12,000 volunteers have signed on and are now working to identify and turn out caucus goers for Cruz. Volunteers, on average, are making up to 20,000 phone calls and knocking on 2,000 doors every day. During the month of January, 836 people will have stayed at Camp Cruz, the former college dorms that are filled beyond capacity with volunteers from all over the country, some tripling up in rooms using air mattresses.\n\"In my experience the Cruz organizational effort here in Iowa is unrivaled,\" said Bryan English, the Cruz campaign's Iowa state director. \"We have coalesced conservatives from across the state because they want a conservative leader who will change Washington, break the DC Cartel, and bring power back to 'We the People'.\"\nThis week, Cruz will be barnstorming the state holding 30 public events in 22 counties leading up to the caucuses. By Monday, he will have completed the 'Full Grassley,' visiting and holding events in all 99 counties in the state. Over the course of the campaign, Cruz has met thousands of Iowans who have come out to his events. He has made it a point to spend time listening to and getting to know the people of Iowa face to face. Governor Rick Perry, who endorsed Cruz earlier in the week, will be attending events today with Cruz along with Bob Vander Plaats and Congressman Steve King.\nAll the campaign has done up to this point in Iowa leads to Monday's caucuses. Cruz noted that this incredible effort would not have been possible without the sacrifices made by thousands of courageous conservatives and their families from Iowa and from around the country. The Cruz campaign believes that conservatives in Iowa have united behind their campaign because Cruz is the only candidate in the race with a proven conservative track record and because he has stood up to Washington, including the leaders in his own party.", "timestamp": "2016-01-26", "title": "Press Release - Cruz for President Sees Unprecedented Grassroots Effort Mobilizing Before Iowa Caucuses"}

Just six days left till the Iowa caucuses and adrenaline at HQ is rising fast. The Gov. had a fantastic performance last night with country-music star Josh Turner here in Des Moines. Despite the arctic blizzard that blew through town, Huckabee supporters from across the state were cutting rug and having a blast! Today, we had great events across the state and a caucus night training session here at HQ. Cable news is wall-to-wall political attack ads—although I haven't seen any anti-Bernie (or pro-Bernie) Sanders ads on Fox. A few minor clips below…\n----\n\"Huckabee jams hits with country star Josh Turner\" — The Des Moines Register ... A little snow in central Iowa didn't stop Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee from slapping the bass with American country star Josh Turner. \"It's an honor to be here in spite of the weather,\" Turner said to the Des Moines crowd as he took the stage. The award-winning singer-songwriter performed six songs at Wooly's in the East Village. He warmed the crowd with hit tunes including \"Why Don't We Just Dance?,\" \"Your Man\" and \"Everything Is Fine.\" Huckabee joined Turner and his accompanying musicians for two tracks, including \"All Over Me.\" Turner told the audience he backs Huckabee because he \"cares about people.\" \"He's about as genuine as the day is long,\" Turner said. \"He cares about each and every one of you. He cares about our nation.\" Before busting out the bass, Huckabee addressed the crowd of about 150. He praised the crowd for braving the weather and talked about the importance of caucusing. \"People are tired of seeing this country governed with disregard,\" Huckabee said before introducing Turner. New York-born comedian Jimmy Labriola — best known as Benny from '90s popular sitcom \"Home Improvement\" — opened the evening's event with jokes ranging in topic from his Italian father to funerals to Osama bin Laden. \"We can see a license plate from outer space but it took us 10 years to find bin Laden?\" he joked. What brought the comedian to Des Moines for the former governor of Arkansas? \"I totally believe in him,\" Labriola said. \"They don't come more real than this guy. This guy believes in what he says.\" Turned closed the evening with \"Long Black Train,\" a song off his debut record of the same name. Before digging into the number, he said he wrote the song with \"no commercial ideas of aspiration in mind,\" and that it's been \"awfully good\" to him. ... \"He's the right man for the job,\" Turner said about Huckabee before closing his set.\n\"Huckabee super-PAC to voters: Get serious\" — The Hill ... A super-PAC that supports former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee is running a radio ad in Iowa urging Republican voters to \"consider someone serious\" for the White House. The ad criticizes Republican presidential front-runners Donald Trump and Ted Cruz and calls Huckabee a conservative with a \"record of achievement and respect for public service.\" \"At times, this presidential campaign has been downright hard to watch,\" the ad says. \"It's as if Trump and Cruz have completely forgot they're running for the highest office in the land, an office held by great men, great Republicans.\" The ad, released by Pursuing America's Greatness, said Huckabee balanced budgets, cut taxes, fought corruption and created jobs during his time as governor. \"Mike Huckabee is a serious conservative leader and a man of faith we can always trust,\" the ad says. \"Mike Huckabee for president.\"\nOpinion: \"You'll Be Shocked Which GOP Candidate This NYT Bestselling Author Likens To Ronald Reagan ... they are master communicators.\" — Western Journalism ... A few years ago I wrote a biography of Ronald Reagan. I spent hundreds of hours extensively researching, studying and interviewing people close to President Reagan. Now, I have spent countless hours getting to know, observe and study many of the GOP presidential candidates. And I've been struck by an uncanny likeness between Reagan and Mike Huckabee. Not only are their personalities, styles and temperaments much alike, but they share many of the same principals, beliefs, talents and gifts, on top of having many similar experiences in their lives. I don't make these comparisons lightly. Here are some of the reasons why I think they are so similar. The common thread begins in their backgrounds. Reagan and Huckabee successfully held the political office of governor of their state for two terms. Less well known is that before politics, Huckabee, like Reagan, worked in TV and radio. The leadership strength both share is they are master communicators. The main essence of communication is to connect with others, and impart and share information or ideas. Both men share the keen ability to take complex ideas and difficult-to-understand problems and explain them in clear, concise and easy-to-understand ways. \"A leader,\" Huckabee explains, \"is the one who can outline the broad vision and the direction, and say here's where we are going to go, here's why we need to go there, and here's how we are going to get there.\" Reagan and Huckabee are deep thinkers, but they both explain things in a very natural and easy-to-understand manner, often using metaphors and analogies. Pundits and journalists make the mistake of assuming them not to be deep thinkers, but this is contrarily so, because it takes a great deal of intelligence and unique ability to take the complex and paint word pictures and stories with examples to help clearly explain a multifaceted situation, or take a gigantic numerical figure and relate it to a common object as a way of explanation. Early on, some intellectuals erroneously assumed the ability to speak clearly and naturally to everyday people, as Reagan did, was the result of simple thinking. However, quite the opposite was true. It takes a very gifted and skilled communicator to achieve this ability. Another huge leadership quality and advantage both share is their optimism, cheerfulness, sense of humor and storytelling. In fact, what might come as a surprise to some is the importance storytelling can play in the lives of extraordinary leaders. Think Lincoln, Churchill and Roosevelt in addition to Reagan. Another shared trait is Reagan's and Huckabee's sense of humor. Leadership studies have shown it's a powerful tool and sign of intelligence. A cleverly placed joke can ease stress, decrease conflict and increases comradery, cohesiveness and bonding in groups. Motivational speaker Mike Kerr says humor can boost morale, motivate people, increases communication and builds trust and relationships. After almost 8 years of Barack Obama, division and strife have grown rampant among Americans. Our nation sorely needs to unite. Reagan was masterful at uniting Americans, as now Huckabee seeks to do. By having a great sense of humor, Reagan and Huckabee found a good way to express something that's hard for some people to hear, but softens it while getting the idea or message across without sounding too harsh. Neither Reagan or Huckabee are narcissistic and self-centered, like some politicians. \"Candidates don't run for themselves; they run for the future,\" Huckabee said in October. And Reagan had a saying on his desk in the White House that read, \"There is no limit to what a man can do or where he can go if he doesn't mind who gets the credit.\"\n\"Conservative national groups battle in the states over Constitution redo\" — The Center for Public Integrity ... It's only a short phrase buried in the U.S. Constitution, but it enables an unprecedented avenue to change the law of the land: If two-thirds of the states demand it, Congress \"shall call a convention\" for proposing constitutional amendments. A hopeless pipe dream? Actually, no; the issue is front and center right now. ... So suddenly such a meeting, not held since the earliest days of this country, is becoming a real possibility. Even GOP presidential candidates are seizing on the burgeoning movement, with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee….endorsing this unconventional process and rallying their supporters as legislative sessions start up again. While the legislation appears to be a grassroots effort bubbling up from the states, in reality it's quite the opposite. National groups have been holding workshops, publishing tips and even crafting model legislation for years to persuade legislators to use their states to circumvent the logjam in Congress….\n\"Mike Huckabee in the news\" — Cleveland.com ... Huckabee has been particularly hostile toward Ted Cruz: he clearly thinks Cruz is fundamentally untrustworthy and deceptive, and he would likely support Donald Trump over Cruz: (National Review). Huckabee said... \"I just think it's hard to say God is first in your life if he's last in your budget,\" Huckabee said in an interview with Buzzfeed. \"If I can't trust God with a dime out of each dollar that I earn, then I'm not sure how I can tell him that I trust him with my whole life.\" (Buzzfeed) In a follow-up interview with Fox News' Bill O'Reilly, Huckabee said he's not sure he's been too \"critical\" of Cruz, but he said people who claim to be consistent must act as such. When O'Reilly asked whether Cruz is being \"phony\" when it comes to Christian charitable giving, Huckabee replied, \"I think it's something he needs to answer. What are his parameters of stewardship?\"\n(The Blaze) ... Huckabee will play bass guitar in Des Moines on Monday alongside country music artist Josh Turner. Actor Jim Labriola, best known for playing donut-loving delivery man Benny Baroni on the 1990s sitcom \"Home Improvement,\" will also join Huckabee on the Iowa campaign trail through the end of the month.\n(Des Moines Register) Huckabee and Trump bumped into each other in an Iowa hotel hallway last Wednesday, according to a tweet from Huckabee's daughter and campaign manager, Sarah Huckabee.\n\"Only in IA can 2 pres candidates randomly bump into one another in a hotel hallway,\" the tweet read. No word on what the pair talked about: (Des Moines Register).\n\"Mike Huckabee returning to Ames Wednesday\" — Iowa State Daily ... Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee is planning on a stop in Ames this week during his final tour of the state before the Iowa Caucus. Details about the event, which is free and open to the public, are below: WHO: Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, 2016 Republican presidential candidate; WHAT: Huckabee Huddle - Moral Clarity; WHEN: 12:30 p.m. Wednesday, Jan. 27; WHERE: Jeff's Pizza, 2420 Lincoln Way, Ames; RSVP for the event at MikeHuckabee.com. Huckabee was in Ames just before the start of the spring semester, talking to supporters at a town hall at Oakwood Road Church.\n\"Mike Huckabee sticks to his guns in Iowa\" — The Guardian ... \"I killed it, whatever it was,\" says Janet Huckabee as she lifts her AR-15 rifle away from the suburban shooting range in Iowa and inspects a shredded paper target. In the neighbouring lane, her husband and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee is having less luck. A variety of handguns jam, his safety glasses mist up, and he wants to know why all his shots are pulling to the left. In fairness, both seem more than comfortable with the firearms on offer during what is largely a photo opportunity for journalists... what he likes to hunt: duck, turkey, pheasant, deer and antelope. \"The second amendment is not about hunting though,\" he wants to make clear. \"It has to do with protecting ourselves, our homes, our families and our country from tyranny. Whether it's the tyranny of a burglar or the tyranny of a government that wants to take our liberty away.\" Just in case Barack Obama's recent order to introduce more background checks for those buying firearms is not proof enough of this existential threat, the governor goes on to claim it was a fear of armed American civilians that deterred the Japanese from invading California after the Pearl Harbor attack. \"It might take the sheriff 20 minutes to get to where I live,\" he says, outlining a hypothetical scenario. \"So I would call 911 - I am not just going to be some vigilante - but in those next 20 minutes, I am not sitting around helplessly waiting to be a victim. The reason I call 911 is to tell the sheriff where to come to pick up the carcass of the idiot who tried to break into my home at 2 o'clock in the morning.\" ...This soft-spoken conservative won the Iowa caucus in 2008, with strong backing from the state's evangelical faithful, and is making 150 stops in the state this month to try to prove that the opinion polling is wrong this time. \"I know the New York media already decided who is going to win on caucus night,\" Huckabee concludes in his pitch to the small room of supporters. \"They have already got it figured out, but every time we have a caucus here in Iowa, they get it wrong.\" It's a relatively unsophisticated message, even by the standards of 2016. \"I like Mike,\" reads one poster. Apart from mentioning the second amendment, he speaks only of his plan to abolish income tax...Press adviser Hogan Gidley bristles when the Guardian suggests that the fun of messing about with country stars and shooting ranges might be part of what keeps the campaign going: \"He's doing 150 stops. It's hard work. This is just a bit of relief.\"\n\"Mike Huckabee: 'Sick Day in America When Our Government Punishes Those Who Expose Evil'\" — Breitbart ... GOP presidential candidate former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee slammed Houston prosecutors for indicting the activists who used hidden cameras to record Planned Parenthood officials allegedly attempting to trade body parts from aborted babies. \"Harvesting human organs is beyond barbaric, it's unimaginably grotesque and evil,\" Mike Huckabee said. \"And it's a sick day in America when our government punishes those who expose evil with a smartphone—while accommodating those who perform it with a scalpel.\" After a two-month-long investigation into Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, the Harris County District Attorney's office in Houston, Texas, indicted the two individuals who created the undercover videos. They did not indict Planned Parenthood officials. David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt were indicted by a grand jury for \"tampering with a governmental record, a second degree felony.\" WMUR reports, \"Daleiden was also indicted on the count of prohibition of the purchase and sale of human organs, a class A misdemeanor, according to the Harris County district attorney.\"\n\"THE ENDORSEMENTS SCORECARD\" — Powerline Blog ... How important are endorsements by office holders when it comes to nominating a presidential candidate? I think the conventional wisdom is that this year, at least on the Republican side, they won't count for much. On the other hand, Aaron Bycoffe of FiveThirtyEight cites research showing that in presidential nomination contests between 1980 and 2004, early endorsements by members of the party elites were the most important cause of candidate success in the state primaries and caucuses. Accordingly, FiveThirtyEight is keeping track of endorsements this cycle. Even if dndorsements end up not helping successfully to predict the nominees, the scorecard is fascinating, at least to me. FiveThirtyEight's scorecard awards 10 points for endorsements by governors, 5 points for endorsements by U.S. senators, and 1 point for endorsements by U.S. representatives. The winner, as of now, on the Republican side is Jeb Bush with 51 points. He is followed by Marco Rubio (43), Chris Christie (26), Mike Huckabee (26),...Ted Cruz, said to be \"hated\" by his GOP Senate colleagues, hasn't picked up any Senate endorsements. ... Mike Huckabee and Chris Christie benefit from home cooking...\n\"Gov. Mike Huckabee Plays Bass Guitar With Country Music Star Josh Turner In Downtown Des Moines\" — Breitbart ... DES MOINES, Iowa — With snow blanketing Iowa's capitol city outside, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee—a 2016 GOP presidential candidate and the winner of the 2008 Iowa GOP caucuses—took the stage with country music star Josh Turner here in Wooly's downtown to play bass guitar. Under high ceilings with the rafters showing, the packed downtown honky-tonk—dimly lit with hightop tables surrounding a hardwood dance floor, long bar off to the left and higher-top booths lining the right wall — buzzed with Huckabee supporters as they waited for their candidate and Turner to take the stage. Huckabee volunteers passed out campaign stickers and sold bright red #ImWithHuck tee-shirts. \"I want to say thanks to all of you for coming out—for us, this is horrible weather,\" Huckabee told the 150 or so supporters gathered inside Wooly's a few blocks from the Iowa State Capitol building while inches of snow piled up outside. \"I know you're from Iowa, you're saying 'This is great. This is normal.' Look, a lot of us on this campaign and the campaign staff, we're all from the South. I'll tell you, our blood is not as thick as yours is and we really admire you guys—we were in Cedar Rapids earlier today and coming to Des Moines tonight it was just like a blinding snowstorm the whole time and I'm just always amazed. This would have just shut everything down in Arkansas—and it wouldn't take this much. We're always amazed when we hear on the news about people who have heart attacks while they're shoveling snow, and we think why would anyone shovel snow? That's the problem with yankees: They're always out there shoveling snow. We're thinking this is dumb because snow will melt except for you it doesn't melt for weeks or months, for us it melts tomorrow. It's really, I mean, everything closes. The government closes, school closes. Washington, D.C., closed last week for several days.\" The crowd cheered. About 150 people came out to Wooly's for the Huckabee event—more than double that had RSVP'd before the snow started pelting Iowa roads—for the free concert. When Turner took the stage—Huckabee joined him mid-set—he didn't say much besides singing. \"I just wanted to say it's an honor to be here despite the weather,\" Turner told the crowd. \"We're out here at Wooly's, we're indoors and the heat's working so everything's fine.\" Turner, a conservative Christian, did say why he's supporting Huckabee for president. \"He's about as genuine as the day is long,\" Turner said. \"He cares about each and every one of you. He cares about our nation.\" While on stage, Turner played six songs for the Huckabee team. He kicked it off with\"Why Don't We Just Dance?,\" then shifted to \"Everything Is Fine\" before turning to \"Would You Go With Me?\" and then \"Your Man.\" After that Huckabee joined him on stage to play bass for \"All Over Me\" and \"Long Black Train.\" Huckabee was also joined by his wife, former Arkansas First Lady Janet Huckabee. \"I want to thank you all for coming—I know the weather was a little less than sunshiny today,\" Janet Huckabee said on stage before comedian Jimmy Labriola—who's starred on shows like Home Improvement and in movies like The Santa Clause—performed to open up the night. When Gov. Huckabee was on stage, the 2008 caucus winner said that he expects to do a lot better than polling currently shows and the media predicts he'll do in the caucuses next Monday. \"Folks, we are one week away, one week from tonight the Iowa caucuses—tonight is sort of a practice for the caucuses,\" Huckabee said. Not that Josh Turner will be at the caucuses singing at all 800 locations and not that Jim Labriola will be there. But I hope you'll be there. One of the things, I don't know if it ticks you off, but the media from the east coast has already figured out who you're going to vote for. They've already told you who you're going to vote for. Why is it that every four years they're wrong? They have been since Jimmy Carter won the Iowa caucuses all the way back in the 70s—nobody saw that coming. Time after time after time, the people of Iowa have made up their own minds. Once again, we are believing that something very surprising will happen a week from tonight. The media will once again have it wrong and we are going to have the opportunity to shock the nation and launch from Iowa on to the White House. The crowd cheered again. Alabama Secretary of State John H. Merrill, who endorsed Huckabee for president and joined his team at Wooly's on Monday night, told Breitbart News backstage that he's backing Huckabee because he's a strong Christian conservative.\n\"Cindy and I—my wife—we've been very, very fortunate to meet all of the candidates that are running because as part of the SEC primary we've been able to host all of the candidates that come down to Alabama,\" Merrill told Breitbart News. Every time that we met one and we started at the Red State Gathering in Atlanta, and we've had personal interaction time with each one of them, we always found ourselves comparing each one of them to Mike Huckabee. How do we like this guy as compared to Gov. Huckabee? We couldn't find anybody that we had more confidence in, had more faith in or believed in stronger than we did in Gov. Huckabee. So we just made a commitment that we were going to offer our support to other candidates as they come to Alabama because of my role but my personal endorsement and personal support has been with Gov. Huckabee. We've made phone calls, visits, we've come to Iowa to campaign with him for this last week. We're just honored to be with him—because what I want in my president is I want a committed conservative Christian who believes that Jesus Christ is the living son of the living God who has Christ as a center point for his life and I want that person to be someone who has proven to me to be a conservative fiscal manager, a conservative moral leader, a conservative leader in our government who is a strong manager and Gov. Huckabee has proven that as a very conservative governor of a Democrat state. Merrill added that he's confident Huckabee will do a lot better than the media predictions have him doing. \"So the question comes, why are you helping somebody who can't win?\" Merrill said. That's what everybody says—why are you for Mike Huckabee?—and this is what I say 'if everybody who thinks that Mike Huckabee would be a good president supports Mike Huckabee, he'll be the next president.' So for me, not doing it because I didn't believe he could make it would mean that I didn't believe enough in the future of our government and what I expect the government to be. So I have to be one of those people that steps up and says I support this guy because this guy is the kind of guy we need. Merrill, who's been in Iowa with Huckabee for just two days so far, told Breitbart News too that \"there's no doubt about it to me\" that the energy for Huckabee ahead of the 2016 caucuses is stronger than what's showing up in the mainstream media. He continued, \"So what has to happen—the caucus vote is just like it is on any election—who gets their people out?\" Merrill said. \"So if we can get our team out to the caucuses on Monday, our team supports our guy, then our guy can finish in the top three. If our guy finishes in the top three, all bets are off. If he makes it to South Carolina, he'll win South Carolina. And if he wins South Carolina, he'll win the SEC primary. And if he wins the SEC primary, then he's on his way to the nomination.\" And if that scenario plays out for Huckabee, Merrill notes, \"he's the only one that's running as a Republican that defeated the Clintons not just once but several times.\" As such, that's why when Huckabee was on stage, he pushed for his supporters to show up at the caucuses for him since most of the politicians in Washington, D.C., don't care about American workers like them. I know there are lots of choices in this election, I get that there are 327 Republicans running now—I would simply say to you in all seriousness, one of the things that I think makes this year's voter so angry is that it seems to not matter whether Democrats or Republicans are occupying Washington,\" Huckabee said. \"It's the same stuff. Which is always for their best interest and never for yours. Many of you work all day standing on your feet all day working on a concrete floor. You lift heavy things. You sweat to do what you do. Somehow it just seems like to the folks that make the decisions that they end up making decisions that ship your jobs to Mexico or to China or to Indonesia. [They have] no idea how hard you're working or what little you have to show for it thanks to policies that have turned into six of the richest counties in America being right around Washington, D.C.\n\"Huckabee announces Wednesday campaign events\" — The Des Moines Register ... Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee has announced his campaign events for Wednesday. The events, which are free and open to the public, include: Des Moines: 8:30 to 9 a.m., address at the Iowa Pork Producers Association's \"Pork Congress Forum,\" Iowa Events Center Hy-Vee Hall, 730 Third St.; Marshalltown: 10:15 to 11:30 a.m., meet and greet, Marshalltown Senior Citizens Center, 20 E. State St.; Ames: 12:30 to 2 p.m., meet and greet, Jeff's Pizza Shop, 2402 Lincoln Way.; Boone: 5:30 to 7 p.m., meet and greet, Saints Avenue Café, 1312 S.Story St.\n\"Huckabee pans power of polls\" — The Gazette... the former governor of Arkansas and 2008 Iowa caucuses winner has a point when he argues that polling is becoming too powerful in shaping the presidential campaign, from media coverage to candidate debates. The need for a campaign focused on ideas and issues, Huckabee contends, is being swallowed in a sea of survey-driven spectacle. Huckabee, who met with our editorial board Monday, compared our current politics to people who watch NASCAR races mainly to see spectacular wrecks. \"I'm really fearful that we've created a situation where people are watching this election cycle for the wrecks, not for the performance of the cars,\" he said. It's a vicious vortex of polls, celebrity and TV ratings. Polls are used to limit and position candidates on the main stage at televised debates, where, as he puts it, \"it's all about the circus.\" Moderators ask questions designed more to spark conflict and stoke ratings than to chart a course for the country. And in this election cycle, candidates who excel at making a spectacle tend to climb in the polls, grab the spotlight and command center stage... \"Well, first I'm going to come over there and punch you in the nose and get a lot of publicity, and people will love me for that and my poll numbers will go up.\" If only Huckabee had done it, he might be a contender. This is, clearly, the polling-est campaign I've ever seen. When the Republican front-runner spends remarkably long stretches of his public bloviations lauding his amazing poll numbers and denigrating polls that don't show his lead as adequately yuge, something's seriously amiss….\n\"Huckabee to Screen 'God's Not Dead 2' For Voters in Iowa On Eve of Caucuses\" — Townhall.com ... Many would argue that Gov. Mike Huckabee's (R-AR) strongest issue on the campaign trail is his fight for religious freedom. In his pursuit of defending Americans' right to worship, the presidential candidate announced Tuesday that he will be showing a screening of the new film God's Not Dead 2 this Sunday on the eve of the Iowa caucuses. While the original movie centered on a student's courage to stand up to his atheist teacher, the sequel, out April 1, follows a high school teacher who is forced to defend her Christian faith in the courtroom after daring to speak the name Jesus in her classroom. Huckabee makes a cameo in the powerful story. In 2014, God's Not Dead stunned the box office by becoming the highest grossing independent faith film of the year, proving audiences were hungry for its message. In a statement, Huckabee explained why he is eager to bring the second installment to Iowa voters: \"The success of GOD'S NOT DEAD stunned Hollywood, but not the people of middle America,\" Huckabee said. \"On the eve of the Iowa caucuses, this screening will be a great opportunity for people in Iowa to be among the first in the nation to see the film before it gets to theaters and be reminded why this election is so important to preserving religious liberty. Since there is limited seating, we hope people contact us early to be there.\" \"Christians across the United States feel like their voice has been taken,\" saysGod's Not Dead 2 Director Harold Cronk. His film will answer the question: What is really at risk?\n\"Report: Republican Strategist Henry Barbour Wants Mike Huckabee To Attack Ted Cruz\" — Breitbart ... Establishment Republicans and donors are seeking to coalesce around whichever candidate is not Donald Trump or Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), according to the New York Times. One influential Republican strategist says he wants to see former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee to go after Cruz. \"Whoever is not named Trump and not named Cruz that looks strong out of both Iowa and New Hampshire, we should consolidate around,\" said veteran Republican strategist Henry Barbour….\nHuckabee: Iowa caucuses' grassroots impact in danger — Globe Gazette ... ANKENY, Iowa — Mike Huckabee said he fears a poor showing for him in Monday's Republican presidential caucuses could portend an end to Iowa's first-in-the-nation influence. Huckabee, speaking to reporters Tuesday after giving an address at Faith Baptist Bible College, said the caucuses historically have rewarded candidates who campaign on the ground, visiting as many areas of Iowa as possible and shaking as many Iowans' hands as possible. Huckabee, who won the 2008 caucuses, has resumed that style of retail politics this year, visiting each of Iowa's 99 counties and holding 138 campaign events since April, according to Drake University's Iowa Caucus Project... Huckabee said if candidates learn they can win the Iowa caucuses without spending time on the ground here, the presidential nominating process will be dominated by big-money donors, not voters. \"It always has paid off. There's never been an Iowa caucus in which people could win (taking) the shortcut. If they can this year, I think it's the end of the Iowa caucus as we know it,\" Huckabee said. \"Because if in the future a candidate can go to Wall Street, go to the big banks, raise a bunch of money, come down here and throw some TV ads together, make a few appearances, just enough to say we were here, put a flag down, if they can win that way then why will candidates go and do what I've done, which is to go to all 99 counties and do the grassroots, person-to-person approach? They won't.\" Huckabee said if presidential candidates learn they can win Iowa without devoting time on the ground, the presidential primary will become a race more about who can garner the most money to spend on advertising. \"It will become a process like any other, and they people will spend their time in New York, California, Texas and Florida getting money. And it'll be a shame,\" Huckabee said. \"The real losers are the American people who won't have the benefit of somebody filtering these candidates through the questions and the lenses of farmers and housewives and factory workers. Where else in America do candidates have to be held accountable in this kind of setting, face to face? I think that could be a real tragedy for the country.\" Unlike other presidential candidates who have spoken here, Huckabee's address Tuesday to roughly 200 Faith Baptist Bible College students was more sermon than campaign speech. He challenged students to stand up for Christian values in a world in which he said Christianity is being \"virtually criminalized.\" \"If you think the world in which you live is a morally dark world, then all the more reason for you to be the light of the world,\" Huckabee said. \"If you are unwilling to be the light, then darkness will prevail.\"\nFox News—Justice With Judge Jeanine\n...From the campaign trail in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Republican Presidential Candidate Governor Mike Huckabee. Good evening, Governor...How's it going out there for you? [Huckabee] \"Well, it's going great. We're in the middle of a 150-event month in January. Just in Iowa. So I don't think anybody can say that we are rolling over, giving up or slowing down…Oh, absolutely. People forget that for 40 years, the Iowa caucus has always produced big surprises. And the people that were absolutely touted by the East Coast media usually don't win. And the winner ends up being somebody that they had not factored in. And I think we're going to see a surprise February 1st…Oh, the evangelicals have never been a monolithic group. I think it's one of the greatest myths that has existed in Republican politics. Evangelicals don't always vote according to a predictable pattern. I didn't really have an overwhelming Evangelical vote even eight years ago. I had a lot of rank-and-file working-class people.

{"author": "Bernie Sanders", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117514", "text": "AUDIENCE: Bernie! Bernie! Bernie! Bernie!\nSANDERS: Thank you.\nWell, let me -- let begin by thanking you for inviting me to be with you today, thanking Steve for his introduction, and most of all, thanking the steelworkers for their long, long support of what I've been trying to do throughout my entire political career.\nI don't get any money and I don't want any money from corporations. Never got a nickel. [applause]\nDon't want any money from the billionaire class. [applause]\nBut I am very grateful for the support that I've received from the steelworkers throughout my entire political career. Thank you, guys, very, very much. [applause]\nWhen I went to college, I studied some economics, but the real economic lesson that I learned was when I was a kid. I grew up in a home where my dad had come from Poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket. Never made much money. Mother graduated high school. I lived in a three-and-a-half room rent-controlled apartment in Brooklyn, New York, and we lived not poor, but our family lived on the financial stress as is the case with millions and millions of families in our country today.\nSo the major economics lesson that I have had in my life was not in high school and not in college, it was as a kid understanding what financial stress does to a family, understanding that every decision that is made has got to be thought about, whether you can afford to do this or whether you can afford to do that. And that, brothers and sisters, is a lesson I have never forgotten and I never will forget. [applause]\nYou know, one of the reasons I think our campaign is doing well is because we try to talk about the real issues impacting the American people. Don't do necessarily do what the media wants us to do, but talk about real issues.\nJust turned out yesterday -- just happened. We were in Iowa Falls, had a few hundred people out to a meeting. And I kind of opened up the discussion to ask people what was going on in their lives, what was going on in their lives in terms of trying to make it on $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security. And suddenly what was it like in their lives if you can't afford the prescription drugs that you need. And I want to thank the nurses, our sisters and brothers; are there nurses here? [applause] Who know these issues, who know what it means to be treating patients who can't afford prescriptions. And I opened it up, the discussion. One woman gets up there and says the medicine her family need -- I think it was her husband needed -- shot way up, shot way up to an outrageous price. And we all know that tomorrow, if you walk into a drug store to refill your prescription, the price could be double or triple than what was paid today. Some of you have that experience, right? Because the pharmaceutical industry is ripping off the American people. [applause]\nSo people talk -- we don't have a lot of money. The cost of prescription drugs goes way up. Then another woman says -- you know, I was using the point -- making the point, millions of people in this country -- we don't talk about it terribly much -- trying to get by on $12,000, $13,000 a year on Social Security. You do the arithmetic. Tell me how you pay for health care. Tell me how you pay for prescription drugs. How do you heat your home. How do you buy the food you need on $12,000 or $13,000 a year? And the answer is exactly right, you don't. You don't. [applause]\nAnd then we got Republicans going around the country lying, as they occasionally do...[laughter]...and they're saying Social Security is going broke. We have to cut Social Security benefits.\nAUDIENCE: No!\nSANDERS: Now, just stop and think about it. Forget politics. Tell me how somebody can go around the country when we know that millions of people -- seniors, disabled vets, people with disabilities, people who can't make it on $1,000, $13,000 a year, and they're talking about cutting Social Security benefits.\nThere's a thing that a lot of people have not heard of. It's called the chain CPI. Anybody know what the chain CPI is? It's a fancy term from Washington to cut Social Security benefits, and it argues, the theory behind it is that the COLAs, the cost-of-living adjustments that seniors are getting today are too generous. Does anybody here know what seniors got in their COLA last year?\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Zero!\nSANDERS: Zero! Too generous. Got to cut it. Anyhow, at Iowa Falls we heard from people who told us no, I'm not getting $12,000, $13,000 a year, I'm trying to live on $10,000 a year.\nAnd then we heard another woman talk about what it means to have minimum wage jobs and how difficult it is to survive. And that is the reality for millions and millions of people in this country. It's a reality we don't talk enough about and it's certainly a reality that we are not effectively addressing.\nNow, here's the story. If we were a poor country -- and there are poor countries around the world -- you have a certain type of discussion. And you say, you know, it's unfortunate that we have to live in poverty, but that's who we are. We're a poor country. We can't have good education, we can't have good health care, we can't have decent paying jobs. We're a poor country.\nBut the truth is, as everybody here knows, the United States of America is not a poor country. We are the wealthiest country in the history of the world. But -- but most people don't know that because almost all of the new wealth and income is going to the top 1 percent.\nAnd brothers and sisters, what a Sanders administration is about is a very radical idea. You ready for a radical idea? We're going to create an economy that works for working families, not just billionaires. [applause]\nAnd not only that. In the last 30 years, as everybody in this room knows, technology has exploded. Almost every worker in America is more productive than he or she was 20 years, 30 years ago, right? You're producing more.\nQuestion. If you are more productive, if we are producing more, why are millions of people working longer hours for lower wages?\nAUDIENCE: Greed!\nSANDERS: Why is almost all new income and wealth going to a small number of people?\nAUDIENCE: Greed!\nSANDERS: You guys are a smart group here. All right. and that's what we're going to deal with. So we are going to tell billionaires who pay an effective tax rate lower than many of you do, we're going to tell large multi-national corporations who make billions of dollars a year in profit and stash their money in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year may pay zero in federal income taxes, we're going to tell them that it is time for them to accept their responsibility as Americans to start paying their fair share of taxes. [applause]\nAnd when we eliminate the Cayman Islands loophole and when we raise a trillion dollars in new revenue, you know what we're going to do with that? We're going to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and create millions of decent paying jobs. [applause]\nThis is the United States of America, the greatest country on the face of the Earth. You tell me why our roads, our bridges, our water systems, our waste water plants, our levees, our dams, our airports, our rail system are deteriorating or crumbling?\nAUDIENCE: Republicans! [laughter]\nSANDERS: All right. We need to invest in a $1 trillion investment, which I believe we should make, creates 13 million decent paying jobs. [applause]\nIncluding a lot of good steelworker jobs. [applause]\nNow, every person in this room -- because of the steelworkers or one of the great unions in our country, you understand the history of the trade union movement. And you understand that change, real change, never comes from the top on down. It always comes from the bottom on up. [applause]\nAnd you understand that way back when employers did not say, \"Well, you know, I think it's a great idea for workers to have a union. We'd love to sit down and do some collective bargaining with you because we think that's fair and that's right.\" That's not the way it happened.\nThe way it happened is way back when, workers went on strike, workers fought and workers died, workers were beaten, workers were fired from their jobs in order to make sure that working people could organize, could engage in collective bargaining, could sit down at a table and fight for decent wages and decent working conditions.\nThat's the history of the trade union movement and we should be proud of that. But what all of you know is that over the last several decades, despite the fact that millions of workers want to join a union, it has become harder and harder for workers to in fact create unions, to become members of unions.\nYou know and I know that employers have acted illegally with the support of the NLRB so that if workers tried to organize, the organizers there would be fired, and if by some miracle people actually did organize a union, employers would refuse to engage in a first contract, collective bargaining, [inaudible]. And that is why I believe that the middle class does not grow unless the trade union movement grows. [applause]\nThe middle class does not prosper unless workers are engaged in strong collective bargaining. Now... [applause]\nNow, what a lot of people -- what a lot of non-union people don't understand is that to the degree they get anywhere near decent wages -- decent wages, it has a lot to do with the success of the trade union movement because you're driving wages up. [applause]\nIn any case, after decades of illegal action on the part of employers, it seems to me we have got to make it easier, not harder for workers to join unions. That's why we have introduced a new FCOP piece of legislation, and it says very simply that if 50 percent of workers in a unit plus one sign a card saying they want to be in a union, they will have a union. [applause]\nHere's the truth. Here's the truth. Not going to tell you that every worker in America wants to join a union, but what I will tell you is that millions of them do. Millions of them understand that workers who have a union get better wages, better working conditions and better benefits. And our job is to say that the American people must be able to exercise their constitutional right to organize unions without illegal impediments on the part of employers, and that is what I intend to do. [applause]\nI mentioned earlier that there are millions of seniors and disabled veterans in this country. And by the way, as the former chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, let me thank all of the men and women in this room and in this country for their service to our country. [applause]\nFor their putting their lives on the line to defend this country. And here's a promise I make, is that we will do our best, absolute best, and there should not be any debate about this whether you're a conservative, progressive, Democrat or Republican. When people put their lives on the line to defend this country and they come home, they are going to get the best health care available. They're going to get the benefits that they earned. [applause]\nBut here's the difference that Secretary Clinton and I have on a very important issue. I believe that when millions of seniors and disabled vets are struggling to get by on $12,000 or $13,000 a year, it is not good enough to say -- and I've led the effort on this, that we're not going to cut Social Security. That is an abomination. What we must do is say, \"Of course we're not going to cut Social Security, but we are going to expand Social Security benefits.\" [applause]\nAnd here is how we are going to do it. It is not complicated. Right now, somebody makes $5 million a year, somebody makes $118,000 a year, they both contribute the same amount into the Social Security trust fund.\nIf you lift that cap and you start at $250,000 and above, top 1.5 percent of the American people, what we can do is increase Social Security benefits for those now living under $16,000 a year by $1,300 a year. That's not insignificant for people who are struggling. [applause]\nAnd when we do that, we also extend the life of Social Security from 19 years to 50 years. Now, that is my view. I think -- I think that at a time of massive income and wealth inequality, when the wealthy are getting much wealthier, you know what? I think it is just appropriate, just right to lift that cap, and ask the wealthiest people in this country to make sure that all seniors can live in dignity. [applause]\nThat is my view, if Secretary Clinton drops in, ask her her view. I don't think she agrees.\nNow, when we talk -- and Steve raised this issue. When we talk about why it is that the great middle class of this country is disappearing, why it is that we have 47 million people living in poverty, why it is that we have massive wealth and income inequality, one of the important reasons is our disastrous trade policies. [applause] You are looking at a former United States congressman. I represented Vermont in the Congress for 16 years, and a senator today. You are looking at a member of the Senate, who in his life, voted against NAFTA, against CAFTA, against PNTR with China. [applause]\nAnd by the way, is helping to lead the opposition to the TPP. Now... [applause]\nLook -- look, everybody in this room understands what these disastrous trade agreements are about. You all know who wrote these trade agreements. Not complicated.\nThe steelworkers did not write these trade agreements. They are written by corporate America to benefit corporate America, people who could care less about what these trade agreements did to working families.\nHere's what they've done. Since 2001 in America, we have lost 60,000 factories. Got that? In my state, in Iowa, all across this country -- 60,000 factories. Not all of that, to be fair, is attributable to trade. There are other reasons why factories shut down, but a lot of it is attributable to trade. And when you lose 60,000 factories, many of them attributable to disastrous trade agreements, you're talking about the loss of millions of good-paying American jobs. [applause]\nEverybody knows what the purpose of these trade agreements were supposed to do. They did exactly what corporate America wanted them to do -- what they were designed to do is to say, why should we pay workers in the United States $20, $25, $30 an hour, provide decent benefits, negotiate with unions, protect the environment, why would any corporation want to do that when they could shut down in America, throw people out on the street, move to China, move to Mexico, move to low-wage countries, pay people pennies an hour, not have to worry about the environment, not have to do deal with unions and then they can bring their products right back in this country?\nAUDIENCE: Greed!\nSANDERS: The simple truth is, and it's indisputable, these trade agreements have been a disaster for working families in this country. They have benefited the CEOs of large multinational corporations. No one can deny that reality.\nI am proud to tell you that way back when I was on the picket line in opposition to NAFTA and helped lead the opposition against all of these trade agreements. But I got to tell you also, these trade agreements have been supported not just by Republicans but by some Democrats as well. We've got to acknowledge that.\nWhere we are today is to say that when our country is de- industrializing -- do you know what I mean by that? What I mean, you tell me how are we a great nation if we're not purchasing the products that we need that are made in our country? Can you be a great country? Can you be a great country where everything you buy is made in China? I don't think so. I don't think so.\nAnd by the way -- this is another important point to be made. It is not only the loss of jobs, it is what we call the race to the bottom. So here's what's going on. People are saying -- and this is a good thing -- people are saying, well, you know what? We're seeing an uptick in manufacturing in America. Good. Take a look at the wages that those new manufacturing jobs are paying.\nThere was once a time when manufacturing jobs, unionized manufacturing jobs, were the gold standard for the working class of this country. You had a good job in a manufacturing plant, you had a union, you were making middle-class wages and middle-class benefits. But then -- I'll tell you a story. A couple years ago in Louisville, Kentucky, General Electric announced that they were expanding their manufacturing capabilities, creating a couple hundred jobs. Some people were very excited about it. And they asked this guy from GE, they said, why are you doing this? He said, well, it turns out that if you add all of the these things together, transportation costs and the fact that wages in America have gone down, it is actually more competitive to do manufacturing in America now than in China because wages have gone down so much. So they're paying people in manufacturing $10, $12 an hour.\nNow, if manufacturing workers are getting paid $10, $12 an hour, what do you think other workers are going to be getting? This is the race to the bottom, what they have always wanted. Not to bring Chinese wages up to where we were, it's to bring our wages down to where Chinese wages were. [applause]\nSo this TPP; they want us to support the TPP. They want our people to compete against workers in Vietnam. I have nothing against workers in Vietnam. I was there, they work very hard. Minimum wage in Vietnam is 65 cents an hour. I do not want American workers to have to compete against people who are making 65 cents an hour. [applause]\nSo we have to take a deep breath. We have to understand that our trade policies have failed and we have to begin an entirely new set of policies. And the bottom line for me is that every major corporation in America wants all of us to buy their products. Can't turn on the TV, buy this, buy that, buy that. Well, if they want us to buy their products, they damn well better start manufacturing those products back in the United States and not in China. [applause]\nLet me touch on another important issue and I'm glad our brothers and sisters from the nurses union -- and we thank you so much for your support. [applause]\nThe reason that the nurses are supporting our campaign is that these are serious people who want to be able to do their job as well as they can. All right. Thank you job is to prevent disease. Their job is to take care of people who are sick. But right now they and many, many other people in the health care profession are unable to do the job that they were trained to do.\nNow, I think the Affordable Care Act has made some important steps forward and one important step forward that we are not going to allow to go forward is the so-called Cadillac Tax. We have delayed that and we will continue to push that back. Workers who gave up wage increases and other benefits for decent health care should not be penalized for those sacrifices. [applause]\nBut the Affordable Care Act, which I voted for and strongly supported, did a couple -- number of good things. It did away with this obscenity called pre-existing conditions. You all know what that is? [applause]\nThis private insurance obscenity which said if you had a disease years ago, they would not cover you for the disease that you needed coverage for. It's like getting fire insurance except that if you have a fire, then they don't pay. We got rid of that.\nWe have expanded health insurance to some 17 million Americans. We have made it fairer for women who are forced to pay higher rates than they should have for the crime of being a woman. So we kind of eliminated that. But having said that, here's the reality of health care today. And what our campaign is about is asking the American people to think big, not small. Here we are.\nThe United States of America today is the only major country on earth -- the only one, that doesn't guarantee health care to all people as a right. They do it in England. They do it in France, do it in Germany, do it all over Scandinavia. I live 50 miles away from the Canadian border, they do it.\nEvery major country does it. In America today, 29 million people today have no health insurance at all. Millions more have high deductibles and high co-payments. Sound familiar? OK. And by the way, we pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.\nAt a time when one in five Americans are unable to afford the prescription drugs their doctors are prescribing, at a time when seniors are cutting their pills in half because they can't afford to buy what they need, the three major drug companies in America last year made $45 billion in profit.\nAnd because they are so powerful, because they provide hundreds of millions of dollars in lobbying and campaign contributions, because they have 1,400 lobbyists in Washington, D.C., there is no legislation on the books to prevent them from doubling, tripling, quadrupling the price you pay for medicine. They are getting away with murder and in some cases, they are committing murder. [applause]\nWe hear from oncologists who are hearing from cancer patients and they're telling us our cancer patients can't afford the medicine that they need. We are dealing in some cases with folks who have Hepatitis C. A new drug, a very effective drug out, do you know what that costs? A thousand dollars a pill.\nWhat we have got to tell the pharmaceutical industry -- now, let me back up and tell you a story for a minute. Late 1990s, when I represented Vermont in the Congress, I took a bus load of women from northern Vermont over the Canadian border to Montreal.\nAnd the reason we went is that I knew is that prescription drugs in Canada were much less expensive. Women who were dealing with breast cancer, working class women, walked into the pharmacy. They purchased the breast cancer medicine that they needed -- this is not generic, brand name medicine for one-tenth the price they're paying in the United States.\nI was the first member of Congress to do that. Others followed. Now millions of people, by the way, get their medicine from Canada. We should not have to get medicine from Canada. Pharmaceutical industry has got to stop ripping us off. [applause]\nNow, when you got 29 million uninsured, even more underinsured, when we're paying the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, it turns out that we are spending per person in health care almost three times more than they do in the United Kingdom where they guarantee health care to all of their people. We are spending 50 percent more than the French who guarantee health care to all of their people, much more than the Canadians who guarantee all of -- health care to all of their people.\nIt seems to me that the time is now for us to say loudly and clearly that in the United States of America, health care is a right for all people. [applause]\nAnd we are going to pass a Medicare for all single payer programs. [applause]\nAnd when we do that -- when we do that, not only do we make the nurses and the doctors' jobs easier, because they're going to be able to treat everybody in a comprehensive way, we're going to save the middle class many thousands of dollars a year on health care costs. [applause]\nWe began our campaign for the presidency of the United States nine months ago, and when we began it, I think we were at three, four percent in the polls. We didn't have any money. We didn't have any organization, and frankly, not so many people outside of Vermont knew who Bernie Sanders was. But the message that we have been bringing forth to the American people, a message which says that the economy today is rigged, that it benefits the wealthy and the powerful at the expense of everybody else, that the campaign finance system that exists today is corrupt and undermining American democracy... [applause]\nThat message is resonating all across this country. And here we are in Iowa, and one week from yesterday there will be the first caucus in the country. I believe that we have an excellent chance to win that caucus if -- and here is the if. If we have a large voter turnout. [applause]\nIt is going to be a very, very close election, but I believe that if working people want to be part of a campaign which says enough is enough, our government has got to represent all of us and not a handful of campaign contributors, if those people come out and vote, we will win and we'll win big. [applause]\nLet me also say this. Let me also say this. This campaign is different from other campaigns, not just because of the fact that I am perhaps the most progressive member of the Senate and my agenda in this campaign is the most progressive. This campaign is more than that. And that is what I say every single day and I repeat to you now from the bottom of my heart. No president, not Bernie Sanders, not anybody else, can do it alone. All right? [applause]\nNow, I want to tell you a painful truth that you understand as proud trade unionists, but not all people in America understand. And that is the powers that be -- Wall Street, whose greed and recklessness and illegal behavior brought this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, they have endless supplies of money, endless.\nIn fact, somebody on Wall Street now, I think just announced is going to spend $600,000 in ads against me here in Iowa this week -- $600,000 from one guy.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Give them hell, Bernie!\nSANDERS: We surely will. [applause]\nSo, you got the power of Wall Street. I want to remind you something about Wall Street. You know, Congress, against my vote, helped to bail them out because the banks were too big to fail. You remember that?\nWell, you won't be shocked to know that three out of the four largest banks in this country are bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail.\nAnd you know what I think? When you have a handful of huge financial institutions with incredible economic and political power, maybe it is time we broke them up. [applause]\nBut it's not just Wall Street. You deal all of the time with corporate America, whose greed, whose unquenchable greed, they want more and more and more, and they are prepared to step on every working person in this country to get more and more and more. We got to take them on. Got to take on the corporate media that decides what we see and what we hear.\nWe got to take on the large campaign contributors. That's not an easy fight, and no one president alone can do it. And that is why, what this campaign is about is a political revolution. [applause]\nWe need trade unionists. We need millions of people to stand up and be involved in the political process in a way that we have not seen for a very, very long time. What we are fighting for, brothers and sisters, is not only for our well-being, we are fighting for our kids. We are fighting for our parents. We are fighting for the planet.\nThis is a fight that we cannot afford to lose. And together we will not lose.\nThank you very much.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118052", "text": "\"And for Americans short of retirement, basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything else is today. Even if he's going from job to job, he should still be able to save for retirement and take his savings with him.\"\n- President Obama, State of the Union 2016\nIn his State of the Union address, the President made clear that more Americans should have the ability to save for retirement at work - and the ability to take their savings with them as they move from job to job. While Social Security remains a rock-solid guaranteed benefit that every American can rely on, Americans are increasingly responsible for their own retirement security. No longer do many workers spend their entire career with one company that will provide them a pension in retirement. Rather, as traditional notions of work and lifetime employment change, too many Americans risk not having the resources to enjoy their retirement after a lifetime of hard work. These changes require us to rethink and rework our safety net to better protect workers.\nThe President's proposals - which will be detailed further in his FY2017 Budget - aim to ensure near universal access to workplace retirement savings accounts and put us on a path to a more portable retirement benefits by testing what works. That includes steps to:\n• Expand access to workplace retirement savings opportunities by encouraging more employers to offer plans and making it easier for workers to participate:\no Enabling small businesses to come together and create pooled 401(k) plans, at lower cost and with less burden than going it alone;\no Automatically enrolling workers without access to a workplace plan in an IRA;\no Providing tax credits for small businesses that begin offering retirement plans, or choose to automatically enroll workers in existing plans; and\no Allowing long-term, part-time workers to participate in their employer's plan.\n• Provide a path forward to more portable retirement benefits by:\no Piloting innovative, more portable approaches to provide retirement and other important employment-based benefits;\no Evaluating existing portable benefits models, and examining the feasibility of greater change; and\no Helping workers find lost or missing retirement accounts from prior jobs.\n• Build on existing efforts: The Administration has facilitated state efforts to create their own retirement savings options for their citizens, without running afoul of federal law; launched myRA, a simple, safe, no-fee, and portable savings option; issued guidance making it easier for employers to accept rollovers from other 401(k)s; and proposed rules to ensure retirement advisers make recommendations in their customers' best interest.\nExpanding Access to Workplace Retirement Accounts\nAccess to workplace retirement savings plans is key to workers' future economic security. Today, one out of three workers does not have access to a retirement savings plan, including half of workers at firms with fewer than 50 employees and more than three-quarters of part-time workers. In addition, contractors and temporary employees are often unable to participate in employment-based plans. Workers without access to a plan at work rarely save for retirement: fewer than 10 percent of workers without access to a workplace plan contribute to a retirement savings account on their own.\nThe President's proposals would provide more than 30 million people with access to workplace retirement savings options. The proposals would encourage and enable more employers to offer plans such as a 401(k), while creating alternative savings arrangements so workers can save for retirement at work even if their employer does not offer a plan.\n• Make it easier for employers to create pooled 401(k) plans to lower cost and burden. Multiple employer plans (MEPs) already allow employers with a \"common bond\" to form a pooled retirement plan, offering benefits through the same administrative structure but with lower costs and less compliance burden than if each employer offered a separate plan. In his upcoming Budget, the President will for the first time propose to remove the \"common bond\" requirement, enabling employers to take advantage of \"open MEPs\" while adding significant new safeguards to ensure workers are protected. As a result, more small businesses should be able to offer cost-effective, pooled plans to their workers, and certain nonprofits and other intermediaries will be able to create plans for contractors and other self-employed individuals who don't have access to a plan at work. As an added benefit, if an employee moves between employers participating in the same open MEP, or is an independent contractor participating in a pooled plan using the open MEP structure, he can continue contributing to the same plan even if he starts work for a different company.\n• Provide tax cuts for businesses that choose to offer more generous employer plans or switch to auto-enrollment. The President not only wants to make it simpler for small businesses to offer plans, but also more cost effective for them to do so. That's why the President will again propose in his Budget to triple the existing \"startup\" credit, so small employers that newly offer a retirement plan would receive a tax credit of $1,500 per year for up to three years - likely enough to offset administrative expenses. And because auto-enrollment is the most effective way to encourage workers with access to a plan to participate, small employers that already offer a plan and add auto-enrollment would also get a tax credit of $500 per employer per year for up to three years.\n• Expand retirement savings options for long-term, part-time workers. Recognizing that part-time workers are much less likely to have access to a retirement plan, in part because employers are allowed to exclude them from participation, the President will again propose in his Budget to require that employees who have worked for an employer at least 500 hours per year for at least three years be eligible to participate in the employer's existing plan. This simple change would provide an additional one million people with access to retirement plans, and come at minimal cost to employers, as they would not be required to contribute.\nIn addition to encouraging employers to offer traditional retirement plans such as a 401(k), the Administration has taken steps to increase the availability and use of IRAs and help workers save by automatically enrolling them in these accounts.\n• Proposed to automatically enroll workers without access to a workplace plan in an IRA. The President's Budget will include a proposal - included in his past Budgets - that would require employers with more than 10 employees that do not currently offer a retirement plan to automatically enroll their workers in an IRA. Other individuals not automatically enrolled could participate so long as they fall below the income cutoff, and could continue to make their own contributions even if they change jobs. Employers with 100 or less employees who offer an auto-IRA would receive a tax credit of up to $3,000.\n• Issued proposed rule and guidance facilitating state efforts to create their own retirement savings programs. Over the past year, Illinois and Oregon have enacted their own state-level auto-IRAs, while Washington and New Jersey have enacted retirement marketplaces connecting small businesses and their employees to existing investment vehicles. Approximately 20 more states are considering similar measures or an alternative state-based 401(k). To address concerns about preemption by Federal pension law, the Department of Labor has proposed regulations and issued guidance clarifying a legal path forward, and will finalize those regulations later this year.\n• Made myRA available to new savers without access to workplace plans regardless of where they work. This fall, the Department of Treasury fully launched myRA (my Retirement Account), a simple, safe, no-fee, and portable savings option that provides the same principal-protected return available to members of Congress. Individuals can contribute to myRA through payroll deductions at their employers or directly through their bank accounts, and can continue contributing to myRA even if they switch jobs.\nIncreasing Portability of Retirement Savings\nAs we work to expand coverage to more hard-working Americans, we also need to apply the best of American innovation to reinventing our benefits programs to ensure that workers in an increasingly mobile economy can carry their benefits with them across an entire career - or for some workers, across multiple employers at the same time. The Affordable Care Act was a huge step forward, relieving the \"job lock\" that our health insurance system had created for too many. Now when you return to school, or launch a business, you'll still have healthcare coverage.\nBut much work remains to ensure retirement benefits are as mobile as today's workforce. At present, workers who have a workplace retirement savings plan may have to manage a number of retirement accounts left over from prior employers, save in an IRA to which their employer will not contribute, or complete an often burdensome process to move their 401(k) balances from job to job, assuming their new job allows it.\nGood ideas in this area and on portable benefits more broadly have been raised on both sides of the aisle, but new models enabling workers to take their retirement benefits and other important employment-based benefits from job to job are still in their infancy. Today's proposals are designed to lay a foundation for a future expansion of benefits by developing models that work and, once proven, can be taken to scale. That's why the President proposes to:\n• Pilot new, more portable approaches to providing retirement and other important benefits typically offered by employers. The President's Budget will propose demonstration funding for nonprofits and States to design, implement, and evaluate new, innovative approaches to provide more portable retirement and other employer-provided benefit coverage. The goal is to develop and test models that are portable across employers and can accommodate intermittent contributions or contributions from multiple employers for an individual worker. In addition, the Department of Labor will evaluate existing portable benefits models, and examine the feasibility of greater change.\nEmployees should at least be able to consolidate savings from a prior 401(k) into their new 401(k) rather than amassing a stack of accounts throughout their lifetime, but the process of rolling over can be burdensome, and workers often receive bad advice about what to do with their savings. That's why the Administration has taken the following steps under its own authority to promote rollovers between retirement plans and enable people to more easily keep track of their retirement savings.\n• Issued Treasury/IRS guidance making it easier for employers sponsoring a plan to accept rollovers from other employers' 401(k)s or other plans by addressing concerns that incoming rollovers might jeopardize the qualified status of the receiving plan.\n• Proposed new rules to ensure that retirement savers receive advice in their best interest, especially when changing jobs. Employees leaving a job are often advised to take the money out of their 401(k) and put it in an IRA managed by the adviser, rather than rolling the funds over to their new employer's 401(k). While this may be the right step for some savers, such advice is sometimes motivated by the adviser's best interest, rather than the clients. The Department of Labor's proposed conflict of interest rule - which will be finalized later this year - would minimize such conflicts of interest by requiring retirement advisers to provide advice in their clients' best interest.\n• Assisted individuals keep track of retirement accounts terminated by their employer. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation's Missing Participants Program connects participants who could not be located when their defined benefit plan terminated with their unclaimed pension benefits. PBGC will be issuing a proposal to expand the program to help missing participants in terminating defined contribution plans.\n• Enabled savers to access their retirement benefits even if their company goes bankrupt. By the end of the year, the Department of Labor will finalize new rules enabling bankruptcy trustees to more efficiently distribute assets from bankrupt companies' retirement plans, so their employees can access their savings sooner.\nThe federal government's own retirement plan - the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) - is also making it easier for federal employees to roll their prior 401(k) savings into their TSP account. This June, the TSP will issue a request for proposals to, among other things, eventually facilitate rollovers to the TSP by making the service provider, not the participant, responsible for shepherding rollovers.", "timestamp": "2016-01-26", "title": "Fact Sheet: Building a 21st Century Retirement System"}

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111552", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:07 P.M. EST\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Looks like you're all feeling \"the Bern.\" (Laughter.) I do not have any opening statements to make at the top, other than a corny joke. So we can go straight to your questions.\nDarlene, do you want to start?\nQ: Great, thank you. I wanted to follow up a little bit on a meeting the President had yesterday on the Zika virus. I was wondering if the President's approach to the Zika virus is similar -- if he's approaching the spread of the Zika virus similar to the way he approached the spread of Ebola in West Africa. I mean, does he kind of see the U.S. leading some sort of anti-Zika virus effort?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, one thing that's important for people to understand is that there's a pretty significant difference -- a number of significant differences between the Ebola virus and the Zika virus, obviously both in terms of the way they are transmitted, but also in terms of the health impacts. Obviously, Ebola is a deadly disease. The Zika virus poses a different set of risks that are most serious for pregnant women. And that explains the kind of reaction you've seen from the federal government and the kind of guidance that the CDC has shared with Americans who are considering travel to tropical areas -- to a variety of tropical areas in the Western Hemisphere.\nI think the President has spoken at some length about the lessons that we can draw from fighting Ebola, that the value of having a critical health infrastructure in place is critical to positive public health outcomes. He's talked about the unique role that the United States can play in mobilizing an international response to diseases like this that do pose a broader public health risk. And we're certainly mindful of all of that as we consider the risk that is posed by the Zika virus.\nMost of our efforts right now, however, are focused on sharing information with the public about steps that they can take to protect themselves. And again, this is a risk that is most acute for pregnant women, or women who are planning to become pregnant. For people who are not pregnant, men and women, the Zika virus is basically a mild, non-fatal form of Dengue fever. And the most common symptoms are things like a mild fever, a rash, or conjunctivitis. That said, studies show that only about one in five people who get Zika will have any symptoms.\nBut what we are primarily concerned about is the link that is apparent between a particular birth defect in women who have contracted the Zika virus.\nSo I would anticipate in the days ahead that you'll see more of a conspicuous, concerted effort on the part of the U.S. government to communicate with the American people about the risks of this virus and the steps that they can take to protect themselves.\nQ: And then the statement that you all released last night after the meeting said the President emphasized the need to accelerate research to make available better diagnostic tests, vaccine development, and again, public information. Do you anticipate the President asking for any additional money to do any of the things that were just cited here, for research or vaccine development?\nMR. EARNEST: There's no specific request that I'm prepared to make from here today. But mobilizing the kind of response that may be necessary certainly could require additional funding, but I would also expect that the kind of funding that we would envision would at least in part be useful in building up the broader public health infrastructure that would have benefits in fighting a variety of diseases.\nQ: And then to switch over to \"the Bern\" -- (laughter) -- did you --\nMR. EARNEST: You guys laugh when she says it. (Laughter.) And I get groans when I say it.\nQ: She's funny. (Laughter.)\nQ: Did you have a chance to hear any of what the Senator said outside after the meeting?\nMR. EARNEST: I did.\nQ: He seemed very complimentary towards the President, almost embracing the President. Was there any early feedback from the President on how he thought the meeting went?\nMR. EARNEST: Obviously, the meeting had just ended before I came out here. I did not speak to the President about the meeting.\nBut look, the two men spent about 45 minutes together. It was, as Senator Sanders said, a one-on-one meeting. And the President was certainly expecting to spend some time talking in the meeting about how they could work together to advance Democratic priorities and values. That's work that they've obviously done in the past, and that's work that the President hopes they can do together in the future.\nObviously, Senator Sanders, as he noted to all of you, is a part of a very active campaign right now, and he's spending a lot of time on the campaign trail and clearly is enjoying the kind of response that he's getting from large crowds all across the country -- not just in Iowa, but in other places, including Minnesota.\nObviously, when the President spent some time on the campaign trail, he had the experience of drawing some big crowds and he enjoyed that experience. And I think there was -- I would anticipate there was an opportunity for the President to reminisce a little bit about his own experience campaigning for President, both in terms of drawing big crowds but also spending some time talking to people in more out-of-the-way places where the crowds are not as large but the interactions do allow for a more personal, private conversation.\nAnd the President, even as he has served in office, has talked about how those kinds of opportunities are fewer and farther between when you're President of the United States; that you do sort of live in a bubble. And the President is constantly looking for creative ways to get out of it. And when you spend time on the campaign trail running for President, you're necessarily going to spend some time interacting with individuals one on one. And the President certainly enjoyed that opportunity as a candidate and has talked a lot about how he wishes he could do more of it as President.\nThe last thing I'll say about this -- and this is something that the President expected to talk about in the meeting and Senator Sanders alluded to this as well -- it's good for the Democratic Party for there to be such a robust debate going on about who should be our party's nominee. That debate is good for our democracy, it's also good for the party. And in the context of that debate, Senator Sanders has had great success in engaging and even inspiring a large segment of the Democratic Party.\nThat ability to engage Democrats and excite them and inspire them will be critical to the success of Democrats up and down the ballot, whether Senator Sanders is a nominee or not. And it underscores that while there is an important debate going on inside the Democratic Party, the real difference lies between Republicans who advocate for the kinds of economic policies that mostly benefit the wealthy and well-connected, and led us to the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, and Democrats who continue to believe that our government policies should be focused on expanding economic opportunity for everybody, especially those in the middle class and those who are working hard to get into the middle class.\nAnd that's an important part of the debate, and that's a debate that you're hearing on the campaign trail now, but that is a debate that will really crystallize in the context of a general election later this year. And while, as Senator Sanders noted, the President is doing his best to allow the candidates to make their own case in the Democratic Primary process, he expects to be very actively and personally engaged in the general election to support those candidates that actually are interested in building on the progress that this country has made in the seven years of his presidency.\nAyesha.\nQ: One more on the meeting with Bernie Sanders. Who called for the meeting? And then also, he has put a hold on the nominee to lead the FDA, saying that he has too close ties to the pharmaceutical industry. And I was wondering, did that come up in the meeting? Was that a plan to come up in the meeting? Has the White House at all been trying to work with him to get him to lift that hold on your nominee?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me go to your first question first. The President and Senator Sanders had the opportunity to visit at the congressional holiday ball here at the White House last month. And at the party, Senator Sanders noted to the President that he'd like to have the opportunity to sit down for a more formal meeting. And the President agreed that would be a good idea, and we've been working to set up this making for more than a month now.\nObviously, the President has had a pretty busy schedule over the last couple weeks, and Senator Sanders has, too. But this is a meeting that came together in the last week or two. And the President was pleased to have the opportunity to sit down with Senator Sanders today.\nI don't know whether or not the President's nominee to be the next leader of the FDA came up in the context of this meeting. Obviously, the President and the administration have full confidence in the ability of our nominee to make the kinds of decisions that are in the best interest of the health and safety of the American people. The President would not have nominated him to the job if he didn't think that he would be able to effectively look out for the interests of middle-class families in that role.\nQ: Going back to the Zika virus, are there any plans at this point to appoint a Zika czar or someone to kind of lead the effort? And even though, yes, it is really primarily focused on pregnant women and the effects are focused on pregnant women, it still seems like it would be pretty serious if these mosquitoes that spread the virus do come to the U.S. Is there a plan? Does the White House have a plan to respond, like if this really becomes -- starts spreading in the U.S.? I mean, in some of these other countries they've just told women not to get pregnant. That doesn't seem like that would fly in the U.S. So is there a plan in place?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously, our public health experts both at the CDC and the NIH are mindful of the risks that are associated with the Zika virus. And the President is himself concerned about it. That's why he convened a meeting here at the White House yesterday to discuss it.\nSo what we will do is we will rely on the best scientific advice that is available to protect the American people. And first and foremost, that starts with warning people about any travel plans they may have where this virus has been detected; and making sure that people are educated about the risk that it poses. Certainly, the risk to pregnant women or women who could become pregnant is serious. But it's important for people to understand that if you're a man or you're not pregnant, that the impact of the virus is relatively mild.\nSo first of all, we want to make sure that people are properly educated about the risks of this virus, but also that we're taking the kinds of steps that are necessary to do as much as possible to try to fight this disease.\nAnd Darlene mentioned the readout noted a desire to sort of ramp up our efforts to look for a vaccine and other treatments. The other thing that scientists tell us is that trying to limit the mosquito population is another way that we can fight this disease. So we're certainly going to avail ourselves of all of the scientific knowledge that's been accumulated to make sure that we are trying to stay in front of this disease.\nObviously, the mosquito population in the United States in January is not significant. But we are mindful that as the thermometer heats up here, that we need to be mindful of this risk.\nQ: But is there a need for a czar, do you think?\nMR. EARNEST: At this point -- other than a catchy name like Zika Czar, I wouldn't anticipate the need for that kind of position at this point. (Laughter.) But we did find it useful in the fall of 2014 to have somebody with the skills of Ron Klain to come in and help organize the interagency efforts across the federal government to fight the Ebola virus. It's too early at this stage to say whether or not that will be necessary when it comes to the Zika virus.\nMichelle.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. So in President Obama's interview with Politico last week, he called Secretary Clinton \"idealistic, progressive, good, smart, tough, experienced.\" Then he again called her \"wicked smart\" a second time. So that sounded to many listeners like a pretty glowing endorsement of Clinton.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think I would encourage you to just take it at face value. It sounds like that's what you might be doing. The President had kind words for Secretary Clinton. She is someone who served the President ably. In his Cabinet, as Secretary of State, she advanced the interests of the United States all around the world.\nThe President also had the opportunity to watch her up close as she campaigned for the presidency in 2007 and 2008, and he came away from that experience with a deep admiration for her skills as a political candidate. And the President has made no secret of the fact that over the years of campaigning against one another and then working together in the administration, that the two have become genuine friends.\nThat said, the President has also been clear that at this point he does not plan to offer up a specific endorsement in the presidential race. And he has made a point of both saying nice things about his friends in public. He also, as many of you have observed, has also explained where there are maybe some differences. And sort of depending on the news cycle, sometimes that's interpreted as a jab at his former friend, or a resounding secret endorsement of someone whom he has long admired.\nI think what all this reflects is a desire on the part of the President to support Democratic candidates and to position Democrats to win the presidential election in November, regardless of who the nominee is.\nQ: In the same interview, he had a few kind words for Bernie Sanders, as well. But at one point, though, it seemed like he was describing him as a \"bright, shiny object,\" which I guess you can interpret positively or negatively, depending.\nMR. EARNEST: The President has certainly been described as worse.\nQ: Well, because it almost seemed like he was also referring to a point where he, himself, at one point had been described in the same way. But anyway, he used that, and then at another point it seemed almost like he might be saying that you need to have more than one focus or you need to have more than one issue, as if he was saying that that was Sanders. So by saying those things the way he did, but not officially endorsing someone, and the timing of this, doesn't this essentially have the weight, the effect of being an endorsement of Hillary Clinton?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I don't think it does. I think that the President did have the opportunity to talk in that interview about how important it is that somebody like Senator Sanders has succeeded in inspiring tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of Democrats all across the country to attend his campaign events, become engaged in his campaign, contribute to his campaign, and be a part of a broader effort to put another Democrat in the White House. That's a really good thing for the party.\nThe President also happens to think that's a good thing for the country because it will ensure that the next President, if that person is a Democrat, recognizes the need to build on the progress that we've made so far and not go back to the policies that actually led to the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. And all the Democratic candidates have given voice to that kind of commitment and that kind of view of the challenge facing our country.\nAnd so the ability of somebody like Senator Sanders to engage Democrats all across the country in that debate and in that fight is a good thing for the country and a good thing for the party. And so that's obviously why what Senator Sanders has been doing over the last year or so is so important. And I say that regardless of whether or not he's the nominee.\nQ: So when the President said that, as President you don't have the luxury of focusing on one thing. Was he saying that, at this point, Sanders has been seeming to focus on one thing?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the President was just making an observation that applies to all of the candidates. It certainly applies to Senator Sanders, it also applies to Senator Clinton, that the kinds of skills that you're going to need in a Commander-in-Chief is not just a passion about one issue -- although that passion is really important and is critical to the success of any sort of campaign, particularly a national, presidential campaign -- but you're also going to have to demonstrate an ability to handle lots of different things at the same time. And obviously the American people will have an opportunity to evaluate the capacity of candidates in both parties to do exactly that.\nQ: So in the differences that Sanders and the President have, which are well known, did they come any closer in agreement on any of these? What would you say the -- if there was a positive outcome to this meeting today, what do you think it was?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, I think it was an important opportunity for the two men to sit down and sort of talk about their shared commitment to advancing the policies and priorities and values that they have in common. And, again, I don't have a whole lot more of a detailed readout to share with you from a private meeting, but I think there is value in having those kinds of conversations, and I suspect it's not the last one.\nQ: And on foreign policy, would you say that they see eye to eye? Were there any areas you could discuss that they talked about?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any more detail about that aspect of their conversation to share.\nMary.\nQ: On the President's interview with Politico, Hillary Clinton seems to think that the President's comments were somewhat tantamount to an endorsement. She said the President was arguing that she is \"best prepared to do all aspects of the job.\" Is that a correct interpretation?\nMR. EARNEST: The President has not issued an endorsement in the race. At this point, he doesn't plan to. I would expect that the President will vote in the Illinois primary. He'll vote absentee. I don't know that we'll announce in advance exactly who he chooses to support, but we'll keep you posted if that changes.\nQ: And a few months ago, the President joked about the Republican debate, saying that if the candidates couldn't handle some of the moderators, then how are they going to handle the Chinese or the Russians. Given that, what does the President think of Donald Trump's decision now to skip the next debate?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I noted that a spokesperson for Fox News had a variation on that very statement. So I guess imitation is the highest form of flattery, even if it's Fox News that's doing the imitating.\nLook, I think what is true is that -- since you brought up the Politico interview -- the President himself noted that he was not a big fan of participating in presidential debates, but he never backed out of a debate two days before it was scheduled to be held. And I think that demonstrates his own commitment to the process, and making good on one's commitments.\nAnd we've seen that over last several months that Mr. Trump has repeatedly chosen to kick reporters out of the room for asking tough questions. It appears he's taking that approach to a new level by avoiding those questions entirely.\nQ: So does he think it says something about his temperament and his ability to do the job?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm confident that his Republican opponents think so. But ultimately it will be up to the voters to decide.\nApril.\nQ: Josh, a couple of questions. I want to go back to the Bernie Sanders-Hillary Clinton thing, but in a different way. He's met with -- the President has met with Hillary Clinton several times as a private citizen. And he met with Bernie Sanders today. Is there any room for him to meet with Martin O'Malley? Does he I guess pass the bar to have a meeting with him when it comes his poll numbers?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we're not examining poll numbers before deciding on presidential meetings. I certainly wouldn't rule out a future meeting between the President and Governor O'Malley.\nQ: Is it being talked about?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any active discussion right now. But I wouldn't rule out that if Governor O'Malley makes a request like that, that we wouldn't find a way to find some time on the President's schedule for it.\nQ: Has it been (inaudible)?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of one. But --\nQ: All right now, back on another subject, the Flint subject. What is the expectation for the Governor, the Mayor, for all involved when it comes to the water issue in Flint, Michigan?\nMR. EARNEST: What is our expectation for the --\nQ: Yes.\nMR. EARNEST: I think the most important thing is that the people of Flint are looking to their state and local leaders who are responsible for water safety in their community to step up to the plate and fix the problem.\nAnd the federal government is certainly committed to playing our important role in helping them succeed in that endeavor. There are a variety of ways for us to do that. One is we obviously have the expertise of the EPA, who has recently announced ramped-up testing of the water in that community. Late last week, the President announced that he was expediting $80 million in funding to the state of Michigan that could potentially be used to confront some of the issues that are facing Flint and their water system right now. There is a federal official from the Department of Health and Human Services that is there on the ground coordinating the assistance that's being provided by the federal government.\nThe reason it's an HHS official is that obviously there are significant public health consequences for the water quality in Flint right now. And we want to make sure that we have the expertise on the ground that's necessary to deal with it and to try to support the ongoing efforts of state and local officials.\nQ: This has been years in the making to get to this crescendo moment. Why did it take this long? And why is not viewed by many in this country as a crisis? People are saying we want to get someone to come in and test the water. We're going to do this -- we're talking about not charging people for water. People are saying out in the street -- you can hear it from those who live in Flint, you can hear it from people just in the black community trying to understand why has this not been placed in a higher priority than what we're seeing now.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think the President has made clear that this is a priority. And I think that is evident both from the tone of his remarks, but also based on the kind of efforts that you've seen mobilized on behalf of the federal government. I think there's no denying that Mayor Weaver of Flint considers this to be a crisis. I think she's acting like it is. And you saw Governor Snyder dedicate the first 10 or 15 minutes of his State of the State address to discussing this issue. That's an indication that he believes that this is a significant problem that needs immediate attention.\nI think the other thing that's notable here is that the reason that many people attribute -- what many people attribute the problems with Flint's water supply to is this changeover from where the water was obtained; and that by getting the water from the Flint River, that raised some significant questions about how clean the water is and what sort of threat that poses to public health. That's only a recent change that has been made. I believe that was in the summer of 2014.\nSo there may be a variety of things that conspired to contribute to this problem, but I think what most scientists have concluded is that this all stems from a decision that was made only about a year and a half ago.\nQ: And lastly, the President has his My Brother's Keeper initiative and it deals with at-risk minority males, while there are many critics who are now saying, and doctors who are saying that there could be a lost generation in Flint, Michigan because of the effects of this contaminated water. What is being done as relates to that in this White House in trying to catch that lost generation?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what's clear is that the potential -- I want to underscore \"potential\" -- public health impact here is quite significant. And that is why the federal official that is responsible for coordinating the efforts of the federal government is an expert in public health. And so we're mindful of those risks and certainly will be mobilizing the resources that are necessary to try to deal with them.\nQ: But when you have lead -- I mean, I've talked to doctors who say we've seen the effects of lead like in kids who were diagnosed years ago. Like Freddy Gray, for instance, in Baltimore, he had been diagnosed with lead poisoning. So you're saying \"potential\" -- there is a reality that lead poisoning and other contaminants can really do damage to a person academically, physically.\nMR. EARNEST: I wasn't attempting to downplay the impact of lead poisoning. I think it is unclear at this point exactly what the extent of it was in Flint, and that's what they're trying to take a look at. I'm certainly not downplaying the significance of -- or the seriousness of something like that.\nCheryl.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I'd like to ask you about the budget that's coming out in a couple of weeks. And the White House today rolled out a program of school lunches. But I wanted to ask, will the President's budget adhere to the spending caps that were just agreed to in the budget agreement in December?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we'll have a whole lot more detail about what's included in the budget when we roll it out here in a couple of weeks. So stay tuned for that. Sorry I can't help with yet.\nRon.\nQ: Just a couple questions. On Flint, the Governor there has asked for -- specifically asked for medical care, long-term medical care for minors under 21. And he's asked the federal government to help with that. Is that something that the President thinks is a good idea, or something that you're working actively towards doing? I gather there will be a formal proposal to Health and Human Services fairly soon.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we'll obviously take a close look at any requests that are made by state and local officials for assistance that the federal government can provide. And again, the federal official on the ground in Flint that's coordinating the federal resources that are being brought to bear to this situation is a public health expert, so she would certainly be in a good position to evaluate the benefits of a request like that.\nQ: It just seems like a very -- a somewhat unique request because of the unique nature of this particular crisis. Essentially, federal health care coverage for minors under the age of 21 on a long-term basis, that seems like a very significant commitment that the government would have to make, the federal government to make. Conceptually, is that something the President, you think, would support?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think we'd have to take a look at exactly what the request is before rendering a judgment on it.\nQ: There was a pretty stinging editorial in the Detroit News about the EPA's role in all this. Are you familiar with that?\nMR. EARNEST: I didn't see the editorial, but go ahead.\nQ: The basic point of it is that the EPA knew that there was a problem about a year ago, but chose not to be very public about it, chose to deal with this more discreetly through the Michigan State Department of Environmental Protection. But the critics in the agency are saying essentially they knew that there was a problem a year ago or more but really didn't sound the alarm. Is that a fair criticism?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me say a couple of things about that. The first is that there is an ongoing Department of Justice investigation to this, so I have to be limited, at least measured in what I can say about it, because I don't want to be perceived as weighing in on this investigation or trying to defend or deflect blame from anybody.\nLet me just say, in general, that what the President himself has identified is the need to take another look at the relationship between the EPA and those states like Michigan where it is state and local officials who are responsible for things like water quality, because it does raise exactly the kind of moral and, in some cases, legal question that you're raising, which is that if the EPA has a legitimate concern about something, but yet it is the responsibility of state officials to administer the water system, the question then is, what does the EPA do? Particularly if their concerns are not being heeded by the state and local government.\nWhat the President has asked the EPA to do -- and I think the EPA Administrator made an announcement about this recently -- is to clarify exactly how that relationship should work so that the EPA is not put in a position where they're expected to keep private information that is critical to the health of the public. That obviously is a situation that we need to avoid, and the EPA has taken another look at the rules and regulations that govern the relationship between state officials and federal officials to make sure that that kind of situation doesn't arise in the future.\nQ: I don't know the legality of it all, but apparently there's a situation where the EPA, it would be illegal for them to essentially say there's a problem because it's a state responsibility.\nMR. EARNEST: What I'm saying is that there are a bunch of rules and regulations that govern the relationship between the EPA and state and local officials. And so they do have a -- they obviously want to try to follow that procedure. What we need to make sure is that that procedure doesn't unnecessarily inhibit the ability of the EPA to make public information that could have a significant impact on the health and wellbeing of the public.\nQ: And the decision-making by the EPA, is it part of the focus of the DOJ investigation?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, you'd have to talk to the Department of Justice about what all they're taking a look at. But I certainly want to be cautious about not unintentionally interfering in an ongoing investigation.\nQ: And just one thing on the campaign. Another way of looking at this whole thing is that President Obama appointed Senator Clinton to a very sensitive position. They worked side by side in the Situation Room and in the trenches for years and years. Why wouldn't he endorse someone like that? Why wouldn't he come out and -- it would seem perfectly natural. The relationship he has with Senator Sanders pales in comparison, at least by the way anyone would like at this. So isn't he just playing politics? Is he hedging his bets? Why wouldn't he come out and say something much more supportive of his own former Secretary of State?\nMR. EARNEST: I think that's an entirely legitimate question.\nQ: Thanks. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I just -- (laughter) -- well -- here's, I think, the President's thinking about this. It's simply that he's not the only person that should have an opportunity to decide. Democratic voters should be engaged in this process. And there is a strong benefit to the Democratic Party to have people like Senator Sanders who doesn't have a long, personal relationship with the President of the United States, but yet has been remarkably effective in galvanizing support for his campaign among Democratic activists all across the country. He is somebody who has been able to engage Democrats all across the country in the debate about the future of our country. That is a good thing for the party. And the President and his vision for the future of the country benefits from somebody like Senator Sanders having success in mobilizing Democrats to be actively engaged in the debate about the future of the country.\nAnd so, second, the President also believes that it's important that he himself benefitted from a vigorous primary campaign; that anybody who followed the President's election in 2007 and 2008, it was pretty obvious that the President improved dramatically as a candidate over the course of 2007 and 2008. And if the primary process had been wrapped up in late to mid-February, the President would not have had the benefit of honing those skills, both on the stump and on the debate stage.\nNow, I will readily acknowledge that, at the time, that it was a little harder to discern that benefit; that those of us that had been moving from state to state, and certainly the President, who was spending days upon days and weeks upon weeks on the campaign trail in a way that nobody really expected, at the time felt like a little bit of a slog. But in hindsight, it's quite clear that he benefitted from -- that his performance on the stump and his performance on the debate stage and his performance as a candidate improved as a result of that.\nSo any sort of presidential attempt to sort of head off that debate at this early stage by weighing on the primary isn't really going to benefit any of the candidates. And the truth is the President wants to encourage a robust debate within the Democratic Party. That's going to be good for both inspiring people to be active and engaged in the political process, but also it's going to sharpen the skills of all of the candidates involved.\nAll that said, I wouldn't necessarily rule out an endorsement down the line. But at this point, the President reserving his private preference -- or keeping his private preference private, I guess, has had important benefits for the party and important benefits for the candidates.\nQ: Is it fair that that non-endorsement could be seen as a negative for Secretary Clinton? Some will see it.\nMR. EARNEST: I have no doubt that some will see it that way. But I think that -- I think I've tried to lay out what the benefits are of the President keeping his private preference private and allowing the process to play out in a way that engages Democrats across the country and sharpens the skills of the Democratic candidates who are competing for those votes.\nKevin.\nQ: Josh, thanks. Staying with 2016, is it fair to say that the President believes that Hillary Clinton is better prepared to be President than Bernie Sanders?\nMR. EARNEST: The President hasn't made public an assessment like that at this point. Again, I think the President has talked about the --\nQ: This morning he said she's better prepared than any non-Vice President to ever run for the office.\nMR. EARNEST: I think that was a clear acknowledgement of the skills and experience that she brings to the job. But look, ultimately his preference in this contest is one that will be expressed in his absentee ballot in the Illinois primary. If we choose to make that public, we'll let you know.\nQ: Staying -- actually, let me talk foreign policy for just a second. I'm sure you saw the report of President Rouhani making this grand European tour. He made a comment in which he said, we invite American businessmen to join their European counterparts in investing with us as part of a win-win collaboration after years of mutual losses. Is that how the President would see it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, President Rouhani has taken advantage of the opportunity to go and make his case around the world of why his country is open for business again. And he makes that claim based on the significant steps that his nation has already taken to dismantle a significant portion of their nuclear infrastructure.\nThey've also -- they did that by eliminating 98 percent of their enriched uranium stockpile; by essentially gutting the core of a plutonium reactor; dismantling -- or at least unplugging thousands of centrifuges; and agreeing to the most intrusive set of inspections that have ever been imposed on a country's nuclear program.\nAnd in exchange, we have -- the international community has allowed Iran to try to re-establish business ties with other countries and other companies around the world. What's also true is that Iran continues to be subject to significant sanctions -- not just here in the United States, but also in Europe, because of their ongoing support for terrorism, because of the human rights abuses that are all too common inside of Iran, and because of their continued development of a ballistic missile program in violation of their international obligations.\nQ: You said something important -- you said in sort of opening the possibility for investment. Does the President feel that he can take some credit for that? That by creating this Iran nuclear deal or at least having a hand in it, that now he's been able to assist the Iranians in opening their economy to the world again?\nMR. EARNEST: The goal of the nuclear agreement was focused on making sure that Iran's nuclear program existed only for peaceful purposes, and that the international community had full transparency into their program so that they could confirm for ourselves that that program existed only for peaceful purposes. And that is an objective that was achieved as a part of the nuclear agreement.\nI would acknowledge that President Rouhani pursued that agreement for different reasons. But ultimately our goal of preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon was achieved.\nQ: Last one. You've probably read the reports about Afghanistan and the potential that American troops could be there for decades. Does the President see it that way? And is this an acknowledgement that his best-laid plans when he campaigned on the idea of ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan aren't going to play out?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President, when he ran for this office in 2007 and 2008, actually talked about the need to intensify our focus on Afghanistan to make sure that we are confronting the extremist threat that had led to the worst terrorist attack on American soil in 2001.\nAnd under this President's leadership and because of the strategy that we put forward, and principally because of the courage, bravery, and professionalism of our men and women in uniform, we have decimated core al Qaeda that previously did capitalize on the instability in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.\nQ: So decades is --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what we have always said is that the United States envisioned a long-term partnership with the government of Afghanistan, and that our commitment to economic development and shoring up their governing structures was a long-term commitment. And again, this was a commitment not just made by the United States, but by the broader international community. And we always did envision a scenario where there would be a U.S. embassy in Afghanistan that would be guarded by U.S. military personnel. We envisioned the establishment of a security cooperation office at that embassy that would strengthen the military-to-military ties between Afghanistan and the United States.\nSo we always envisioned a long-term relationship between our two countries. But right now, there is a military presence inside of Afghanistan by the United States and our NATO partners to focus on counterterrorism and on continuing to train and advise Afghan troops that are currently providing for the security situation in their own country. And that effort continues.\nQ: So if I'm understanding you, you're comfortable with the idea that for decades, potentially, there could be thousands of American troops in Afghanistan; that after 15 years of tireless effort by the women and men who fought in that country, the blood, the treasure, that's not going to be nearly enough. And you're comfortable with that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the scenario that we envision right now is that we would essentially draw down troop levels to about 5,500 troops by the end of this year. Moving forward, the next Commander-in-Chief and his or her national security team taking advice from our commanders on the ground in Afghanistan will have to determine what sort of troop presence is appropriate for that country moving forward.\nWhat the President envisions is a continued decrease in that number. But ultimately that's a decision for the next President. What is clear, though, again, is that our goal was to destroy the core al Qaeda cell that had planned and supported the worse terrorist attack on American soil back in 2001. And that objective was achieved.\nByron.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. You said -- if I heard you correctly, you said the President hasn't made public his private preference in the Democratic primary contest. Does that mean he has one? Or is he approaching the field with an open mind?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm confident the President approached this with an open mind. I don't know whether or not the President has made a decision about whose -- about which candidate he will support in the Illinois primary. But yes, it's fair to say that the President is considering that decision -- or at least considered that decision with an open mind. I don't know if he's decided at this point.\nQ: Can you point to some areas where Senator Sanders and the President have worked together, either when he was in the Senate or during this administration? And would you describe Senator Sanders's role in advancing the President's objective as constructive or obstructive, or a little bit of both?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there's one way to measure this, and that is that during the two years that they served in the United States Senate together, there were about 200 pieces of legislation that they either sponsored or co-sponsored. I think that at least is one -- I would concede that is a relatively arbitrary measure, but at least it's one way to quantify the depth of their cooperation in the United States Senate.\nObviously, Senator Sanders has made a name for himself in part because of his passionate advocacy for Wall Street reform and standing up for and fighting for middle-class families. That's also been at the core of the President's domestic policymaking agenda as well. And while there are some differences in the details when it comes to their approach to those two issues, their agreement about championing the middle class being critical to the success of our country I think is probably the most prominent.\nBut there are -- as it relates to other issues where they agree, based on what Senator Sanders said at the stakeout, it sounds like he's generally supportive of the broad approach the President has taken to fighting ISIL and preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and some of those foreign policy issues. But when it comes to whether or not Senator Sanders agrees with all those things, you probably have to ask him.\nQ: Can you clarify the history of their meetings? Have they met privately in the Oval Office before? I think you said in the briefing that they have. Was that a meeting that took place in December of 2014?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, that's when the meeting took place.\nQ: Do you know what happened there? Do you have a readout? Do you know how that came together?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't. I think that was, frankly, a similar circumstance to this one, where Senator Sanders basically informed the White House of his intent to seek the Democratic nomination for the office of President. And he, I think understandably, concluded that one thing to do might be to ask the last guy who successfully obtained the Democratic nomination for the office of President and spend some time talking to him. And that's what they did.\nI don't have a detailed readout of that meeting either. But, yes, there are at least two occasions in which Senator Sanders and President Obama have met privately in the Oval Office in the last year or so.\nQ: One last quick one. Does the President think there should be more Democratic debates? This is something of some controversy. There's talk of adding an unsanctioned debate or reexamining the Democratic debate schedule. He's been through this. What does he think?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President believes that the Democratic National Committee, who actually is neutral in this race, should decide exactly what that debate schedule should be. It's my understanding that's something that they settled on many months ago.\nAlexis.\nQ: Josh, I have two questions about Senator Sanders, and then one unrelated question. To follow up on what Byron was asking you, Senator Sanders was saying that he believes that the President is trying to be as evenhanded as possible. Just process-wise, did the President extend to him any kind of conduit or contact that he can use to make sure that his relationship with the White House, should he need it, is facilitated in anything akin to the way that Secretary Clinton can access White House information?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, I think the fact that we were able to set up this meeting I think is an indication that when Senator Sanders needs to communicate with the President or senior members of the White House team here, that he has the capacity to do that.\nQ: But I mean, other than leg affairs, what office or contact -- did the President setup any special -- like call Denis or --\nMR. EARNEST: No, I'm not aware that anything like that was necessary. I'm confident that if, again, if Senator Sanders needs to get the attention of the President or anybody else here on the senior staff, that he's able to do that.\nQ: One other question just to follow up on Byron, too. Because the President has said that he wants to be a single-issue voter or assist himself in the Democratic Party on gun control, can you clarify whether the two men talked about gun control today and whether they're on the same page? Would the President have any hesitation to be supportive of Senator Sanders on the basis of that issue?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know whether or not this came up in their private conversation. And, again, as we talked about a couple of weeks ago, it's apparent from Senator Sanders's public comments on this issue that he has arrived at a position and an agenda that is consistent with the kind of agenda we'd expect of a candidate who supports common-sense gun-safety measures like those the President has said will have a significant impact on who he chooses not just to vote for but also to support and campaign for in the next election.\nQ: Then the unrelated question is about Guantanamo. Cheryl asked you about the budget, but I want to ask you, can you say whether the President -- the budgetary implications of his proposal to shutter Guantanamo as a prison will be included in the budget that would be released in early February so that lawmakers could see what the implications might be in the savings that he envisions?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know whether or not this will be included in the budget, but obviously we'll be able to talk about that when we roll out the budget. I do know that part of the plan that the Department of Defense has been working on for a number of months now includes a discussion of the fiscal impact of closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay and finding a more cost-effective way to detain those individuals who pose a threat to the United States.\nQ: Do you think that the plan will be public before the release of the budget?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have an update for you on the timing of the Gitmo plan. But when that plan is presented to Congress we'll make sure that all of you get a copy of it as well.\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, in the past, the President has sought the counsel or taken the counsel of Michael Bloomberg, particularly on guns. Does the President believe that there's room for another billionaire in this race for President? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Mayor Bloomberg was just at the White House a couple of weeks ago, two or three weeks ago now, to discuss the effort that he has undertaken to make our communities safer from gun violence. Obviously, the President has been deeply appreciative of the kind of investment and commitment that Mayor Bloomberg has made to this issue. The President believes it's important as well. And they had an opportunity to talk about their efforts in the Oval Office just a few weeks ago.\nUltimately, Mayor Bloomberg will have to decide for himself if he wants to run for President. I mean, it does seem like on about every 12 or 13 months we do see anonymous sources claiming to be familiar with the thinking of Mayor Bloomberg, speculating that he might even be considering a potential run for the presidency.\nSo, look, as I noted in the context of Vice President Biden's deliberations, everybody around here is mindful of the kind of personal considerations that are included in a decision like that, and obviously that's a decision that only Mayor Bloomberg can make for himself. And it's not a decision that can be made by an anonymous source who claims to be familiar with his thinking.\nQ: Going back to the Politico interview that we discussed so far, there's a comment President Obama made when talking about Hillary Clinton -- he made that reference to sort of the Ginger Rogers analogy -- \"She had to do everything I did except backwards and in heels,\" suggesting she had it harder. Does the President think it's harder for female candidates running for office?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the point that the President was making in the context of that interview is just simply that a long national campaign for the presidency is arduous and is physically demanding, and as tiring as the President found that process to be, it must have been even more challenging for Secretary Clinton. Again, he noted -- he cited this example in his interview. One example of that is, I would assume, based on very little personal knowledge, that it takes Secretary Clinton a little longer in the morning to do her hair than it does for the President of the United States to do his hair. And that may seem like a rather prosaic observation, but ultimately, when you're talking about an 18- or 19-hour day, that matters. And that's the observation that the President was making.\nQ: But he wasn't necessarily only thinking of Hillary Clinton in that context. I mean, is he saying, generally speaking, a campaign as arduous as this one, it is just tougher for women to run for the same office?\nMR. EARNEST: I guess in that context and with that sort of -- I would acknowledge that the unique challenges that were faced by Secretary Clinton in 2008 are probably familiar to women candidates who have competed in other political campaigns, even below the presidential level.\nQ: It would take Trump a while to do his hair. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: The last time I talked about Mr. Trump's hair I got in a little trouble. So I'll let you make that observation, not me.\nQ: But just to clarify here, do you think, in the context of this race now, that gender is playing a role? Was the President trying to go that far in this statement? Or was he just speaking in what sounds like you're kind of characterizing in a lighthearted, sort of \"it takes longer to get ready in the morning\" context?\nMR. EARNEST: I think what the President was chiefly talking about is just why it is he had developed so much admiration for Secretary Clinton. And they have this -- look, it's a rather unique thing for two people to have participated in such an historic presidential election. And it lasted a whole lot longer than most people expected. It involved campaigning in states that had not recently been involved in -- or at least actively contested in the Democratic presidential primary process. And while they were on different sides of the contest, they went through that contest together. It was a searing experience for him, personally, but yet it was an experience that the two of them shared in common.\nAnd I think the President was just making the observation that he found that process to be demanding, but his admiration for her was that it must have been even more physically demanding on her as she was going through that process. And so I think he was just trying to explain why he admired her skills as a candidate, and her tenacity and her perseverance.\nAnd would that apply to other women candidates in the context of other races? Yes, it potentially could. But each race is a little bit different.\nQ: And one other remark in that interview I wanted to ask -- the President I guess expressed some regret for being so hard on Hillary Clinton the last time around, in 2008. Is that sentiment felt here, elsewhere within the White House, given how deeply some of those competitive juices were flowing back then? I mean, is this now a sentiment that, in looking at the race now, people who worked on the campaign, the President himself said, wow, it shouldn't have gotten that tough?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think one thing that the President made clear once he made the decision to add Secretary Clinton to his Cabinet, and once he took office as President, he made clear to his staff that those old rivalries needed to be set aside for the good of the country. And I think for the most part, that's what staff members who served on both campaigns did, because they recognized, particularly at that stage in our history where you had the broader American economy teetering on the edge of a cliff, that the stakes were too high to continue petty personal or political rivalries.\nAnd, look, some of that work happened in the context of the campaign in the general election. There were a number of my colleagues who still work at the White House today who originally supported Secretary Clinton in the primary race, worked and supported Senator Obama in the general election, and now serve President Obama here. Obviously, Secretary Clinton, then-Senator Clinton, campaigned pretty aggressively for Senator Obama in the 2008 general election. So that was part of a long-running process. And I think if you take a look at the effectiveness of their working relationship once she became Secretary of State, I think you could observe that that process was successful.\nToluse.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I want to ask you about inversions. On Monday, Johnson Controls and Tyco went through a merger. It's a pretty big inversion that would cost the U.S. taxpayers about $150 million. Senator Sanders said it would be a disaster for the taxpayer. Hillary Clinton also spoke out against it. I'm wondering if the White House has any statement or reaction to that deal.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have a comment on any individual company's transaction. What I will just say in general is the President has made clear that closing loopholes that only benefit the wealthy and well-connected, whether those are individuals or corporations, is a top priority of his. And unfortunately, we haven't seen Republicans embrace that notion, but we're going to continue to talk to them about it.\nAnd I know that there are a number of steps the Treasury Department has already taken to make it more difficult for any company to engage in a transaction that allows them to avoid their tax bill unfairly. And they're continuing to look at other policy proposals that would improve upon those efforts. But ultimately, we need legislation to address this loophole. And that legislation continues to be high on the President's agenda.\nQ: It does not seem like that legislation is moving forward in the Republican Congress at this point.\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah, unfortunately. And I think it is a good illustration, though, of the Republican priorities. Look, the President made this observation at some recent public event: it's not middle-class families that are moving to a PO Box overseas so they can avoid paying their taxes. Most middle-class families here in the United States stand up and pay their fair share. Why shouldn't we ask the same thing of large corporations that benefit from the infrastructure in this country, that benefit from the talent pool that exists in this country, that benefit from the most -- being part of the biggest economy in the world, and a legal structure that allows their business to thrive? It's time for them to pay their fair share, too. And I'm not sure how Republicans can make the case that that's somehow a bad idea.\nQ: Then why is there so much reluctance to speak out specifically about these deals when they come up? Why not use the bully pulpit to try to stop some of these deals from happening since legislation doesn't seem to move forward?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the challenge here is that the -- obviously, there are elements of the U.S. government that have jurisdiction over individual companies. And so I don't want to somehow suggest that our approach to regulating companies is going to be prejudiced based on some policy decision that they've made. So I'm not going to weigh in on a decision that's made by an individual company -- frankly, particularly one that involves tax policy like this.\nBut the principle is one that the President has talked about quite extensively and continues to be a top priority of the administration. And look, I'd encourage you to check with the Treasury Department for an update on their ongoing efforts to address what we view as a pretty significant flaw in the tax code.\nQ: Also, kind of speaking of the Treasury Department, I think Secretary Lew was here this morning. I'm wondering if Puerto Rico came up in that discussion. We saw the readout of the discussion with Leader Pelosi and Harry Reid. And it seems like Puerto Rico was one of the top issues that came up in terms of what the President wants out of Congress. Did that issue come up? Is the President coming up with a strategy for how to get Congress to move on Puerto Rico here in the next few weeks?\nMR. EARNEST: Are you asking if it came up in the meeting with Senator Sanders?\nQ: With Secretary Lew.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Secretary Lew is at the White House most mornings because he participates in the senior staff meeting in the Chief of Staff's Office. So I don't have an update for you on any sort of specific internal deliberations on this. We've made clear that the administration considers this a priority, and it's not uncommon for this to be a topic of some conversation here at the White House.\nObviously, Secretary Lew has been at the forefront of our efforts to try to address the situation. I know that he traveled to Puerto Rico just last week to meet with officials there. And we were gratified at the end of last year when Speaker Ryan made a specific commitment to allow the House to vote on legislation that would not bail out Puerto Rico, but give Puerto Rico some more options for dealing with their financial challenges.\nQ: One more question on potential executive actions on tax policy. Senator Sanders, I think he wrote a letter to the President last year calling for the President to take some executive actions and close some loopholes. And one of his advisors just came out this week and said that the President could -- or executive actions could close the carried interest loophole. I'm wondering if the President or any of his advisors are looking at the authority or executive action to specifically address some of these tax loopholes that Congress doesn't seem to want to address.\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I haven't seen any specific proposals that have been put forward. But certainly the President has demonstrated a willingness to use his executive authority to try to advance priorities that we've identified, even when it comes to tax policy.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, on the record, to get you to clarify, is it accurate for us to describe President Obama as impartial and neutral in the Democratic race both privately and publicly at this time?\nMR. EARNEST: I think it is fair for you to say that the President has been conscientious about remaining publicly neutral in the presidential race.\nQ: And there was no effort on his part to use the Politico interview as a way to signal a preference for one candidate over the other?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I think the goal of the Politico interview, as was evident for most of the discussion, was to have an opportunity to talk about his experience campaigning in Iowa, and why that was a meaningful experience for him both in terms of shaping his public identity, but also the way that it had an impact on his approach to public service and to fulfilling his responsibilities as President.\nAnd the truth is that's how most -- that was the context for most the questions about both Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders came up.\nQ: Today's meeting with Senator Sanders was on the President's public schedule, but his meeting last month with Secretary Clinton was not. Can you tell us why? And will you be putting future meetings with candidates on the schedule?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there certainly were a number of concerns raised by people in this room about the fact that the President's meeting with Secretary Clinton was not announced in advance. And so we took that step with Senator Sanders last night to include on the nightly guidance that the President was intending to have this meeting today.\nWe will endeavor to announce those kinds of meetings in advance in the future. I'm certainly going to protect the President's ability to have a private conversation. And there have been conversations that the President has had, for example, with former Speaker of the House John Boehner, when he was still in office, that were not announced in advance and were not actually even confirmed shortly after they were completed.\nThe President needs to have the ability to have private conversations with other political leaders, and we're going to protect his ability to do that. But those kinds of meetings are obviously not the norm. And when the President is having what would otherwise be described as a routine meeting with Senator Sanders, or somebody like Secretary Clinton, then we'll plan to announce it in the guidance of the night before.\nQ: And on another issue, is there any White House response to the Doomsday Clock announcement on Monday that it's keeping the clock at three minutes to midnight; that we are in a very dangerous environment?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I saw some news reports about that. I'll just say that the President intends to convene the next installment of the Nuclear Security Summit here in Washington, D.C. in the next couple of months to talk about our ongoing efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear materials and nuclear weapons. And the President does believe in a longer-term role of trying to essentially nuclear disarm every country in the world. I know the President believes that that would make the globe and the United States of America more safe.\nI know that another factor in that analysis was climate change. And while we've made important progress in the context of the Paris agreement last year, for the first time we had more than 190 countries committing to reducing carbon pollution. We're going to need to see countries follow through on those commitments. And there will be more work that needs to be done to confront the challenge of climate change.\nNow, the good news is we've seen a preliminary commitment on the part of these countries to taking that step. And the President is optimistic about the kinds of economic opportunities that that creates for American businesses and American workers here in this country when it comes to the wind energy, or solar industry here in the United States. So we're optimistic about the current trajectory there. But again, there's no denying that more work needs to be done.\nLauren, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: President Obama on Monday announced a ban on solitary confinement for juvenile offenders in the federal prison system, saying that the practice was overused and that it had the potential for death, stating psychological consequences, and then had an op-ed where he outlined a series of executive actions. If bans like this -- there's a not a ban for adults. If this is torture for children, isn't it torture for adults to put them in solitary confinement? And what steps will be taken to remedy that, if any?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the reason that the President was motivated to announce this policy change is because there are legitimate concerns that have been raised about the devastating mental toll that prolonged solitary confinement can have on inmates.\nAnd if we envision a criminal justice system that gives people a second chance, after they've paid their debt to society, we need to make sure that they're equipped to do that. And again, based on the studies that have been done about the impact of solitary confinement on one's mental health and mental condition, it's hard to make the case that we're giving people an opportunity to succeed in the normal world once they've been able to reenter mainstream society if they've gone through this terrible ordeal of being confined in a prison cell alone and limited in their ability to interact with other human beings.\nSo there are a number of steps that are included in this announcement that include, even when individuals are held in solitary confinement, allowing them to spend more time outside their cell; trying to find other ways to detain individuals who might otherwise be put in solitary confinement.\nLet me give you one example. Maybe a prisoner is having some mental problems, and too often right now the option is just to put them in solitary confinement until they calm down. The question is if there are other ways to limit the ability of that individual to harm others or themselves, while also ensuring they get the kind of mental health treatment that they need.\nThe other thing that is included in this executive order are new limits on the use of this -- of solitary confinement as punishment, limiting the amount of time that they can be included in solitary confinement, as well as developing additional measures that can be instituted both as a punishment, but that will have less of a long-term negative impact on the inmate's mental health. And greater communication with the inmate about being placed in restrictive housing is another part of this strategy.\nSo the President is mindful of the severe impact that solitary confinement can have on inmates. And that's why he's put forward what he hopes will serve as a model for other law enforcement agencies to follow when it comes to implementing solitary confinement procedures.\nQ: Which was one of the issues that he had raised at the State of the Union, saying that he wanted to find bipartisan support for things like this. Can we expect anything like this in the future along the lines of the prison system?\nMR. EARNEST: The President certainly continues to be very interested in criminal justice reform. And while our goal is to get Congress to work in bipartisan fashion to pass criminal justice reform, I certainly wouldn't rule out the President using his executive authority to take additional steps to reform the system in a way that he believes would make the American people more safe.\nUltimately, that's what this is about. It isn't just about looking out for the interests and rights of individuals who are in the prison system. Certainly, that's important. But if we're also going to give those individuals a second chance -- something we all believe in -- we need to make sure that we're not impairing their ability from the beginning to go out and develop relationships with their families when they get out of prison, and get a good job and be able to hold down that job. If they've undergone this terrible mental trauma, then we're making it a lot harder for them to go out and do what we want them to do.\nAnd the ability of individuals to come out of the prison system, pay their debt to society, and start to make a positive contribution to our country ultimately makes all of us safer. And that's the President's aim here.\nJen, you got something real quick?\nQ: Yes, thank you.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay. I just got to get going. I don't want to be late for a meeting.\nQ: Okay, I'll be really quick.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay.\nQ: You and the President both have been pushing Congress to pass a new war authorization for ISIS for a long time. Unexpectedly, last week, Mitch McConnell introduced a sweeping AUMF himself, and actually used a rule to expedite it to the floor and bring it up if he wants to. Is that something the President would support?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I haven't looked at the actual text of the AUMF, but we believe that Congress has, for too long, put off their fundamental responsibility to pass the authorization to use military force against ISIL. And obviously, our men and women in uniform are fulfilling their responsibilities to keep the country safe, and it's time for Congress to fulfill their responsibilities, too.\nQ: But would the President support something as broad as that? It's basically an open-ended authorization to give the President any war powers he'd like to go after ISIS.\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I haven't looked specifically at the proposal that Senator McConnell says he supports. Obviously, we believe that an authorization to use military force that's passed by Congress should reflect Congress's constitutional responsibilities to weigh in here. And that's our expectation that Congress should do; it's still unclear if they actually will fulfill that responsibility.\nQ: And speaking of war, Concepcion Picciotto is the woman who has been living in the tent out front for about 35 years, waging the longest peace protest in U.S. history. She died this week. I wanted to see if the President is aware at all of who she is and aware of this long-time fixture out there, and if he has anything to say about her and her vigil.\nMR. EARNEST: I saw some of the news coverage of this over the weekend. I don't know if the President is aware, but it's clear that she had a lot of passion and conviction for trying to make the planet a safer place.\nQ: Thirty-five years.\nMR. EARNEST: And we certainly got to pay our respects, not just to the life that she lived but to her passion for making the world a safer and more peaceful place.\nThanks, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 2:23 P.M. EST", "timestamp": "2016-01-27", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}

Murkowski, R-AK)\nThe Administration appreciates the bipartisan support for addressing key energy and conservation priorities in S. 2012. Modernizing the Nation's energy system and the policies that govern it has been a central focus of the Administration's efforts to combat climate change, strengthen energy security and resilience, and enhance our economic competitiveness. Through investments in research, development, and deployment; fuel economy standards; the President's Climate Action Plan; the Clean Power Plan; the Quadrennial Energy Review; and other initiatives, the Administration has made considerable progress in advancing cleaner energy systems that continue to deliver reliable and affordable energy for American homes and businesses.\nS. 2012 would focus on energy efficiency, energy infrastructure, energy supply, and conservation. The Administration believes that these are important issues and supports some provisions of the legislation. In particular, the bill would benefit conservation by permanently reauthorizing the Land and Water Conservation Fund and the Historic Preservation Fund, and by creating a new Park Maintenance and Revitalization Fund to help address the maintenance backlog at our National Parks. In addition, the bill would address several key energy priorities. It would reauthorize the weatherization assistance and State energy programs, support geothermal energy development, and advance energy job training, all of which support the President's Climate Action Plan.\nHowever, the Administration has concerns with other parts of the legislation including provisions that would: generate budgetary scoring issues associated with energy savings contracts, which represent an important tool in advancing Federal sustainability; repeal existing Department of Energy (DOE) programs that aim to improve efficiency at manufacturing facilities; eliminate DOE oversight of certain technology demonstration and commercial activity at National Laboratories; eliminate independent certification requirements for certain ENERGY STAR products; potentially delay issuance of final rules by unnecessarily requiring Federal agencies to respond to reliability analyses already required under Executive Order 13211; omit key security considerations with regard to provisions dealing with cybersecurity and computing; create permitting processes and governance structures for certain energy infrastructure projects that are redundant or inconsistent with recently enacted law; and limit project reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act. The Administration appreciates the role that carbon-free hydropower plays in meeting the Nation's energy needs. S. 2012 would improve upon the hydropower relicensing provision contained in H.R. 8, but the Administration has concerns about its implementability.\nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other concerns as the bill moves through the legislative process.", "timestamp": "2016-01-27", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: S. 2012 - Energy Policy Modernization Act of 2015"}

Donald Trump is not going to debate on Fox tomorrow night. Will you debate on our debate? Will you show up?\nCLINTON [via telephone]: Look, Chris, what I've said through my campaign is that I would look forward to another debate. I am, you know, anxious, if we can get something set up, to be able to be there. And so let's try to make it happen.\nMATTHEWS: Well, someone has to lead from the front. Will you be there, no matter what? Will you show up and wait and see? Will you be there waiting for Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley? Would you, in other words, lead the pack in showing up and committing to doing that?\nCLINTON: Look, I'm ready for the debate, and I hope Senator Sanders will change his mind and join us. And I think the DNC and the campaign should be able to work this out. I've said for — you know, for a long time that I'd be happy to have more debates, and I hope we can get this done.\nMATTHEWS: Well, if he doesn't show up, will you?\nCLINTON: Well, let's hope that we can get it worked out. I don't want to — you know, I don't want to jump the gun and create more problems for everybody trying to get this worked out, so we can all come to agreement that the voters of New Hampshire and America deserve to see us, you know, debating before the New Hampshire primary.\nMATTHEWS: So you won't be there — just a last question on this. You won't be there unless Bernie's there.\nCLINTON: Well, I'm not committing to that, either, Chris. I think we should have another debate. I think people want it. They have called for it. Folks have moved forward trying to get it set up. We've got, you know — look, 24 hours in a political campaign is an eternity.\nMATTHEWS: Right.\nCLINTON: We've got a little time to try to get everybody on board, which would certainly be my preference.\nMATTHEWS: OK, you believe candidates should have the courage to face each other before the — before the caucuses, in other words. You think you should be there and he should be there.\nCLINTON: I do. I think that — you know, I agreed, we all agreed to go with the process that the DNC had set up. And you know, I've been saying for a while that if they come up with more debates, I will be there. And now we've got a real, live possibility, and I — I personally think it would be great for the — you know, the primary. We're moving into the caucus, as you know so well, on Monday.\nMATTHEWS: OK...\nCLINTON: And then once we come out of there, whatever happens, we should agree to debate in New Hampshire.\nMATTHEWS: In other words, you're sticking to your commitment, I will be there.\nCLINTON: I will — I will debate. Now, as I say, I'd want — I want all the campaigns and the DNC to agree. That is my preference.\nMATTHEWS: OK.\nCLINTON: That's what we've tried to, you know, do in our side of the ledger here.\nMATTHEWS: OK.\nCLINTON: And I'm pushing people to come to agreement so we can all get out there and debate before the New Hampshire primary.\nMATTHEWS: Well, this is getting very sharply worded as we get closer to the caucuses. The word in \"The New York Times\" this morning, Madam Secretary, is that Senator Sanders is readying an attack ad against you. We don't know whether he's going to use it, but the language is basically that you're in hock to Wall Street because of the speaking fees you've taken from Goldman Sachs. How do you respond or how will you respond to an eleventh-hour attack like that?\nCLINTON: Well, first, it's really disappointing, Chris. You know, Senator Sanders has started to get increasingly personal with his attacks. He even compared me to Dick Cheney last week, which, you know, is kind of a low blow. So it would be another escalation and a breaking of his pledge not to go negative. One of the things that I think has been great about the Democratic side is we really have focused on issues, while the Republicans have been hurling insults. And I think the people in Iowa want to go to the caucuses thinking about which one of us as president can actually make a difference in their lives, and that's the case I've been focused on making. So you know, it would be a sharp departure by Senator Sanders. And you know, the other part of this, is anybody who knows me knows you can't buy me. I mean, honestly, I've been standing up and fighting and getting knocked around for years, trying to get things done that I think would improve people's lives. And I'm not going to stop, and that includes anybody trying to, you know, mess with our financial system.\nMATTHEWS: Well, when he uses phrases like — dark phrases like, You can draw your own conclusions, as to whether you're in hock to Goldman Sachs or anyone — is that — is that a low blow, You can draw your own conclusions?\nCLINTON: Well, I think he's trying to go to the line without going over it. And you know, clearly, some of the journalists covering us are starting to notice and call him out on it. But I feel very — you know, very positive and energized by what I'm seeing happening here in Iowa. And I know that I have the best plan to rein in Wall Street abuses, to make sure it doesn't ever happen again. Lots of folks, from Barney Frank to Paul Krugman, have said that's the case because I don't just go after the big banks. You know, we already have the authority to do that under Dodd-Frank, and I have said I would use that authority if they were posing a systemic risk to our economy. But equally importantly, we've got to go after the shadow banking sector. You know, let's not forget Lehman Brothers, AIG, Countrywide, Rapovia. And let's also remind people, Chris, that, clearly, the billionaires, as Bernie likes to say — the billionaires have chosen sides. They're running ads against me and trying to, you know, kind of hoodwink Democrats into voting against me because they know exactly what I will do because they've seen me in action. So whether it's, you know, Karl Rove or the hedge fund guys with their own super-PAC, or Joe Ricketts jumping in now with a kind of ham-handed effort to look like he was, you know, going against Bernie, when the real point was to, you know, stir opposition to me. I take that as perversely flattering and as the single best refutation of what Senator Sanders is trying to imply.\nMATTHEWS: Well, you're giving us a real rogue's gallery here of Dick Cheney and Karl Rove. [laughter]\nAnyway, let me ask you about the slogans. You used a phrase the other day, these shouting slogans. Now, I know what you mean — I'm going to build a wall across the Rio Grande — across — along the Rio Grande River. I'm going to make the Mexicans pay for it. But on the Democratic side, Senator Sanders says things like free health care, or rather, government-paid health care for life, as a right. He talks about free tuition when you go to a great school like Berkeley or Madison, Wisconsin. Free! Free! Is that what you mean, this — we had a young guy on yesterday from South Carolina who switched from you to Senator Sanders, and he — I went through this list of free things and I said, Where's the money come from? And he says, Well, we put a man on the moon. We can do this. And that kind of fantastic — what do you call it — appeal. And then I heard from Sanders the other day that they're going to stay left, right to the general, they're not going to make any appeal to the middle. How do you beat somebody who promises to go hard left, right to November, and offers all this stuff to people who are 20 years old, 22 years old, and they don't have to pay much taxes now, but you say, Look, you're going to get free — no more tuition bills, no more bills! You're going to have no health care the rest of your life, so forget having to buy insurance. It's a pretty good offer. Is that what you mean by shouting slogans?\nCLINTON: Well, I was really more referring to the Republicans, as you pointed out initially. And I have been, you know, pointing out the differences in the approach between myself and Senator Sanders because I know that it's more important we actually make progress than fall back into gridlock. And let's take health care as an example. You know, we've been trying, as Democrats, since Harry Truman to get on the path to universal coverage. Before it was called \"Obama care,\" it was called \"Hillary care,\" and I have the scars to prove it. And I was thrilled when President Obama passed and signed the Affordable Care Act. We are now at 90 percent coverage. I sure think we ought to improve it. I've got plans to get the costs down and make sure we do go after high prescription drug costs and some of the other drivers of health care costs. But I think it's a lot smarter to try to go from 90 percent to 100 percent than to throw our country into another contentious debate about health care. Where's the money going to come from? Who's going to be paying it? If you have health care you like, if you're under a private plan, do you have to give it up? If you're on Medicare and you work, do you have to pay more taxes? All these questions that would be thrown back into the public arena and we'd have to start all over again from 0 to 100 percent. I just think we want to stay on the path of making progress. Now, some people, you know, say, Oh my gosh, that's so pragmatic. It's not, you know, soaring, or whatever they say. Well, I'm out there talking to people who prescription drug costs have gone up from $200 to $14,000. I'm talking to people whose insulin cost has gone up three times. That's not a new drug. That doesn't have any new research in it. I'm talking to people who are thanking me for the Affordable Care Act because the lifetime limit, the cap has been lifted. And a man yesterday in Davenport said to me, I'm so grateful because I've got a granddaughter with a congenital heart condition. These people can't wait, Chris. We can't wait for another big debate that promises, you know, the sky when we know we've got to deliver on the ground. We've got to help people deal with the problems, the issues, the challenges they're facing right now. We have to restore faith that our government can work. And that is what I intend to do as president, and I'm going to keep fighting for that. And I respect the goal because Senator Sanders and I share the same goal. We want to get to universal coverage. I think my way will get us there faster and provide the health care that the people here in Iowa are telling me they are desperately, desperately in need of.\nMATTHEWS: Last question, and it's so important to this campaign. I think so. I know you think so. It has to do with history. And it's not the only issue in the campaign, obviously, but if you look at the American Constitution — and you've studied constitutional law — and the fact is that it wasn't until after the civil war that African-American men were given the right to vote in the 15th Amendment. And then women didn't get it until after the First World War. There's a long lag there. Obama was elected president. You might get elected president. You may well get elected president. Do you think it's — you think young American women — say, young women in college, 18 to 22, 23 — do they get it, how long this struggle has been and the fact that it's a precarious struggle that could fall back? Do they know that all the rights to choice, to equality at workplace, where they do get it, all were fought for? Do they get it? That's my simple question. I don't know if they do. Do you think they get it?\nCLINTON: Look, I think that a lot of young people — and I wouldn't limit it to women. I think young people of every background, every racial, ethnic, religious background, are, you know, trying to understand how best they can participate in our political system and what the stakes are for them. And of course, you know, if you haven't been through a lot of these struggles, it's easy either not to know about them or to think they didn't go far enough or that, you know, everything is taken care of. So we've got the two extremes of the argument. But here's what I'm hearing, at least from the young women who come to see me. They say, Hey, OK, you're for equal pay. What are you going to make sure I get it? I had a young woman the other day here in Iowa say, I want to go to law school. How can I be sure that if I work hard and do well and get a job, I'm going to get equal pay? And I said, OK, that's the right question because we've been fighting for this. We've made progress, but not near enough. Here's exactly what I think we need to do to get it. Or young women who say, you know, I can't balance family and work. I had a young woman come to see me holding her 9-month-old baby and she said, you know, I can't go back to work until I get my baby stabilized. I need paid family leave. What are you going to do about it? So I think what's happening is, as the campaign goes on, a lot of young people — and let's focus on young women — are moving from the sort of general, either we haven't gone far enough or those fights are over and I don't have to worry about it, to being much more specific. And that is a good development because at the end of our efforts here in the primaries, and if I'm so fortunate enough to get the nomination, then I think we fight out an election between a party that believes we've got to continue to address the lacks in our drive for equality, our drive for justice, whether it's racism, sexism, homophobia, you name it — we need to address those gaps, and the other side doesn't even want to admit they exist. So I think we're going to have a very positive reaction in the general election between, you know, the big deniers on the Republican side, and you know, Let's make progress, get things done, on my side.\nMATTHEWS: Thank you so much. One last — just to clarify what you said about the debate. Would you like the chairman — the chair of the Democratic National Committee, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, to approve the MSNBC/NBC debate next week?\nCLINTON: I would like the chairmen of the party and the campaigns to agree that we can debate in New Hampshire next week.\nMATTHEWS: OK.\nCLINTON: That is what I'm hoping will happen.\nMATTHEWS: OK. Thank you so much. It's been an honor to have you on, Secretary Hillary Clinton from Iowa. Thanks for joining us on HARDBALL tonight.\nCLINTON: Thanks, Chris.

Please remember to keep sending me texts throughout the day using the number 275-236 (ASKBEN). Let's jump into tonight's questions.\nThe first question tonight is from Hal, he asks about \"common core\" and it's \"detrimental effect on effective learning in the classroom.\" Thank you for asking Hal, you know education is one of my passions.\nI have been, and always will be, a proponent for facilitating learning environments that enrich our students, reward excellence and motivate our young ones to dream beyond their current circumstances. A student's mind is more than eager to absorb even more than we often give credit, ready to be challenged and stretched. That is my issue with \"Common Core\" is it lacks Common Sense — why would we place bureaucratic impediments and barriers to learning in front of students, more focused on rote and regurgitation, there is nothing intellectually stimulating about this debacle. There's a lot of rhyme without much reason.\nWhat I will advocate for is empowering local communities, states, parents and students to explore the many opportunities a free-market approach to education will produce: performance-driven curriculum that engages students and allows our amazing teachers to get back to their passion, which is enriching students. The math is simple on this one.\nNext, James asks about ISIS and their \"seemingly emboldened\" international posture, specifically towards America and Israel.\nTimely question James, and yes, I agree. The more we allow these Radical Islamic Terrorists to carry out their mission, unchecked, the more their ranks will feel untouchable. A cancer that is allowed to grow will spread its tentacles until the body is decimated — I, for one, will not allow our hands to sit idly by. As Commander-in-Chief, it will be my priority to protect American interests and innocent lives, of all creeds and religions, from the pointed threats of those championing death rather than life. Period.\nThe time for wishful thinking and capitulation is over — we must not allow the spine of America to be planted firmly in the sand. It will require decisive action with clear and measurable objectives and goals — this war will not be fought from the rear. We are a nation of leaders and operators, a country rooted in bold distinction, ever present to thwart evil when it rears its head. I am confident that given the proper leadership, coalescing our international allies in common purpose, the United States will once again reestablish itself as the force for peace through strength, stability through anchored positional readiness.\nIt starts with calling out the enemy by name. Let's make it official.\nFinally, Karaina asks \"are you prepared for the debate? What do you think about Mr. Trump not showing up?\"\nPrepared, yes. The thing is, Karaina, we should always be prepared to give an account and answer. Whether it is walking on the debate stage, speaking to large crowds at our town halls, or engaging with people every day on the numerous stops throughout the country, I am at ease knowing that I am prepared to talk about important matters because I'm not a politician, I'm person, just like you. It's not about \"sound bites\", it's about sound guidance, wisdom and principles. Those are the core of whatever topic it is I'm addressing. As long as you have your foundation firmly rooted in the truth, facts are sure to follow. It's common sense.\nAs far as Mr. Trump possibly not participating in the debate, I don't really think that any one candidate should be the focus — remember, this is about We the People and representing a multitude of people on that stage tomorrow night, and every day thereafter.\nAgain, thank you for the great questions, I always enjoy spending our evenings together for these chats.\nGoodnight,\nBen", "timestamp": "2016-01-27", "title": "Press Release - #AskBen Fireside Chat - January 27"}

This is Dr. Carson's third plan addressing national security issues announced this month. Combined with plans to overhaul government bureaucracy, the tax code, education and health care, these strategies represent Dr. Carson's extraordinary vision to empower 'We the People' to re-invigorate the nation. The plan is available for download here.\nThe past seven years have seen increasing incidences of terrorism around the world, from the emergence of the Islamic State to the revitalization of the Taliban. Attacks in San Bernardino and Paris highlight the Obama administration's failure to implement a coherent response to radical Islamic terrorism around the globe. Dr. Carson's plan will engage terrorist ideology and strategy head on, recognizing the nature of the enemy this country faces, targeting the threat at its source and protecting the American way of life.\nFirst and foremost, the Carson plan identifies the nature of the threat: a radical ideology that seeks to violently impose Islam on others and supplant existing cultures and duly constituted governments around the world. Dr. Carson's strategy recognizes the reality of global jihadist movements, and counters terrorism not only militarily, but also diplomatically, economically and politically. His plan will defeat the Islamic State, both in Iraq and Syria, as well as in northern Africa where it seeks to gain a new stronghold. Dr. Carson's plan also calls for waging war against the radical Islamic terror movement as a whole, and outlines a unified national response to this grotesque and violent ideology.\n\"A President's most sacred obligation is to protect this great nation from every threat, both foreign and domestic,\" said Dr. Carson. \"Today, radical Islamic terrorism threatens our very existence. Whether through direct violent attacks or 'civilizational jihad,' radical Muslim terrorists wish to destroy America, her allies and her principals. Seven years of failed leadership against this threat has left us more vulnerable than ever. As President, I will unify the national will to confront radical Islamic terrorism in all of its forms.\"", "timestamp": "2016-01-27", "title": "Press Release - Dr. Ben Carson Releases Policy Plan for Defeating the Islamic State and Eliminating the Threat from Radical Islamic Terrorism"}

That candidate is Ohio Gov. John Kasich.\nAmong Republicans hoping to champion the party's chances in November, Kasich's resume is unusually impressive. During his nine terms in Congress representing Ohio, he was a key figure in constructing federal budgets and reducing the national deficit, chairing the House Budget Committee for six years. He also demonstrated considerable knowledge in the areas of defense and foreign policy as an 18-year member of the House Armed Services Committee. After leaving Washington, he eventually returned to Ohio, where he's in his second term as governor of a large and politically diverse state. There, he turned a projected $6 billion state budget deficit into a $2 billion Rainy Day fund.\nIn both roles, Kasich has distinguished himself as a pragmatist, willing to make tough choices even when they go against conventional party wisdom. In Washington, his effort to balance the budget included strong advocacy for reassessing the nation's military bases, closing some and realigning others, and fought to end the expensive B-2 bomber program. While in Congress, he voted for an assault weapons ban and favored background checks at gun shows.\nIn Ohio, he stood out as a Republican governor willing to implement the expansion of Medicaid services through the Affordable Care Act. Criticized by his former tea party supporters for the move, Kasich said two things that are indicative of his leadership style. He noted the program would be paid for mainly by the federal government, including with money Ohioans had sent to Washington and deserved to see return to the state. More to the point, he noted it was simply the right thing to do to help those most in need in his state. While opposing the ACA, he acknowledges that any reworking or replacing of that law needs to include continuing to care for those Americans who have gained coverage through the program.\nRead the entire endorsement here.\nThe Sentinel's endorsement follows closely after five other New Hampshire newspapers' endorsements, including the Concord Monitor, Nashua Telegraph,Valley News, Portsmouth Herald, Foster's Daily Democrat and Bow Times.", "timestamp": "2016-01-27", "title": "Press Release - The Keene Sentinel Supports John Kasich for President"}

It \"blindfolded the American people\" by hiding the tax.\nAs Reagan explains, when the American taxpayer doesn't see the \"hurt\" from taxes, it's easier for liberal politicians to raise them. Cruz's VAT wouldn't show up on income tax returns or sales receipts, but it would hit every American's wages, and raise the price of everything they buy\n2. It empowers big government by creating a huge new revenue source.\nThe U.S. government has never had a VAT before. Lots of European countries do, though.  Having a VAT in addition to income taxes has allowed governments across Europe to explode in size — to the point where in many cases they control way over half of the economy.\n3. It infringes on the tax base of state and local governments, who primarily rely on sales taxes to fund their operations.\nAs a tax on consumption, the VAT is a new way for the federal government to raise revenue, but also one that will be layered on top of state and local sales taxes. That means a really high combined tax rate on everyday purchases in lots of states, higher than in many European countries.\nIf Ronald Reagan could see the problems with a European-style VAT years ago, why can't some Republicans see them today?", "timestamp": "2016-01-27", "title": "Press Release - That Time When Ronald Reagan Opposed the Idea at the Heart of Ted Cruz's Tax Plan"}

In fact, Sanders helped write the Affordable Care Act but says more remains to be done to provide better health care at less cost for all Americans, including the 29 million Americans still without health insurance and millions more who are underinsured. Sanders' proposal would save the typical family more than $5,000 a year.\nHer ad claims she would \"break through the gridlock, not add to it.\" In fact, Sanders has worked with Republicans in Congress to pass major legislation. He worked with Sen. John McCain, for example, to pass a $15 billion bill to improve health care for veterans. McCain praised Sanders' \"record of advocacy for veterans,\" but added, \"I don't see how any veteran … could possibly have any good things, nor could support, her quest for being commander in chief.\"\nClinton insinuated that Sanders attacked Planned Parenthood. In fact, Sanders has a 100 percent lifetime voting record for Planned Parenthood and defended the group against Republican attempts to cut its budget.\nClinton's ad says she would \"stand up to the gun lobby, not protect it.\" Sanders has a D- lifetime rating by the National Rifle Association, supports President Barack Obama's gun safety initiatives. Sanders' advocacy for gun safety dates back to his 1988 congressional campaign, which he lost by 3 points after calling for a ban on assault weapons. Clinton has flip-flopped on gun issues throughout her career. Once an advocate for registering handguns, she became a gun-friendly candidate in 2008 when she tried to portray Obama as too hard on gun owners.\nIn another dig at Sanders, her ad suggests that she would \"lead on foreign policy, not ignore it.\" On the major foreign policy issue of the era, however, she voted for the war in Iraq. Sanders opposed it. He supported President Obama's overture to Iran which resulted in an agreement with world powers to stop Iran from developing a nuclear arsenal. She called President Barack Obama \"naпve\" for even talking to Tehran. She wants a no-fly zone in Syria. He disagrees and instead wants Middle East nations to take the lead in fighting the Islamic State to prevent U.S. forces from being drawn into a perpetual conflict.\nClinton's new ad does not offer any proposals for the future. She doesn't say how she would strengthen Social Security. She doesn't detail a way to combat climate change. She doesn't say why she won't support the leading bills by Democrats in Congress to provide paid family and medical leave.

The members of this team represent not just the thousands of Iowans who have come together to support our campaign, but also the tens of thousands of people who are engaging to help restore the promise of America.\"\nAdditionally the campaign announced 1,573 caucus captains across the state. The announcement marks the final milestone in Cruz's impressive Iowa organization. The campaign is putting its massive Iowa organization to the test this week by mobilizing the grassroots and turning them out to caucus for Cruz.\nAs of last week, over 12,000 volunteers have signed on and are now working to identify and turn out caucus goers for Cruz. Volunteers, on average, are making up to 20,000 phone calls and knocking on 2,000 doors every day. During the month of January, 836 people will have stayed at Camp Cruz, the former college dorms that are filled beyond capacity with volunteers from all over the country, some tripling up in rooms using air mattresses.\nThe Cruz for President Iowa Leadership Team:\nReverend Timothy Fitzner, Adair County — 99 Iowa Pastors\nRobin Schaecer, Adair County — County Chair\nEd Carr, Adams County — County Chair\nPastor Matthew Castle, Allamakee County — 99 Iowa Pastors\nBob Hager, Allamakee County — County Chair\nDennis & Mary Keatley, Allamakee County — County Chairs\nRevelyn Lonning, Allamakee County — County Chair\nRobin Oden, Allamakee County — County Chair\nKeith Schroeder, Allamakee County — County Chair\nPastor Duane Smith, Allamakee County — County Chair, 99 Iowa Pastors\nDr. Gene Bray, Appanoose County — 99 Iowa Pastors\nGreg Fenton, Appanoose County — County Chair\nRep.

The utter horror of the Holocaust must never be forgotten. We mourn for the millions of people who lost their lives and the families who lost their loved ones. And we honor the heroism of the Jewish people – and all those who were persecuted – their courage will always reverberate throughout the world.\n\"Just last week, it was reported that the Israeli citizen and Holocaust survivor Yisrael Kristal is thought to be the world's oldest living person. It's a testament to his incredible fortitude, and to that of so many survivors, and we should seize every opportunity to learn from these living witnesses of that dark chapter in human history. Last year I was honored to spend time with Elie Wiesel and his wife Marion. We spoke about his experiences during the war, what it was like rebuilding his life after all had been destroyed, and the importance of American leadership in the global war against jihad. On the eve of Prime Minister Netanyahu's address to Congress, I was proud to co-host an event with Mr. Wiesel to shed light on the threat of a nuclear Iran to Israel and the United States.\n\"Israel is an everlasting beacon of the faith and strength of the Jewish people. The people of Israel have rebuilt and rededicated the land to justice, freedom, and tolerance. The State of Israel not only welcomes the Jewish people, but also protects vulnerable minorities in the Middle East. Christian, Jewish, and Muslim holy sites are well protected under Israel's domain. We shudder to think what would happen to the Church of Holy Sepulchre in an East Jerusalem under the control of Hamas.\n\"As we honor the memory of the six million, we must rededicate our efforts to fighting tyranny and jihad around the world, to combatting anti-Semitism – whether in Europe or on our own college campuses, and to preventing Iran's Ayatollah Khamenei, or any other dictator, from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. We must defeat evil with truth and resolve – and that begins with honoring the brave survivors and victims so that together we ensure that never again does such an atrocity occur.\"", "timestamp": "2016-01-27", "title": "Statement by Senator Ted Cruz on International Holocaust Remembrance Day"}

I am grateful to have their support and look forward to working together to awaken people of faith in our nation.\"\nDr. Chuck Harding is a missionary evangelist.

{"author": "Ted Cruz", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=114969", "text": "This coalition boasts a diverse group of National Co-Chairs representing virtually every perspective on the pro-life spectrum\nHOUSTON, Texas – Presidential candidate Ted Cruz will today announce his pro-life coalition at a pro-life rally in Des Moines, Iowa. Tony Perkins, President of Family Research Council is the Chair of Pro-Lifers for Cruz and will be participating in the rally as Cruz announces the group, which already has 17,334 members. Cruz has always strongly advocated for the sanctity of life and believes every life matters and should be protected by law. He has been on the forefront of this battle his entire adult life, from winning a case before the Supreme Court banning partial birth abortion to leading the fight to remove federal funding for Planned Parenthood.\nThe pro-life coalition will be chaired by Tony Perkins, President of Family Research Council. Co-Chairs will include former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli; Carol Everett, Founder and President of Heidi Group and former abortion clinic owner; Jewels Green, former abortion clinic worker; Rebecca Hagelin, bestselling author and pro-life speaker; abortion survivor Gianna Jessen; Jason Jones, award winning filmmaker and pro-life activist; South Carolina Representative Wendy Nanney; Troy Newman, President of Operation Rescue; Iowa Right to Life Board Member Loras Schulte; and Dave Sterrett, pro-life activist and author.\n\"I am encouraged by the incredible passion and support seen in these pro-life leaders who have coalesced behind our shared cause,\" said Cruz. \"Every single National Co-Chair in this coalition has led the charge for the pro-life cause and is a true inspiration. Without life, we have no liberty. The right to life is a pillar of our country and a God-given right that we must fight to protect. I am encouraged by the large number of people who have already signed up to take on this fight with me and look forward to what this coalition will be able to achieve under the incredible leadership of the Pro-Lifers for Cruz Coalition.\"\nTony Perkins, President of Family Research Council, said, \"Senator Cruz understands what it means to fight for life. Through the countless battles Ted has led on pro-life issues, he has been steadfast and hasn't forgotten what the people elected him to do. There is an unmistakable power and conviction when he speaks for those who do not have a voice that resonates with the pro-life community. I am proud to offer my support to Ted Cruz in this election, someone we can trust to do what he says he is going to do.\"\nAs President of FRC, Perkins has expanded the organization's reach across the nation by building a major network of pastors and churches, encouraging them to impact the culture by thinking nationally, but acting locally. Perkins is also an ordained minister and remains active in Christian ministries serving as an elder in his home church and frequently filling pulpits across the country. He is a board member of Caring to Love Ministries, one of Louisiana's largest pregnancy resource centers, a trustee of Louisiana College, and a member of the Louisiana Commission on Law Enforcement. He also serves as president of the Council for National Policy.\nKen Cuccinelli, former Virginia Attorney General, said, \"There are so many issues where a reliable pro-life President is critical, there's not enough time to discuss them during one campaign,\" Ken said. \"But I trust Ted to appoint good judges, I trust Ted to put the United Nations in its place and to protect life internationally, and I trust Ted to be pro-life when it comes to the federal budget. Planned Parenthood will be defunded under a President Cruz. Our government will once again be supportive of life, instead of looking for ways to fund abortion.\"\nFirst as a Virginia State Senator, then as Virginia's Attorney General, Ken Cuccinelli was a leader in protecting life in Virginia — a fact still visible on Virginia's roadways, where the Choose Life license plates on thousands of cars still testify to one of Ken's numerous pro-life victories. Whether it was drafting Virginia's parental consent laws or efforts to protect women through health and safety standards at abortion clinics, Attorney General Cuccinelli made supporting life part of his mission in public office.\nCarol Everett, after being a part of the abortion industry, came to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ, changed directions, and devoted her life to helping other women with the choice of life, both physical and eternal. Carol is the Founder and CEO of The Heidi Group located in Round Rock, Texas.\nJewels Green is a former abortion clinic worker who was pressured into an abortion as a teenager and survived a subsequent suicide attempt. She is a mother, writer, public speaker, volunteer, and tireless advocate for the right to life from conception to natural death. Jewels is featured in the documentary film 40 and her candid articles have been published online and in print.\nRebecca Hagelin, bestselling author and pro-life speaker, said, \"Senator Cruz is the only candidate with the proven comprehensive track record of how to actually protect life. From leading the battle on Capitol Hill with life saving legislation, to saving lives through winning pro-life victories at the Supreme Court, Ted Cruz has defeated the death sentences of the innocent at every turn,\" said Rebecca. \"He knows that victory for the preborn, the ill, the disabled and the elderly must be secured in all three branches of government, and he knows how to do it. When Ted Cruz becomes president, America's powerful and redemptive prolife era will begin!\"\nRebecca Hagelin has advocated pro-life, family, faith, and freedom policy for over 25 years. A former vice president of The Heritage Foundation, Rebecca is a columnist, public speaker, and author of Home Invasion: Protecting Your Family in a Culture That's Gone Stark Raving Mad and 30 Ways in 30 Days to Protect Your Family.\nGianna Jessen, abortion survivor, said, \"I always say that men are born to defend women and children, not sit idly by, or be passive when they are being harmed,\" Gianna said. \"Senator Cruz has been absolutely courageous in his defense of the unborn, and willing to stand alone. As someone who was born in an abortion clinic in Los Angeles, someone who lived through an abortion, I applaud that courage.\"\nGianna Jessen is the survivor of a failed saline abortion. The failed abortion also provided the \"gift\" of cerebral palsy, as she calls it. Gianna uses her ability to touch people's hearts with her story and serves as an outspoken disabilities and pro-life activist. She has testified before Congress twice and continues to travel the world speaking out for those who can't.\nJason Scott Jones is a filmmaker and human rights activist. Because of his personal experience with abortion, he became a pro-life activist at age 17 and has not stopped working since—on campus, in the Hawaii legislature, in crisis pregnancy centers across America, on Capital Hill, and in Hollywood. His film projects include Bella, a pro-life movie, The Stoning of Soraya M., Crescendo, and Sing a Little Louder. He is the author of The Race to Save Our Century, and the upcoming The World Is On Fire, and a regular columnist at TheStream.org.\nWendy Nanney is a member of the South Carolina House of Representatives. First elected to the state house in 2008, Nanney worked for passage of a 24-Hour abortion bill that requires women seeking abortion to wait 24 hours after they have arrived at the clinic. In 2014 Nanney sponsored the \"Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act\" which would prohibit abortions on unborn babies after 20 weeks' gestation. Her work for the unborn in South Carolina is tireless and honorable and is seen everyday in the South Carolina House of Representatives.\nTroy Newman is the president of Operation Rescue, one of the leading pro-life Christian activist organizations in the nation and a founding board member for the Center for Medial Progress. He has been involved in the pro-life community for over 20 years, starting in 1991 as the Operation Rescue West president. He is also a published author, having written Their Blood Cries Out and his most recent book Abortion Free.\nLoras Schulte has been actively involved in the pro-life movement for the last 30 years of his life. Loras sits on the board of Iowa Right to Life and serves on the board of Bridgehaven, a crisis pregnancy center. Loras was instrumental in the production of the Cedar Rapids Gazette list of 10,000 names who believe the cost of an abortion is One Human Life.\nDave Sterrett is the President of Disruptive Truth and the \"We Choose Life\" initiative. He is the author and co-author of eight books, including the Wall Street Journal bestseller I Am Second (Thomas Nelson) and Aborting Aristotle (St. Augustine's Press).\nLast week, Cruz wrote an op-ed for The Resurgent on the 43rd anniversary of Roe v.

{"author": "Mike Huckabee", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116424", "text": "By Mary Beth Brown\nA few years ago I wrote a biography of Ronald Reagan. I spent hundreds of hours extensively researching, studying and interviewing people close to President Reagan.\nNow, I have spent countless hours getting to know, observe and study many of the GOP presidential candidates. And I've been struck by an uncanny likeness between Reagan and Mike Huckabee.\nNot only are their personalities, styles and temperaments much alike, but they share many of the same principals, beliefs, talents and gifts, on top of having many similar experiences in their lives. I don't make these comparisons lightly. Here are some of the reasons why I think they are so similar.\nThe common thread begins in their backgrounds. Reagan and Huckabee successfully held the political office of governor of their state for two terms. Less well known is that before politics, Huckabee, like Reagan, worked in TV and radio.\nThe leadership strength both share is they are master communicators. The main essence of communication is to connect with others, and impart and share information or ideas. Both men share the keen ability to take complex ideas and difficult-to-understand problems and explain them in clear, concise and easy-to-understand ways.\n\"A leader,\" Huckabee explains, \"is the one who can outline the broad vision and the direction, and say here's where we are going to go, here's why we need to go there, and here's how we are going to get there.\"\nReagan and Huckabee are deep thinkers, but they both explain things in a very natural and easy-to-understand manner, often using metaphors and analogies. Pundits and journalists make the mistake of assuming them not to be deep thinkers, but this is contrarily so, because it takes a great deal of intelligence and unique ability to take the complex and paint word pictures and stories with examples to help clearly explain a multifaceted situation, or take a gigantic numerical figure and relate it to a common object as a way of explanation.\nEarly on, some intellectuals erroneously assumed the ability to speak clearly and naturally to everyday people, as Reagan did, was the result of simple thinking. However, quite the opposite was true. It takes a very gifted and skilled communicator to achieve this ability.\nAnother huge leadership quality and advantage both share is their optimism, cheerfulness, sense of humor and storytelling. In fact, what might come as a surprise to some is the importance storytelling can play in the lives of extraordinary leaders. Think Lincoln, Churchill and Roosevelt in addition to Reagan.\nAnother shared trait is Reagan's and Huckabee's sense of humor. Leadership studies have shown it's a powerful tool and sign of intelligence. A cleverly placed joke can ease stress, decrease conflict and increases comradery, cohesiveness and bonding in groups. Motivational speaker Mike Kerr says humor can boost morale, motivate people, increases communication and builds trust and relationships.\nAfter almost 8 years of Barack Obama, division and strife have grown rampant among Americans. Our nation sorely needs to unite. Reagan was masterful at uniting Americans, as now Huckabee seeks to do. By having a great sense of humor, Reagan and Huckabee found a good way to express something that's hard for some people to hear, but softens it while getting the idea or message across without sounding too harsh.\nNeither Reagan or Huckabee are narcissistic and self-centered, like some politicians. \"Candidates don't run for themselves; they run for the future,\" Huckabee said in October. And Reagan had a saying on his desk in the White House that read, \"There is no limit to what a man can do or where he can go if he doesn't mind who gets the credit.\"\nThis column originally ran on WesternJournalism.com.", "timestamp": "2016-01-27", "title": "Press Release - You'll Be Shocked Which GOP Candidate This NYT Bestselling Author Likens To Ronald Reagan"}

That's because it was written by people who didn't want you to understand it. But as someone who spent three years working for Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, take it from me—this is a huge deal for women across the state.\nTo put it in simpler terms: Right now, the state of Louisiana has six licensed abortion providers. If this law had been upheld, that number would have dropped to two.\nThere are more than 4.5 million people living in Louisiana. This mandate, and similar restrictions in other states, make it incredibly difficult for women (especially low-income women and women of color) to exercise their reproductive rights—and can make doing so a costly, onerous thing to do.\nI am thrilled that the court has protected abortion access—especially in a state where women's rights are constantly being threatened. But this fight is not over.\nLaws like this are popping up all over the country, all with one purpose: to eliminate access to safe and legal abortion, or make a constitutional right a privilege only for those who can afford it. And this year, the Supreme Court will rule on the constitutionality of a similar law in my home state of Texas that amounts to the biggest challenge to Roe v. Wade in a generation.\nThat's one of the reasons I joined Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.

Bryce worked there part time for years before he had the opportunity to purchase it as a fresh college graduate of the University of Northern Iowa. And although Bryce is thrilled to be a new small-business owner—doing something he loves—he also has nearly $40,000 of student debt to repay. In fact, his student loans are his biggest business expense.\nBRYCE: New college graduates, they may not want to go to big corporations for 10, 15, 20 years before they start their business. A lot of us have ... fresh ideas that we want to do now, and we have the motivation, too. ... So that's my biggest thing, is the barrier of entry and financing.\nHILLARY: This is a really important point. We all know about the student loan debt, but I've never heard anyone so persuasively link it to the slowdown in business startups. ... we've got to tackle this student debt problem. ... You've given me an insight that nobody else has.\nAs promised, Hillary came to Bryce's bowling alley in Adel to talk about what we can do to help young people achieve their dreams—and that includes making college more affordable and helping people pay off their student loan debt.\n\"Bryce's story is so touching,\" Hillary said. \"This is the community where he grew up, this is where he worked as a young man, high school and college, and he cared so much about what this business provided to Adel. ... He was describing his dream of someday owning it and then getting his chance to try to do that and what he wanted to build because of it.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118055", "text": "Today, the White House will host a conversation about child hunger in America, with experts and direct service providers discussing how hunger continues to harm children across the country. Participants will discuss the role of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and other core nutrition programs in ensuring American children have the fuel they need to thrive. The conversation will include SNAP recipients, academics, direct service providers, advocates, faith leaders, and federal, state, and local officials and will focus on the critical role of SNAP in reducing food insecurity and poverty, and the high-cost consequences when benefits are not enough to sustain a family to the end of the month. The agenda for today's event is available  HERE.\nThe Obama Administration is dedicated to ensuring American children and families have the support they need to build a better future, especially when weathering life's ups and downs, such as loss of a job, illness, or work that pays less than a livable wage. SNAP and other nutrition programs, like school meals, make a real and measurable difference in the lives of children and their families and provide a stronger future for the entire country. Building on its commitment to expanding access to opportunity for all, today the Obama Administration will announce additional actions to ensure American children have the food they need to grow, learn, and succeed.\nNEW FEDERAL ACTIONS\nEnsuring all low-income children have year-round access to the food they need to learn and grow.\nThe President's FY2017 Budget will invest $12 billion over ten years to reduce child hunger during the summer through a permanent Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer for Children (Summer EBT) program to provide supplemental food benefits during the summer months for all families with children eligible for free and reduced price school meals. During the academic year, school meals help ensure consistent and adequate access to nutritious food for the nearly 22 million low-income children who receive free and reduced price school meals. However, only a fraction of these children receive free and reduced price meals when school is out of session. As a result, low-income children are at higher risk of food insecurity and poor nutrition during the summer. Summer EBT, which provides benefits on an electronic debit card that can only be used for food at the grocery store, fills the food budget gap in the summer; rigorous evaluations of USDA pilots of Summer EBT programs have found that they can significantly reduce food insecurity among children and improve their diet.\nAllowing States to use Medicaid data to automatically link low-income children to school meals.\nUSDA will announce a new initiative to increase access to school meals for low-income children through a project that will allow interested State agencies that administer the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) to use Medicaid data to certify students for free and reduced priced lunches. This will link eligible children to nutritious school meals with less paperwork for the State, schools and families alike. Interested states are invited to submit applications and USDA expects to approve approximately five States to begin the demonstrations during the upcoming school year (2016-2017), with additional states implementing the pilot in the subsequent years. USDA is committed to helping 20 States take up this pilot and begin implementing direct certification using Medicaid data over the next three school years.\nBUILDING ON RESEARCH DEMONSTRATING SNAP'S CRITICAL ROLE IN HELPING CHILDREN SUCCEED\nIn 2014, nearly one in seven American households experienced food insecurity, meaning that one or more household members did not have a consistent source of adequate nutritious food. Moreover, 40 percent of all food-insecure households—and nearly 6 percent of US households overall—were considered to have very low food security. This means that, in nearly seven million households, at least one person in the household missed meals and experienced disruptions in food intake due to insufficient resources for food.\nA report released last month by the White House Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) found that SNAP, the largest federal food and nutrition program, plays an essential role in reducing poverty and food insecurity, and significantly improves the health and wellbeing of low-income families. In 2014 SNAP lifted at least 4.7 million Americans out of poverty, including 2.1 million children, and today helps families across the nation to put food on the table while they work to improve their economic situation. Research shows that among households who receive SNAP, food insecurity rates are up to 30 percent lower than they otherwise would be. But in spite of SNAP's success, hunger remains a stubborn problem, in part because for many benefits are inadequate to provide enough healthful food to children and families living on a tight budget.\nNew research cited in the CEA report has linked diminished food budgets at the end of each month to significant consequences, including:\n• A drop-off in caloric intake among SNAP recipients, with estimates of this decline ranging from 10 to 25 percent over the course of the month;\n• A 27 percent increase in the rate of hospital admissions due to low blood sugar for low-income adults between the first and last week of the month;\n• An 11 percent increase in the rate of disciplinary actions among school children in SNAP households between the first and last week of the month;\n• Diminished student performance on standardized tests, with performance improving only gradually again after the next month's benefits are received.\nToday's event builds on this commitment to high quality research and will feature perspectives from leading food security and nutrition researchers on the critical role of SNAP in reducing food insecurity and poverty, as well as in improving long-run health, education, and economic outcomes. The panel members, and resources to learn more about their work, are provided below. These resources are provided for informational purposes only and their inclusion does not indicate endorsement by, or the official views of, the U.S. Government:\n• Dr. Hilary Hoynes, Professor of Public Policy and Economics, Haas Distinguished Chair in Economic Disparities, Goldman School of Public Policy, University of California Berkeley: Dr. Hoynes has reviewed the role that SNAP plays in reducing poverty and food insecurity in the U.S. and examined the degree to which the program helps to buffer the impact of recessions and stagnating wages. More information on Dr. Hoynes' research is available  HERE.\n• Dr. Diane Whitmore Schanzenbach, Faculty Fellow, Institute for Policy Research Associate Professor, Human Development and Social Policy, Northwestern University School of Education and Social Policy, Chicago, IL; Director of the Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution: Dr. Schanzenbach, along with her coauthor, Hilary Hoynes, has studied the extent to which SNAP acts as an investment in children's long term outcomes and its payoff for both recipients and taxpayers. More information on Dr. Schanzenbach's research is available HERE.\n• Dr. Adam Drewnowski, Director, Nutritional Sciences Program, School of Public Health, University of Washington, Seattle, WA: Dr. Drewnowski has written about the relationship between diet quality and food cost, including whether inadequate food budgets pose a significant barrier to the adoption of nutrient-adequate diets. More information on Dr. Drewnowski's research is available  HERE.\n• Dr. Hilary Seligman, Associate Professor, University of California San Francisco School of Medicine, San Francisco, CA; Lead Scientist, Feeding America: Dr. Seligman has summarized research on the connections between food insecurity and health, highlighting some of the medical costs that result from insufficient food budgets. More information on Dr. Seligman's research is available  HERE.\n• Dr. Parke Wilde, Associate Professor, Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy, Tufts University, Medford, MA. Dr. Wilde has reviewed recent research on initiatives that enhance SNAP and other benefits to improve recipient households' success in achieving a high-quality diet, including USDA's Summer EBT demonstration and the Healthy Incentives Pilot. More information on Dr. Wilde's research is available  HERE.\nThe event will also feature local and national leaders who see hunger's effects first hand—in doctors' offices, classrooms, and communities: Dr. Sandra Hassink, Immediate Past President of the American Academy of Pediatrics; Dawn Pierce, mother, licensed practical nurse, and a former SNAP recipient from Boise, Idaho; Clint Mitchell, Principal at Bel Air Elementary School in Virginia; Carlos Rodriguez, executive director of the Food Bank of Monmouth and Ocean Counties in New Jersey; and Les Johnson with Area Resources for Community and Human Services, which participated in the Summer EBT for Children pilots in Missouri.\nToday's announcements build on ongoing efforts to ensure all children have the opportunity to reach their full potential.\nOver the past seven years, the Obama Administration has put in place an historic set of policies to expand opportunity for all Americans. The President, working with Congress, acted to prevent millions from falling into poverty, particularly through the Recovery Act. The Administration championed expansions of the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit for working families, which reduce the extent or severity of poverty for more than 16 million people - including about 8 million children - each year. Through the Affordable Care Act, almost 18 million people have gained health insurance and, for the first time on record, more than 90 percent of Americans have health insurance. Family homelessness has been reduced by 19 percent since 2010. And unemployment has been cut in half, to 5 percent.\nThe Administration has also developed several initiatives to improve food security and nutrition for vulnerable children. Through the Community Eligibility Provision, schools in high-poverty areas are now able to offer free breakfast and lunch to all students with significantly less administrative burden. And revisions to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) added a cash benefit to allow participants to purchase fruits and vegetables, a change that substantially increased the value of the package.\nStates and counties are essential in connecting kids to federal nutrition programs. Today, the Administration is highlighting the efforts of State and local leaders that are spearheading aggressive efforts to tackle child hunger. For example, states including Florida, Michigan, Montana, Virginia, and Washington have publicly prioritized combatting childhood hunger, with a particular focus on expanding access to school breakfast programs and adoption of community eligibility:\n• In the 2011-2012 school year, Michigan became one the first states to adopt the community eligibility option, paving the way for other states to learn from their efforts. For the 2010-2011 school year, Michigan directly certified 72 percent of children in households receiving SNAP benefits who were eligible for direct certification. Over the next few years, Michigan substantially increased its direct certification rate, reaching 87 percent in the 2013-2014 school year.\n• Montana's efforts, led by the Governor and First Lady, have made it the state with the highest take up of community eligibility in the nation, with nearly all eligible schools' participation.\n• Also with leadership from the First Lady, Virginia is using an $8.8 million demonstration award from USDA to work toward the end child hunger in the Commonwealth, with a strong focus on expanding participation in the school breakfast program.\n• California is proposing investing new State resources to improving the operations of their nutrition programs with a goal of connecting 400,000 eligible children to nutrition programs over the next two years.\n• Colorado has created a streamlined online portal for a wide array of nutrition programs as a strategy to consolidate and simplify the application process, thus improving access for busy working families.\nOther landmark accomplishments by the Obama Administration to create opportunity for America's children include the Healthy, Hunger Free Kids Act, which updated school nutrition standards for the first time in fifteen years; reforms to K-12 education including the Every Student Succeeds Act; expanding access to high quality early education through investments and quality improvements in Head Start, preschool, and child care; and championing both universal pre-K and access to free community college.", "timestamp": "2016-01-27", "title": "Fact Sheet: Obama Administration Announces Major Investments in Preventing Child Hunger"}

Just today, the Wall Street Journal wrote about how Bernie Sanders is using his stump speech to attack Secretary Clinton's character. Last year, after a reporter called to question it, the Sanders campaign was forced to take down a negative online ad when Sanders himself admitted it crossed the line in attacking Secretary Clinton.\nAnd this month, the Sanders campaign faced criticism for running a TV ad that was an implicit attack on Hillary Clinton.\n* MSNBC: \"[Sanders is] broadcasting a paid TV ad with that message is a major escalation, and a potentially risky one for a candidate who has vowed not to go negative.\"\n* TIME: Sanders Hits Clinton With a Roundabout Jab in New Ad\n* Washington Examiner's Ariel Cohen: \"Sanders once vowed to run a \"positive campaign\" but that's changed since he surpassed Clinton in the polls.\n* Huffington Post's Sam Stein: Bernie's campaign will protest. But this is an attack ad even if he doesn't mention Clinton by name\n* The Hill: Sanders ad hits Clinton on Wall Street\n* Politico: New Sanders ad lands indirect hit on Clinton\nAs the Iowa caucus has drawn nearer, Sanders has even taken to making personal attacks on Clinton. And now, under pressure with just five days left until the contest, the campaign is going public with active discussions about launching \"direct\" attacks against Hillary Clinton on TV—and the Clinton campaign has released a new video highlighting the difference between Senator Sanders' previous claims and his recent attacks. Watch the video here: https://youtu.be/PydyTQXs59E\n\"It's disappointing that Senator Sanders has abandoned his claims of a positive campaign in order to parrot Karl Rove's attacks against Hillary Clinton.

Dermer; Nina Totenberg, legal affairs correspondent, NPR; Sens. Lamar A. Alexander and Robert P. Corker, Jr.; Nobel Prize winner, author, and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel; Israel Meir Lau, chairman, Yad Vashem Council; and New York City resident Elizabeth Wilk, who sought shelter with Walery and Maryla Zbijewski in Warsaw, Poland, during the Nazi occupation and later emigrated to the U.S.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111488", "text": "Thank you. Good evening. Erev tov. [Laughter]\nThe Talmud teaches that if a person destroys one life, it is as if they've destroyed an entire world, and if a person saves one life, it is as if they've saved an entire world. What an extraordinary honor to be with you as we honor four righteous individuals whose courage is measured in the lives they saved—one child, one refugee, one comrade at a time—and who, in so doing, helped save our world.\nI deliver a lot of speeches. Very rarely am I so humbled by the eloquence that has preceded me, and not just in words, but in the acts that we commemorate today.\nTo my dear friend Steven Spielberg, thanks for your moving and generous words. You spoke of the importance of finding your voice and using it for good, and I know that your work—whether a masterpiece like \"Schindler's List\" or the stories that you have so persistently preserved through the Shoah Foundation—is deeply personal. Steven once said that the story of the Shoah is the story that he was born to tell, rooted in those childhood memories that he just gave you a taste of: the relatives lost, the stories you heard from your family. And, Steven, the whole world is grateful that you found your voice, and for the good that you've done with that voice. It will endure for generations. And so, on behalf of all of us, we are grateful.\nTo Ambassador and Mrs. Dermer, to Nina Totenberg, our friends from the Israeli Embassy and Yad Vashem: Thank you so much for hosting us today.\nLet me just add tonight that our thoughts are also with former Israeli President Shimon Peres. I had the opportunity to speak with Shimon earlier this week. I thanked him for his friendship, which has always meant so much to me personally. And I thanked him once again for the shining example of his leadership. With his extraordinary life—in the Haganah and as a founding father of the State of Israel, a statesman who has never given up on peace, an embodiment of the great alliance between our two nations—Shimon inspires us all. And this evening we speak for all of us—Israelis, Americans, people around the world—in wishing him a full and speedy recovery.\nI also want to just note the presence of two of our outstanding Senators from the great State of Tennessee. I know that it's rare where you have such a extraordinary native of the State being honored in this way, but I think it's also worth noting that this represents the bipartisan and steadfast support of Members of Congress for the security and prosperity of the State of Israel. And they act on that every single day.\nThe survivors, families of the righteous and those they saved, to all the distinguished guests: We gather to honor the newest of the Righteous Among the Nations and make real the call to \"never forget,\" not just on this Day of Remembrance, but for all days and for all time.\nAnd at moments like this, as I listened to the extraordinary stories of the four that we honor, memories come rushing back of the times that I've encountered the history and the horror of the Shoah: growing up, hearing the stories of my great uncle who helped liberate Ohrdruf, part of Buchenwald, and who returned home so shaken by the suffering that he had seen that my grandmother would tell me he did not speak to anyone for 6 months, just went up in his attic, couldn't fully absorb the horror that he had witnessed.\nThen having the opportunity to go to Buchenwald myself with my dear friend Elie Wiesel, and seeing the ovens, the Little Camp where he was held as a boy. Standing with survivors in the old Warsaw Ghetto. And then the extraordinary honor of walking through Yad Vashem with Rabbi Lau and seeing the faces and hearing the voices of the lost of blessed memory. And then, taking my own daughters to visit the Holocaust Museum, because our children must know this chapter of our history and that we must never repeat it.\nThe four lives we honor tonight make a claim on our conscience, as well as our moral imagination. We hear their stories, and we are forced to ask ourselves, under the same circumstances, how would we act? How would we answer God's question, where are you? Would we show the love of Walery and Maryla Zbijewski? [Laughter] Not bad, right? There, in Warsaw, they could have been shot for opening their home to a 5-year-old girl. Yet they cared for her like one of their own, gave her safety and shelter and moments of warmth, of family and music, a shield from the madness outside until her mother could return.\nWould we have the extraordinary compassion of Lois Gunden? She wrote that she simply hoped to \"add just another ray of love to the lives of these youngsters\" who had already endured so much. And by housing and feeding as many Jewish children as she could, her ray of love always shone through and still burns within the families of those she saved.\nWould we have the courage of Master Sergeant Roddie Edmonds? I know your dad said he was just doing his job, but he went above and beyond the call of duty, and so did all those who joined in that line. Faced with a choice of giving up his fellow soldiers or saving his own life, Roddie looked evil in the eye and dared a Nazi to shoot. His moral compass never wavered. He was true to his faith, and he saved some 200 Jewish American soldiers as a consequence. It's an instructive lesson, by the way, for those of us Christians. I cannot imagine a greater expression of Christianity to say, I, too, am a Jew.\nAnd I ask these questions because, even as the Holocaust is unique, a crime without parallel in history, the seeds of hate that gave rise to the Shoah—the ignorance that conspires with arrogance, the indifference that betrays compassion—those seeds have always been with us. They have found root across cultures and across faiths and across generations. The Ambassador mentioned the story of Cain and Abel. It's deep within us. And too often, especially in times of change, especially in times of anxiety and uncertainty, we are too willing to give into a base desire to find someone else—someone different—to blame for our struggles.\nSo here, tonight we must confront the reality that around the world, anti-Semitism is on the rise. We cannot deny it. When we see some Jews leaving European cities, where their families have lived for generations, because they no longer feel safe; when Jewish centers are targeted from Mumbai to Overland Park, Kansas; when swastikas appear on college campuses—when we see all that and more, we must not be silent.\nAn attack on any faith is an attack on all of our faiths. It is an attack on that Golden Rule at the heart of so many faiths: that we ought to do unto others as we would have done to us. For Americans, in particular, we should understand that it's an attack on our diversity, on the very idea that people of different backgrounds can live together and thrive together. Which is why—your father was right—we are all Jews. Because anti-Semitism is a distillation, an expression of an evil that runs through so much of human history, and if we do not answer that, we do not answer any other form of evil. When any Jew anywhere is targeted just for being Jewish, we all have to respond as Roddie Edmonds did: \"We are all Jews.\"\nWe know that we'll never be able to wipe out hatred from every single mind. We won't entirely erase the scourge of anti-Semitism. But like the righteous, we must do everything we can. All of us have a responsibility.\nCertainly, Government has a responsibility. As President, I've made sure that the United States is leading the global fight against anti-Semitism. And it's why, with Israel and countries around the world, we organized the first United Nations General Assembly meeting on anti-Semitism. It's why we've urged other nations to dedicate a Special Envoy to this threat, as we have.\nIt's why, when a statue of an anti-Semitic leader from World War II was planned in Hungary, we led the charge to convince their Government to reverse course. This was not a side note to our relations with Hungary, this was central to maintaining a good relationship with the United States, and we let them know.\nIt's why, when voices around the world veer from criticism of a particular Israeli policy to an unjust denial of Israel's right to exist, when Israel faces terrorism, we stand up forcefully and proudly in defense of our ally, in defense of our friend, in defense of the Jewish State of Israel. America's commitment to Israel's security remains, now and forever, unshakeable. And I've said this before: It would be a fundamental moral failing if America broke that bond.\nAll nations that prize diversity and tolerance and pluralism must speak out whenever and wherever Jews and other religious minorities are attacked. In recent years, we've seen leaders in France, Germany, and Great Britain stand strongly against anti-Semitism. In Israel, President Rivlin has spoken eloquently about the need for tolerance and acceptance among all Israelis, Jewish and Arab.\nMeanwhile, Governments have an obligation to care for the survivors of the Shoah, because no one who endured that horror should have to scrape by in their golden years. So, with our White House initiative, we're working to improve care for Holocaust survivors in need here in the United States. And with the compensation fund we helped to create, claims are finally being paid that even more Jews deported from France during the Holocaust, including survivors here in America, can benefit from.\nBut the task before us does not fall on Government alone. Every faith community has a responsibility. And just as all religions speak out against those who try to twist their faith to justify terrorism and violence, just as all faiths need to speak out when interpretations of their religion veer in an ugly direction, so too must they speak out against those who use their faith to justify bias against Jews or people of any faith.\nWe know that there were Muslims—from Albanians to Arabs—who protected Jews from Nazis. In Morocco, leaders from Muslim-majority countries around the world just held a summit on protecting religious minorities, including Jews and Christians. His Holiness Pope Francis has spoken forcefully against anti-Semitism, saying, \"Every human being, as a creature of God, is our brother, regardless of his origins or religious beliefs.\" These are the voices we must heed. And anyone who claims to be a religious leader must project that vision, that truth.\nAnd finally, all of us have a responsibility to speak out and to teach what's right to our children and to examine our own hearts. That's the lesson of the righteous we honor today, the lesson of the Holocaust itself: Where are you? Who are you? That's the question that the Holocaust poses to us. We have to consider—even in moments of peril, even when we might fear for our own lives—the fact that none of us are powerless. We always have a choice. And today, for most of us, standing up against intolerance doesn't require the same risks that those we honor today took. It doesn't require imprisonment or that we face down the barrel of a gun. It does require us to speak out. It does require us to stand firm. We know that evil can flourish if we stand idly by.\nAnd so we're called to live in a way that shows that we've actually learned from our past. And that means rejecting indifference. It means cultivating a habit of empathy and recognizing ourselves in one another; to make common cause with the outsider, the minority, whether that minority is Christian or Jew, whether it is Hindu or Muslim or a nonbeliever; whether that minority is native born or immigrant; whether they're Israeli or Palestinian.\nIt means taking a stand against bigotry in all its forms and rejecting our darkest impulses and guarding against tribalism as the only value in our communities and in our politics. It means heeding the lesson repeated so often in the Torah—to welcome the stranger—for we were once strangers too. That's how we never forget: not simply by keeping the lessons of the Shoah in our memories, but by living them in our actions. As the book of Deuteronomy teaches us, \"Tzedek, Tzedek tirdof\"—\"Justice, Justice you shall pursue.\"\nI want to close with what I'm told is a Jewish legend. It's said that within every generation there are 36 virtuous individuals: individuals so honorable, so filled with compassion, that their good works sustain the very existence of the world. They are called Lamed Vovniks, and without them, society crumbles, according to the legend. We don't know who they are. They're entirely indistinguishable, ordinary people, like Walery and Maryla and Lois and Roddie. You wouldn't necessarily recognize them in a crowd. But I believe that their generation—the generation of Schindler and Wallenberg and Karski—demanded a lot more than 36. It called for more than 26,000 Righteous Among the Nations. It called for the millions of heroes who did not go quietly and who stood up and fought back.\nAnd may we all strive to live up to their noble example, to be the Lamed Vovniks of our generation, to do our part to sustain each other and to embrace the humanity that we share, and in so doing, save our world. May the memory of the lost be a blessing. And as nations and individuals, may we always strive be among the righteous.\nGod bless you. God bless the United States of America. And God bless the State of Israel.", "timestamp": "2016-01-27", "title": "Remarks at a Ceremony Honoring Recipients of the Righteous Among the Nations Medal at the Embassy of Israel"}

[laughter]\nWe have a crowd of about 1,600 here, and while they have agreed to respect the candidates and listen intently, we can tell you they are very excited to be here. Am I right? [applause]\nKELLY: So let's get started.\nSenator Cruz, before we get to the issues, let's address the elephant not in the room tonight. [laughter]\nDonald Trump has chosen not to attend this evening's presidential debate. What message do you think that sends to the voters of Iowa?\nCRUZ: Well, Megyn, let me say at the outset to the men and women of Iowa, thank you for the incredible hospitality over this past year.\nBy Monday, you will have welcomed me into all 99 counties in Iowa. You will have welcomed my dad to preach at your churches. You will have welcomed Heidi and our girls, Caroline and Catherine, into your homes. And I'm so grateful for the diligence, for the seriousness with which the men and women of Iowa approach this process.\nIf I am elected president, keep an eye on the tarmac, because I'll be back, because Iowa in 2017 will not be fly-over country. It will be fly-to country. [applause]\nNow, secondly, let me say I'm a maniac and everyone on this stage is stupid, fat, and ugly. And Ben, you're a terrible surgeon. [laughter] Now that we've gotten the Donald Trump portion out of the way... [laughter and applause]\nI want to thank everyone here for showing the men and women of Iowa the respect to show up and make the case to the people of this state and the people of the country why each of us believe we would make the best commander in chief. [applause]\nKELLY: The divide between you and Mr. Trump has turned into one of the biggest stories in the country. And for six months that — your campaign, during this campaign, you praised Mr. Trump as somebody who you thought was an effective voice against the Washington cartel. You said you were glad that he was running as a Republican.\nBut when he started to criticize you, your message changed, and you suddenly started to portray him as the voice of the Washington cartel, and suggested he would do the Democrats' bidding. Which is it?\nCRUZ: Well, let me be clear, if Donald engages in insults or anybody else, I don't intend to reciprocate. I have not insulted Donald personally and I don't intend to.\nI am glad Donald is running. I'm glad he has produced enormous enthusiasm, and, every Donald Trump voter or potential voter, I hope to earn your support. I know everyone else on this stage hopes to earn your support.\nNow, there is a difference between personal insults and attacks — between going into the mud with ad hominems and focusing on issues and substance. CRUZ: I think issues and substance, policy and vision and record should be the meat of politics. That's fair game but that's where I'm going to focus. That's how I focused from the beginning of the campaign and it is how I intend to continue going forward. [applause]\nWALLACE: Senator Rubio, I want to explore this sort of larger issue. The campaign has in a sense turned into a battle for the soul of the Republican party: establishment versus grassroots, pragmatic versus principle. You say that you can unite all of the factions inside the GOP. How?\nRUBIO: Chris, let's begin by being clear what this campaign is about. It's not about Donald Trump. He's an entertaining guy. He's the greatest show on earth. This campaign is about the greatest country in the world and a president who has systematically destroyed many of the things that made America special.\nYou see, we usually elect presidents in America that want to change the things that are wrong in America. Barack Obama wants to change America. Barack Obama wants America to be more like the rest of the world. We don't want to be like the rest of the world. We want to be the United States of America. [applause]\nThat is why Hillary Clinton cannot win this election. Hillary Clinton this week said Barack Obama would make a great Supreme Court justice. The guy who systematically and habitually violates the constitution on the Supreme Court? I don't think so. If I'm our nominee, I will unite this party and we'll defeat Hillary Clinton and we will turn this country around once and for all, after seven years of the disaster that is Barack Obama. [applause]\nBAIER: Governor Bush, it's hard for anyone of your pedigree to avoid being called establishment. But isn't that part of the problem in this race, that three others on this stage are splitting the main stream Republican vote and there by possibly handing this nomination over to an anti-establishment candidate?\nBUSH: Bret, we're just starting. The first vote hasn't been counted. Why don't we let the process work. I trust Iowans, Granite staters, people in South Carolina, people in Nevada, to start this process out. I kind of miss Donald Trump. He was a little teddy bear to me. [laughter]\nWe always had such a loving relationship in these debates and in between and the tweets. I kind of miss him. I wish he was here. Everybody else was in the witness protection program when I went after him on behalf of what the Republican cause should be: conservative principles, believing in limited government, believing in accountability. Leading by fixing the things that are broken.\nLook, I am in the establishment because my dad, the greatest man alive was president of the United States and my brother, who I adore as well as fantastic brother was president. Fine, I'll take it. I guess I'm part of the establishment Barbara Bush is my mom. I'll take that, too. [applause]\nBut this election is not about our pedigree, this is an election about people that are really hurting. We need a leader that will fix things and have a proven record to do it. And we need someone who will take on Hillary Clinton in November. Someone who has a proven record, who has been tested, who is totally transparent. I released 34 years of tax returns... [bell rings] ... and 300,000 e-mails in my government record. To get the information from Hillary Clinton, you need to get a subpoena from the FBI. [applause]\nBAIER: Thank you governor.\nKELLY: Senator Christie, you began this campaign touting your record as a Republican from a blue state who knows how to get things done and reach across the aisle. However, many Republicans feel that reaching across the aisle and getting things done isn't great if you get the wrong things done. And they prefer to stand on principle rather than compromise. Why are they wrong and you're right?\nCHRISTIE: They're not wrong. But what's wrong is your premise in the question. You can do both. There is no reason why you can't stand for principles, go and fight for them and be able also, to have to get things done in government.\nYou know, what people are frustrated about in Washington, D.C.., and I know the folks out there tonight are incredibly frustrated because what they see is a government that doesn't work for them. You know, for the 45-year-old construction worker out there, who is having a hard time making things meet.\nHe's lost $4,000 in the last seven years in his income because of this administration. He doesn't want to hear the talk about politics Megyn and who is establishment and who is grassroots. And who's compromised and who is principled. What he wants is something to get done.\nAnd that's the difference between being a governor and having done that for the last six years in New Jersey and being someone who has never had to be responsible for any of those decisions. Barack Obama was never responsible for those decisions.\nHillary Clinton has never been responsible for those kind of decisions where they were held accountable. I've been held accountable for six years as the governor of New Jersey and with a Democratic legislature, I've gotten conservative things done. That's exactly what I'll do as president of the United States. [applause]\nBAIER: Senator Paul, you are definitely not in the establishment category. But at the beginning of this campaign, you said you were your own man when asked about your father, former Texas Congressman and three-time presidential candidate Ron Paul.\nSenator Cruz's campaign is out with a video saying that Cruz is the intellectual and political heir to your father's 2012 campaign and the liberty movement. And your father now says it's realistic that Donald Trump will be your party's nominee.\nSo did you make a mistake by not fully — more fully embracing your father politically at the beginning of this campaign?\nPAUL: You know, I've always had a great deal of respect. There's probably no person I respect more in the country or in recent history than my father. I think he was probably the most honest man in politics that we've ever seen in a generation.\nAnd so in no way have I ever said that I don't embrace my father or love my father or appreciate everything that he has done for the country. I think what's interesting about where that liberty vote goes that my father brought to the Republican Party is, I don't think they're necessarily going to go for Ted.\nYou know, Ted didn't show up. We had an audit-the-Fed vote, which was the biggest thing my dad had been advocating for, for 30 years, Ted didn't have time to show up. He was the only Republican that didn't show up for it.\nAnd so I think really that vote is going to stay in the Paul household. I think more of it is coming and it's going to grow.\nThe NSA is another big issue. Ted said he was for NSA reform, but then he told Marco Rubio, no, no, no, I voted for the bill because I'm for the government collecting 100 percent of your cell phone records.\nI don't think Ted can have it both ways. They want to say they're getting some of the liberty vote. But we don't see it happening at all. We think we're going to do very well in Iowa with the liberty vote. [applause]\nBAIER: Senator Cruz, your response to that?\nCRUZ: Well, I agree with Rand that I very much respect Ron Paul and that I think anyone who is able to win in the Republican Party has to be able to bring together the disparate elements of the Reagan coalition. You've got to be able to bring together conservatives and evangelicals and libertarians, and stitch together a winning majority.\nWhen it comes to the audit the Fed bill, as Rand knows well, I was an original sponsor of the bill, I'm strongly supportive of it. It didn't have the votes to pass. And I had commitments to be at a town hall in New Hampshire.\nBut I look forward to signing that bill into law as president and auditing the Fed and providing needed accountability at the Federal Reserve. [applause]\nBAIER: Senator Rubio?\nRUBIO: I think, you know, Rand and I have some significant issues on policy, but I respect Rand. He believes everything he stands for. [applause]\nI do respect Rand.\nBut I want to be frank about what I stand for. I believe the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest power in the world. And I believe only with a strong America will we defeat this radical group, this apocalyptic group called ISIS.\nThat's why when I'm president we are going to rebuild our intelligence capabilities. And they're going to tell us where the terrorists are. And a rebuilt U.S. military is going to destroy these terrorists.\nAnd if we capture any of these ISIS killers alive, they are going to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we're going to find out everything they know, because when I'm president, unlike Barack Obama, we will keep this country safe. [applause]\nBAIER: Thank you, Senator.\nPAUL: May I respond?\n[crosstalk]\nBAIER: We'll come back to...\nPAUL: Well, I mean, I was talked about in the question.\nBAIER: OK. Go ahead, go ahead.\nPAUL: Just very quickly, I would like to respond.\nThe bulk collection of your phone data, the invasion of your privacy did not stop one terrorist attack. I don't think you have to give up your liberty for a false sense of security.\nWhen we look at this bulk collection, the court has looked at this. Even the court declared it to be illegal. If we want to collect the records of terrorists, let's do it the old fashioned way. Let's use the Fourth Amendment. Let's put a name on a warrant, let's ask a judge for it. Let's respect the history of our country.\nJohn Adams said that we fought a War for Independence because we wanted to fight against generalized warrants. Let's don't forget that. [applause]\nWALLACE: Governor Kasich, I want to get back to this question of where conservatives are this year. You call yourself a, quote, \"inside-outside guy, a reformer who knows how to get things done,\" but you reject the establishment label.\nFirst question is why do you reject it? And secondly, what do you say to Republican voters this year who view practical government experience as a liability and not an asset?\nKASICH: Well, first of all, I had a national reporter say, you know, there's three lanes. There's the establishment lane, the anti-establishment lane, and then there's the Kasich lane.\nAnd the reason is, is that I've been a reformer all of my career, fighting to reform welfare, fighting to reform the Pentagon, also being in a position to balance the budget, because that is very, very hard to do.\nAnd then in Ohio, of course, I had to bring about big reform, again, because we were so far in the hole and now we just found out we are up over 400,000 jobs since I took over as governor.\nYou know, the situation is this. We cannot fix things in this country — the Social Security, the border, balancing the budget, getting wages to grow faster — unless we lead as conservatives, but we also invite people in from the other party. We have to come together as a country. And we have to stop all the divisions.\nAnd, you know, that's been my message in New Hampshire. And having been in New Hampshire and here in Iowa, but in New Hampshire, I just received the support of seven out of eight of the newspapers in that state because they see positive, they see unity, they see coming together, and they see a record of change and a record of accomplishment.\nAnd it isn't because I'm all that great. It's because I've been assembling a team of people who want to be involved in something that's a little bigger than themselves. I'll keep — I'll keep heading in that direction, believe me. [applause]\nWALLACE: Dr. Carson, I want to pick up on that with you. Governor Kasich likes to say he knows how to land the plane. You've landed a lot of planes in the O.R. But what about the idea of running for president with no experience in government at all?\nCARSON: Well, I will gladly confess that I'm the only one on this stage with no political title. You're not going to hear a lot of polished political speech from me, but you will hear the truth. And I don't think you have to be a politician to tell the truth. In fact, sometimes it's not that way... [applause] ... and I've had more two a.m. phone calls than everybody here put together, making life and death decisions, put together very complex teams to accomplish things that have never been done before. And we are in a situation right now in our country that we have never been in before. We need people who think out of the box and can solve problems; can utilize the resources around them; very smart people, to focus on the problem and solve the problem.\nThe American people are terrified. That's why we have this abnormal situation going on right now. We don't need more of the same solutions. We need different solutions to solve the problems and to save our nation. [applause]\nWALLACE: Gentlemen, we're now going to start to drill down into specific issues that are on voters' minds. I'm going to start with one of the biggest ones, which is foreign terror.\nAccording to Google, ISIS was by far the most searched foreign policy topic over the last year. Senator Cruz, you talk tough about fighting terrorism. You talk about carpet bombing into oblivion. You talk about seeing if the sand will glow at night. But critics say that your record does not match up to that. You opposed giving President Obama authority to enforce his red line in Syria. Three years in a row now, you have voted against the Defense Authorization Act.\nHow do you square your rhetoric with your record, sir?\nCRUZ: Well, Chris, I will apologize to nobody for the vigorousness with which I will fight terrorism, go after ISIS, hunt them down wherever they are, and utterly and completely destroy ISIS. [applause]\nYou know, you claim it is tough talk to discuss carpet bombing. It is not tough talk. It is a different, fundamental military strategy than what we've seen from Barack Obama. Barack Obama right now, number one, over seven years, has dramatically degraded our military. You know, just two weeks ago was the 25th anniversary of the first Persian Gulf war. When that war began, we had 8,000 planes. Today, we have about 4,000. When that war began, we had 529 ships. Today, we have 272.\nYou want to know what carpet bombing is? It's what we did in the first Persian Gulf war; 1,100 air attacks a day, saturation bombing that utterly destroyed the enemy. Right now, Barack Obama is launching between 15 and 30 air attacks a day. He's not arming the Kurds. We need to define the enemy. We need to rebuild the military to defeat the enemy. And we need to be focused and lift the rules of engagement so we're not sending our fighting men and women into combat with their arms tied behind their backs. [applause]\nWALLACE: Senator Rubio, does Senator Cruz's record match his rhetoric?\nRUBIO: Well, again, I mean, obviously, as already has been pointed out, the only budget that Ted has ever voted for is a budget that Rand Paul sponsored that brags about cutting defense spending. And I think that's a bad idea for the following reason.\nISIS is the most dangerous jihadist group in the history of mankind. ISIS is now found in affiliates in over a dozen countries. ISIS is a group that burns people alive in cages; that sells off little girls as brides. ISIS is a group that wants to trigger an apocalyptic showdown in the city of Dabiq — not the city of Dubuque; I mis-said — mis-said that wrong once [inaudible] time — the city of Dabiq in Syria. They want to trigger an apocalyptic Armageddon showdown.\nThis group needs to be confronted and defeated. They are not going to go away on their own. They're not going to turn into stockbrokers overnight or open up a chain of car washes. They need to be defeated militarily, and that will take overwhelming U.S. force.\nToday, we are on pace to have the smallest Army since the end of World War II, the smallest Navy in 100 years, the smallest Air Force in our history. You cannot destroy ISIS with a military that's being diminished. When I'm president, we are rebuilding the U.S. military because the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest military in the world.\n[crosstalk]\nWALLACE: Senator Cruz, you've got 30 seconds. You were mentioned. [applause]\nCRUZ: Chris, in 1981, when Ronald Reagan came to the Oval Office, he encountered a military that had been debilitated just as the current military has, just like Jimmy Carter weakened our readiness, undermined our ability to defend this country, so too has Barack Obama. Just as morale in the military has plummeted in the last seven, so it had then.\nWhat Reagan did is he began with tax reform and regulatory reform, unleashing the engine of the American free enterprise system. It brought booming economic growth and that growth fueled rebuilding the military. I intend to do the exact same thing to defeat radical Islamic terrorism —\nWALLACE: Gentlemen.\nCRUZ: ... and to devote the resources from the booming economy to rebuilding our Navy, rebuilding our Air Force, rebuilding our Army and ensuring we have the capacity to keep this country safe.\nPAUL: My budget was mentioned. My budget was mentioned.\nWALLACE: May I — may I just say, we are going to continue the questions about foreign terror, gentlemen, right after this break.\nKELLY: But first, you can join tonight's conversation right from home. Go to google.com or open your Google search app and search Fox News debate to vote on which candidate you think has the best plan to defeat ISIS. We'll be right back.\n[commercial break]\nBAIER: Welcome back. Let's get right back to the questions. Chris.\nWALLACE: Thank you. Governor Christie, you have compared both Senators Cruz and Rubio to Barack Obama, saying that we cannot afford another inexperienced President. You've also said that Senator Cruz's vote to curtail the NSA surveillance program made America less safe. Is either of them ready to be Commander in Chief?\nCHRISTIE: Well, let me say that I do believe that the vote on NSA made the country less safe. Well, let me tell you what the country should really be worried about. I watched that town hall meeting with the Democrats the other night, and I heard Hillary Clinton asked a direct question by an Iowan, and that's what Iowans like to do. They like to ask direct questions.\nAnd, they asked about her email situation. And, here's what she said to the American people. She did it for convenience. For her convenience. She put America's secrets at risk for her convenience. She put American intelligence officers at risk for her convenience. She put American strategy at risk for her convenience.\nLet me tell you who's not qualified to be President of the United States, Chris. Hillary Rodham Clinton did that to our country. She is not qualified to be President of the United States. [cheering]\nThe fact is what we need is someone on that stage who has been tested, who has been through it, who has made decisions, who has sit in the chair of consequence and can prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton on... [bell rings] ... that stage, and that is exactly what I am ready to do. [applause]\nWALLACE: Governor Bush...\nCRUZ: Chris? Chris I was mentioned in that question.\nBUSH: No, you weren't. Your name wasn't mentioned, Ted.\nCRUZ: ... Actually, I was...\nBUSH: ... Chris, keep it coming...\nWALLACE: ... I don't think that your name was mentioned...\nCRUZ: ... Chris, your questions that you...\nWALLACE: ... Sir, I think — I think the question was...\nCRUZ: ... What was your question...\nWALLACE: ... It's not my question that you get a chance to respond to, it's his answer. [laughter]\nYou don't get 30 seconds to respond to me...\nCRUZ: ... Your question was you have disagreed... [audience reaction]\nWALLACE: ... You don't get 30 seconds to respond to me...\nCRUZ: ... [inaudible] opening statement.\nWALLACE: ... If I could go on. Sir, I know you like to argue about the rules, but we're going to conduct a debate...\nBUSH: ... Thank you Chris...\nWALLACE: ... Governor Bush...\nCRUZ: ... This entire question was an attack, but that's [inaudible]\nWALLACE: Governor Bush, here's the question — I'm going to ask Governor Bush the question.\nYou criticized several candidates in this field on this stage for what you call unrealistic ideas about how to fight terrorists, including Rubio, and Cruz on the issue of their refusing to give the President authority to enforce the redline in Syria.\nBut, given the fact that your brother got us into two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that have still not ended.\nThat have still not ended, what lessons have you learned from his mistakes, sir?\nBUSH: Well, first, I was critical of the Senators not giving the authorization for the use of military force. They should have made it more open ended for the next president. We shouldn't have the war fighters have their arms tied behind their back as President Obama wanted to do, but they had a chance to show support and it wasn't popular at the time. It became popular after the attack in Paris, and San Bernardino. Now we hear the tough talk.\nPrior to that, in the Reagan Library, I gave a detailed plan. Exactly what to do as it relates to ISIS. And it is from the lessons from history that we do this because if we allow this to fester, we're going to have Islamic terrorism, multi-generations of it all across this country. The caliphate of ISIS has to be destroyed, which means we need to arm directly to Kurds, imbed our troops with the Iraqi military, re engage with the Sunni tribal leaders. Get the lawyers off the damn backs of the military once and for all. [cheering]\nHave a no fly zone in Syria and create safe zones to deal with the refugees. But, more importantly, to train a Sunni-led force in Syria to take out ISIS with our support... [bell rings] ... ground and air. That's what we need to to, and I laid that out prior to the crisis with the advice of a lot of people, including 12 Medal of Honor recipients that I'm proud that they're supporting my campaign. [applause]\nWALLACE: Senator Cruz, now you get a chance to respond.\nCRUZ: Chris, I would note that that the last four questions have been, \"Rand, please attack Ted. Marco, please attack Ted. Chris, please attack Ted. Jeb, please attack Ted...\" [audience reaction]\nLet me just say this...\nWALLACE: ... It is a debate, sir.\nCRUZ: ... Well, no, no. A debate actually is a policy issue, but I will say this. Gosh, if you guys ask one more mean question I may have to leave the stage. [applause]\nChris, the most important determination any voter is going to make in this election is who's best prepared to be Commander in Chief. Who has the experience, who has the knowledge, who has the judgement, who has the clarity, and vision and strength of resolve to keep this country safe. That is what this debate is all about, and I would suggest let's stay focused on those issues — rather than just attacks directed at each other.\nWALLACE: I think the questions were about issues. Senator Rubio, what would you like to respond sir... [applause]\n[crosstalk]\nPAUL: ... Senator Cruz, I'd like to respond...\nRUBIO: ... First of all — Let me go first, and then you can please recognize Rand after. [laughter]\nFirst of all...\nPAUL: ... and I'd like to respond.\nRUBIO: ... do I go — let me go first, and then you can please recognize Rand after. But... [laughter] ... first of all...\nWALLACE: Thank you.\nPAUL: Thank you, Marco.\nRUBIO: ... first of all, I'm — don't worry, I'm not leaving the stage no matter what you ask me.\nWALLACE: Good.\nRUBIO: And second of all... [applause] ... and I think — you know, Governor — Jeb, you — the attack that — the authorization that Barack Obama asked for was not against ISIS. It was against Assad. And John Kerry described it as attacks that would be unbelievably small.\nI don't think the United States should be engaged in symbolic military activity. So it was not against ISIS, it was against — it was against Assad.\nI think the United States military is operating under rules of engagement that are too strict... [bell rings] ...and that do not allow us to pursue victory. When I'm president, that will change.\n[crosstalk]\nWALLACE: Senator Paul, go ahead.\nPAUL: Thank you.\nThe issue in Syria's a very important one, and it's one we need to get right. The question is, should we be bombing both sides of the war? Some want to topple Assad. In fact, they want to bomb ISIS and Assad simultaneously.\nI think that's a really, really bad idea. In fact, I've said for several years that arming the allies of ISIS will make the situation worse, That what we really need to do is defeat ISIS.\nBut if you defeat Assad, what you will wind up with is a larger and more powerful ISIS that occupies that space. You might — you may well see an ISIS that takes over all of Syria. [bell rings]\nKASICH: Chris... [applause] ... there was a question about foreign policy, by the way, and experience. And I — I thought, if I didn't jump in, I might not be able to tell everybody this. I think they'd want to hear it.\nLook, I served on...\nWALLACE: Well... [crosstalk] ... we'll be talking about foreign policy a little bit later. We're going to talk...\nKELLY: We have a lot — we have a lot to cover. But we want to — we want to turn the page to domestic...\n[crosstalk]\nKASICH: ... but wait a minute...\nKELLY: No, no. No.\nKASICH: ...the only reason is — look...\nKELLY: No no no, because we want to turn the page to domestic terror, and let me tell you why: we're partnering with Google on this debate, and they're telling us...\nKASICH: OK.\nKELLY: ... that their search results have gone through the roof on — on people...\nKASICH: I've always listened to you, Megyn. Go ahead.\nKELLY: ... you're a good man, Governor Kasich.\nKASICH: Yes — thank you.\nKELLY: People — the search results — the searches for terror issues, for safety issues in America have gone through the roof, increased over 400 percent since 2008.\nPeople are worried. They're worried about what's happening in the country and about a domestic terror attack, as all of you know. Now, when combating this threat, Senator Rubio, you've advocated closing down mosques — we'll get back to you.\nWell, you have advocated closing down — closing down mosques, diners, any place where radicalization is occurring. You told me that. But the Supreme Court has made clear that hateful speech is generally protected by the First Amendment.\nIn other words, radical Muslims have the right to be radical Muslims, unless they turn to terror. Doesn't your position run afoul of the First Amendment?\nRUBIO: Megyn, that's the problem. Radical Muslims and radical Islam is not just hate talk. It's hate action. They blow people up. Look what they did in San Bernardino.\nLook at the attack they inspired in Philadelphia, that the White House still refuses to link to terror, where a guy basically shot a police officer three times.\nHe told the police, \"I did it because I was inspired by ISIS,\" and to this day, the White House still refuses to acknowledge it had anything to do with terror.\nLook, the threat we face from ISIS is unprecedented. There has never been a jihadist group like this. They have affiliates in over a dozen countries now.\nThey are the best funded radical jihadist group in the history of the world, and they have shown a sophisticated understanding of the laws of other countries on how to insert fighters into places, and they are actively plotting to attack us here at home and around the world.\nWe must keep America safe from this threat. And yes, when I am president of the United States, if there is some place in this country where radical jihadists are planning to attack the United States, we will go after them wherever they are, and if we capture them alive, they are going to Guantanamo. [applause]\nPAUL: [inaudible].\nKELLY: Senator Paul, do you agree with that? We're gonna close down mosques, we're gonna close down diners where we think radical thinking's occurring? [crosstalk]\nPAUL: Yeah, no, I think that's a — that's a huge mistake, to be closing down mosques. But I would say that if you want to defend the country, it begins with border security. And this is where I've had my disagreement with Senator Rubio.\nWhen he brought forward the \"Gang of Eight\" bill to give citizenship to those who came here illegally, I put forward an amendment that says we should have more scrutiny on those who are coming as students, those who are coming as immigrants, those who are coming as refugees, because we had two refugees come to my town in Bowling Green and try to attack us.\nMarco opposed this because they made a deal. He made a deal with Chuck Schumer that he would oppose any conservative amendments. And I think that's a mistake, and I just don't think Marco can have it both ways. You can't be in favor of defend us... [bell rings] ... against Islam — radical Islam — if you're not for border security.\nRUBIO: Might I respond? [applause]\nThe first thing — I don't know of anyone who's not in favor of fully vetting people that are trying to come into this country, other than perhaps Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. I think we all support that. Rand's amendment was not the right way to do it.\nI do believe that people who are trying to come to the United States — this country has a right to know who they are and why they are coming. And that's why I've been clear, when I am the president of the United States of America, we don't know who you are, and we don't know why you're trying to come to the United States, you are not going to get in, because the radical threat that we now face from ISIS is extraordinary and unprecedented... [bell rings] ... and when I'm president, we are keeping ISIS out of America.\nKELLY: Governor Christie, let's talk about profiling. [applause]\nIn December...\nCHRISTIE: Talk about what? I...\nKELLY: ... profiling. Profiling. In December, two radical Muslims killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California. Neighbors of the terrorists said that they did not report the couple to law enforcement prior to the crime, because they were afraid that they would be accused of profiling.\nNow, you have said that we should not profile. How do you square that with the San Bernardino case?\nCHRISTIE: Well, because you can do it without profiling, Megyn, when you do it on the facts. What those facts knew was that these folks had weapons. They knew that they were talking about trying to take our country and attack it.\nThat's not profiling, that's law enforcement. And that's the difference between somebody who knows how to do this and somebody who's never done it before.\nKELLY: They didn't know they were going to attack the country.\nCHRISTIE: They knew they were talking about the issues of attacking people, Megyn. They knew that.\n[crosstalk]\nKELLY: That's not true. The neighbors said they saw men going in and out of the garage. They saw packages being delivered. They saw Muslims, and they did not think that was enough to call the cops. Do you?\nCHRISTIE: Listen, I think that what people should do is use their common sense. And the fact is, let law enforcement make those decisions. I've told people that from the time I was U.S. attorney 13 years ago.\nIt's not for them to make those decisions about whether or not something is legal or illegal, or profiling or not. You see something that's suspicious, you call law enforcement and let law enforcement make those decisions.\nThat's what should be done. That can be done. That can be done without profiling people. What that is, is just common sense. They thought something was wrong.\nAnd here's the problem in this country right now. The problem is that Barack Obama has made law enforcement the enemy, Hillary Clinton has made law enforcement the enemy.\nThey're not supporting our law enforcement officers, it's making everybody nervous to get out of their cars, if you're a law enforcement officer. It's making... [bell rings]... everybody nervous to get out of their cars if you're a law enforcement officer. [bell rings]\nIt's making people in neighborhoods nervous to go to law enforcement. As president, I will support law enforcement and we'll stop radical terrorist attacks in this country by supporting our intelligence community and law enforcement community. [applause]\nKELLY: Dr. Carson, this week a female Muslim who served in the U.S. Air Force asked Hillary Clinton the question, she asked whether the United States is still the best place in which to raise her three Muslim children. Given what she perceives as a rise in Islamaphobia in this country. Do you think the GOP messaging on Muslims has stoked the flames of bias on this as the Democrats suggest, and how would you answer this veteran?\nCARSON: Well, I don't know about the GOP messaging, but I can tell you about my messaging. You know, need to stop allowing political correctness to dictate our policies, because it's going to kill us if we don't. [applause]\nAnd in the Holy Land Foundation trial in 2006 in Texas, they had a memorandum, an explanatory memorandum that talked about the fact that Americans would be easy to overcome and to commit civilization jihad because they were going to be trying to protect the rights of the very people who were trying to subvert them.\nBut I believe in the Teddy Roosevelt philosophy. Teddy Roosevelt said, we are a nation of immigrants. As such, everybody is welcome from any race, any country, any religion, if they want to be Americans. If they want to accept our values and our laws. If not, they can stay where they are. [applause]\nKELLY: Governor Kasich, stand back. You appear to back in another debate, a so-called back door to encrypted cell phone technology, which protects most smartphones that we all have from hacking. And it includes our phones and it also protects the cell phones of the terrorist.\nNow the tech companies and a group of MIT scientists, smart guys, right, warn that if they create a way for the FBI to have a back door into our encrypted communications, then the bad guys will exploit it too. And they say that this is going to cause more security problems than it would solve for everyday Americans. Are they wrong?\nKASICH: Well, look the Joint Terrorism Task Force needs resources and tools. And those are made up of the FBI, state and local law enforcement. And Megyn, it's best not to talk anymore about back doors and encryption, it will get solved, but it needs to be solved in the situation of the White House with the technology folks.\nKELLY: But this is public testimony.\nKASICH: But I just have to tell you that it's best with some of these things not be said. Now I want to go back something. See, I was there when Reagan rebuilt the military. I was there in '89 when the wall came tumbling down because we were strong.\nAnd I was there when we went into the Gulf War. We didn't win that war just from the air, we won that war by assembling a group of Arab leaders who stood in the Rose Garden and stood with America. We want to destroy ISIS, it has to be in the air and on the ground. It has to be with our friends in the Arab world and our friends in Europe, the coalition that we had when we went to the first Gulf War.\nAnd then when we win that, and we will win that against ISIS as it settles down, and we should leave. Because we shouldn't be policemen of the world. But what we need to do is turn it over to the regional powers to be able to handle that.\nKASICH: But we have a unique time in America to connect with people all around the world that understand that there's an existential threat against all of them, the Arabs, the Jordanians, the Saudis, the Egyptians, our friends in Europe, including the Turks. So we have a unique opportunity to bring everybody together.\nI saw Reagan do it, I've seen other presidents do it. And frankly, if you want to be commander in chief, you have to have the experience. At the same time we're doing all that, the Pentagon must be reformed so we get what we need for our men and women in uniform. All of that together, we're going to be just fine and America is going to continue to lead the world.\nKELLY: Governor, thank you. [applause]\nBAIER: Governor Bush, just today, a wounded warrior organization designed to help wounded veterans and their families is coming under fire for raising tens of millions of dollars, but spending almost half of that on travel and hotels and dinners and luxury, lavish conferences. So taking care of veterans is obviously a huge issue in the country that has asked so many to serve and sacrifice so much.\nIf you were president. would you police these charity organizations that say they're helping vets?\nBUSH: Of course. And there's all sorts of ways that can be done at the state, local and federal level to do that. But the first duty of the next president of the United States is to fix the mess at the Department of Veterans Affairs. That's his first responsibility. [applause]\nLook, we have waiting lists for veterans that are — that are leaving because of the sequester where we're gutting the military. More and more military personnel are leaving becoming veterans, and the waiting list grows. They've given out $140 million of bonuses to Veterans Department employees, including reducing the waiting lists, without giving veterans care. People died, and only three people have been fired.\nI will make sure that we fire the sheer incompetence inside the Department of Veterans Affairs and then we'll give veterans a choice card so that they don't have to travel hours and hours to get care if they want to go to their private provider. You want to make the Veterans Administration do a better job, give them — give veterans choices and you'll get a much better result. And as it relates to all the other organizations, let me give you a good example.\nIn Houston, Texas, there's an organization in place because someone acted on their heart, wanted to make sure that there's no homeless veterans in Houston. And they've come pretty close to that without federal government assistance. We need to mobilize the entire country to treat our veterans and treat them with much more respect than they get today.\nBAIER: Governor Bush, thank you. [applause]\nSpeaking of veterans, we have a question from a veteran who is one of the top Youtube creators. Over the course of the evening, gentlemen, we will hear from some of Youtube's most followed stars. And here's one of them.\nQUESTION: I'm Mark Watson. I'm known for my [inaudible] views on Youtube, but I'm also a veteran who served in the Army for eight years.\nAs an African-American living near Ferguson, I've seen the strain between police officers and the communities they serve firsthand. Now, there are great tools like body cameras that — to protect both officers and citizens, but we all currently have better cameras in our pockets than in our precincts. Why aren't we using the technology available to better protect our communities?\nBAIER: Senator Paul, that question to you.\nPAUL: You know, I've supported legislation to allow body cameras. I've been to Ferguson, I've been trying to look for solutions to our criminal justice problem.\nOne thing I discovered in Ferguson was that a third of the budget for the city of Ferguson was being reaped by civil fines. People were just being fined to death. Now you and I and many of the people in this audience, if we get a $100 fine, we can survive it. If you're living on the edge of poverty and you get a $100 fine or your car towed, a lot of times you lose your job.\nI also think the war on drugs has disproportionately affected our African-American community, and what we need to do is make sure that the war on drugs is equal protection under the law and that we don't unfairly incarcerate another generation of young African-American males.\nIn Ferguson, for every 100 African-American women, there are only 60 African-American men. Drug use is about equal between white and black, but our prisons — three out of four people in prison are black or brown. I think something has to change. I think it's a big thing that our party needs to be part of, and I've been a leader in Congress on trying to bring about criminal justice reform. [applause]\nBAIER: Senator Paul, thank you.\nWALLACE: This debate is just getting started. Coming up, the role of the federal government. But first, join tonight's conversation right from your home. Go to google.com or open your Google search app and search Fox News Debate to vote on which issue is most important to you in this election. More from the Iowa Events Center and the Republican presidential debate in a moment. [applause]\n[commercial break]\nKELLY: Welcome back, everybody. We are live in Des Moines, Iowa. And let's get right back to the questions — Bret.\nBAIER: Thank you, Megyn.\nGentlemen, I'll ask you some questions about federal spending and the role of the federal government. Everybody always said they want to cut federal spending and usually they start by saying they'll cut waste, fraud, and abuse, but that really doesn't ever materialize. We all know that.\nGovernor Christie, you talk a lot about entitlement reform and you say that that's where the federal government can get savings needed to balance the budget. But can you name even one thing that the federal government does now that it should not do at all?\nCHRISTIE: Yes. You want one? [laughter]\nBAIER: I want one. Yes. [laughter]\nCHRISTIE: How about one that I've done in New Jersey for the last six years. That's get rid of Planned Parenthood funding from the United States of America. [applause]\nBAIER: Anything bigger than that?\nCHRISTIE: Bigger than that? Let me tell you something, when you see thousands upon thousands upon thousands of children being murdered in the womb, I can't think of anything better than that. [applause]\nBAIER: And, Governor, I realize everyone on this stage opposes Obamacare and you're not alone. Google Data shows that in the last month when people searched \"policy repeals,\" that there were a lot of them. Obamacare took the top two spots. But today there are millions of people who gained health insurance from Obamacare and they now rely on it.\nSo the question, Senator Cruz, if you repeal Obamacare, as you say you will, will you be fine if millions of those people don't have health insurance? And what is your specific plan for covering the uninsured?\nCRUZ: Sure. Well, let's take it one at a time. First of all, we have seen now in six years of Obamacare that it has been a disaster. It is the biggest job-killer in this country. Millions of Americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work, have lost their health insurance, have lost their doctors, have seen their premiums skyrocket.\nIf I'm elected president, we will repeal every word of Obamacare. [applause]\nNow, once that is done, everyone agrees we need healthcare reform. It should follow the principles of expanding competition, empowering patients, and keeping government from getting in between us and our doctors.\nThree specific reforms that reflect those principles. Number one, we should allow people to purchase health insurance across state lines. That will create a true 50-state national marketplace which will drive down the cost of low-cost, catastrophic health insurance.\nNumber two, we should expand health savings accounts so people can save in a tax-advantaged way for more routine healthcare needs. And number three, we should work to de-link health insurance from employment so if you lose your job, your health insurance goes with you and it is personal, portable and affordable.\nAnd I'll tell you, Bret, I think that's a much more attractive vision for healthcare than the Washington-drive, top-down Obamacare that is causing so many millions of people to hurt. [applause]\nBAIER: Senator Cruz, thank you.\nGovernor Bush, you've advocated for statehood for Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rican economy is collapsing under unsustainable debt burden. Only about 1 million of its 4 million residents are currently employed. So should American citizens who you say are already overtaxed, bail out Puerto Rico as well?\nBUSH: No, they shouldn't. And I believe that Puerto Rico ought to have the right of self-determination. If I was a Puerto Rican, I'd vote for statehood so that they have full citizenship. They serve in the military. They would have to pay federal taxes. They would — they would accept the responsibilities of full U.S. citizenship. But they should have the right of determine — self-determination.\nBefore you get to that, though, Puerto Rico is going to have to deal with the structural problems they face. You know, it's — it's a fact that if you can pay for a $79 one-way ticket to Orlando, and you can escape the challenges of a declining economy and high crime rates, you move to Orlando.\nAnd a lot of people are doing that. And the spiraling out-of- control requires Puerto Rico to make structural reforms. The federal government can play a role in allowing them to do that, but they should not — the process of statehood or the status of Puerto Rico won't be solved until we get to the bigger issue of how you deal with the structural economic problems they're facing right now.\nBAIER: Governor Kasich, you're one of two remaining sitting governors still in the race. Your colleague, Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan is under fire — he and his administration — for the Flint, Michigan water crisis and the botched response to it. How would you have handled that?\nKASICH: Well, you've got to be on top of it right away. And, you know, I don't know all the details of what Rick Snyder has done. I know there have been people who have been fired; people who are being held accountable. But the fact is, every single engine of government has to move when you see a crisis like that.\nAnd I've had many situations in the state of Ohio where we've had to move, whether it's storms, whether it was a horrible school shooting. There are many crises that come — a water crisis in Toledo. You've got to be on top of it. You've got to go the extra mile. You've got to work with local communities and you've got to work with the federal government.\nBecause you realize that people depending on you. And so, you go the extra mile. But people have to be alert. They have to be alert to problems. And when you see a problem, you must act quickly to get on top of it. And people at home are saying they've got a problem, listen to them. Because most of the time, they're absolutely correct.\nSo the fact is that we work for the people. The people don't work for us. And we have to have an attitude when we're in government of serving-hood. That's what really matters. We serve you. You don't serve us. We listen to you and — and then we act. [applause]\nBAIER: Senator Rubio, on the issue of climate change, in 2008, you wanted Florida to get ahead of other states and establish a cap- and-trade system, a program for carbon emissions, which many Republicans thought at the time would hurt the Florida economy. Now, you're a skeptic of climate change science. And in fact, you warn that federal efforts to fight climate change will cost U.S. jobs and hurt the U.S. economy.\nSo why the change?\nRUBIO: Well, Bret, first that's not entirely the story. At the time, the liberal governor of Florida, who claimed he was a Republican — his name was Charlie Crist — he wanted to impose cap-and-trade on Florida. And I opposed it. I was the first person out of the box that opposed him on it.\nAnd then we saw that the leading candidates for president at the time, both the Republican and the Democrats, all supported it. And what we said is, if they're going to impose this on us, we better prepare to protect the state from it. But I have never supported cap- and-trade and I never thought it was a good idea. And I was clear about that at the time.\nAnd I do not believe it's a good idea now. I do not believe that we have to destroy our economy in order to protect our environment. And especially what these programs are asking us to pass that will do nothing to help the environment, but will be devastating for our economy.\nWhen I am president of the United States of America, there will never be any cap-and-trade in the United States. [applause]\nBAIER: Thanks, Senator.\nKELLY: All right. We're going to move on. Because coming up, immigration, and something you've never seen before.\nStay tuned, right after this break.\n[commercial break]\nKELLY: Welcome back everyone. Live, in Des Moines, Iowa. Now, we move onto the topic of immigration. Senator Rubio, we'll start with you. When you ran for Senate in 2010, you made clear that you opposed legalization and citizenship for illegal immigrants. You promised repeatedly that you would oppose it as a U.S. Senator as well. Here are just a few examples. Watch.\n[begin video clip]\nRUBIO: Never support. Never have and never will support any effort to grant blanket legalization amnesty to folks who have entered, or stayed in this country illegally.\n[end video clip]\n[begin video clip]\nRUBIO: First of all, earned path to citizenship is basically code for amnesty. It's what they call it. And, the reality of it is this, it is unfair to the people that have legally entered this country to create an alternative for individuals who entered illegally, and knowingly did so.\n[end video clip]\n[begin video clip]\nRUBIO: You cannot grant amnesty. If the American people see us granting amnesty they will never again believe in legal immigration. They will never again support it, and that's wrong for our country, bad for our future.\n[end video clip]\nKELLY: Within two years of getting elected you were co-sponsoring legislation to create a path to citizenship, in your words, amnesty. Haven't you already proven that you cannot be trusted on this issue?\nRUBIO: No, because if you look at the quote, and it's very specific. And, it says blanket amnesty, I do not support blanket amnesty...\nKELLY: ... But, you went on from there...\nRUBIO: ... I do not support amnesty...\nKELLY: ... You said more than that, Senator...\nRUBIO: ... No, I said I do not support blanket amnesty...\nKELLY: ... You said earned path to citizenship is basically code for amnesty. You...\nRUBIO: ... It was...\nKELLY: ... supported earned path to citizenship...\nRUBIO: ... It absolutely has been, and at the time in the context of that was in 2009, and 2010, where the last effort for legalization was an effort done in the Senate. It was an effort led by several people that provided almost an instant path with very little obstacles moving forward.\nWhat I've always said is that this issue does need to be solved. They've been talking about this issue for 30 years, and nothing ever happens. And, I'm going to tell you exactly how we're going to deal with it when I am president.\nNumber one, we're going to keep ISIS out of America. If we don't know who you are, or why you're coming, you will not get into the United States.\nNumber two, we're going to enforce our immigration laws. I am the son and grandson of immigrants. And I know that securing our borders is not anti-immigrant and we will do it.\nWe'll hire 20,000 new border agents instead of 20,000 new IRS agents. We will finish the 700 miles of fencing and walls our nation needs. We'll have mandatory E-verify, a mandatory entry/exit tracking system and until all of that is in place and all of that is working and we can prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control, nothing else is going to happen.\nWe are not going to round up and deport 12 million people, but we're not going to hand out citizenship cards, either. There will be a process. We will see what the American people are willing to support. But it will not be unconstitutional executive orders like the ones Barack Obama has forced on us.\nKELLY: Governor Bush, do you agree Senator Rubio has not reversed himself on his immigration promise?\nBUSH: Well, I'm kind of confused because he was the sponsor of the Gang of Eight bill that did require a bunch of thresholds but ultimately allowed for citizenship over an extended period of time. I mean, that's a fact. And he asked me to support that. And I — I supported him because I think people, when you're elected, you need to do things.\nAnd he led the charge to finally fix this immigration problem that has existed now for, as Marco says, for 30 years. And then he cut and run because it wasn't popular amongst conservatives, I guess.\nHere's what I believe. And I wrote a book about this called Immigration Wars. You can get it at $2.99 on Amazon. It's not a bestseller. I can promise you. [laughter]\nThere won't be any — you can get it. It's affordable for everybody. We should have a path to legal status for the 12 million people that are here illegally. It means, come out from the shadows, pay a fine, earn legal status by working, by paying taxes, learning English. Not committing crimes and earn legal status where you're not cutting in front of the line for people that are patiently waiting outside. [applause] I think that is the — I think that's the conservative consensus pragmatic approach to how to solve this problem.\nRUBIO: May I respond?\nKELLY: Go ahead, senator.\nRUBIO: It's interesting that Jeb mentions the book. That's the book where you changed your position on immigration because you used to support a path to citizenship.\nBUSH: So did you. [laughter]\nRUBIO: Well, but you changed the — in the book...\nBUSH: Yeah. So did you, Marco. [applause]\nRUBIO: You wrote a book where you changed your position from a path of citizenship to a path of legalization. And the bottom line is this, we are not going to be able to do anything on this issue until we first bring illegal immigration under control. The American people have been told for 30 years they're going to enforce the border, they're going to build a wall and it never gets built and it never happens.\nIt is very clear there will be no progress on this issue in any way, shape or form, until you prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control. And when I'm president, we are going to bring it under control once and for all after 30 years of talking about it.\nBUSH: Marco, Marco — he brought up my name. I have supported a consensus approach to solving this problem wherever it came up. and in 2007 it almost passed when my brother was president of the United States. A bipartisan approach got close. Barack Obama actually had the poison pill to stop it then.\nAnd when you led the charge with the Gang of Eight, I supported it because you asked me to. I think it's important for people in elected office to try to forge consensus to solve problems. There's never going do be perfect bill. [applause]\nKELLY: All right.\nBUSH: But when you didn't do that and you ask people to support, you shouldn't cut and run.\nRUBIO: But Megyn...\nBUSH: You should stick with it and that's exactly what happened. He cut and run. And that's a tragedy because now... [bell rings] ... it's harder and harder to actually solve this problem.\nKELLY: All right. This will be the last one.\nRUBIO: There's not going to be consensus on this issue until we enforce our immigration laws. That is abundantly clear. You're not going to be able to ram down the throat of the American people your approach. The only way we're are going to be able to move forward after two migratory crises with minor, after two unconstitutional executive orders, the only way forward on this issue is to first bring illegal immigration under control. And until that happens there's not going to be consensus on this issue.\nKELLY: OK. Let's move on. Senator Cruz, when Senator Rubio proposed that bill creating a path to citizenship, you proposed an amendment. It would have allowed for legalization but not citizenship. Yes, it would.\nPressed last month on why you supported legalization, you claimed that you didn't. Right? Like you just did. Saw that. [laughter]\nYou argued that this was just a poison pill amendment, basically it's something designed to kill the bill and not actually get it through. But that is not, however, how it sounded at the time. Watch.\n[begin video clip]\nCRUZ: I want this bill to be voted down. I don't want immigration reform to fail. I want immigration reform to pass. I believe if this amendment were to pass, the chances of this bill passing into law would increase dramatically.\nI believe if the amendments I introduced were adopted, that the bill would pass. And my effort in introducing them was to find a solution that reflected common ground and that fixed the problem.\nIf the proponents of this bill actually demonstrate a commitment not to politics, not to campaigning all the time, but to actually fixing this problem, to finding a middle ground. That would fix the problem, and also allow, for those 11 million people who are here illegally, a legal status, with citizenship off the table.\nKELLY: Was that all an act? It was pretty convincing.\nCRUZ: You know, the amendment you're talking about is one sentence — it's 38 words. Anyone can go online at tedcruz.org and read exactly what it said. In those 38 words, it said anyone here illegally is permanently ineligible for citizenship. It didn't say a word about legalization. I introduced...\nKELLY: But the bill allowed both. The bill you were amending allowed citizenship and legalization.\nCRUZ: But — but Megyn, the bill was 1,000 pages. I introduced a series of amendments, each designed to fix problems in the bill. The fact that each amendment didn't fix every problem didn't mean that I supported the rest of the bill.\nAnd I'll tell you who supported my amendment — Jeff Sessions, the strongest opponent of amnesty in the United States Congress. And he did so because taking citizenship off the table was important, and it revealed the hypocrisy of the proponents of this bill, who were looking for votes.\nListen, we can solve immigration. We just heard an argument back and forth that we can't solve immigration. I have a detailed immigration plan that is on my website, tedcruz.org. It was designed with Iowa's own Congressman Steve King and Jeff Sessions, and... [applause] ... we have the tools in federal law to do this now. We can build the fence. We can triple the border patrol. We can end sanctuary cities by cutting off... [bell rings] ... funding to them. We can end welfare for those here illegally. And what is missing is the political will, because too many Democrats and, sadly, too many Republicans don't want to solve this problem. If I am elected president... [bell rings] ... we will secure the border...\nKELLY: OK, sir.\nCRUZ: ... and we will end the illegal immigration.\nKELLY: Senator Paul. [applause]\nYou know how Washington works. Do you buy that?\nPAUL: I was there and I saw the debate. I saw Ted Cruz say, \"we'll take citizenship off the table, and then the bill will pass, and I'm for the bill.\"\nThe bill would involve legalization. He can't have it both ways. But what is particularly insulting, though, is that he is the king of saying, \"you're for amnesty.\" Everybody's for amnesty except for Ted Cruz.\nBut it's a falseness, and that's an authenticity problem — that everybody he knows is not as perfect as him because we're all for amnesty. I was for legalization. I think, frankly, if you have border security, you can have legalization. So was Ted, but now he says it wasn't so. That's not true.\nKELLY: Go ahead, sir. [applause]\nCRUZ: You know, John Adams famously said, \"facts are are stubborn things.\" The facts are are very, very simple. When that battle was waged, my friend Senator Rubio chose to stand with Barack Obama and Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer and support amnesty.\nAnd I stood alongside Jeff Sessions and Steve King, and we led the fight against amnesty. And if you want to know who's telling the truth, you should look and ask people like Jeff Sessions and Steve King and Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin, all of whom say, as Jeff Sessions said, responding to these false attacks just recently in Alabama — he said, \"if it wasn't for Ted Cruz, the Gang of Eight Rubio/Schumer bill would have passed. But because Ted stood up and helped lead the effort, millions rose up to kill it. [bell rings] [applause]\nKELLY: Senator Rubio, even Chuck Schumer, your co-sponsor of that bill...\nRUBIO: Yeah, but let me respond...\nKELLY: ... agrees with Ted Cruz on this.\nRUBIO: ... no, I understand, but let me respond. I was mentioned on this — in this answer, and so I'm going to respond this way.\nThis is the lie that Ted's campaign is built on, and Rand touched upon it — that he's the most conservative guy, and everyone else is a — you know, everyone else is a rhino.\nThe truth is, Ted, throughout this campaign, you've been willing to say or do anything in order to get votes. Ted, you worked for George W. Bush's campaign... [booing]\nYou — you — you helped design George W. Bush's — you helped design George W. Bush's immigration policy. And then, when you got to the Senate, you did an interview with CBS News — I wasn't even part of the video — where you said, on the issue of people that are here illegally, \"we can reach a compromise.\"\nAnd then in the committee, you said, \"I want to bring people out of the shadows.\" [bell rings]\nNow you want to trump Trump on immigration. But you can't — we're not gonna beat Hillary Clinton with someone who's willing to say or do anything to win an election.\nKELLY: Go ahead, Senator Cruz. [applause]\nCRUZ: You know, I like Marco. He's very charming. He's very smooth. But the facts are simple. When he ran for election in the state of Florida, he told the people of Florida, \"if you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty.\"\nWhen I ran in Texas, I told the people of Texas, \"if you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty.\" We both made the identical promises. But when we came to Washington, we made a different choice.\nMarco made the choice to go the direction of the major donors — to support amnesty because he thought it was politically advantageous. [bell rings]\nI honored my commitments, and as president, I will honor every commitment that I make to the men and women of this country. [applause]\nKELLY: All right.\nCHRISTIE: Megyn?\nKELLY: Go ahead, Governor Christie.\nCHRISTIE: I want to ask the people of the audience. Like, I'm standing here, I — I watched the video of Senator Cruz. I watched the video of Senator Rubio. I heard what they said. And this is why you need to send someone from outside of Washington to Washington. [applause]\nI feel like... [applause] ... I feel like I need — I feel like I need a Washington to English dictionary converter, right? [laughter]\nI mean, I heard what they both said, I saw it on the video. And the fact is this is what makes a difference when you're a governor. You can change your mind. Ted can change his mind. Marco can change his mind. It's perfectly legal in this country to change your mind. But when you're a governor, you have to admit it. You can't hide behind parliamentary tricks. That's the difference, and that's the kind of leader we need in the White House. Stop the Washington bull and let's get things done. [applause]\nKELLY: Let's go to a Youtube question. Let's get to a Youtube question. This is a question from a Youtube creator with over 2 million subscribers. Watch.\nQUESTION: I'm Dulce Candy, a Youtube creator who immigrated to the United States from Mexico when I was a little girl. Since then, I am proud to say I served in the armed forces in Iraq, became a citizen and I am now an entrepreneur.\nThere are many immigrants who contribute positively to the American economy, but some of the comments in the campaign make us question our place in this country. If America does not seem like a welcoming place for immigrant entrepreneurs, will the American economy suffer?\nKELLY: Dr. Carson, that's one — that one's for you.\nCARSON: Oh, great. [laughter]\nAs I said before, we are a land of immigrants, but we have to be intelligent about the way that we form our immigration policies, and that's one of the reasons that I have called on us to declare war on the Islamic State because we need to reorient our immigration policies and our visa policies for people who are coming into this country because there are many people out there who want to destroy us.\nNow, I recognize that the vast majority of people coming in here probably are not those kinds of people, but that's not good enough. If you've got 10 people coming to your house and you know one of them is a terrorist, you're probably going to keep them all out.\nYou know, we probably have to figure out a way to make sure that we keep America safe. [applause]\nBUSH: Can I — can I — I just...\nKELLY: Go ahead.\nBUSH: That beautiful young woman who's an entrepreneur who served in the military, first of all, is deserving of our respect for service in the military and the fact that she's an entrepreneur. [applause]\nAnd we should be a welcoming nation. Our identity is not based on race or ethnicity, it's based on a set of shared values. That's American citizenship. And Dulce Candy — a pretty cool name, actually — that is now an entrepreneur over Youtube is part of that American spirit, and we should celebrate it as conservatives. That's what we believe in.\nYou can — you can deal with the threat of terror and also recognize that this country should be aspirational across the board.\nRUBIO: And I think that's the false choice... [applause] ... that's the — that's the false choice in this whole debate about immigration. Of course, we're going to be a nation of immigrants. By the way, no nation on earth is more generous than America is. Every single year close to a million people emigrate to the United States legally. There's no nation on earth that comes close to that number.\nI think the only argument is are we a sovereign country, are we not allowed to choose who comes in, when they come in and how they come in? And that's not what's happening now. [applause]\nKELLY: All right.\nRUBIO: I think the other problem is we have a legal immigration system that's outdated, it's primarily based on whether you have family members living here. In the 21st century, it has to be more of a merit-based system, and that is why our legal immigration system is in need of modernization. And we will always celebrate legal immigration like Dulce's great story.\nKELLY: All right. We're moving on. [applause]\nWALLACE: Gentlemen, we're going to turn now to what we call electability, issues that you're either facing in the primaries or issues that you're certainly going to face in a general election. So you may not be altogether unhappy if you're not included in this round. [laughter]\nSenator Cruz, you pride yourself on standing up to the D.C. cartel, but as we've seen to a certain degree tonight, there's a price for standing up to the D.C. cartel. Thirteen Republican senators have endorsed other candidates, none have endorsed you.\nYou — twice last year, you asked for a colleague to second a motion, a routine courtesy on the Senate floor, and no senator would do it. Top GOP officials worry that if you're at the top of the ticket — some officials — that not only will you lose the White House, but it will tank the ticket all the way down the line.\nThe question is does your style sometimes get in the way of your ability to get things done, sir?\nCRUZ: Well, Chris, you are exactly right that I am not the candidate of career politicians in Washington. [applause]\nAnd I'll tell you the endorsements that I am proud of are the over 200,000 volunteers across this country who have signed up to volunteer for our campaign. The endorsements that I am proud of are leading conservatives like Iowa's own Congressman Steve King, who is a national co-chairman of my campaign. The endorsements that I'm proud of are conservative leaders like Dr. James Dobson, and over 700,000 contributions nationwide, people going to our Web site, tedcruz.org.\nThis is a grassroots campaign and, you know, when I ran for senate in Texas, I told the people of Texas that I'm not going there to go along to get along. Washington is broken.\nAnd the people I have been accountable to every single day in the Senate are the 27 million Texans who I represent and I made a promise to them that I make to you today, which is, if I am elected, every single day I will do two things: tell the truth, and do what I said I would do. [applause]\nBAIER: Thank you.\nKELLY: Governor bush, poll after poll shows you running among the worst in your party against Hillary Clinton. Even Mitt Romney said that a Bush v. Clinton head-to-head would be too easy for the Democrats.\nYet still you and the super PACs supporting you continue to blanket the airwaves with cutting ads, not against Mrs. Clinton, but against your fellow Republicans, especially Senator Rubio.\nDo these attacks do more harm than good by targeting those candidates who appear to have the best chance of defeating Mrs. Clinton?\nBUSH: Well, first of all, I've seen polls where I'm beating Hillary Clinton pretty regularly.\nAnd I believe I can, because I have a proven record, a record of accomplishment, a record of cutting taxes, of shrinking the government, of reforming education, of challenging the status quo, eliminating career civil service protections, shrinking the government workforce by 11 percent, but leading the nation in job growth. That's the record of accomplishment that should be taken to Hillary Clinton, who has no record of accomplishment. So I'm confident if I win this nomination, I will aggressively go against her and beat her.\nAs it relates to the super PACs, I have no control over that. And this is beanbag compared to what the Clinton hit machine is going to do to the Republican nominee. The simple fact is, we all have a record. It all will be scrutinized. There's give and take. It's called the politics. And that's the way it is.\nI'm running hard and I believe I'll be the Republican nominee and I'll be the one best suited to beat Hillary Clinton, who should not be president of the United States. [applause]\nBAIER: Senator Rubio, first before I ask you a question, any response to Governor Bush?\nRUBIO: Well, I believe, and I know that if Iowa helps make me the Republican nominee, I will defeat Hillary Clinton. Hillary doesn't want to run against me, but I cannot wait to run against her. And I cannot wait to earn the opportunity to do it because she cannot be the president of the United States.\nShe wants to put Barack Obama on the Supreme Court of the United States of America. She said that here in Iowa just two days ago. That would be a disaster for this country.\nSo I hope and pray and cannot wait until this state and others give me an opportunity to serve this party as its nominee because I will defeat Hillary Clinton. [cheering and applause]\nBAIER: Now let's talk about electability, Senator. TIME magazine once called you \"the Republican savior.\" Rush Limbaugh and others said you likely will be president some day.\nBut if you look at the recent average of polls in your home state of Florida, you're in third trailing Donald trump by 24 points. If the people who know you best have you there, why should the rest of the country elect you?\nRUBIO: Well, let me be clear about one thing, there's only one savior and it's not me. It's Jesus Christ who came down to earth and died for our sins. [applause]\nAnd so — and I've always made that clear about that cover story.\nAs far as the polls are concerned, Iowa, on Monday night you're going to go to a caucus site and you'll be the first Americans that vote in this election. You will be the first Americans that get to answer the fundamental question, what comes next for this country after seven disastrous years of Barack Obama?\nAnd let me tell you what the answer better not be. It better not be Bernie Sanders. Bernie Sanders is a socialist. I think Bernie Sanders is good candidate for president of Sweden. [laughter]\nWe don't want to be Sweden. We want to be the United States of America. [applause]\nAnd Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being the commander-in-chief of the United States. In fact, one of her first acts as president may very well be to pardon herself because Hillary Clinton... [laughter]\nHillary Clinton stored classified information on her private server. And Hillary Clinton lied to the families of those four brave Americans who lost their life in Benghazi. And anyone who lies to the families of Americans who have died in the service of this country can never be commander-in-chief of the United States. [applause]\nBAIER: Thank you, Senator.\nWALLACE: Governor Christie, two of your former top aides go on trial in May for fraud and conspiracy in the \"Bridge-gate\" case, the politically motivated closure of lanes to the George Washington Bridge.\nAnother former aide who has already pleaded guilty and will likely testify for the government, as you know, says that you knew about this whole deal. Can the GOP take the chance of nominating you with this scandal still out there, sir?\nCHRISTIE: Sure, because there has been three different investigations and proven that I knew nothing. And the fact is that what I did do, what I did do from the beginning, Chris, as soon as I found out about it, I fired the people who were responsible. And that's what you expect from a leader.\nAnd, I'll tell you something else. I inherited a state in New Jersey that was downtrodden, and beaten by liberal democratic policies, high taxation, high regulation. And, this year, in 2015, New Jersey's had the best year of job growth that our state has ever had in the last 15 years. That's because we've put conservative policies in place.\nAnd, I'll tell you one other thing, you know why the Republican party will want to take a chance on me? Because they know that Hillary Clinton will never be prosecuted by this justice department, and they're going to want to put a former federal prosecutor on the stage to prosecute her next September. And, there is no one on this stage better prepared to prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton than I am.\nI will be ready. I will take her on, and when I take her on I guarantee you one thing, she will never get within 10 miles of the White House. The days for the Clintons in public housing are over. [applause]\nBAIER: Much more to come, including where the candidates stand on foreign policy. And, once again, you can go to Google.com, or open your Google search app and search, \"Fox News Debate\" to vote on which candidate you think is winning the debate tonight. We'll be right back.\n[commercial break]\nKELLY: Welcome back, everybody. Let's get back to the questions. Chris?\nWALLACE: Gentlemen, almost 60% of Republican caucus-goers identify themselves as Evangelicals, so I'd like to spend a few minutes exploring social issues.\nGovernor Kasich, you talk a good deal about your faith. In fact, you say it played a role in your decision to expand Medicaid, and you say that when you meet Saint Peter at the Pearly Gates, he's going to ask what you did for the poor, not what you did to keep government small.\nSenator Cruz is on the opposite side of this issue from you, so does that mean that you're getting in and he isn't? [laughter]\nKASICH: No. You know, Chris, here's what happened with Medicaid in my state. We took the growth of Medicaid from over 10 percent in my second budget to 2.5 percent, without cutting off one person or cutting one benefit, because we — we innovated the government.\nAnd now mom and dad can stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home. And then we decided we could bring $14 billion of our money — I mean, Washington doesn't have any money. It was our money, and we brought them back to tend to the mentally ill. Because I don't think they ought to live in prison or live under a bridge; to treat the drug-addicted so they're not in an in-and-out-of-the-door policy out of the prisons; and to help the working poor so they don't live in emergency rooms.\nHow has it worked? Well, we have treated the drug-addicted in our prisons and we released them in to the community, and our recidivism rate is less than 20 percent. That's basically bordering on a miracle because of our great prison director. The mentally ill? They've been stepped on for too long in this society, and we are beginning to treat them.\nIn terms of my faith, look, all I say is that when I study scripture, I know that people who live in the shadows need to have a chance. But I'm not deciding that anybody's got to make these decisions the way that I do, on the basis of what I do. But what — I will tell you this. The time has come to stop ignoring the mentally ill in this country and begin to treat them and get them on their feet, along with, of course, with treating the drug-addicted. [applause]\nBecause we don't want them in and out — we don't want them in and out of the prisons. Give people a chance. We talked about criminal justice reform. We've enacted it in our state. Look, the conservative message is economic growth and along with economic growth goes opportunity for everybody in America. Everybody ought to have a chance to be able to rise to their God-given purpose.\nAnd that is what we have done in Ohio. We're running surpluses. We're up 400,000 jobs. And guess what? The formula is working. I'd suggest people take a look at it.\nThank you. [applause]\nWALLACE: Gentlemen, we had a case study on religious liberty just this last summer. A county clerk in Kentucky named Kim Davis refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples after the Supreme Court ruling, saying that it violated her religious beliefs.\nGovernor Christie, you said that she must follow the law or be moved to another job that would be in keeping with her conscience. But some conservatives say that that violates her religious liberty.\nCHRISTIE: No, what I said, Chris, was that the law needs to be followed. And that someone in that office has to do their job. So if Ms. Davis wanted to step aside and get rid of her ability to be able to do that, there should be someone else in that office who it didn't violate their conscience so they could follow the law of the state of Kentucky.\nI never said that Ms. Davis should either lose her job or that she had to do it. But what I did say was that the person who came in for the license needed to get it. And so if there's someone in that organization, and it turns out there was, who was willing to be able to do that, that's what we should do.\nBut just as importantly, and I agree with what John said. You know, we all have our own individual interpretations of our faith. And here's the problem with what's going on around the world. The radical Islamic jihadists, what they want to do is impose their faith upon each and every one of us — every one of us. And the reason why this war against them is so important is that very basis of religious liberty.\nThey want everyone in this country to follow their religious beliefs the way they do. They do not want us to exercise religious liberty. That's why as commander in chief, I will take on ISIS, not only because it keeps us safe, but because it allows us to absolutely conduct our religious affairs the way we find in our heart and in our souls. As a Catholic, that's what I want to do. And no matter what your faith is, that's what I want you to be able to do. [applause]\nWALLACE: Thank you, sir.\nSenator Rubio, during the last debate, you said Governor Christie had changed his position and his mind on gun control, on common core, and backing President Obama's nomination of Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court. He said you're wrong on the facts and you can't, quote, \"slime your way to the White House.\" I assume in the last two weeks, you've done some fact-checking. Do you want to take anything back?\nRUBIO: Yeah, I would encourage people to go on my website, marcorubio.com, and we'll put all the facts up there so people can see it for themselves. But you've just asked a very fundamental question about the role of faith in our country. And I think this is an important question. I think if you do not understand that our Judeo-Christian values are one of the reasons why America is such a special country, you don't understand our history. You see, why are we one of the most generous people in the world — no, the most generous people in the world? Why do Americans contribute millions of dollars to charity?\nIt is not because of the tax writeoff. It is because in this nation, we are influenced by Judeo-Christian values that teach us to care for the less fortunate, to reach out to the needy, to love our neighbor. This is what's made our nation so special.\nAnd you should hope that our next president is someone that is influence by their faith. Because if your faith causes you to care for the less fortunate, it is something you want to see in your public figures. And when I'm president, I can tell you this, my faith will not just influence the way I'll govern as president, it will influence the way I live my life.\nBecause in the end, my goal is not simply to live on this earth for 80 years, but to live an eternity with my creator. And I will always allow my faith to influence everything I do. [applause]\nWALLACE: Thank you, senator.\nSenator Paul, in May on the campaign trail you, said you didn't get into politics to fight about abortion. You said you were more concerned about the national debt. Your answer is to turn abortion back to the states the way it was before Roe v. Wade.\nDoes that mean that if a liberal state, let's say, wants to make abortion legal, that you're okay with that and what do you say to conservative voters who believe deeply that abortion is murder?\nPAUL: You know, I think abortion is always wrong. I've supported a variety of solutions, both state as well as federal. In fact, just last week, I introduced the Life at Conception act, which would say that the 14th amendment would defend an individual even in the womb.\nBut I think on the broader question of religion and politics, you know, I think liberty, itself requires a virtue — requires a virtuous people. In fact, Washington said that democracy requires a virtuous people.\nOz Guinness, the theologian, said that liberty requires restraint but the only restraint consistent with liberty is self-restraint. There's a lot packed into that statement. But the bottom line is we must have virtue, we must have a religious bearing as a nation. The government is not always going to save us and it's not always going to come from government.\nBut if we don't know right and wrong, I think we have lost our way. I think we become unmoored and I think without the religious foundation that guides us all, I think we have a great risk of going horribly in the wrong direction.\nWALLACE: Sir, just 30 seconds to answer my specific... [applause]\nJust 30 seconds to answer my specific question. Do you favor the idea that abortion should be a states' rights issue and if a liberal state wants to make it legal, that that's their choice? Yes or no?\nPAUL: Both. No, both the federal and a state approach. I have said that we could leave it to the states but I've also introduced a federal solution as well. So the federal solution would be the Life at Conception act which is an act that would federalize the issue.\nBut I've also said for the most part, these issues would be left back to the states. So there might be an occasion if we did overturn Roe v. Wade — Roe v. Wade nationalized the issue. If you had the court reverse Roe v. Wade, it would become a state issue once again.\nI think it would be better the more — the less abortions we have, so the more states that we have that made abortion illegal, the better, as far as trying to save and preserve lives.\nWALLACE: Thank you, sir. [applause]\nBAIER: Gentlemen. [applause]\nI'd like to ask you a few questions about foreign policy broadly.\nDr. Carson, many experts believe Russian leader Vladimir Putin has greater ideas, bigger designs for the region beyond Russia's actions inside Ukraine. Fast forward to February 2017 and it is President Carson, and Russian uniformed commandos cross the Estonian border and they occupy a city in Estonia. Estonia, a member of NATO, essentially invokes Article IV, an attack on one is an attack on all. What do you do?\nCARSON: Look, first of all, I recognize that Vladimir Putin is an opportunist and he's a bully, and we have to face him down. And I would — first of all, face him down in that whole region, the whole Baltic region. I think we need to put in some armored brigades there. We only have one or two. We need much more than that. We need to be doing military exercises if not only Estonia but Latvia and Lithuania. They're terrified by the saber rattling. I think we ought to put in our missile defense system.\nI think we ought to give Ukraine offensive weapons and I think we ought to fight them on the economic basis because Putin is a one- horse country: oil and energy. And we ought to fight them on that level.\nWe ought to be helping in terms of the technology for fracking, keeping the price low, quite frankly, because that's what's keeping him contained. So, yes, I'd absolutely would go in if he attacked. I think on Article IV of NATO, we would definitely protect all of our allies. [applause]\nBAIER: Gentlemen, you've all said that the Iran nuclear deal is a bad one.\nSenator Rubio, you were among the candidates who've said you would tear it up on day one. But as you know, Iran has already received tens of millions of dollars — tens of billions of dollars in this deal and has quickly reestablished ties economically with Europe.\nThe major concessions, in other words, are up front in this deal. So should you win by the time you take office, the remaining parts of the deal would be the constraints on Iran. So why blow up those constraints on day one, letting Iran off the hook?\nRUBIO: Well, let me first describe Iran because they're not just a normal nation state. And we have no quarrel with the Iranian people. But the Iranian leader, their supreme leader is a radical Shia cleric who has an apocalyptic vision of the future. He views himself not simply as the leader of Iran, but as the leader of all Muslims — all Shia Muslims on the planet. And they have a desire not simply to conquer the Middle East and to become the dominant power in that region, but ultimately to be able to hold America hostage.\nThat is why they're building an — right now, developing long- range missiles capable of reaching the United States, and that is why there's going — they're going to use those $100 billion to expand their conventional capabilities and to one day buy or build a nuclear weapon.\nWe will — when I am president of the United States, on my first day in office, we are canceling the deal with Iran, and nations will have to make a choice. They can do business with Iran, or they can do business with America, and I am very confident they're going to choose America before they choose the Iranian economy.\nBAIER: Governor Kasich, you've said that Marco Rubio is wrong... [applause] ... that Senator Rubio is wrong with tearing it up on day one.\nKASICH: Look, we don't know what's going to happen in ten months. And if I were president of the United States right now, I'd be lining up our allies to say that, if one crossed T or one dotted I does not occur, they are — violate the agreement, we slap back on sanctions.\nWe can slap on sanctions alone, on day one, but it's not gonna be anywhere near as effective. But the president needs to be laying the groundwork right now for the ability to slap those sanctions back on worldwide.\nAnd I'll tell you what I'm worried about — I'm worried about money. You read about all the companies now that are doing business — about to do business in Iran, and if we don't get this settled now, with other countries in the world, about sanctions, then Iran could violate that agreement, and we're the only ones putting the sanctions on.\nWe need to move aggressively now. But I would say this to you, Bret. Number one, if they violate it, we need to move against them. And number two, if we find out they're developing a nuclear weapon and we know how to get to it, we're gonna go take it out. That is what we have to do. We cannot let things get farther down the road, like we did with North Korea.\nBAIER: But Governor Kasich, you know that the most powerful sanctions are the multilateral ones.\nKASICH: That's right. Yes.\nBAIER: And these European countries are already reestablishing these ties.\nKASICH: I know, Bret.\nBAIER: They don't want...\nKASICH: But Bret, here's the problem. You take a look at the — at Belgium. I talked to a diplomat from Belgium. I said, \"how's it going?\" He said, \"we have the military in the streets right now. We never dreamt we'd ever see it.\"\nSee, I think there is an opportunity to bring the world together. The Turks are being threatened. We know about the French. We know about the Belgians. We know about the Brits. Everybody is under fire and under attack, and we have to stand together as an alliance.\nSo actually, the opportunity is there, because of the threat to all of these countries, to bring all of us together... [bell rings] ... and say there is something more important than money. It is the future of the world and the future of our children and grandchildren. That's the kind of leadership this country needs. It has not been in effect during the administration of Barack Obama.\nAnd that's only the beginning of the failures that they have committed, not only in the Middle East, but all over the world, including Russia and China.\nBAIER: Governor, thank you. Governor Christie... [applause] ... Libya is the newest base for ISIS. Just today, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said ISIS is consolidating their footprint there and also setting up training facilities.\nSo if you were president, would you deploy U.S. troops to Libya to take out ISIS there?\nCHRISTIE: Bret, let me tell you, this is another one of those places where Hillary Clinton has so much to answer for, and why she is completely unqualified to be commander in chief.\nIn a previous Democratic debate, Martha Raddatz, three times, asked Hillary Clinton about the failure in Libya, a policy that she took credit for, and said, \"what is your measure of responsibility, Madam Secretary, for the failure in Libya?\" Three times, she refused to answer the question, because she refuses to be held accountable for anything that goes wrong. If it had gone right, believe me, she would have been running around to be able to take credit for it.\nHere's what I'd do. This is about the bigger, broader war against ISIS. We need to bring together our European and our Sunni Arab allies, and we need to develop a strategy together to take on ISIS every place that it is around the world, so that together, all of us can take ISIS out, destroy it, and then move on to come back to our country, protect our homeland security and make sure that the American people are safe.\nAs president of the United States, that is exactly what I will do.\nBAIER: Thank you, Governor. [applause]\nWALLACE: We're not finished yet. More to come from the presidential debate, live from Des Moines, Iowa, next. And remember, to see how the campaigns are responding to the debate in real time, go togoogle.com or open your Google search app and search Fox News debate, and please stay with us. [commercial break] [applause]\nBAIER: Welcome back to Des Moines. Let's resume the debate. Megyn?\nKELLY: Senator Paul, you have suggested that former President Bill Clinton's history with women is fair game in this campaign. How do you answer those who say you don't hold the sins of the husband against the wife?\nPAUL: You know, I've never really brought this up unless asked the question, but I have responded to the question. I don't blame Hillary Clinton at all for this. I don't think she's responsible for his behavior. But I do think that her position as promoting women's rights and fairness to women in the workplace, that if what Bill Clinton did any CEO in our country did with an intern, with a 22-year- old, 21-year-old intern in their office, they would be fired. They would never be hired again. [applause]\nFired, never hired again and probably shunned in their community. And the thing is, she can't be a champion of women's rights at the same time she's got this that is always lurking out there, this type of behavior. So it is difficult.\nKELLY: Of her husband's?\nPAUL: Yeah. But I combine this also with the millions upon millions of dollars they've taken from regimes in the Middle East who treat women like cattle. [applause]\nWALLACE: We have another question from one of Youtube's top creators. Here it is.\nQUESTION: I'm Nabela Noor. I'm a Muslim American born and raised in the U.S. who creates beauty and lifestyle videos on Youtube.\nIn 2015, the number of hate crimes against Muslims in the U.S. has tripled, and on social media, where I spend a lot of time, I've seen many attacks directed towards fellow Muslims. This culture of hatred is only driving ISIS to radicalize, recruit and incite violence.\nAs president, what would you do to address this toxic climate and promote increased tolerance in the United States?\nWALLACE: Governor Bush, how do you answer Nabela?\nBUSH: Well first of all, I think it's important that when we're running for the highest office in the land that we recognize that we're living in dangerous times and we have to be serious about it, that our words have consequences.\nDonald Trump, for example — I'm glad — I mentioned his name again just if anybody was missing him... [laughter] ... Mr. Trump believed that in reaction to people's fears that we should ban all Muslims. Well, that creates an environment that's toxic in our own country. Nobela is a rising entrepreneur. She wants to pursue the American dream. She's an American citizen. She should not feel uncomfortable about her citizenship. She's not the threat. The threat is Islamic terrorism.\nWe need to focus our energies there, not these broad, blanket, kind of statements that will make it harder for us to deal with ISIS. We need to deal with ISIS in the caliphate. We need a strategy to destroy ISIS there. You can't do that without the cooperation of the Muslim world because they're as threatened as we are.\nSo, I think it's important for us to be careful about the language we use, which is why I've been critical of Donald Trump. Disparaging women, disparaging hispanics, that's not a sign of strength. Making fun of disabled people... [bell rings] ... We're never going to win elections if we don't have a more broader unifying message. [applause]\nWALLACE: Governor, thank you. Senator Cruz, change of subject. You called for an end to the renewable fuel standards which mandate that refineries blend biofuels, including ethanol into gasoline. As you well know, ethanol's a big industry in this state, $10 billion dollars a year.\nLast week, Terry Branstad, the popular Governor of Iowa... [applause] ... Who is in the hall tonight, said that you're bankrolled by big oil, and that Iowa voters would be making a mistake supporting you. Why should those voters side with you over the six- term governor of the state, sir?\nCRUZ: Well, Chris, I'm glad to discuss my views on ethanol and energy. I think God has blessed this country with enormous natural resources, and we should pursue all of the above. We should be developing oil, and gas, and coal, and nuclear, and wind, and solar, and ethanol, and biofuels. But, I don't believe that Washington should be picking winners and losers. And, I think there should be no mandates, and no subsidies whatsoever. [applause]\nAnd, indeed, my tax plan that I've introduced, it's available on our website. It's a simple flat tax for everyone. It'll produce enormous economic growth, and it eliminates every mandate, every subsidy, so there's no subsidies for oil and gas, no subsidies for anyone.\nNow, it is true that there are a bunch of lobbyists, and a bunch of Democrats in this state spending millions of dollars trying to convince the people of Iowa that I somehow oppose ethanol. It's not true. I have introduced legislation that would phase out the ethanol mandate over five years, but that is in the context of having no mandates whatsoever for anyone.\nAnd, I would not that there's a much more important government regulation to ethanol, and that's the EPA's blend wall that makes it illegal to sell mid-level blends of ethanol in gasoline. I will... [bell rings] ... Tear down the EPA's blend wall which will enable ethanol to expand its market share by up to 60%, all without mandates. All without any government mandates whatsoever through the marketplace. And, I'll note finally, Chris, there is a reason that Iowa's Congressman Steve King, perhaps the fiercest defender of farmers in this state, is sharing my campaign. Because he understands that I'm committed to a fair, and level playing field for every energy source without lobbyists, and without Washington picking winners and losers. [applause]\nWALLACE: Dr. Carson, I'd like to ask you about exactly that issue. Where are you on the mandatory ethanol standard, and precisely this question. Should government be in the business of picking winners and losers, or should it be left to the market place?\nCARSON: Well, as anyone knows who's been listening to me, you know? I'm very much against the government being involved in every aspect of our lives, you know? We last year there was an additional 81,000 pages of government regulations. If you stack that up it would be a three-story building. This is absolutely absurd. And, they've insinuated themselves into everything.\nNow, as far as the renewable fuel standard is concerned, certain promises were made, certain government contracts were issued which extend all the way into the year 2022, and I believe that it's probably unfair to withdraw the rug because people have invested money. People have invested a lot of energy into that.\nBut, you know, we are blessed with tremendous energy in this nation, and we need to be talking for new sources of energy. Seventy percent of our population lives by costly. What about hydroelectric power? We can develop that, you know? We have so much natural gas now, and we can liquify it, and we can transfer it across the sea so we can make Europe dependent on us instead of Putin — put him back in his little box where he belongs.\nThose are the kinds of things that we ought to be doing. And, you know, take advantage of the tremendous opportunities in energy that God has given us, not get involved in these little petty arguments.\nAnd we can get a lot of them out if we get the government out of our lives. [applause]\nWALLACE: Doctor, thank you.\nBAIER: Coming up, closing statements from the candidates as our debate continues, live, from Des Moines, Iowa.\n[commercial break]\nKELLY: Welcome back, everybody. And now, it is time for closing statements. The candidates each get 30 seconds.\nAnd we begin with Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.\nPAUL: Well, thanks for having me. It's great to be back. [applause]\nI'm an eye surgeon from Bowling Green, Kentucky, I miss doing eye surgery, still get to do a little bit. Did a couple of cataract surgeries over Christmas holidays. Got to go to Haiti last year. I've gotten to do some incredible things. Got to be on the floor of the Senate. And it has been amazing to me.\nBut the thing that is most important to me and caused me to run for office is I'm worried about the country and how much debt we're adding. And I am the one true fiscal conservative who will look at all spending. And that's the only way we'll ever balance our budget.\nThank you. [applause]\nKELLY: Ohio Governor Kasich.\nKASICH: You know, one of our biggest national security issues is the world looks at us some time, and we look at each other and say, why can't we solve problems? Well, I've got news for you, we can. We can in fact create jobs and provide job security. We can create a situation where wages begin to rise. We can create a situation for our children to be able to get a decent job to pay down their college debt. We can re-assume our role in the world.\nBut all of this has to come together when we have a positive attitude, an optimistic approach, an ability for us to set the tune as conservatives, to invite other people in to be part of that orchestra.\nYou see, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of the day, I'm an optimist [bell rings]\nBecause I've seen so many things get accomplished in my lifetime. And we can do it again together, all of us, to strengthen this country, work together. Thank you. [applause]\nBAIER: New Jersey governor, Chris Christie.\nCHRISTIE: On September 11, my wife was two blocks from the World Trade Center. When those buildings came down, she was trapped in her building and I didn't hear from her over six hours.\nWe have three children, eight, five and one. And I had to confront the possibility of being a single parent. Terrorism in this country scares everyone. And the fact is that we need a commander-in- chief who not only understands how to protect us, but feels in here what it means to face the possibility of loss.\nI've faced it. I've prosecuted terrorists. I have made the decisions that need to be made as a governor to protect us and as president of the United States, no one will keep this country safer than I will.\nBAIER: Thank you governor. [applause]\nKELLY: Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. Governor.\nBUSH: We desperately need a conservative leader as president of the United States. I have a proven record as governor of the state of Florida, as a conservative leader. And I also have detailed plans to fix the mess in Washington, D.C.\nAs president I will restore and rebuild our military, restore the alliances and keep us safe. And as our party's nominee, I will defeat Hillary Clinton in November. I ask for your support on the caucuses come Monday night and I will make you proud as our party's nominee. Thank you very much. [applause]\nWALLACE: Dr. Ben Carson.\nCARSON: I want to thank the people of Iowa for being so welcoming to me. Please think of our founding fathers as you listen. We the people of the United States in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare and secure the benefits of liberty to ourselves and our prosperity, do ordain and establish this constitution of the United States of America. Folks, it's not too late. Enough said. [applause]\nBAIER: Florida Senator Marco Rubio.\nRUBIO: The bible commands us to let our light shine on the world. For over 200 years, America's light has been shining on the world and the world has never been the same again. But now, that light is dimming a little, after seven years of Barack Obama. And that's why Monday night, what will happen here in Iowa is so important.\nI'm asking you for your vote. Caucus for me on Monday night because if I am your nominee, I will unite this party and I will defeat Hillary Clinton and when I'm president, America's light will shine again and the 21 century will be a new American century. [applause]\nBAIER: Thank you senator.\nKELLY: Texas Senator, Ted Cruz. Senator.\nCRUZ: Ninety-three hours. The media noise will soon be over and it's now for the men and women of Iowa to decide. Our country is in crisis. We're worried the future of our children and we've have been burned over and over again.\nThe central question in this race is trust. Who do you know will kill the terrorists, defend the constitution and repeal Obamacare? Who do you know will stop amnesty and secure the borders? Who do you know will defend life, marriage and religious liberty? Examine our records, pray on it and I will be honored if you and your family will come caucus for us on Monday night. [applause]\nKELLY: Gentlemen, thank you all so much for being here tonight. We appreciate it greatly. And that does it for the seventh Republican primary debate of the 2016 presidential race. But we're not done. The Kelly file starts in a moment and guess who is going to be there? Senator Ted Cruz.\nWALLACE: And don't forget, after all the talk, the first voting of the 2016 campaign happens in just four days. The first Americans to vote, the Iowa caucuses are Monday and Fox News will have complete coverage.\nBAIER: And we have you covered from Iowa, all the way to the conventions and on to the general election.

Ninety-seven hours before Iowa chooses, in fact the last two winners in this state are on this stage tonight. Governor Huckabee, in 2008, you won by nine points here, but this time your support seems to be going to Senator Ted Cruz and Donald Trump. Why, Governor, is your message not working this time?\nHUCKABEE: I don't think it's that the message isn't working, I think it's the message isn't getting out because the message that I have this time, Bill, it's exactly what I said eight years ago. I talked about people who are standing on their feet on factory floors, people who lift heavy things, who sweat through their clothes, they're getting gut punched. They are not having a fair shake in this economy.\nI talked about that eight years ago, and I'm talking about it now. I talked about the importance of preserving life, of not just saying we're going to defund Planned Parenthood, but let's do something bolder. Let's get rid of abortion once and for all by applying the Fifth, and Fourteenth amendment to every person from conception because that means that we recognize that no person can be deprived of life or liberty unless they have due process. And, that's not happening in our country.\nAnd, I believe, and continue to practice that we need the Fair Tax to revive our economy. To make it so that people are able to be rewarded for their work rather than punished for it. [applause]\nHEMMER: Governor, thank you.\nSenator Santorum, four short years ago you won Iowa. You beat Mitt Romney, pretty much shocked the country. But, just the other day you talked about what is in the greater good for your campaign. Is Monday night your last stand?\nSANTORUM: You know, listening to what your network was talking about prior to this race, this debate, reminded me of the coverage that many on this floor are getting. This race, this debate, was called the, \"Undercard Debate\". The undercard debate.\nIt wasn't advertised significantly. In fact, the entire hour lead up to this there was no conversation about any of the four people on this debate stage, and that is the chronic situation.\nIn fact, they listed -- they put a poll up from Wall Street Journal/NBC News, they listed the candidates, and they failed to mention I wasn't listed. I got zero, why? Because they -- NBC, Wall Street Journal poll never includes my name on the list.\nThis is what the media has been doing over the past year, and trying to segregate, and take Iowans out of the process. What Iowans deserve... [applause] ... is to hear from every candidate on equal footing. Had they applied the same rules four years ago, I would have been in the undercard debate. The guy who won the Iowa Caucuses would have been in the undercard debate, not talked about. [bell rings] We would have been talking about, maybe, an entertainer that may have been trying to run. Ladies and gentlemen, you have a chance on Monday to put the record straight about who you want, not who will entertain you.\nHEMMER: OK.\nSANTORUM: But, who will fight for what you believe in, and I hope you do...\nHEMMER: ... Senator, do you want to name... [applause and cheering] ... Senator, do you want to name that entertainer your refering to?\nSANTORUM: Well, look. The entire lead up to this debate was talking about whether Donald Trump is going to show up for the next debate.\nThe people of Iowa, who I know pretty darn well, care a lot about the issues. They care about who is going to be the leader of the free world. Who is going to be able to take on ISIS and take on Iran and make sure that we're safe. They're concerned about whether... [applause] ...their agriculture programs so their renewable fuel standard is going to be retained. [bell rings]\nHEMMER: But senator, since you mentioned...\nSANTORUM: And we are not hearing any of those things. We are hearing about whether someone is going to show up for the next debate or not.\nHEMMER: Senator, quickly then, after this debate, you mentioned Donald trump's name. Immediately, you're going to event across town here in Des Moines as a guest of Donald Trump.\nSANTORUM: Yes, I am.\nHEMMER: So are you laying the groundwork for maybe your future? Perhaps an endorsement of Mr. Trump?\nSANTORUM: You know, this, again, more of the politics of trying to get people to throw stuff at each other. I'm not going to throw mud at anybody on this stage tonight. I'm not going to throw mud at anybody on the stage later. [applause]\nI'm not going to attack Donald Trump. What I'm -- Mike Huckabee and I were asked to come to an event where money was going to be raise to do help our veterans. You know, I thought about it. [applause]\nAnd I thought about. I said well, wait a minute, now, if there were no political considerations and I had some time because I'm not doing anything at 9:00 tonight. [laughter]\nAnd so if I had some time, would I go... [bell rings] ... if I could help raise money for veterans? And the answer was yes, I would. And so I'm going. [applause]\nGILMORE: Well, Bill, can I first...\nHEMMER: Thank you, senator. One moment. We'll get to you in a moment, Governor. We have a few coming up.\nMACCALLUM: So it will come as no surprise that there is an idea out there that there is a civil war brewing within the GOP over the meaning of conservative and the question of who is electable.\nThere are some in the GOP who are so outraged by Trump and Cruz that they say they would actually rather have Hillary Clinton in the White House. [booing]\nSo, Carly Fiorina, I ask you this. Is your party in crisis?\nFIORINA: You know, when I started my campaign on May 4th of last year, I was 17 out of 16 candidates. Nobody polled my name. Nobody had ever heard of me. Less than 4 percent of you had ever heard of me.\nThe people in Iowa showed up and they are still showing up. Hundreds and hundreds of them at every event. I have done over 150 events in the state of Iowa and I have 15 more coming up. [applause]\nNow, by the way, I start there because someone asked me about midway through my campaign, what's the biggest surprise to you on the campaign trail? And I will tell you what the biggest surprise is: the chasm, the yawning chasm, between what the national media talks about and what the people of Iowa and the people of this great nation talk about. [applause]\nThat's the biggest surprise. So guess what, Martha? Guess what, sorry. The people of Iowa never ask me about a crisis in the GOP, they never ask me about the polls. They never ask me about the other candidates.\nWhat they ask me about is Carly, tell us why zero based budgeting is so important. Tell us why you are a leader who is going to produce results. Tell us how you are going to defeat ISIS. Tell us how we are going to replace Obamacare.\nIn other words, I'm going to put my faith every single time not in the pundits, not in the polls. Most definitely not in the national media. I'm going to put my faith in the common sense and the good judgment of the voters of Iowa.\nAnd the last time I looked, you hadn't started voting yet. So, on Monday night, I hope you will stand with me, fight with me, caucus for me. Because... [bell rings] ... citizens, this is why we have to take our government back. The establishment thinks it owns this country. The pundits thinks they own this country. The media thinks they owns this country. We were intended to be a citizen government, citizens. The game is rigged. You have the power. Take our country back.\nHEMMER: Thank you. [applause]\nGovernor Gilmore. As of one week ago, you have not held a single campaign event here in the state of Iowa. As of one week ago, in fact, you were the only one in the Republican field who had not made a campaign visit to this state. You know how it works here. You know how it's worked over time. Why should anyone caucus for you on Monday night?\nGILMORE: Well, first of all, Bill, let me say one thing, I have been in Iowa. But this is not the place where I'm choosing to begin my campaign. I am beginning my campaign in New Hampshire and I decided to do that based upon the process that is in place in Iowa and the primary that's in place in New Hampshire.\nBut never mind that, I want to return to something. I'm the only veteran, Bill and Martha in this race. And I'm not going to any Donald Trump event over across town on some sort of faux veteran sort of issue.\nI'm going to speak to you tonight about the issue that really confronts veterans. I'm going to talk to you about the concerns that they have got with the veterans administration.\nThe lousy appeals process that they have got. The fact that sometimes they get good service at the V.A. and sometimes they don't and the fact that post traumatic stress syndrome is not properly recognized. That psychology positions are unavailable in the Veterans Administration.\nAnd I will say this to you -- as the only veteran in -- in this race, when I become president of the United States, the veterans are going to be treated with respect and competently in success in the Veterans' Administration in this country.\nHEMMER: Governor, thank you. [applause]\nMACCALLUM: Governor Huckabee, word is that New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg is considering getting into this race. If he does, that would make four New Yorkers, including Sanders, Clinton, and Trump.\nOne candidate in this race has criticized so-called \"New York values\". So tell me, in your opinion, are New York values different than Iowa values?\nHUCKABEE: You know, I -- I would leave that to other people. I'm not going to get into an argument with all the New Yorkers, because there's a lot of them. [laughter]\nThis much I will tell you. I wish that some of those New Yorkers had funded as much of my campaign as they did the corporately funded candidates, but they didn't.\nAnd to be honest with you, when I say I'm -- wish they had, I'm glad they didn't. I'm not a New York-funded campaign. I'm not bankrolled by the corporatists, I'm not bankrolled by Goldman Sachs and Citibank and AIG and all the big brokers -- brokerage houses and the billionaires.\nI'm sponsored by people like Thomas, a part-time Uber driver in Pennsylvania who sent me $25 this week. He's between jobs. He's driving an Uber car. But he believed in what I'm talking about enough that, even on a limited, part-time income, he sent me $25 to help in my campaign.\nI'll stand with the Thomases of the world any day. I'll leave all the discussion of the big financiers to other candidates. But there's only a few of us in the entire Republican process who are not corporately funded by the same group.\nAnd let me just finish by saying, you want to know why things never change depending on whether Democrats or Republicans are in power, and why Republicans in Iowa and the rest of the country are so frustrated?\nThe reason is, is because if you follow the money, the same folks who finance the Democrats finance the Republicans, and no matter what the speeches and the ads, they get the same results.\nIf you want a different result, I'm available. [applause]\nMACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.\nSenator Santorum, according to Google, the Paris terror attacks were the largest story that was searched in 2015, with nearly 1 billion searches of that story worldwide.\nThere have been at 18 terror attacks so far this year -- in just January alone, in 2016, and it will likely, as we all know, get worse. But what can an American president do to stop these terrifying killings?\nSANTORUM: Thank you for the question, Martha.\nWe have to have an honest discussion with the American people about the nature of the threat that we confront. This president says that ISIS has nothing to do with Islam, and as a result has put together a strategy that doesn't take care of what the reality is, which is ISIS has established a caliphate.\nA caliphate is like a kingdom ruled by -- a caliphate is ruled by a caliph, a kingdom is ruled by a king. Only the difference is a caliphate is also a religious title, and it is both a religious call to help this state, as well a -- to -- to make the state stronger.\nThe reality is that ISIS has established a caliphate, and is using that to attract people around the globe to follow them as the leaders of the Sunni world.\nAnd you say, \"well, how do we stop them from following them?\" Well, to be a legitimate caliphate, you have to control land and operate a state under sharia law.\nIf you don't do that, you cannot call for that support. And so the answer is we must take their land and make them... [bell rings] ... illegitimate in the eyes of the Muslim world. So I would put troops on the ground and take the land back from Iraq and return to its rightful ownership in Iraq. That would delegitimize them.\nMACCALLUM: Thank you, Senator.\nHEMMER: Ms. Fiorina, same topic. The president says that many are exaggerating the threat from ISIS. To quote him, \"this is not World War III, and they do not pose a threat to our national existence.\" Does he have a point? Does ISIS threaten our ability to survive as a nation?\nFIORINA: Well let me tell you this: news flash, President Obama, news flash, Mrs. Clinton -- climate change is not our most pressing national security threat. [applause]\nActually -- actually, it is ISIS, followed closely by Iran. And those two things are linked, so that when our president cozies up to Iran, all of our allies in the Middle East, who are ready to help us defeat ISIS, wonder whose side we're on. And the truth is, under this president, we are on Iran's side, not our allies', who would help us defeat ISIS.\nYou know, one of the things we have to start with is understanding that we must stand up to adversaries. So Hillary Clinton famously asked, what difference does it make how four Americans died in Benghazi? This is the difference it makes, Mrs. Clinton.\nWhen terrorists purposefully attack an American embassy and kill four Americans, including an ambassador, and the next morning you get up and you lie about a videotape that doesn't represent our values, instead of saying the United States of America was purposefully attacked by terrorists, and we will seek retribution, then you are saying to every adversary and every adversary and every terrorist organization on the planet, it's open season.\nThat, Mrs. Clinton, is what difference it makes. [applause]\nHEMMER: Thank you.\nMACCALLUM: Governor Huckabee, you have said when it comes to ISIS, quote: \"If Russia is willing to help us kill these savages, then on this they are with us and not against us.\"\nBut we have seen Putin's quote-unquote \"help\" in Crimea and in Ukraine. And this week the U.K. implicated him in the poisoning death of one of his rivals. So are you foolish to think that we can ever work with Vladimir Putin?\nHUCKABEE: Well, I don't trust him. I've never said I trusted him. But if somebody is willing to take a shot at the people we are taking shots at, I'm more than willing to let them use their own bullets to do it.\nBut let's be very clear about how we take out ISIS. And I think Rick Santorum is exactly right. You take away their land.\nBut one of the things we have to do is a comprehensive strategy to get ISIS. First of all, take away their access to social media platforms. They are using the same social media platforms to recruit, and to train, and to direct people as I use to see pictures of my grandkids. That's ridiculous.\nThe second thing, go after them financially. Wage war with them. Make it so nobody can do commerce with ISIS. Not a nickel of transfer. Any company, any country, that even gets close to dealing with them, absolutely put sanctions on them. Make them pay.\nAnd finally, you have got to go after them militarily. And that means we send the land, the sea, the air forces, the A-10 Warthogs dropping ordnances on every truck and every tank, and we obliterate them. But we have to understand that they are a force that's getting bigger. And with any kind of cancer, you don't contain it, you eradicate it. And that's how we have to fight ISIS, comprehensively. That's what I would suggest we do. [applause]\nMACCALLUM: Thank you.\nHEMMER: Governor Gilmore, some time this spring 34 more detainees are cleared from release from Gitmo. If you were president, as you say, this president wants to close it. As president, if Gitmo were closed and an enemy combatant were found or captured in the field of battle, perhaps Syria or Iraq or Libya, and you don't have Gitmo, where would you put them?\nGILMORE: First of all, Bill, I think that Gitmo ought to remain open. But I also want to point out to you that what you are saying is the exact right topic to all of these other candidates. And that's this international challenge that we are facing, the international war that America is in, even to this day.\nAnd I'm the candidate who is best qualified to deal with this issue. A degree in foreign policy in Russian area studies. I'm the only United States Army veteran having gone to Europe during the Cold War as United States Army Intelligence agent, the governor during the 9/11 attack, the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security for the United States for five years.\nAnd this is what I will do. If I become the president, I'm going to rebuild the United States military. We're going to take the sequester off the defense budget. Give the Navy the ships it needs. Refit the United States Army. Refit the United States Marine Corps.\nAnd on this international guerrilla war, we need to recognize our Special Forces, our intelligence community, and the people that we need in order to really protect us.\nAnd finally, this war of ideas, we must win this. We must say to the world that radical Islamism is the threat. It isn't just confined to ISIS. It is worldwide. And if we win the war of ideas, then we will win the international guerrilla war.\nHEMMER: Governor, thank you for that. [applause]\nMACCALLUM: Coming up, we're going to have more on the top issues in this campaign, and you can engage in tonight's conversation right from home. Go to google.com, search \"FOX News debate.\" You can vote on which candidate you think is winning so far in tonight's debate. And you can check results after the debate is over.\nWe are back in a moment live from the Iowa Events Center in Des Moines.\n[commercial break]\nHEMMER: Welcome back to Des Moines on what will be a long night here. Let's get back to the questions. Let's get back to the questions with Martha.\nMACCALLUM: Alright, Governor Huckabee, government grows and grows. In fact, neighborhoods in and around the Beltway get richer and richer all the time while our manufacturing towns are disappearing. Still Republicans from Reagan to Bush have bowed to shrink the size of government, but it never works.\nIs this Presidency, and presidency, simply too small a David to slay the Goliath of government?\nHUCKABEE: No, I don't think that it's impossible, but we're not going to do it by doing the same things we've been doing for all these many years. And, we've lost five million manufacturing jobs just since the year 2000.\nThe other day I was in Newton, Iowa. It used to be a vibrant place where Maytag washers and dryers were built. Went out of business in 2007, all those shops went to Mexico. All those people lost their jobs. There was a guy in my forum that day, he lost his job. He still has never found an employment that got anywhere near the job that he had.\nLet me ask you, how many people do you think living around the Beltway know a guy like that? Care about a guy like that? Not many. And, that's because they're six of the ten richest counties in America that surround Washington D.C. People who live in the bubbles of the high finance world of New York, the government world of Washington, the entertainment world of Hollywood, don't have a clue about how hard people out here in Iowa are working every single day.\nAnd, I believe one of the values of campaigning in Iowa, you can't win unless you go out and talk to farmers and housewives -- and welders, and unemployed truck drivers, and I hate... [bell rings] ... That a president could become president who never met people who have to struggle to make a living and put food on the table. [applause]\nMACCALLUM: Alright, Carly Fiorina, you've said that you can get the tax code down to three short simple pages. But, when lobbyists who have twisted the arms of members of Congress come sit with you in the Oval Office and say, \"Madam President, sorry, I cannot be with you on this one,\" you may understand what previous presidents have gone through. No?\nFIORINA: You know, we have a professional, political class of both parties. We have been talking about the same issues for election cycle after election cycle. Yeah, government is big and out of control, and the only way to get it under control is to control the money.\nAnd the only way to control the money is to ask the federal government to budget the way you do, to examine every dollar, to cut any dollar to spend -- to move any dollar.\nThe fancy word for that is zero-base budgeting. I call it common sense. That three-page tax code I talk about all the time here in Iowa? It's been around for 20 years. But politicians don't want to talk about it, and you bet the lobbyists don't want to talk about it.\nIn fact, nobody wants to vote on a three-page tax code or zero- base budgeting, although they've both been around for a long time. You know why? Because if you get those two things done, you are goring everybody's ox.\nYou are taking the political establishment apart. You are actually challenging the status quo, which is what we need in the Oval Office. So you know who I'm going to count on? The citizens of this great nation, because you have extraordinary power.\nBut when you do not use it... [bell rings] ... you are losing it. So take out your smartphones, folks. The people of Iowa know what I'm talking about. You take out your smartphones. if you agree with me that three-page tax code needs to be passed, lobbyists aren't going to be in my office.\nIf you agree we gotta finally pass zero-base budgeting, take out your smartphones. Press one for yes, ladies and gentlemen. Press two for no. Citizens, we must take our country back. [applause]\nHEMMER: Let me stay with you, Ms. Fiorina. You've said you will shrink the federal government by 30 percent over the next two years, and those jobs will not be filled, and you'll do it through retirement.\nYour critics would argue that's exactly what you did at Hewlett Packard when 30,000 people lost their jobs. If it did not work at H.P., why would it work at the federal government?\nFIORINA: Well, first of all, I haven't said that. What I have said is that in the process of examining every dollar, cutting any dollar and moving any dollar, we happen to know that in this vast federal bureaucracy we have about 260,000 federal government employees who are going to retire, and we shouldn't replace them.\nSecondly, at Hewlett Packard, as you know -- the people of Iowa know this -- we went through a tough time. The worst technology recession in 25 years -- a great company called Gateway used to do be right here in Iowa. But they didn't make the tough calls necessary to save all those jobs, and so they lost every one of those jobs.\nYes, I've had to make some tough calls. We saved 80,000 jobs. We went on to grow to 160,000 jobs. And, frankly, I think the American people know we need a president who's going to make some tough calls.\nSo let me tell you where I'm going to start. The American people got a bill passed through Congress that said we could fire the top 400 senior executives at the V.A. for dereliction of duty.\nWhen we know that 307,000 veterans have died waiting for health care and the V.A. handed out $142 million worth of bonuses for superb performance, I'm going to start by firing 400... [bell rings] ... senior executives at the V.A. [applause]\nHEMMER: Thank you.\nMACCALLUM: Senator Santorum, Bernie Sanders asked a woman in Iowa what it's like to live in poverty. She broke down in tears, saying that she lives on less than $10,000 a year and that she is ashamed every day.\nShe leans on her parents for help. She says she can't buy presents for her children. We are all sympathetic to this woman's plight. On the other hand, the G.O.P. is supposed to be the party of smaller government. So what would you look her in the eye and say?\nSANTORUM: What I would say is that we have to create jobs that give people wages and benefits that can help them provide for themselves and their families. And that's why I announced from a factory floor in western Pennsylvania, I pledge to make America the number one manufacturing nation, again, in the world. And we can do it. China is starting to reorient itself away from a manufacturing economy that's dumping products on the -- overseas to providing more services to their people.\nThis is an opportunity for America. It's an opportunity for us to get those jobs back. And by the way, do you want to solve global climate change? Take 2 million jobs from China in manufacturing and moving them back here to the United States, where we produce one-fifth the CO2 when we make things. [applause]\nWe can help -- we can do every -- we can do it all. We can take care of the environment. We can create more jobs here. Seventy-four percent of Americans don't have a college degree.\nAnd unfortunately most folks who, in the Republican Party, don't talk about what we're going to do to create jobs for people who feel like neither political party cares about them. [bell rings]\nWhen you elect me, we'll create opportunities for working men and women in this country -- all over this country.\nMACCALLUM: Thank you, Senator.\nHEMMER: Governor Huckabee, Nikki Haley, Republican governor from South Carolina, recently said...\nGILMORE: Hey, did you miss me? Did you skip me?\nHEMMER: I did not, but we...\nGILMORE: I'm going to have something to say about this, but you just keep going.\nHEMMER: We have plenty for you -- you bet, Governor. We have a couple more in the hopper for you in a moment here.\nGILMORE: Yes, I'll be there. [laughter]\nHEMMER: First, Governor -- Governor Huckabee, Nikki Haley warned about listening to \"the siren call of the angriest voices,\" to which Donald Trump said he is \"very, very angry.\" Who is right, Governor?\nHUCKABEE: A lot of Americans are angry. And I think it's important to understand why they are mad. They are mad because they see a government that continues to do fine. They see people at the top. They are doing fine.\nBut that person you asked Rick about a moment ago, that lady that's making 10,000 bucks a year, do you know what our poverty programs do to people? They keep them in poverty.\nThey keep them in poverty because we have these arbitrary thresholds... [applause] ... that mean that if you go to work, you lose all the benefits for your kids, Medicaid, WIC, Section 8 housing, food stamps, and then your kids go hungry. I know a little about poverty. My sister is here tonight. Now both of us could tell you we did not grow up rich.\nMy mother grew up in a house, oldest of seven kids. She had lived in a house that didn't have floors. Just dirt. No electricity. No running water. I resent it when people say, oh, people are poor because they want to be. No, they are not.\nNobody wants to be poor. And that's a stupid, foolish thing, mean thing to say. People are poor because they don't know how to get out of the hole. And government shouldn't push them back in the hole which is what our policies do when they punish people who want to go to work and don't let them out. [applause]\nWe can fix that, but it takes some leadership to get it done.\nHEMMER: Thank you, Governor. [applause]\nMACCALLUM: Governor Gilmore, thanks to the Iranian nuclear deal, President Rouhani is currently on a tour of Europe meeting with our closest allies in France and Italy. In fact, he has already landed some 50 to 85 billion are the estimates in deals with those countries, with our allies. More on the way.\nYou and others say that you would rip up that deal. But, really, by the time the next president is in office, won't that horse be well out of the barn?\nGILMORE: You know, Martha, it may be out of the barn in that the Iranians may be moving towards a nuclear program, because this nuclear deal actually gives them a time frame up the road when they are going to be able to do that kind of program.\nAnd that's very dangerous because it means people in the Middle East have to begin to react to that right now. The United States, I think, has to continue to exercise its influence in the Middle East, stay active, and not do this pull-back type of program that we are seeing all over the place with President Obama, which is creating this kind of danger.\nThe world is a more dangerous place now than when I was an intelligence agent. We have not only this international guerrilla war but also these challenges from these other countries as well.\nBut, Martha, I want to say one more thing to you and Bill. I disagree with Carly Fiorina when she says that it's just a political class in Washington. The truth is that the country has changed. And there are powerful forces at this point that are really controlling our lives. And that's why people are so angry.\nOne of those is government, which is regulating everything through the Environmental Protection Agency, through other places. But the biggest one is the organized establishment media.\nAnd I just noticed just now you gave Carly Fiorina two one-minute answers in a row. This media across the country is manipulating and shaping and framing this campaign and has been for at least a year now in order to get the kind of choices that people are going to have an opportunity to see.\nThis is wrong. It has to change. And when I'm president, it's going to change. [applause]\nMACCALLUM: We have another question for you, Governor Gilmore, back to back, here we go. According to Google...\nGILMORE: I'll take it. [laughter]\nMACCALLUM: You got it. According to Google, gun control is the most searched issue last month, making up nearly 80 percent of all the U.S. searches. People are looking for information on guns.\nWhen it comes to the tragic mass killings that we have seen in this country, Donald Trump says that what we need to do is build quote \"more institutions for people who are sickos.\"\nCharles Krauthammer also says that in some cases involuntary commitment would help. And you have agreed with that. Given that institutions would be extraordinarily expensive to begin building, how much is too much to ask on this from the American taxpayer?\nGILMORE: Martha, I just visited a community mental health clinic in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, just three days ago, as a matter of fact. And when I was governor of Virginia, I tried to move more of those resources into the community, which will give us the facilities and the abilities to begin to identify people who actually might be dangerous and who abuse Second Amendment rights.\nBut I do believe this is one of the really principle issues in this campaign. The president and Hillary Clinton are working very hard to change the culture of this country in order to put us in a position where we can't exercise Second Amendment rights.\nThat's wrong. I am a board member of the National Rifle Association.\nThe reason I'm a board member is because I believe that individuals in this country can be trusted to exercise their rights under the Second Amendment and under the Bill of Rights. To take away people's Second Amendment rights is to redefine the individual in the society, and I'm not going to put up with it. As President of the United States, when Jim Gilmore's President of the United States, I can tell you this. Gun control is not going to be an issue.\nIf gun control... [bell rings] ... comes to the President's desk when I'm president, I'll veto it as fast as it takes Hillary Clinton to eliminate her emails. [applause]\nMACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor Gilmore.\nHEMMER: Governor Huckabee, you've mentioned the economy several times tonight. Let's go back to that for a moment because in America today 50% of the American workers are making less than $30,000 dollars a year. Let's talk about what you could do for them.\nThe Conservative Club for Growth has had an issue with your policy on taxes for years. In fact, it called you, \"Tax Hike Mike\". And, the record shows state spending in Arkansas increased 54% when you were in charge, 94% if you include federal dollars during that same period. When it comes to helping people at the margins, $30,000, $32,000 dollars a year, what's better? A tax and spend approach, or shrinking government?\nHUCKABEE: Well, I didn't have a tax and spend approach. You got to understand where the Club for Growth comes from, a bunch of rich guys sitting around writing checks to go after people they don't like. And, they don't like me sometimes because I was fighting for the guys at the bottom, not just the guys at the top. I cut 94 taxes in a state that had never had a general major tax decrease in its history.\nI also was able to see per capita income growth in my state go up by 50%. I think that's a pretty darn good record. Look at the overall record and it was fine.\nBut, it's not about stats from when I was governor. Look, one of the reasons I support the Fairtax is because it's the one thing, Bill, that would truly empower people at the bottom of the economy by no longer punishing them for their work.\nIf a guy works an hourly job, and he works eight hours, gets paid for it, terrific. But, if he works 16 hours, he doesn't get a double paycheck because he's going to be bumped up into a new tax bracket, and the government will get more of his second shift than he will. So, we've actually punished him for being industrious, hardworking, and that is a foolish economic policy... [bell rings] ... that's hurting Americans about as much as anything. [applause]\nHEMMER: Governor Huckabee, thank you. Same issue, Senator Santorum. The President says criticism of his economic policy is political hot air. You consistently talk about manufacturing jobs leaving America. You support a flat tax of 20%. How would a flat tax bring back two million jobs to America?\nSANTORUM: Well, in fact, the plan that I put forward is scored by the Tax Foundation as bringing three and a half million jobs into this country, and we have provisions in the flat tax for the corporate side that actually has a phase in of manufacturing. Manufacturers initially don't pay any income tax. Ten percent the next year, and 20.\nWe're going to also have a repatriation provision which says that if you have money overseas, and you're Apple, and you got a couple hundred billion dollars there, bring it back. The most you'll be taxed 10%, invest it here in America. Create jobs here in America with all that money that's sitting overseas.\nWe also -- it's not just taxes. It's regulation. I've pledged to cut every single Obamacare -- I mean, excuse me, Obama regulation, including Obamacare, and remove those regulations that cost more than a hundred million dollars in the economy. That will liberate -- and that includes waters of the U.S., and the ozone regulations, they -- the mercury regulations. All of these just crush our manufactures and don't create an opportunity for us to survive.\nAnd, remember, China produces five times as much CO2 and other pollutants per dollar of GDP as we do. [bell rings]\nYou want to help the environment? Bring jobs back to America. [applause]\nHEMMER: Senator, thank you.\nMACCALLUM: Still more to come from the Republican Presidential debate tonight.\nAnd, see how the campaigns are responding to the debate in realtime, go to Google.com and open your google search app. Type in, \"Fox News Debate\".\nWe'll see you, just a moment -- back. [applause]\n[commercial break]\nMACCALLUM: We are back live at the Iowa events center and this question goes to Carly Fiorina. In the last debate you said as part of your introduction, quote, \" And unlike the other woman candidate in this case I actually love spending time with my husband.\" [laughter]\nFIORINA: He is right there. He is right there.\nMACCALLUM: But back in September in an interview you said that you would stick only to the record, your record versus Hillary Clinton's record. And never resort to personal attacks. So what changed?\nFIORINA: It wasn't a personal attack. I was pointing out the fact that Hillary Clinton will do anything to gain and hang on to power, anything. Listen, if my husband did what Bill Clinton did, I would have left him long ago. [applause]\nSo, here's the deal. Hillary Clinton has been climbing the ladder to try and get power and here now she is trying for the White House. She is probably more qualified for the big house, honestly. [laughter]\nShe has escaped prosecution more times than El Chapo, perhaps Sean Penn should interview her. [laughter]\nThe woman should be prosecuted. [applause]\nAnd while Mrs. Clinton has flown hundreds of thousands of world around the global, I have too. And I know flying is an activity not an accomplishment. While I know that she has held many positions and many titles she has not accomplished much of anything in her life. She has gotten every single foreign policy challenge wrong. [bell rings]\nShe continues to lie to the American people. It's called the Clinton way. Both Bill and Hillary practice it, the Clinton way. Say whatever you have to say, do whatever you have to say. Lie as long as you can get away with it. Hillary Clinton cannot be the president of these United States. [applause]\nMACCALLUM: All right. Carly, I want to stay with you on this next question as well.\nYou waded into the Planned Parenthood early on. You took some heat for it. Now the people who shot that undercover video are the ones who got indicted and Planned Parenthood is untouched. Hillary Clinton has been crowing about this. Any regrets about this?\nFIORINA: Well, you know, Hillary Clinton hasn't been indicted either. So that tells us a lot about our justice system in this country. But, look, the facts of Planned Parenthood have not changed, folks, and I will not be rendered silent on this issue or any other issue.\nAnd it doesn't matter what stage I'm on. Here are the facts. Planned Parenthood engages in partial birth abortion, in late-term abortion. They alter those abortion techniques to harvest and sell body parts. They have admitted that they are not going to accept compensation for this anymore.\nThe reality is, most Americans find this practice horrific. Most Americans find horrific that Hillary Clinton's position on this is it's not a life until it's born. Most Americans find horrific Hillary Clinton's position or the Democrat party's position, that a young woman does not need her mother's permission to get an abortion.\nBut if you are 13 years old, you can get an abortion, but you can't go to a tanning salon without your mother's permission. A president Fiorina -- in a president Fiorina budget, there will not be one dime for Planned Parenthood, although there would be a lot of money for women's health and we will finally pass the pain capable unborn child protection act.\nI will always stand for life and religious liberty... [bell rings] ... because this is about the character of our nation. [applause]\nMACCALLUM: Thank you Carly Fiorina. Let me just ask a quick question here to Senator Santorum.\nCarly Fiorina was the only one of the GOP candidates to attend the March for Life in Washington last week. Where were you.\nSANTORUM: Well, I've been to the March for Life for about 25 years and I thought -- I think that's a pretty good record. [applause]\nSpoken at it a few times and I have shepherded every single piece of pro-life piece of legislation that's passed over the last 20 years. I've either authored it or shepherded it through the United States Congress and I'm pretty proud of that record too. [applause]\nBut we have an election going on and there was some snow coming. So I decided that maybe it would be better for me to get out and do some campaigning and not be stuck as my wife and kids were for a week, piling out of two and a half feet of snow.\nSo, here's what I would say. If you want someone that is going to talk a good game, there are a lot of folks on this stage that have talked a good game on the issue of life.\nNot only have I talked a good game on life and I've done some things. But I've also lived it. You know, one of the things Saint Francis said was, you know, if you preach the gospel, then if you have to, speak.\nThe bottom line is, that twice in my life, we were counseled to have an abortion, one with our son Gabriel and one with our little girl Bella. And neither time did Karen and I for a moment think about it because we know that life begins at conception.\nWe know the dignity of every human life and we know the potential of every child, no matter how long that life lives. And that is a message that can come across to all Americans and without having to say a word and defend the institution of life and the dignity of life in this country. [applause]\nFIORINA: Martha, can I just say we've been talking tonight about a lot of issues and we've also been talking about the fact that the game is rigged and frankly, the media has a lot to do with that.\nIt is outrageous frankly, that Fox News, and you, would question the pro-life credentials of Rick Santorum. [applause] That is outrageous. [applause]\nHEMMER: Thank you Ms. Fiorina.\nGovernor Gilmore. Who are the moderate Muslims do you seek advice and counsel from on how to deal with the threat from radical Islamic terrorism?\nGILMORE: You know Bill, that raises, I think, the question of the future of the Republican party. The question is -- first of all, I stand second to no one in standing up to radical Islamism. I understand that ISIS is a piece of that but it is a world-wide phenomena that has manifested itself in Paris, in 9/11, in San Bernardino, in Boston.\nI recognize all that. But I also recognize this. This is a strain of Islamism that cannot be supported and cannot be stood for. And what we need is for people in the Muslim community in the United States to stand up and be counted and to say that this is not right.\nAnd yes, I have met with some people. And I'm not going to identify who they are. I met with them last week. And they told me some terrible stories about how they have been harassed and their children have seen them be harassed.\nAnd I said to them. You have got to stand up and condemn this radical Islamism because it's the war of ideas that we are going to have to win to go along with our military conflicts that are coming forward.\nBut the point is Bill... [bell rings] ... we cannot have a Republican party that scapegoats anyone, Hispanics, Muslims, any women, African Americans, anyone. If that becomes the future of the Republican party, I don't want to be a part of that.\nHEMMER: Thank you governor. [applause]\nGovernor Huckabee. Here in Iowa 43 percent of Democratic caucus goers describe themselves as socialist. That's a higher number than those who say they are capitalist. I guess you could say, they're feeling the burn. [laughter]\nThis is a country rooted in capitalism, the United States of America. How did we get here?\nHUCKABEE: I honestly don't understand how anybody with IQ above plant life would honestly think... [laughter] ... that we would be better off if we let the government have all of the private property and that the government would dole out what they thought we should have.\nI'm not \"feeling the Bern,\" Bill. I'm not feeling it. [applause]\nAnd when Bernie Sanders promises these kids free college, I'm telling them, because I get asked, what about free college? I said, look, if we give you free college when you are 20, pal, you are going to be paying for it when you are 30, when you are 40, and when you are 50. [applause]\nThere is no such thing as the government giving you anything. They will definitely make a mess of it.\nAnd I just think there are a lot of people who have never understood the basic understanding of economics, that you do not make people rich by tearing down those who are you providing jobs, and you don't help poor people by taking away.\nYou give them jobs. Let them work. Let them earn. And then you let them keep the money that they earned. That's how we build a great economy. [applause]\nHEMMER: Thank you, Governor.\nSenator Santorum, the president says politics in America have become meaner over the past several years with him in the White House. Two weeks ago at the State of the Union he said the following. \"A president with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide.\"\nLincoln and Roosevelt, that's pretty good company. If he is right, do Republicans share some of the blame?\nSANTORUM: The president of the United States has been the most divisive president in -- certainly in my lifetime. This is a man who constantly... [applause] He is not trustworthy. You can't sit down and negotiate with him. He won't keep a deal. We have heard that over and over again. And here is what he does that really, really creates the friction in Washington.\nHe personally attacks people. He ascribes motives to them that aren't true and then he tears them down. How are you going to work with someone if you don't treat them decently, honestly, and respectfully?\nI was a tough fighter when I was in Washington. I had very sharp elbows. I fought. I went there and joined a game named Jim Nussle here from Iowa with the \"gang of seven.\" And we, in four years' time, took a Congress that had been controlled by Democrats for 40 years, and brought in the first Republican majority because we fought and we fought tough.\nBut you know what? I was able to then work with those same people that we fought with and able to pass welfare reform. Unborn Victims of Violence Act. Pro-life bills. Health savings accounts.\nA whole laundry list of things not because I was mean, but because I was able to be respectful in the disagreements. And that's what we need in Washington, someone who can be respectful and still unite this country. [applause]\nHEMMER: Thank you, Senator.\nMACCALLUM: All right. Coming up, we will have the closing statements from our candidates tonight as we continue live from the Iowa Events Center in Des Moines. We'll be right back.\n[commercial break]\nHEMMER: In the closing few moments, the candidates have an opportunity to make a closing statement, 30 seconds for each. And, we want to start tonight with the former Virginia Governor, Jim Gilmore.\nGILMORE: Well, thank you very much, Bill. And, thank you, and Fox and Google for including me in this debate tonight. I think it's been a wonderful opportunity.\nI'm the son of a meat cutter. My father worked for Safeway stores for 45 years. My mother was a secretary, she ended her career as the Secretary for the Methodist Bishop. I didn't have a father that could give me a million dollar loan to start my business. But, my father did talk character, and he provided for his family, and he was a wonderful example.\nAnd, I'm not about to go across town tonight to carry the coat for some billionaire. Instead, I intend to run for President of the United States, speak to the issue of this international war, and challenge that we're in. This issue of veterans rights, and the issue of Second Amendment rights, and I ask for your support...\nHEMMER: ... Thank you, Governor. [applause]\nMACCALLUM: Alright, let's go now to Senator Rick Santorum.\nSANTORUM: I just want to thank the people of Iowa. Over the last five years I've done 700 speeches and town hall meetings all throughout the state of Iowa, and it has been an incredible right. Thank you. [applause]\nI want to thank all the wonderful folks like Pastor Carey Gordon who gave me a smooth stone and said you go slay Goliaths. Someone like Jim and Janet Cook who over this past Christmas gave up Christmas presents for their kids, and they have more than I do, just they can help me and my campaign.\nThat's the kind of people... [bell rings] ... in Iowa. And, here's what I'm asking you to do. You're good people. You know good leaders. Lead. Pick the right person, not what the polls say. Not who the money give people to. Pick the leader you know is best for this country. Thank you. [applause and cheering]\nHEMMER: Governor Huckabee.\nHUCKABEE: Well, this week there was a little dust up about a video we put together with the music of Adele, so I thought it'd be appropriate for me to begin tonight by saying, \"Hello, Iowa. It's me.\"\nMACCALLUM: [laughing]\nHUCKABEE: And, you know me. You gave me the largest number of votes in the history of the Iowa caucus eight years ago, and I think you did it because you trusted me, you believed that I had your best interest at heart.\nWhen I was governor I had a little plaque in my office in the Governor's office, and it simply said this. Come, let us reason together. [bell rings]\nI believe the next President needs to put that plaque in the oval office, and needs to lead this country by saying, \"Come, let us reason together.\"\nGod bless you, and thank you for your support. [applause and cheering]\nHEMMER: Thank you, Governor.\nMACCALLUM: Carly Fiorina.\nFIORINA: In over 150 events I have come to know and love the people of Iowa. And the people of Iowa know what the rest of Americans have figured out, this ain't working anymore. The government no longer works for those who pay for it. The professional political class says and does whatever they need to do to win, and then does whatever they please.\nWe need to return to a citizen government. That is why I am running for President. The media, the establishment, they all want to tell you this elections over, they know who's going to win it, except that you haven't... [bell rings] ... cast a single vote yet. So, the people of Iowa, stand with me, fight with me. Caucus for me. It is time to take our country back.\nMACCALLUM: Thank you, Carly. [applause]\nHEMMER: That concludes our debate tonight, but the night has just begun.\nMACCALLUM: In one hour, seven more candidates take the stage for a debate hosted by Bret Baier, Megyn Kelly, and Chris Wallace.

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111533", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n12:51 P.M. EST\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Nice to see you all. I do not have any statements to make at the top, so we can go straight to your questions.\nKathleen, do you want to start?\nQ: I wanted to ask about a piece of legislation that Senate Democrats are pushing in response to the Flint, Michigan crisis. This is a bill that would put up $400 million to fix lead pipes and also require Michigan to match the federal funding, and would require federal action if the state refuses to warn people about unsafe water. And I'm just wondering if the White House supports the legislation, and if you think this is it in terms of what's needed in terms of federal reforms.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we haven't taken a close look at the legislation. I just got the top lines that you described shortly before walking out here. So we'll obviously take a close look at the bill that's put forward by members of the Michigan delegation I believe in both the House and the Senate. So we'll take a close look at that.\nThere are already a variety of things that the federal government and the Obama administration have already moved on to try to offer some assistance to the state and local officials who are responding to this particular situation. That includes what the President and the EPA Administrator believe are needed reforms to the relationship that governs -- or to the rules that govern the relationships between the EPA and state and local environmental regulators.\nIt sounds like that's similar to the proposal that's been put forward legislatively to ensure that those regulations don't unnecessarily interfere with the ability of the EPA to make public information that could be directly relevant to the health and safety of the public. So it sounds like this legislation certainly touches on some of the issues that we have identified. But I think what the administration is committed to doing is making sure that over the long haul we follow through on this response. While certainly the issues that you've mentioned that are included in the legislation are important, so, too, are the public health consequences for some of the failures that we've already seen there.\nAnd again, the lead federal official in Michigan who is responsible for coordinating the overall activities of the federal government is a public health expert from the Department of Health and Human Services, again, mindful of the fact that there are significant public health consequences for some of the infrastructure failures that we've seen in Flint. So my guess is that even those who put forward this specific piece of legislation would not view it as the final word on assistance that could be offered in a helpful way to the people of Flint, Michigan.\nQ: And then I wanted to ask another question about some action on the Hill. It looks like, at least at the moment anyway, that Senator McConnell is not all that interested in moving criminal justice legislation this year. And even some of the big supporters have suggested that it's not -- Senator Cornyn recently said it's not critical that the legislation move this year. And I'm wondering if the White House feels like it's already lost steam. This is one of your only -- maybe one of two major legislative priorities this year, and it seems to be stalling.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we've actually identified, based on the last count, about seven different things we feel like we can actually work effectively with Republicans on over the course of this year to advance shared priorities. These are things that we have identified as priorities, and things that Republicans themselves say they're interested in. You noted one of them, criminal justice reform. The other is, of course, ratifying the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement that was completed by the administration last fall.\nOther issues that the President has discussed that Republicans say they also support are things like significant investments in medical research and development, including the cancer moonshot that the President discussed in the State of the Union address.\nAnother thing that the President has indicated he supports is expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit to offer additional tax credits to childless workers. Right now, the Earned Income Tax program is an economically powerful way to keep families out of poverty, and this is a benefit that we believe can be structured to effectively help childless workers. Speaker Ryan has indicated this is a proposal that he supports. There's been a lot of talk on the campaign trail about fighting heroin abuse and addiction. Certainly the administration has played a leading role in that. We would take up Republicans and their stated interest in that.\nTwo other things -- the authorization to use military force, again, something that some Republicans at least say that Congress should act on. We've been saying for more than a year now that this is something that Congress should do. And Speaker Ryan, at the end of last year, committed to House action that would offer needed assistance to Puerto Rico, and we have long advocated offering the island of Puerto Rico, that government, the opportunity to restructure some of their debts in order to meet some of their financial challenges.\nThese are all things Republicans say that they support. But as you note, we have seen comments from Republicans indicating that, well, maybe they'll get TPP done this year; maybe they won't. Now they're saying something similar about criminal justice reform. I think it does beg, though, one question, which is, what are Republicans going to do? What is exactly their legislative agenda that they're seeking to advance? They've got some ideas that they know are nonstarters. There are plenty of partisan initiatives that they put forward, like repealing the Affordable Care Act. Again, I think you'd be hard-pressed to say that that would actually be a proactive legislative accomplishment, to actually undo something that has provided health care to 17 million Americans. But maybe Republicans can make that case. That's a different argument.\nThe argument I'm making is, what's the Republican agenda? The things that we've identified -- I've laid out seven of them -- are things that Republicans say that they support. They're things that we say that we support. Why wouldn't we make progress on them? And if they -- and I also recognize that a lot of times this gets covered as, well, Republicans deal another blow to the President's legislative priorities. I understand why that's the coverage. And to a certain extent that's true. But at what point, do Republicans actually have to start becoming more transparent about what their objectives actually are?\nWe are in an election year, and the American people will be evaluating whether or not Republicans should continue to entrust the majority in the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives to Republicans. And based on the way that Republicans are talking right now, I'm not really sure what they intend to do to demonstrate that they deserve that responsibility and that opportunity.\nQ: So what does the President plan to do about this?\nMR. EARNEST: I think what the President plans to do is to continue to try to work in good faith with Republicans in those areas where we agree.\nI walked through some things that the President certainly considers a priority, and we stand ready to work with Republicans to advance them. I don't think either of them is particularly ideological. I don't think there's a reason that any of them needs to be necessarily the kind of issue that breaks down along party lines. And it certainly would be consistent with the President's stated view that he intends to make the most of every remaining day that he has in office, including by working with Republicans to advance legislation that would be good for the country. The question is whether or not Republicans are actually going to have the courage to step up to the plate and reciprocate that interest and that action.\nJeff.\nQ: Josh, Russia said today that Saudi Arabia has proposed cutting oil production by up to 5 percent. Is the White House aware of these deliberations among oil-producing countries? And would you welcome it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think it is certainly an interesting indication from the Russians about how concerned they are about their economy. The Russian economy over the last several years has been isolated because of their destabilizing activities in Ukraine. That's had a significant impact on their economy in the short term, but it's also had an impact on their longer-term economic projections. Those sanctions had been put in place around the same time that oil prices on the global market started to decline. And those two things have combined to have a pretty negative impact on the Russian economy and on the prospects for Russian economic growth.\nAnd so I think it is notable that you see the Russians essentially looking for a lifeline from some other countries to try to cooperate with them to boost their economic prospects. I think it remains to be seen whether or not they'll be successful in doing that, but I do think that this admission from the Russians is telegraphing the kind of economic weakness that they have for the last couple of years attempted to deny.\nQ: You make it a point of saying that Russia has leaked this deliberately, but they did say that it was a Saudi Arabian proposal.\nMR. EARNEST: I think what I'm mostly reacting to are sort of the statements from the Russians that they were going to seek to try to work out some agreements with other oil-producing nations to address some of their own -- the weakness in their own economy.\nI don't have much insight into the announcement by the Saudis. So we'll have to get back to you if we have a specific announcement from them -- or on their action.\nQ: Your point about Russia is understood. But, generally, oil prices being at the low level that they are have had other impacts on the world economy. Would the White House welcome a shift in policy from big oil producers -- such as Russia, such as, more appropriately, Saudi Arabia -- to alter that?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have a specific comment to share with you in terms of the energy policy decisions that are being made by other countries. What the President has advocated for the United States is a policy that, over the long term, transitions the United States to a low-carbon economy.\nIn the meantime, we need to be making sure that we're taking advantage in a safe way of the natural resources that we have in this country. And oil and gas production here in the United States is at an all-time high. What also is at an all-time high is our production from cleaner sources like wind energy and solar energy. And what the President envisions is a longer-term transition that will be good for the planet, but also capitalizes on the economy opportunity that exists when it comes to solar and wind energy and energy efficiency and other technologies where U.S. businesses and U.S. workers could really benefit.\nQ: All right. And then one other topic -- the World Health Organization today said that the Zika virus is exploding -- or spreading explosively, and could affect as many as 4 million people in the Americas. Has the response been too slow?\nMR. EARNEST: Jeff, I think what you have seen from this administration is a response consistent with the kind of threat that could be out there.\nI think at this point, here in the United States, the risk of disease spread by mosquitoes is quite low. The January temperatures in North America are quite inhospitable to mosquito populations. But obviously, that's going to change. Eventually, the mercury is going to start to rise, and we need to be mindful of any sort of potential risk here in the United States. What we also need to be mindful of is the risk that's facing, in particular, pregnant women or women who could become pregnant who might be considering traveling to regions of the Western Hemisphere where it's warmer and where the Zika virus has already spread.\nThe concern that we have is not with -- well, the concern that we have is most focused on pregnant women or women who could become pregnant because of a concerning correlation that scientists have between contracting the Zika virus and the manifestation of a particular birth defect. And that's I think what explains the pretty serious reaction that you've seen from the administration.\nThe President convened the leading scientists and public health officials in this administration to discuss this issue in the White House Situation Room earlier this week. You've seen the CDC issue guidance to Americans who might be considering travel throughout the Western Hemisphere in the short term. And you've seen the ramping up of a public communications effort from the CDC, from the NIH, and other public health professionals about steps that Americans can take to protect themselves. Just today, the CDC convened a tele-briefing to discuss this issue.\nAnd we are in a stage right now where we want to educate the public about what the risks actually are. For most people, the risk of the Zika virus is minimal because the Zika virus has relatively mild symptoms, and only one in five people who are infected with the Zika virus actually manifest those symptoms. So our real concern is about this correlation between the Zika virus and a particular birth defect. And that's what we're mindful of, and that's why we're mobilizing the kind of response that we believe is consistent with the threat that's out there.\nCheryl.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. So the President's going to be talking to House Democrats tonight. What is his message to them on TPP, in particular?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I would not expect that the focus of the President's remarks would be on TPP. Most Democrats don't support the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- at least not most Democrats in the House of Representatives. We believe we have a strong case to make to Democrats about why the Trans-Pacific Partnership is good for American businesses, is good for American workers, and is good for American middle-class families. It levels the playing field for American businesses and American workers, and it cuts taxes on 18,000 American products that are imposed by other countries.\nAnd so we have a strong case to make. We'll be making that case to the American public. We'll certainly be making that case to Democrats who supported giving the President Trade Promotion Authority last year. And we'll certainly be making that case to Democrats who opposed Trade Promotion Authority but did at least leave open the possibility that they might support the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\nSo we have a strong case to make and we'll make it. But for the majority of Democratic members who will be in that room today -- or tonight, they obviously do not consider passing -- or ratifying the Trans-Pacific Partnership a legislative priority. There are a lot of other legislative priorities, though, that we do share in common, and I would expect the President will talk about some of those. And you'll hear from him directly about that tonight.\nAndrew.\nQ: A question related to the President's speech yesterday. A while back, the President indicated that he would -- the U.S. would be reviewing its position with regard to Middle East peace, so I wonder if in the next 12 months or so we could expect any fresh push to try and resolve or take small steps forward on the Israel-Palestine issue.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have any progress like that to tell you about that's been made recently. So I would hesitate to predict much about that over the course of this year.\nThe focal point of our conversations with the Israelis right now -- or actually, on deepening and extending our security cooperation -- senior administration officials and their Israeli counterparts are in the midst of discussions about a memorandum of understanding that would extend the U.S. commitment to supplying the Israelis with defense equipment and technology that they need to keep their citizens safe. And those negotiations have been ongoing as recently as this month.\nBut I don't have any update for you in terms of resolving the generations of disagreement between the Israelis and Palestinians.\nRon.\nQ: Back to Flint for a moment. I think a lot of people there are concerned about the Governor's statement that he has no plans to replace any of the lead pipes in that community in the short term, or whatever his words were. And the Mayor there, who has met with the President, has said that this is an awful thing, I guess -- I don't remember the quote -- because the issue is a lack of trust. Is the President aware of that decision? Is he concerned about that decision, about something that narrow -- replacing these pipes -- and whether or not, in fact, that is going to set back any efforts to try and solve the problem there?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think in some ways you're asking a question that's directly about science -- about whether or not it is necessary to replace the pipes to ensure the safety of the water supply in Flint. And there obviously will be environmental officials in Michigan taking a look at this question, and the EPA has offered to lend their expertise in terms of testing water quality and offering advice in terms of what steps the government of Michigan and the city of Flint should take to address this crisis.\nQ: She said it was an issue of trust, not science, because people just don't believe him. And again, this is not years later where concerns were raised, they weren't addressed, and I think that's the concern. It's a matter of trust, not science. And is the President -- has he had any follow-up conversations with the Mayor or -- I'm trying to get a sense of how engaged he is. I know he's got a lot of things on his agenda, but how engaged is he in this particular issue at this time?\nMR. EARNEST: I know the President is regularly updated on the situation in Flint. I'm not aware of any additional conversations that he's had with the Mayor. I think everybody who's been involved in this situation has acknowledged that trust does need to be rebuilt between government officials and the residents of Flint. The Governor of Michigan, himself, acknowledged that there was a broader systemic failure here, and I wouldn't disagree with that notion.\nBut I think because these kinds of decisions should be driven by science, I think that's why it's particularly important that government officials and regulators take the steps that are necessary to begin to rebuild the trust with the citizens they're supposed to be looking out for.\nQ: One other issue. Are there going to be meaningful Syrian peace talks beginning tomorrow?\nMR. EARNEST: For the latest update I'd refer you to the State Department. But obviously there has been a lot of painstaking diplomacy involved, both by senior State Department officials including the Secretary of State himself; officials at the United Nations; and other members of our counter-ISIL coalition who are trying to use their diplomatic leverage to get both the relevant opposition parties and their representatives to Geneva at the same time as officials representing the Syrian government.\nWhat is planned for Geneva are not face-to-face talks between those two groups of people, but rather proximity talks where you'd have U.N. officials sort of shuttling between representatives of the government and representatives of the opposition to try to advance the diplomatic process.\nThis has been hard work that's been underway for a long time and we've made a lot of progress in terms of getting to this stage, and were hopeful that we can continue to move the ball forward. But no one underestimates how difficult that challenge is.\nQ: And just lastly, it may be a difficult thing to measure, but is there any indication that the improved relations with the Iranians as a result of the deal and so forth -- does that have any positive impact on this process in Geneva?\nMR. EARNEST: The State Department would be best positioned to offer a judgment on that. My guess is if there has been any change it's been largely at the margins. I don't think we've seen any sort of overhaul or dramatic turnabout in the context of these negotiations that has occurred since the implementation of the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon going forward.\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, on Syria -- a question on that. With the Russians bombing the U.S.-backed Syrian opposition on behalf of the Assad regime as recently as this week, doesn't that undercut the credibility of the administration's position that that same opposition should agree to sit down with the regime backed by Russia at these talks?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we have on many occasions -- and when I say we, I include myself -- expressed our significant concerns both about the tactics that are used by the regime and their supporters to wage war against Syrian citizens. And that is, after all, why we are trying to broker the kind of political transition that we're hoping to discuss in Geneva tomorrow.\nWhen you have a government entity that is using weapons of war against its own people, you need a political transition. And there's no denying the human suffering that has resulted from the failures of the Assad regime. And there's also no denying that a political transition will be required. We're not going to be able to solve this militarily. And it is our hope that through diplomacy and through talks and through a political transition, we can bring -- at least reduce the violence and chaos inside of Syria, if not eliminate it altogether.\nQ: So you still think Russia is a credible partner here in these talks even though they're bombing the opposition?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, our view of the Russians has been that there are a number of things that they have done that have not been particularly constructive. In fact, we've noted that their heavy support for the Assad regime has actually set back our diplomatic efforts to reach a political transition. We've noted that on a number of occasions. And it is primarily because of -- and again, the reason for that, it's just a practical matter. If they succeed in shoring up their support for the Assad government and help stabilize the Assad government, and weaken the political opposition that we want the Assad government to begin negotiating with, you reduce, if not eliminate, any incentive that the Assad government has to negotiate in the first place. And that's the reason that we have found Russia's military involvement in Syria to be so concerning.\nQ: Can I ask you on another front here -- foreign policy, different country -- General Dunford said that the U.S. is looking to take decisive action in Libya against ISIS. Is there anything you can tell us about the President's consultations on this or potential decisions about that action?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think in one regard, I would say that there's some evidence that the United States has already taken some decisive action inside of Libya. Back in November, because of U.S. military action, the leading ISIL figure in Libya was taken off the battlefield. So the United States has long been mindful of the risk that is posed by the kind of political chaos that we see in Libya.\nWe know that one of ISIL's strategies is to capitalize on chaos in a particular region, and using that to try to establish the foundation of their hateful ideology and to further their aspirations for a caliphate. That's what they've done in Syria, and we know that they have similar aspirations inside of Libya because they see the same thing that everybody else does, which is that there is political chaos in that country.\nThat's why the United States has long supported the U.N.-led effort to try to broker the establishment of a government in Libya that reflects the will and aspirations of the Libyan people. But it's also why we've been mindful of the broader security risk in Libya. And I referenced one particular airstrike -- that's why the United States has taken steps to counter the growth of ISIL inside of Libya.\nI don't have any decisions to preview at this point, but the President has certainly been discussing the threat posed by ISIL in Libya with his national security team, and that discussion has included steps that the United States could take -- in close consultation with some of our European allies that obviously have their own set of experiences and resources to bring to bear there. Obviously, countries like Italy have experience in that part of the world, and we would draw upon their resources, their skill and their expertise to advance our goals in that region of the world.\nQ: Just to clarify, so what you're talking about is one strike, a targeted strike to take out a leader. What General Dunford seemed to be talking about was more like a campaign and working with forces on the ground. That's different. That would be, in that sense, an escalation or new front in the fight against ISIS. Is that the way you're viewing this, as a new front, a third front against ISIS?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, at this point, it's too early to make any -- I don't have any announcements to make from here about any sort of policy decisions that have been made in this regard. I think the point that I'm trying to emphasize is that the administration and the President have been mindful of the risk that is posed by ISIL and their aspirations to operate more aggressively inside of Libya. And that's why we've been strongly supportive of the U.N.-led political process inside of Libya. It's why we've already taken some military actions inside of Libya to counter ISIL. But I don't have anything to tell you about any sort of potential actions or escalation with regard to our efforts against ISIL in Libya.\nQ: And lastly, will the President tonight ask for an AUMF\n-- authorization of force -- when he speaks to Democrats?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I know that there are some Democrats in the House who do believe that Congress should fulfill their responsibility to pass an authorization to use military force. That's something that the President has been advocating for more than a year now. I don't know if it will come up, but if it does, I think what House Democrats will hear is encouragement from the Democratic President that Congress should fulfill their responsibility.\nApril.\nQ: Josh, two questions on two different subjects. One, back on Flint. Back in the beginning of this administration, about seven years ago, this President had two cities in special categories, and those cities were Detroit and New Orleans. And both of those cities wound up coming out of those special categories and special grouping because they had started climbing out of devastation either economically -- or, really, both economically, and the other, devastation of Katrina. So now, with the situation with the water in Flint and some other areas in Michigan, is there a thought to put Flint and Detroit and that whole area maybe back in a special category again to maybe focus in on the issues that are specific and unique to that community?\nMR. EARNEST: April, I'm not aware of any sort of formal designation that's being considered for Flint at this point. We've talked about the wide variety of resources that have been provided by the federal government just in the last few weeks to try to assist state and local officials who are responding to a serious situation there.\nAnd there is no doubt that the challenges facing Flint right now are daunting. When you consider the work that may be required to overhaul and maybe even replace a significant portion of their infrastructure; when you consider, April, as you raised yesterday, sort of the longer-term public health consequences of the failures that we've already seen; the need by government officials and regulators at the state, local and federal level to repair trust with the citizens of that community -- the challenges facing that community are daunting.\nBut I think you raised an interesting point, which is they don't have to look much further than the city of Detroit to understand a few things. One is that the federal government will be committed to following through on the commitments that we make to ensure that that city gets the support that they need to come back stronger than ever.\nAnd there were significant challenges that were facing the city of New Orleans in the aftermath of Katrina. The widespread devastation of that community and the dislocation of the population had a profound impact on that city and its prospects for the future. But the President had the opportunity to visit New Orleans last November, mark the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, and they spent a little time talking about the storm, but mostly talking about the renaissance of a great American city.\nSo I think that the people of Flint, despite the daunting challenges, I think can really look to their neighbors in Detroit and they can look south to New Orleans for a lot of hope and inspiration.\nQ: So and this leads to my second question. When you talk about this renaissance in a great American city -- the President is going to Baltimore today. There were calls for him to go to the area that was affected -- Penn North -- or just some of the blighted, more impoverished communities in Baltimore. In Baltimore today, will he -- or this evening -- will there possibly be -- maybe this is a security concern, I shouldn't ask, but I'm going to ask -- could the motorcade kind of drive a little bit in a different direction than normal just to take a look at some of the areas that could be hurting -- while he's still in office? Areas that supported him as President.\nMR. EARNEST: I don't expect that today. But I just remind you, the President did have the opportunity to travel to Baltimore in 2014, I believe it was --\nQ: This happened in 2015.\nMR. EARNEST: I understand that. I guess that means the President was ahead of the curve here in trying to address some of these problems that Baltimore has been challenged with for a long time now. But I'm not aware of any changes to the motorcade route to announce here today.\nQ: Will he get any updates while he's there in the city? I understand the reason why he's there, but will he meet with the outgoing mayor or other officials -- or Congressman Elijah Cummings, who is very active in the community? Will he meet with community leaders to talk about what's happening and changes possible?\nMR. EARNEST: The President's visit today will be focused on House Democrats, so I will anticipate he'll have a chance to meet with Congressman Cummings, to visit with him in the context of the session with House Democrats. But I wouldn't anticipate a special discussion of the situation in Baltimore.\nQ: Will he get updates on Baltimore, on the situation in Baltimore and the other cities that have had the unrest last year because of the policing issues that they were dealing with?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President certainly is interested in making sure that we're following through. And I know one thing the President does regularly get updates on is the success that we're having in implementing the recommendations of the Task Force on 21st Century Policing. This is a task force that the President assembled in the aftermath of some of the unrest that we saw in cities across the country, expressing concerns about the actions of members of their law enforcement.\nAnd there are a whole set of recommendations that were produced by this task force, and ultimately it will be up to local jurisdictions to decide how and whether to implement these recommendations. But I know that the President is kept apprised of the efforts of local communities to implement those recommendations.\nJulie.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I wanted to touch a little more on the Syria talks. I didn't hear a clear answer to Margaret's question of whether the President views Russia as a really credible partner in those talks -- given all of the sort of contradictions you laid out about what they're doing and what the ultimate goal is of the peace discussions.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I mean, again, we have expressed significant concerns in a variety of settings, including from here, about Russia's military support for the regime and the negative that has on our ability to try to reach the kind of political transition that even President Putin acknowledges will be required to address the situation inside of Syria.\nWhen the President had the opportunity to sit down with President Putin at the United Nations last fall, we came out of that meeting with some disagreements with -- well, we came out not attempting to paper over the differences in our view of the situation inside of Syria. But both sides came out of that meeting acknowledging that both sides agreed that a political transition inside of Syria was necessary to ultimately address the problems that were having not just a terrible humanitarian impact on Syria, but a broader impact on the region.\nAnd the concern that we have is that Russia's military actions contradict their assessment of the political situation inside of Syria. And that's why we have long urged the Russians to reevaluate the military strategy that they're pursuing.\nSo, given that, it is hard to describe the Russians as playing an entirely positive role. But given the influence that Russia has with the Assad regime, they're going to have to be a part of this. And we're hopeful that they will use their influence with the Assad regime to encourage them to pursue the kind of political transition that even the Russians themselves acknowledge are necessary. And we're going to continue to encourage the Russians to do that.\nAnd at this point, given the influence they have with the Assad regime and given how isolated the Assad regime is, the influence that they will bear is important, and we're hopeful that they'll use it in the right way.\nQ: Given that they haven't done that yet, though, what is the point of these talks? I mean, does the President still share Secretary Kerry's view that a cease-fire is possible in the short term? Is that something that's realistic at this point?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Secretary Kerry and his team can give you the best assessment of where things stand, and so I'd mostly defer to them about the likelihood of a cease-fire going into effect. That's obviously something that Secretary Kerry has long been encouraging the parties to pursue and to agree to. But I don't have an update on those efforts for you at this point.\nQ: And the President still believes that President Assad must go ultimately as part of any political transition that they agree on?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes. And again, that view is rooted not just in our moral objections to the way that the Assad government has slaughtered innocent Syrian people, but it's also just a practical consideration. The Assad regime has lost the legitimacy to lead that country primarily because they've used their military to attack large portions of the population. So it's not surprising that that population is no longer interested in seeing Assad sitting atop their government. He's lost the legitimacy to lead.\nSo in order to have a government that actually reflects the will and ambition of the Syrian people, somebody else needs to be in charge. And that's why, as long as President Assad is there, we're still going to see instability and chaos that has consequences not just for a dire humanitarian situation inside of Syria but larger consequences for the region and potentially even the world.\nMichelle.\nQ: Speaking of Russia, this week we heard the Treasury Under Secretary tell the BBC that Putin is corrupt. Does the administration share that view?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the assessment of the Treasury Department I think is the one that is the one that best reflects the administration view. Obviously, the Treasury Department is responsible for enforcing sanctions, and obviously there are significant sanctions that are in place against Russia because of their destabilizing activities inside of Ukraine.\nQ: That's a pretty blunt public statement, though, and that's why it's being asked now because it's something we really haven't heard in so many words before. So if that is the case, a pretty black-and-white statement, why have we not yet seen sanctions against Putin?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I would encourage you to check with the Treasury Department about the sanctions that they have designed. I think there are probably a variety of reasons for that. The first is, we obviously work closely with our European partners to make sure that we're taking coordinated steps to isolate the Russians and their economy. And so that's certainly part of the equation here.\nBut the other thing that we don't do is we don't make a habit of announcing sanctions in advance, or spend a whole lot of time discussing in detail what sort of sanctions may or may not be considered by the U.S. government and our partners. To do so would only give those who could potentially be the target of these sanctions the opportunity to take actions to evade those sanctions, and we certainly don't want to give anyone the opportunity to do that.\nQ: Okay, got it. And last night, when the President was giving his speech at the Holocaust event, he again made a kind of what seemed to be another veiled reference to rhetoric that's been out there on the campaign trail, specifically coming from Trump. And it seems like virtually every time we hear the President speak now, he makes a reference like that, and everybody kind of knows -- I mean, it tends to be just particular enough that you kind of know what he's referring to. But here in the briefing room, we heard you repeatedly dismiss the level of support for Trump out there, dismiss the nature of his rhetoric. We'll say --\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know that I've done that.\nQ: I, myself, have said that this many people are supporting Trump, and you seem pretty dismissive of what it represents on the whole, as well as the value of what he's espousing. So if that is the case, why does the President feel it necessary to now constantly bring this up and to make these references?\nMR. EARNEST: I think you might -- it's not the first time this has happened -- I think you might be reading a little too much into the President's remarks. I think the President does frequently talk about his commitment to American values and talk about how those values represent the best that our country has to offer. And certainly, the kinds of values that were on display by heroic Americans who saved the lives of innocent Jews who could potentially be in harm's way because of the Holocaust does represent the best of American values. And that's something the President has said on a number of occasions, even before any of the current candidates for President on the Republican side announced their candidacy.\nWhat is also true is there's no denying that some of these values are the subject of a political debate. And the President does continue to be confident that the vast majority of Americans does subscribe to the kinds of values that this country has long stood for.\nAnd so I would interpret those kinds of comments on the part of the President not as an attempt to rebut the claims of any particularly presidential candidate, or even any particular political party -- because, after all, many of the values and controversial comments that we see from Mr. Trump are consistent with the kinds of views that are being expressed by a whole range of candidates in the Republican Party. And the fact is, as long as we're going to debate these values, the President is going to stand up and reinforce the values that this country has long stood for, and he's not going to hesitate to participate in that debate.\nBut yesterday, in the context of Holocaust Remembrance Day, I feel confident in telling you the President was not trying to secretly respond to a political candidate. He was seeking to champion the kinds of American values that led a few very brave Americans to selflessly look out for people who could otherwise be innocently victimized.\nQ: So he -- blaming a group and tribalism, you think that those statements had nothing to do with the political rhetoric that's out there now?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I don't think they're a response to the claims, outrageous as they may be, of any particular candidate. I think they are an expression, an affirmation of the kinds of American values that this President has spent his time in office championing. And these are the kinds of values that make America the greatest country in the world.\nMary.\nQ: Back to the fight against ISIS in Libya. I know you can't get into too many specifics, but can you discuss at all what kinds of steps are on the table, or the scope of options that are being considered?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't want to do that at this point. What I think I could do is to help you understand that the President has been talking with his national security team on a regular basis about confronting ISIL. And those conversations do include not just a discussion of our intense efforts in Iraq and in Syria, but also any steps that may need to be taken in other places where we see ISIL trying to establish a foothold. And that obviously includes Libya.\nBut at this point, I'd hesitate to get into the options that the President is weighing at this point. The President will certainly consult with his national security team, consider the situation on the ground in Libya, and once he's made a decision, or if a decision is necessary, that's something that we'll be able to discuss.\nQ: Any timeline on that at all?\nMR. EARNEST: Not a timeline I have to share with you.\nQ: And on a totally separate topic, Hillary Clinton earlier in the week said that she loves the idea of appointing the President to the Supreme Court. I know in the past he said that the Court is too monastic for him, but he hasn't ruled it out. Is it something that he might be open to?\nMR. EARNEST: My guess is it is -- that his aspirations for his post-presidency extend beyond a Supreme Court appointment. I think the constitutional lawyer that the President is I'm sure would have plenty of things and plenty of ideas for how he would do a job like that. But I think his preference for how he wants to spend his time after he leaves the White House would lie in areas that would give him the opportunity to handle a wider range of issues than just those issues that come before the Court.\nPam.\nQ: Speaking of a presidential candidate, Bernie Sanders is going to co-sponsor a bill that would get rid of the immunity that gun manufacturers now enjoy, and it was something that he originally helped pass. Is that something the President might take credit for, seeing as he said he wouldn't campaign or support any candidates who didn't support common-sense gun measures? And did they talk about that issue during their meeting yesterday?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any more details to share with you about their private conversation. As it relates to the legislation that Senator Sanders was discussing, I think you'd have to talk to him about what was motivating the change in his position on this issue. The President certainly has made a concerted effort to raise the profile of the kinds of common-sense steps that Congress could take to make our community safer, while at the same time protecting the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans.\nSo the President certainly would encourage other members of Congress to consider supporting that legislation. But for Senator Sanders's position and his change in position, you'd have to ask him when that occurred and what prompted the change.\nQ: I don't know if you saw it or not, but I was wondering if the White House might have any response to my colleague Chip Reid's report on the Wounded Warrior Project and how that charity spends as little as 54 percent of the money that it raises actually helping injured servicemembers, and has some other sort of frivolous expenses that they spend their money on.\nMR. EARNEST: Pam, I actually didn't see Chip's report, but why don't we take a look at it, and if we can get you a response we'll try to do that.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I just want to get your memories jogged. Where were you during the Challenger event? What do you recall about that day? And as Americans recall what for many was a similar moment, what does the President have to say about that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, we did issue a statement from the President shortly before I walked out here through NASA, which is what we've done in years past. And the President himself has talked about how space exploration has long served as a source of inspiration to American students since even the President himself was a child.\nMy own memories -- actually, I was in the fifth grade when the Challenger disaster occurred. And I do remember vividly the lead-up to the launch of the space shuttle because there was an elementary school teacher that was on board, and there was a concerted effort that was made by NASA to discuss that mission in elementary schools and to hold Christa McAuliffe up as an example as an educator who was committed to science and the kind of exploration that was part of any sort of scientific endeavor. So I do have memories of that as an elementary school student.\nLook, I think there are a lot of people who are involved in the space program today who say that they were inspired by those astronauts who gave their lives in pursuit of that cause. And the fact that even 30 years later they serve as an inspiration to a whole generation of American scientists and innovators I think is a pretty good indication that while their loss was a tragedy, it certainly was not -- their lives were not given in vain.\nQ: Let me get you to circle back for just a second on Flint. You mentioned that you said \"some of the failures we've already seen, and I think there's been plenty of blame to go around.\" I just want to sort of drill down on the resignation of the Region IV administrator. Is that a tacit acknowledgement that the administration made mistakes in this circumstance, as well?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, I'm limited in what I can say about this because there's an ongoing Department of Justice investigation. They will be responsible for taking a look at exactly who did what and when, and who bears some responsibility here. So there's not a whole lot I have to say about that resignation beyond what that individual had to say about why they were leaving their post.\nQ: Any reason that we haven't heard more from Administrator McCarthy on the topic, certainly given that this story continues to sort of unfold?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I know that last week she announced a number of steps that was responsive to the conversation that she had with the President of the United States last week. This includes overhauling the rules and regulations that govern the relationship between the EPA and state-level regulators in states across the country. Obviously, there are significant EPA resources that have been offered to Flint to conduct some additional testing and to offer other scientific advice that could help them address the problem that they're dealing with right now.\nAnd I think the other concern that the President has -- and this is one that I know that Administrator McCarthy shares -- is making sure that there is not some other community that is experiencing something like what Flint is going through. And ultimately the EPA does have an important responsibility to protect the safety and public health of the American people. Their responsibilities are significant, and I know that they take those responsibilities seriously.\nQ: But we haven't heard from her since last week, and I'm just curious, is she in Flint? Is she going? I just would expect, especially given the magnitude of the story, that she'd want to be out in front on this, and it doesn't look that way, at least from the outside.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think she's taken some important steps here. Again, responsive to a conversation she had with the President and based on her own expertise about the way the EPA operates, she's taken the steps I think that people would expect that she would take. And I'm confident that she is closely monitoring the situation moving forward.\nQ: Okay. Last, on Zika. Given the weather here at this time of year, it may not be something that's rushing our way, but it does a great many of our neighboring countries in the region. Is the President getting a daily update on this circumstance? I know that WHO is making this sound fairly alarming, to be honest with you, and not just for pregnant women.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think their concern is much like ours. Our concern does focus on pregnant women. The symptoms from the virus are relatively mild. I don't think anybody wants to get them, but the kind of symptoms that we're talking about are not life-threatening. These are symptoms that relate to a mild fever and joint pain, and even conjunctivitis. But those symptoms are only seen in about 20 percent of those who contract the virus. And those symptoms go away after about a week.\nThe concern that we have is that there is a correlation between those who contract -- pregnant women who contract the virus and a particular birth defect. And that is what we're primarily concerned about. So the travel guidance that we have -- that the CDC has issued relates to advice that is given to pregnant women or women who are thinking of becoming pregnant about traveling to some of these countries, and steps they can take to mitigate the risk that they face.\nWe've shared this guidance for informational purposes for other people who may be traveling to these regions of the world. But the kind of risk that men, for example, face from the Zika virus is, at this point, based on what we know now, is relatively mild.\nQ: Any comparisons to Ebola really don't fly -- is that kind of what you're saying?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think some of the most prominent differences are the Zika virus is obviously not fatal in the same way that the Ebola virus was fatal. The transmission of the disease is quite different. The Zika virus is transmitted through mosquitoes, again, based on what we know now. The way that Ebola was transmitted -- that there are a variety of ways that Ebola could be transmitted through intimate -- by person-to-person contact. So I think those are sort of the two most prominent differences.\nBut the other thing that's true is that there's more that we need to learn about the Zika virus. Our health care professionals have told us that there's no vaccine that prevents the disease, and the kind of treatment options that are currently available are quite limited. And there is this significant concern about the correlation between the pregnant women who contract the Zika virus and a specific birth defect.\nSo there are certainly reasons to be concerned about this disease. And I think that explains the federal response that's been mobilized here by the United States. It certainly explains the kind of response that we've seen in other countries. I know that there are thousands of members of the Brazilian military that have been mobilized to try to counter this disease. One of the most effective ways to actually deal with this disease is to limit the population of mosquitos that are known to carry the virus. And that certainly -- mosquito control will certainly play into some of the steps that we will take here in the United States once the weather warms up to further protect the American people.\nRight now, our focus is on making sure that people have the facts about the risks that are posed by the Zika virus, and steps they can take to try to minimize that risk.\nQ: So not at a point where if you're going for spring break, for example, you need to not go south of the border -- that kind of thing?\nMR. EARNEST: What we're offering right now is just advice to people. And our concern primarily is focused on pregnant women or women who are planning to become pregnant.\nAngela.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I'm looking for you to unpack something that the Vice President said while he was speaking at the Democratic retreat this afternoon. Just to quote him, he said, \"After Ramadi, watch what happens in Raqqa and in Mosul by the end of the year.\" He didn't elaborate, but he implied that those cities could be taken out of ISIL's control in the near future. Is that something that the White House is hoping that they can accomplish and that you see as a real possibility?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, this is the first time I'm hearing of the Vice President's remarks, so --\nQ: This was after you started the briefing.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay. So why don't I just say in general what we have said about ISIL's control of Mosul and Raqqa. What the Department of Defense has indicated is that these are obviously strategically important areas to ISIL. And there are -- particularly in Raqqa, there are already steps that are being taken by the United States and our coalition partners to apply pressure to ISIL in those areas. There are already airstrikes that have been taken by the United States and our coalition partners in Raqqa against ISIL targets. Those strikes have also taken place in the vicinity of Mosul, as well. And we're going to continue to keep up that pressure against them.\nUltimately, the decision to have Iraqi forces move against ISIL in Mosul -- that will be a decision that's made by the Iraqis. They'll do so in close coordination with the United States and our coalition partners. Obviously they'll also be relying on training that they've received from the United States and our coalition partners, and military airpower that can be leveraged by the United States and our coalition partners.\nThe situation in Raqqa is a little bit different. We know that there are opposition fighters that have made a lot of progress in northern and northeastern Syria, and they have advanced toward Raqqa. But obviously in order to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL and accomplish that goal, we're going to need to get -- root ISIL leaders out of Mosul and out of Raqqa. And that's a significant task.\nWe know that they've been dug into those cities for a while now. And it means it's going to be hard to dig them out. But we certainly are mindful of the fact that this will be necessary in order to achieve our eventual goal.\nQ: Was the Vice President being too optimistic, perhaps?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I didn't see the entirety of his remarks, so I'd be reluctant to comment directly on them.\nQ: On one other matter. The President announced his cancer task force this morning, starting with a meeting next week. Of course, his budget comes out the following week. Can we assume that there will be a request for more funding for the National Cancer Institute in this year's request?\nMR. EARNEST: Stay tuned, and we'll keep you posted.\nYes, ma'am.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. On North Korea issues -- on North Korean nuclear issues. It seems like that President Obama is not interested in the North Korean issues or he ignored North Korean issues. What is the U.S. final destination of North Korean nuclear issues?\nMR. EARNEST: We continue to believe that North Korea should come into compliance with their international obligations, both as it relates to their nuclear program and as it relates to their missile program as well. We know that the North Koreans conducted a nuclear test earlier this month, and since then, the United States, including President Obama, has been in close consultation with our allies and partners in the region to design an appropriate and effective response.\nThere have been discussions that have been held at the United Nations. Within 24 hours of the tests being conducted, the President was on the phone with his counterpart, both Prime Minister Abe in Japan and President Park of South Korea. And you saw both the Deputy Secretary of State, Tony Blinken, and the Secretary of State, John Kerry, traveling in the region just in the last couple of weeks, discussing this very issue -- not just with Chinese leaders but with other leaders in the region.\nAnd what is notable about this situation is that it's not just the United States and South Korea and Japan -- three important allies who agree that North Korea needs to give up their nuclear program and commit to actions that will make the Korean Peninsula stable and more secure -- we know that the Russians and the Chinese agree with that proposition as well. And during Secretary Kerry's visit, I know that President Xi reiterated his commitment to a de-nuclearized Korean Peninsula. And our agreement on that principle will be critical to our ability to achieving that goal. Obviously, China has a closer relationship with North Korea than just about anybody else, and we're hopeful that they will continue to work closely with us to use their influence to advance safety and security on the Korean Peninsula.\nQ: Recently, South Korean President, Park Geun-Hye recommended Five-Party talks instead of Six-Party talks for denuclearization in the Korean Peninsula. Will the United States support this Five-Party talks?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what we have said before [is] that the North Koreans would need to demonstrate a commitment to stability and security on the Korean Peninsula and giving up their nuclear program. That is essentially -- that would be the essence of the conversation, and so we'd have to see a commitment on the part of the North Koreans to actually wanting to have that conversation before we would sit down at the table with them. And that's ultimately where things stand right now.\nJohn, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: I just want to bring it back to that conversation that you were talking about at the top about bipartisan efforts in terms of eradicating cancer. I know you put something out on this, this morning. What are the administration's latest efforts on this effort?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we do have the -- you saw that the Vice President had a post on Medium today where he talked about some of the preliminary efforts that have just gotten underway in the last couple of weeks since the President announced this initiative. There will be a meeting that's scheduled for next week where I would anticipate we'll have some more information on this. So stay tuned.\nQ: And you anticipate and you're open to the idea of some sort of bipartisan legislation moving this effort forward?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what we have seen -- and, again, there are some Republicans who are pretty aggressive advocates for investing in research and development that could lead to medical breakthroughs. This is one of the things -- one of the areas where Republicans have been relatively enthusiastic about increasing funding, and the budget is behind those efforts that could advance our understanding of particular medical phenomenons and scientific breakthroughs. And so there should be an opportunity for us to work together to make sure that that funding is at appropriate levels and is focused on the right things, and we certainly are interested in having that kind of conversation with Republicans who are actually interested in working in a bipartisan way on this. Again, there's no reason this should be ideological or should breakdown along party lines -- it just needs -- what we're looking for is a partner with a seriousness of purpose when it comes to fighting cancer.\nThanks, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 1:57 P.M. EST", "timestamp": "2016-01-28", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}

Together we can fulfill its promise.\nWhen I became an overnight shift manager at the Goodyear plant in 1979, there weren't many women on the job (and the few there were didn't stay long). But I worked my way up, and in 1996, I even received the plant's \"top performance award.\"\nIt wasn't until 19 years after I'd started that I learned I was being paid less than my male colleagues.\nOne evening, I came into work early, checked my mail, and there it was: an anonymous note that listed my salary and the salaries of three men with the same title. I was being paid significantly less for the same job—less than I deserved and less than my family needed.\nThe easiest thing to do would have been to let it go. But that's not who I am.\nI took my case all the way to the Supreme Court. But they ruled that, though I had clearly been discriminated against, I had filed my case too late to be compensated.\nLuckily, we live in a country where, when the laws are wrong, we can do something about it.\nSeven years ago today, President Obama signed his first bill into law: the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which makes it easier to challenge wage discrimination in court. It was an important step toward equal pay for women, and an important victory for the increasing number of American households where women are the primary breadwinner. Under this law, no one else will ever have to accept the gender discrimination I faced without the chance to challenge it in court.\nBut this isn't just my story. It's the story of women working full time across this country who, despite new protections, are on average still earning just 78 cents for every dollar a man earns—with women of color often being shortchanged even more. That's money their families are losing out on.\nOur next president can either build on the progress we've made and go even further—or dismiss this important issue. Women across this country need more than rhetoric; they need action—they need a fighter in the White House.\nI firmly believe Hillary Clinton will be that fighter.\nHillary has spent decades fighting to advance women's rights and economic opportunities. We fought side by side to pass the Lilly Ledbetter Act, which she co-sponsored in the United States Senate, and she has been a tireless champion for the Paycheck Fairness Act—legislation that would go even further to address the pay gap. And she's put issues like equal pay, affordable child care, paid leave, and reproductive rights front and center in her campaign.\nHillary understands that these issues can't be dismissed or pushed to the sidelines. They're not just \"social issues\"—they're fundamental to our country's economic future, and they are at the heart of everything she's fighting for on this campaign. For Hillary, this is about more than politics—it's personal. She just gets it, plain and simple.\nOf all the candidates in this race, she is the one we can count on to be a fierce and uncompromising champion for women, for basic fairness, and for opportunity for everyone. She's not just a steadfast supporter of issues that affect women's lives; she's someone who has been there. She doesn't just say the right things; she does the right things. And when it comes to finally closing the gender pay gap once and for all, that will make a world of difference.", "timestamp": "2016-01-28", "title": "Press Release - Why I'm Supporting Hillary Clinton For President"}

After denying a story claiming they were debating attack ads, they acknowledged later in the day they were still openly considering running ads based on personal attacks on Hillary Clinton.\n\"This last-minute sneak attack from the Sanders campaign is clearly meant to plaster the Iowa airwaves in the days before the caucus with negative ads slamming Hillary Clinton, without giving our campaign time to respond. It's a cynical political ploy in a primary that had until recently been characterized by a respectful back-and-forth about the issues, and it's not one that's going to go over well with Iowans. Since the very beginning of this campaign, Hillary Clinton has been listening to Iowans about the issues they care the most about, and proving that she's the fighter that will stand up for them and bring real change to people's lives. That's what motivates Iowa voters – not cheap political attacks,\" said Hillary for America Iowa State Director Matt Paul.\nYesterday morning, the Sanders campaign confirmed to the New York Times that they were considering running negative attack ads against Hillary Clinton, despite months of promising they wouldn't:\n* New York Times, 1/27/16: \"Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and his top advisers returned to Iowa on Wednesday evening having confronted a decision that will have lasting consequences for his presidential campaign and his political image: whether to open a new, tougher line of advertising against his rival Hillary Clinton in the closing days of the race for Iowa.\"\nThen, Sanders' campaign manager denied that there was a meeting about airing a negative ad, saying they would not change the tone of their campaign:\n* CNN's Dan Merica: \"Sanders campaign manager says their campaign is not meeting tdy re: airing a negative ad: 'Our tone is right on & doesn't need adjusting.'\"\n* CNN: \"Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager, refutes the Times report, saying that their campaign is happy with the tone of their campaign and have no plans to air a negative ad.\"\nBut later in the same day, the New York Times story was updated with further information about their deliberations on running a negative ad:\n* New York Times, 1/27/16: \"That night, at the end of a rally here, the campaign's spokesman, Michael Briggs, said the advisers had not made a decision.

Though Mr. Sanders hasn't insulted Mrs. Clinton, he has compared her to a reviled figure in Democratic circles: former Republican Vice President Dick Cheney. He has also suggested Mrs. Clinton is in Wall Street's pocket because of six-figure speaking fees she has gotten from large banks.\"\nThis is all part of Sanders' increasingly negative campaign, which has devolved from the positive, policy-based campaign he promised into one marked by personal attacks against Hillary Clinton.\n* Des Moines Register, 1/27/16: Bernie Sanders fires against Clinton\n* Much, much more on that here", "timestamp": "2016-01-28", "title": "Sanders Campaign Doubles Down On Last-Minute Barrage Of Negative Attacks"}

Having fun? (Laughter.) We're at the White House! (Applause.) Okay. It's okay, we can say it. We're here, it's exciting. Welcome to our second annual School Counselor of the Year White House award ceremony. We are just thrilled to have you here.\nI want to start by thanking Wyatt for that very heartfelt introduction. We are so proud of him and students like him, and I can't wait to see everything that you're going to achieve in the years ahead. We're so proud of you. And I know there are many students out here who are here supporting the men and women on this stage, and we're proud of you all. Just keep working hard.\nI also want to thank acting Secretary King, who is here today. Thank you so much for being here, for all your work. I want to recognize Richard Wong, the Executive Director of the American School Counselor's Association -- there you go, Richard. How are you? It's good to see you -- saw me looking for you -- (laughter) -- as well as Jill Cook and the entire team at ASCA. Thank you all. (Applause.)\nAnd of course, most of all, I want to thank all these guys up on this stage. I want to thank school counselors across this country for everything you all do for our young people. I know firsthand the kind of impact that you all have on a child's life. Growing up, so many of us, including me, were fortunate enough to have someone in our lives -– some caring adult who decided that they were going to be on our team; someone who pushed us when we wouldn't push ourselves, who supported us maybe when we didn't have the support that we needed; someone who refused to give up on us no matter how badly we screwed up. And so many of us have gotten to where we are today because of that person, because of their unyielding love and their unwavering belief in our potential.\nAnd for so many young people in this country, that person is you –- our school counselors. That's the kind of impact you all have every single day, with every recommendation letter you write, with every college visit you organize, with every hour you spend taking students through their struggles and walking them through their applications, and the FAFSA forms, and helping them make good choices for their future. And I know you don't always get the recognition you deserve for what you do, but if anyone in this country has any doubt about the impact you all are having, today, I just want to share just a few testimonials from students about these amazing men and women, this year's finalists.\nAnd I want to start with Kris Owen from Pickerington, Ohio. One of her students wrote -- and this is a quote -- she said, \"She loves what she does.\" She says, \"It's not an obligation, it's an opportunity for her to impact the lives of students. She has changed my life and she has changed so many other lives because she believes in students.\"\nAnd then there's Rob Lundien from Kansas City, Missouri. One of his students said, \"I am the first in my family to go to college and it is because of him that I am going,\" and \"I don't know what I would do without Mr. Lundien.\"\nOne of Kim Reykdal's students at Olympia High School in Olympia, Washington, wrote -- she said, \"One day, Ms. Reykdal approached me during lunch to give me a scholarship application highlighted and annotated just for me.\" (Laughter.) She says, \"I sometimes think she cares too much.\" (Laughter.) She says, \"If she has information for a student, she will hunt them down\" just to give it to them. Way to go.\nAnd then there's Samantha Vidal from Franklin, Indiana. And one of her students wrote, during my lifetime with Ms. Vidal, I found that if I didn't know the answer, it was okay to get things wrong sometimes. \"She also let me know that as long as I do my best\" it's okay.\nAnd when asked about Durenda Johnson Ward from Raleigh, North Carolina, one of her students simply said, \"She helps me see myself as a beautiful young woman\" even though it might be hard to do that myself at times. \"She has truly helped me see who I am and what I am capable of.\"\nAnd finally, there's our 2016 School Counselor of the Year winner, Katherine Pastor from Flagstaff, Arizona. Yay! (Applause.) But I want to say a little bit more about Katherine. I want to tell you about the impact she's had not just on her students, but on the entire school district and on the counseling profession as a whole.\nDuring her tenure as a school counselor, Katherine created a FAFSA Completion Day and a College Application Completion Day at Flagstaff High School. She helped build a new Career and Counseling Center. She coordinated school counselors statewide to consolidate all the -- Arizona's college fairs into one single week so that they could reach more students in remote areas. She lobbied her school district to pay for counselors to attend the comprehensive college assessment training. And today, half the counselors in Arizona who've completed this training are from her district alone.\nAnd I could probably go on. I was telling Katherine I know more about her and just met her a few minutes ago. (Laughter.) I felt so embarrassed. I know this woman. (Laughter.) But I think all the results speak for themselves.\nIn just seven short years, Flagstaff High School has been -- they've seen a 13-percent increase in college acceptance rates, and a 50-percent increase in the number of colleges that visit their campus. By the way, in her spare time, Katherine is an adjunct professor at Northern Arizona University. She's training the next generation of school counselors.\nBut perhaps most breathtaking of all is that in 2013, Katherine was diagnosed with a brain tumor and she had to undergo surgery, and then endure extensive rehab to learn to walk and talk again. But she refused to let any of those challenges stop her from serving her students. And I could read dozens of testimonials from young people like Wyatt whose lives have been transformed, but there is one in particular that I think perfectly describes the impact Katherine is having.\nThis young woman wrote -- she said, Ms. Pastor, is -- she epitomizes genuine advocacy for students' success and often believes in them more than they believe in themselves. Students see this, and they're inspired to reach higher, both in school and in their personal life. Ms. Pastor wants nothing more than to see students succeed and become the best versions of themselves. The student said, \"That is school counseling.\" Yes. (Applause.)\nI couldn't have said it better myself. That's why I stole her quote. (Laughter.) And I'm standing here today because I believe that every child in this country deserves that kind of support and attention, and every child deserves the resources they need to succeed in school and then complete higher education.\nBut when the average student-to-counselor ratio in this country is 471 to 1 –- and in some places, there's only 1 counselor for every 1,000 students -- let's just stop there for a moment as we think about the goals we want our kids to achieve and just think about what we're asking these men and women to do -- when too many counselors just don't have what they need to do their jobs. When we look at all of that, what we know is that we still have a lot of work to do. And that's why we've reached out to companies and organizations across the country and asked them to step up on behalf of our school counselors.\nAnd today, I am thrilled to announce a few of these commitments. Merck has agreed to invest $1 million to expand the Counselors for Computing initiative run by the National Council of Women in Information Technology. They're going to help 1,400 school counselors advise up to a [half a million students] on pursuing careers in computer science. Good stuff. (Applause.)\nGoogle has stepped up as well with their new virtual reality technology, those Google Cardboards. You've seen those. If you haven't they're really cool. (Laughter.) Any student with access to the Internet will soon be able to take an exciting 3D tour of colleges across the country. So young people who can't afford to visit a school -- and we know how important it is for kids to be able to get onto campuses and just see what college life feels like -- that's a big part of getting kids excited -- well, now kids can do the next best thing and get a 3D tour from their own homes or their classrooms. I actually taped one of these virtual tours, it's really, really cool.\nAnd finally, I'm proud to announce that in this year's federal budget, there is an additional $15 million for our Talent Search program that helps disadvantaged young people fill out their FAFSA and college applications and pursue higher education. And we can thank our Secretary and his team for that hard work. (Applause.)\nSo we're making progress. But I want to be very clear: As far as I'm concerned, we're just getting started. I mean, there is so much more that has to be done, and no people understand that better than all of you -- what you're facing, what you're being asked to do with so little. But for me, this isn't just about getting more programs and resources for our school counselors today. All of this is really about creating a movement to support our school counselors for years, even generations to come. It's so true. (Applause.)\nAnd that starts with simple awareness by making sure that people across this country truly understand the critical role that you play in educating our kids and preparing them for good jobs and successful lives. I mean, we know our teachers are great. We reward them, we celebrate them. But sometimes we miss those other players in the background who have so much to do and so much control over the success of a student's life going forward.\nAnd that's why we started hosting the School Counselor of the Year ceremony here at the White House. We did this because we wanted to plant a flag and send a clear message that what you all do isn't a luxury. It's not an \"extra\" -- just the opposite. The work that you do is absolutely essential for the future of our kids, the future that we say we want our kids to have. Reaching those goals, getting more kids into college, getting them better educated and better prepared for the jobs of the future -- we've got to support you if we want them to do that.\nSo I am going to commit right now, today, to hosting the third annual Counselor of the Year awards ceremony here at the White House next year. (Applause.) Now, this might be one of the last events we host -- (laughter) -- before they kick us out in January of 2017, but we're going to do it. We're going to get you back in here. And we're going to keep shining that light on the work that you do, and ensure that whatever -- whoever lives here next will continue this tradition and this work. You all truly deserve nothing less. You all are heroes.\nAnd I want to end today as I started –- by once again thanking you. Thank you so much for your commitment to our kids' potential. Thank you for the love and encouragement you give them every single day. You look at young people like Wyatt -- there's nothing more fulfilling than knowing that you did something to create a young man like this. You all are amazing, and I look forward to continuing our work together, and to honor and support you in the months and years ahead. Because no matter where I am, we're a team now. (Applause.) So as we said, we're stuck with each other, right? (Laughter and applause.)\nAnd now, it is my pleasure to introduce our 2016 Counselor of the Year, a woman who inspires us all –- from young people in her community to aspiring counselors across the country -- Katherine Pastor.

But today, cancer research is on the cusp of major breakthroughs. It is of critical national importance that we accelerate progress towards prevention, treatment, and a cure—to double the rate of progress in the fight against cancer—and put ourselves on a path to achieve in just 5 years research and treatment gains that otherwise might take a decade or more. To that end, I hereby direct the following:\nSection 1. White House Cancer Moonshot Task Force. There is established, within the Office of the Vice President, a White House Cancer Moonshot Task Force (Task Force), which will focus on making the most of Federal investments, targeted incentives, private sector efforts from industry and philanthropy, patient engagement initiatives, and other mechanisms to support cancer research and enable progress in treatment and care. The Vice President shall serve as Chair of the Task Force.\n(a) Membership of the Task Force. In addition to the Vice President, the Task Force shall consist of the heads of the executive branch departments, agencies, and offices listed below:\n(i) the Department of Defense;\n(ii) the Department of Commerce;\n(iii) the Department of Health and Human Services;\n(iv) the Department of Energy;\n(v) the Department of Veterans Affairs;\n(vi) the Office of Management and Budget;\n(vii) the National Economic Council;\n(viii) the Domestic Policy Council;\n(ix) the Office of Science and Technology Policy;\n(x) the Food and Drug Administration;\n(xi) the National Cancer Institute (NCI);\n(xii) the National Institutes of Health (NIH);\n(xiii) the National Science Foundation; and\n(xiv) such other executive branch departments, agencies, or offices as the President may designate.\nA member of the Task Force may designate, to perform the Task Force functions of the member, any person who is a part of the member's department, agency, or office, and who is a full time officer or employee of the Federal Government. At the direction of the Chair, the Task Force may establish subgroups consisting exclusively of Task Force members or their designees under this section, as appropriate.\n(b) Administration of the Task Force. The NIH shall provide funding and administrative support for the Task Force to the extent permitted by law and within existing appropriations. The Vice President shall designate an officer or employee of the executive branch as the Executive Director of the Task Force, who shall coordinate the work of the Task Force.\nSec. 2. Mission and Functions of the Task Force. The Task Force shall work with a wide array of executive departments and agencies that have responsibility for key issues related to basic, translational, and clinical research, therapy development, regulation of medical products, and medical care related to cancer. Consistent with applicable law, the Task Force also will consult with external experts from relevant scientific sectors, including the Presidentially appointed National Cancer Advisory Board (NCAB). The NCAB shall advise the Director of NCI on its recommendations respecting the future direction and program and policy emphasis of NCI as it relates to the work of the Task Force.

Thank you so much! Thank you! All right, everybody, sit down. Sit down. You're going to make me choke up. [Laughter]\nWell, it's good to see you, Democrats. Everybody is looking good. To not only the Members, but the families and folks who are here, staff, everybody who does such hard work, it is wonderful to be with you again.\nAnd I want to obviously start off by just thanking somebody who I believe will go down as one of the finest Democratic leaders and Speakers we've ever had, my dear friend, Nancy Pelosi—[applause]—who also has adorable grandchildren. I mean, it's hard to find more photogenic grandkids. [Laughter] I'm telling you, they look like they just jumped out of a magazine.\nTo the rest of the leadership—Steny, Jim, Xavier, so many others who have worked with the White House to make a profound difference in the lives of the American people—I am looking forward to one more year of hard work and fulfilling work. And I know that the Carolina and Colorado delegations may be a little distracted right now—[laughter]—by the Super Bowl and the bets that they are laying. If it's buffalo versus barbecue, I'm in. [Laughter] But I wish you guys all the luck, and I congratulate you on unbelievable championship games.\nAudience member. Go Broncos!\nThe President. There you go.\nAudience member. Roll Tide!\nThe President. She's still talking about Alabama. That was a couple weeks ago. [Laughter]\nSo I'm not going to speak long because I want to make sure that we have a chance for Q&A, and I just had a long discussion with a lot of you and the American people in the State of the Union. Obviously, it is election season. The press has been focused on debates and divisions that they can drum up within the primary and within our party. I'm not worried, though, about this party staying united. The other side may have some stuff to work out,—[laughter]—but our trajectory is clear. And everyone's scouring my every word to find some deeper meaning, see if I'm trying to put my finger on the scales, so let me simplify things. Tonight I have an announcement to make about the Presidential race: Democrats will win in November, and we will have a Democratic President succeeding me. Just in case there's any confusion about that.\nAnd the reason I can say that with confidence is because we focus on the things that matter in the lives of the American people. Think about the four questions that I posed during the State of the Union. How do we give everybody a fair shot at opportunity and security in this new economy? How do we harness the American spirit of innovation to solve some of our biggest challenges? How do we keep America safe and lead the world without becoming the world's policeman? And how do we make sure that our politics reflect what's best in us, not what's worst? Our party has the right answers to each of these questions. We've shown that during these past 7 years. As Democrats, we believe everybody who works hard should have a fair shot. Our policies rescued the economy from the worst crisis in generations. We have now seen the longest streak of private sector job creation in our history, more than 14 million new jobs. The best 2 years of job growth since the last time a Democrat was in the White House. Nearly 18 million Americans newly covered by health insurance.\nSometimes, I get a little frustrated that we don't run back the tape to what the Republicans said back then. Because at each juncture, every single one of the steps we took, they said the opposite, wanted to go in a different direction, claimed that our policies would crush jobs and destroy the economy. Do people remember that?\nAudience members. Yes.\nThe President. They said gas would be at $6.50 a gallon—pull up the quotes. Right now it's around a buck-eighty. They said deficits would explode. We cut them by almost three-quarters. My opponent in the last election promised 6 percent unemployment by the end of 2016. We got it to 5 percent by the end of 2015. Our policies are the ones that worked.\nSo we can't let Republicans roll back this progress by letting big banks or Big Oil or hedge funds make their own rules at the expense of everybody else. We can't let attacks on collective bargaining go unanswered. We have to build on the progress we've made with education and training for jobs that pay a good wage, with benefits and protections, that make sure these jobs provide a basic measure of security.\nAnd by the way, one of the things that I've talked about many of you—with many of you is the deepening problem in Puerto Rico that threatens the well-being of 3.5 million Americans. My administration has put forward a comprehensive proposal to give Puerto Rico the necessary tools to address its crisis, create a path to recovery. And the most urgent tool that we need right now, a comprehensive restructuring authority, costs taxpayers nothing and will help more Americans regain control of their own economic security. That's the kind of thing that Democrats believe in.\nIt's why we support a minimum wage. That's why we support paid leave. That's why we support making sure that working families, not folks who are doing just fine, have access to the opportunities that the economy—this new economy is generating. And on the other side, other than some slogans, you do not hear a single policy that they're putting forward that you can say would help middle class families or help working class families. That's what this election is about.\nAs Democrats, we believe in science. I know it's a radical proposition. [Laughter] We believe in the power of American ingenuity and innovation. And over the past 7 years, our policies have helped put tens of thousands of Americans to work in clean energy jobs that pay better than average. We've been able to double the amount of clean energy that we generate. In some parts of the country, wind power, solar power are now cheaper than dirty fossil fuels. We've cut our oil imports by nearly 60 percent, and we've cut our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on Earth. That's what we've done.\nSo we can't let Republicans roll this progress back by giving fossil fuel companies the ability to run roughshod and destroy our environment for future generations. And rather than subsidize the past, we should be investing in the future and the incredible opportunities that come with it. That's what we're focused on, that's what all Democrats believe in. As Democrats, our top national security priority and the thing that I think about every single day when I wake up is how do we protect the American people and keep them safe from terrorist attacks. And for more than a year, America has led a coalition of more than 60 countries to hunt down and destroy ISIL, including with nearly 10,000 airstrikes.\nWe're not going to build progress with a bunch of phony tough talk and bluster and over the top claims that just play into ISIL's hands. We're not going to strengthen our leadership around the world by allowing politicians to insult Muslims or pit groups of Americans against each other. That's not who we are. That's not keeping America safe.\nKeeping America safe and strong and respected requires us using every element of our power. That's how we worked to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. And again, you will recall that the other side was claiming this would never work, they were going to cheat. And yet, a few months later, we now know—have certified—that massive amounts of existing nuclear stockpiles and their infrastructure has been dismantled or shipped out.\nAnd even those who were skeptical are now having to admit that, without firing a shot, we achieved something that all of us had an interest in and had been working on for years. That's how we stopped the spread of Ebola in West Africa: our leadership, our military, our public health workers, our scientists. That's why we're ending 50 years of failed policy by restoring diplomatic relations to Cuba. That is true strength and true leadership, and that's what we believe in.\nAnd we believe that our politics should reflect what's best in us. You know, I'm not going to claim Democrats are perfect. I'm not going to claim that we're right on every single issue or we have a monopoly on wisdom. But I do know that we hold ourselves to a higher standard. We know that we've got to do better. But we believe that there are structural problems in our democracy that we can fix, that there's too much money in our politics, that a true democracy doesn't try to discourage people from voting, but in fact, tries to encourage people from voting and participating and making sure their voice is heard.\nBecause we believe that every vote and every voice matters—whether it's Black or White or Hispanic or Asian or Native American, gay, straight, people with disabilities—that everybody's voice matters, everybody's voice counts. That's what we fought for. That's why John Lewis is sitting here today.\nWe believe that no matter who you are, where you got your start, what your first name—what your last name is, what ZIP Code you were born in, that you deserve a shot at opportunity and success. That's what we believe. And we believe, yes, that government has a role to play in making that happen, to giving a hand up to people. If we stay true to those principles, our party is not just going to have a good year, America will have a good year. And we'll have more good years after that, and we'll build for future generations to come.\nDuring this election season, there is a lot of noise and a lot of talk about America in decline, and as I said at the State of the Union, I don't believe it, and the facts don't show it.\nAudience member. That's right.\nThe President. We're doing a lot better than we were 7, 8 years ago, and we've got a long way to go, but the same approach that we've taken of listening to the daily struggles and hopes and aspirations of people and making sure those voices are represented in the corridors of power and making sure that the laws that we seek to pass are ones that are going to help them and not a bunch of special interests who are trying to either hang onto what they already got or get more that they don't need—that's what the Democratic Party stands for.\nThat's why I'm so proud to have worked with all of you. I've said this in interviews. Yes, Democrats aren't perfect, but you know, we are on the right side of this debate. And we're not cynical. We genuinely believe that everybody should get a shot because most of us had to struggle and work hard, and we watched our parents and our grandparents and others work hard. We believe in immigration reform because we remember the history of our own families coming to this country and how they were able to forge a better life. We care about health care because we remember what it was like for somebody in our family, if they didn't have health care and couldn't pay the bills and didn't get decent care. We care about the minimum wage because a bunch of us worked in minimum-wage jobs and remembered what it was like to try to scrimp and save. And we care about making sure college is affordable because a lot of us here benefited from loans and grants and support. Otherwise, we wouldn't have gotten an education, because we weren't born with a silver spoon. That's what we stand for, that's what we believe in.\nI could not be prouder of the work this caucus has done. I could not be prouder of the partnership I've had with you. And I intend to spend every minute every day between now and January 20 of next year making sure that your legacy continues, not just mine, because that's what the American people need. That's what they deserve. So let's get to work.\nThank you, everybody. All right. Appreciate you. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2016-01-28", "title": "Remarks at the House Democratic Issues Conference in Baltimore, Maryland"}

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111534", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:05 P.M. EST\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. It's Friday already. That's something we can celebrate. Let me do a quick announcement that you may have already seen a little bit about, and then we'll go to your questions.\nOn Wednesday, February 10th, nine years after he announced his candidacy for President, President Obama will return to the place where his political career -- or his national political career began by traveling to Springfield, Illinois. As a state senator, Barack Obama spent each day in the Illinois State Capitol working in good faith with folks from all walks of life -- Democrats and Republicans and independents -- representing good people of every ethnicity and faith, determined to do right by the people of the state where he made his home.\nAnd as a United States senator from Illinois, Barack Obama chose the steps of the old state capitol where Abraham Lincoln once called on a divided house to stand together to ask Americans to join him in the unfinished business of perfecting our union.\nNow, in the final year of his second term, President Obama looks forward to addressing the Illinois General Assembly on February 10th about what we can do together as a country to build a better politics, and one that reflects our better selves. So that should be an interesting event that's a week from this coming Wednesday.\nWith that, Josh, let's go to your questions.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I wanted to ask you about Iranian state media reporting that they had flown a drone -- surveillance drone over some type of a U.S. ship to conduct some surveillance. Do you have any evidence that backs that up? And does the U.S. consider that to be a provocative act?\nMR. EARNEST: Josh, I've seen these reports, as well. I'd refer you to the Department of Defense for any -- for an assessment of whether or not any significant risk was perceived in that action. They can give you a better sense of sort of how worrisome something like this is.\nQ: And on another concerning issue of North Korea, I wanted to see if you could give us an update on the latest U.S. thinking about what the best approach is to responding to that testing incident. It seems that some of our partners in other countries that we're trying to get to put pressure on North Korea are concerned that if we push too hard with sanctions, it could actually destabilize North Korea and lead to even worse situations. So is there -- would the goal of additional U.S. sanctions be to put more economic pressure on Pyongyang, or to actually try and see a new type of government there?\nMR. EARNEST: Josh, we've talked about how the nuclear test that the North Koreans conducted earlier this month was inconsistent with their international obligations. And North Korea's pursuit of a larger nuclear weapons stockpile and a potentially more dangerous nuclear weapons stockpile only serves to destabilize the broader region. And that's why the broader region -- all the large countries in the broader region have called on them to stop doing it.\nAnd that certainly has been the position of the United States and our allies, Japan and South Korea. But that position has also been echoed by Russia and China, including when President Xi attended a state dinner here at the White House. At the news conference that he conducted with President Obama in the Rose Garden, he reiterated the Chinese commitment to denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. And obviously that's something that we support and we've been able to work effectively with the Chinese in pursuit of that goal. And we've been engaged in diplomacy with them to have a discussion about the best way for us to try to achieve that goal.\nSecretary Kerry was in China earlier this week discussing that particular issue. I know that his deputy, Tony Blinken, was traveling in the region within the last couple of weeks to discuss this issue. And, look, the situation with North Korea, as evidenced by the fact that this is something that President Obama and President Xi talked about at the White House last fall, I think is an indication that this issue ranks highly on our agenda any time that senior U.S. officials sit down with their Chinese counterparts. The reason for that is simply that China has as close relations with North Korea as any other country does.\nAnd we have been in conversations with China about how they, in coordination with the international community, can apply more pressure to the North Koreans to get them to comply with international obligations -- or at least come to the negotiating table to have a discussion about how they can become at least a little less isolated.\nSo those conversations continue, and we continue to look for the best way to apply pressure to the North Korean regime to come into compliance with the kinds of international standards that just about everybody else follows.\nQ: And the National Security Council met with the President last night. At this point, has the President been presented with the suggestions from his advisors that he send additional troops either into Iraq or Syria, Special Forces? And any update on his thinking on that?\nMR. EARNEST: Josh, the President meets regularly with his national security team to discuss our efforts against ISIL. And they did have the opportunity to do that again just yesterday. The President's message to his national security team has consistently been to look for ways to intensify those elements of our strategy that are already showing some progress. And the President and his team have made some announcements in recent months that are consistent with that strategy.\nOne thing that we have seen, in particular, is that conducting raids against certain targets have been successful in taking some ISIL leaders off the battlefield and allowing the United States to obtain important intelligence information that can then be used to further our campaign to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. We know that that's a strategy that has allowed us to make some progress. And at the end of last year, the President and his national security team announced our intent to deploy additional troops and to ramp up that element of our strategy by creating essentially these expeditionary task forces that could be positioned to carry out these kinds of raids on relatively short notice. That's just one example of how the President's team has followed through on the President's stated goal of intensifying those elements of our strategy that are already starting to yield some progress.\nSecretary Carter did an interview with NPR that aired today, where he noted that this is exactly the instruction that he has received from the President of the United States. And each time that Secretary Carter has presented to the President a specific plan for intensifying one element of our strategy that has already shown some progress, the President has approved it. And I think that is an indication that the President is quite serious about accomplishing our goal of degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL.\nNow, I would note that that's quite a bit different than the deployment of tens of thousands of U.S. ground combat troops to go and occupy large territory in Iraq or in Syria. The President doesn't think that's a good idea, doesn't think that that would be useful in advancing our broader strategic objective. The Secretary of Defense doesn't happen to think that's a very good idea either. And that's not a recommendation that our Secretary of Defense or our uniformed military leadership have made to the President. But when they have made recommendations that are consistent with intensifying our strategy, that every time the President has approved them.\nRoberta.\nQ: So has the Secretary of Defense made specific recommendations -- in this case, for Libya -- about that strategy that you just talked about sending expeditionary Special Forces to de-raid on such short notice?\nMR. EARNEST: The reference that I made to the expeditionary task forces was a reference to an announcement that we made at the end of last year about Iraq. And I don't have any decisions to announce about our efforts in Libya. Obviously, we've been mindful for some time about the strategy that we know ISIL uses. We know that ISIL is constantly on the lookout for areas where they can capitalize on political chaos and try to establish a foothold in a country. And obviously, Libya is a country that is going through some turmoil right now.\nSo our strategy in Libya is consistent with the strategy that you've seen us employ in other places, which is to be strongly supportive of ongoing diplomatic efforts to try to resolve the political situation in Libya while also preserving a capacity to take military strikes where necessary to push back against an ISIL threat. And back in November, the United States military carried out an airstrike in Libya that took the leading ISIL leader figure in Libya off the battlefield. And I think that should be an indication to you that we're mindful of the risk that ISIL poses to Libya. And we're going to confront it -- continue to confront it in the way that we have now for many months.\nQ: And have the recent attacks in Libya on oil facilities sort of spurred the need to consider more action or a range of options of action there?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, there are -- unfortunately, Libya is a country that has -- that is in political turmoil, and that has led to a lot of violence. And we're of course concerned about that situation. This is a country that is struggling to put together the kind of central government that can actually exercise control over the entire government and provide for the security situation in that country.\nThe United States has been strongly supportive of the U.N.-led effort to try to build up a central government that reflects the views of the diverse population of that country. And so we continue to be mindful of the risk that ISIL poses to areas where there is some political chaos, but also mindful of the need to support the work that's being done to establish an effective central government there.\nQ: And lastly, just briefly, you've said before that the President has hoped to meet face to face with Speaker Ryan relatively soon. And I know it's just 10 days until the budget is released. I'm wondering whether that meeting is going to happen soon, or do you have any news on that?\nMR. EARNEST: I do. It's in the week ahead. Next week -- we'll just jump ahead. Let me make sure I get this part right. Next Tuesday, I believe, the President will meet with both Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan to discuss legislative priorities for the coming year. Building on the bipartisan budget agreement that the President signed into law last year, we certainly believe that there are areas of cooperation for the year ahead. And we are going to have a discussion, and the President will have a discussion with Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan about opportunities to work together to deliver for the American people.\nQ: Why has it taken so long to have the chance to meet with Speaker Ryan?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we've obviously been in a discussion with him since the beginning of the year about setting up this meeting. And it's obviously been a busy couple of weeks; obviously the State of the Union address, or --\nQ: Snow days.\nMR. EARNEST: There have been some snow days. There have been at least a couple weeks where Congress hasn't been in session. But this is the opportunity that we've had to meet, and the President is looking forward to the conversation. Again, based on the success that we had last year in finding some common ground to advance a whole range of shared priorities, there's plenty to talk about this year, too.\nJustin.\nQ: The DHS IG today released logs from the Secret Service showing that their radios had experienced technical issues some 100 times over the last 11 months. Congressman Chaffetz in response said that DHS and Secret Service had gotten more money than they had requested, especially for this, and so this was more evidence of mismanagement at the agency. I'm wondering how you kind of respond to that and why the Secret Service hasn't been able to get their radios working.\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't seen the IG report, Justin, but obviously we can take a look at the findings of that report and see if we can get you a response.\nQ: The Labor Department today sent over its fiduciary rule to OMB. I'm wondering if you anticipate OMB sort of expediting that -- their consideration of that rule, and if you could kind of lay out a timeline. Embedded in it is an eight-month sort of windup process, and so if you're kind of seeing that by the end of the year be done.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, this is obviously something that the administration and the Department of Labor in particular has been hard at work on. I was just looking through some of the stats here. This rule has been subject to public comment for more than five months now, and there were four days of public hearings that were convened to discuss the potential consequences of this rule. I know that the Department of Labor received more than 3,000 comments and hosted about 100 meetings to discuss the rule.\nLook, the President has made this a priority because being able to save for retirement is part of the kind of American Dream that every middle-class family aspires to. And saving for a retirement where you can continue to live out your golden years in dignity without placing an undue burden on your kids I think is something that, again, that every American worker aspires to.\nAnd right now, based on the way that the laws are written -- or based on the way that the rules are written, there are estimates that up to $17 billion each year in retirement savings is lost because some financial advisors don't act consistent with the best financial interests of their clients.\nSo I know that there are some who complain that a rule like this could be overly burdensome, but this does not place a single additional burden on a financial advisor that is acting in the best interest of their client. If you're doing the right thing and you're a financial advisor, then you don't have to do anything differently than you're already doing.\nThat's why I think this falls pretty clearly in the common-sense category. And I don't have an exact timeframe to lay out for you about when this would be implemented, but obviously we're working aggressively to work through the process, incorporate the input, be receptive to the feedback that we receive, but also put in place a regulation that is clearly in the best interest of those workers who are trying to do the right thing by saving for their retirement.\nQ: Senators Boxer and Feinstein introduced an amendment today that would require the Energy Department to kind of convene and lead a task force looking into the methane leak in California outside of L.A. I'm wondering if you have a stance on that amendment specifically, but also why -- I mean, this has been kind of an ongoing environmental catastrophe -- why we haven't heard the President speak about this or any kind action out of the White House.\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of the details of the amendment that they've put forward. I do know, however, that the EPA has been focused on the situation in California for quite some time now. They've been working closely with California officials providing some environmental expertise to try to guide the response to the situation.\nYou're right, I haven't heard the President talk about it publicly either, but I know that the President is aware of this issue. And the best-informed, most-empowered experts in the federal government aren't just aware of this issue, they've been actively working on it for some time now.\nQ: Last one, because it's Friday. The President, when he was talking to House Dems behind closed doors yesterday, seemed to suggest that although he didn't think they had the sort of the legislative capacity to do it, that if they were able to pass legislation reclassifying marijuana, that he'd be willing to sign it. That is a shift in position for him. And so I'm wondering if you could flesh out sort his thinking there.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me first compliment you on your Friday reference. (Laughter.) So that was very clever. For those who are fans of that cult classic, you'll appreciate how clever Justin was in asking that question.\nI did not attend the President's meeting yesterday -- he'll explain it to you after the briefing. (Laughter.) He doesn't have anything to do. So -- that was another joke. You can explain that one to him, as well.\nQ: Can you add it to the transcript? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: I'll see what I can do on that. I didn't participate in the President's meeting yesterday, but I did get a readout of the meeting. And my understanding is that it was a tongue-in-cheek response to the question.\nThere are some in the Democratic Party who have urged the President to take this kind of action. And the President's response was if you feel so strongly about it, and you believe there's so much public support for what it is that you're advocating, then why don't you pass legislation about it, and we'll see what happens. I think that was the tenor of the President's remarks.\nMary.\nQ: Does the President agree with the Vice President that the Republican presidential race is a \"gift from the Lord\"? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: The Vice President has a well-established reputation for his colorful expressions like the one that you just cited there. The President has made clear that regardless of who Republicans nominate at this point, based on the rhetoric that we hear not just from the leading candidate, but from all of the leading candidates -- to the extent that there are multiples of them -- all are offering up the same kind of pessimism and doom and gloom that stands in stark contrast to the kind of optimism and energy and momentum that Democrats are running on.\nAnd that dynamic historically in politics plays pretty well for those who are running on optimism and the kind of can-do spirit that has infused American politics since the founding of our country.\nQ: But does he think that the Republicans -- or the state of the Republican race is at all making things easier for Democrats?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think -- again, I didn't see the entirety of the Vice President's remarks. But I think his point is that the contrast offered up from the pessimism of the Republican candidates, again, creates a genuine opportunity for Democratic candidates that are interested in championing the interest of middle-class families and capitalizing on the momentum that our economy is showing, and building on what is best about America. And the Vice President's observation is that that's a winning message, particularly when it comes in contrast with the doom and gloom that's being spread by the Republican Party.\nMichelle.\nQ: Okay. There was a poll this week, though, that showed that 57 percent of Americans feel that things are going badly in this country. And when you see the doom and gloom rhetoric, as you describe it, getting maybe more of a groundswell than you would expect -- maybe in other years, I don't know; it seems to have taken a lot of people by surprise -- how are you so certain that optimism is going to really capture people when it seems based on these numbers that it's the pessimism that is the stronger feeling out there?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we'll see. That's the beauty of these things. There will be a contest. There will be a long debate over the course of this year, and there will be an election in November. And we'll tally up the votes, and we'll find out. And that's the beauty of the process.\nSome of this is clearly bias by my own experience. One of the things I think that is particularly notable about the Iowa caucuses that are coming next week is you do see a lot of this effort by Republican candidates to try to exploit people's anxieties.\nBarack Obama, when he was running in Iowa, had yard signs all across the state. They didn't have his name on it; they had the word \"hope\" on it. And that message is what propelled him to not just an historic upset in the Iowa caucuses, it propelled him to the Oval Office.\nSo, yeah, I guess I have a little bit of a bias here. But I think there is a strong element of our political culture that is, at its core, optimistic; that this is a country that was founded on an ideal. And ever since it was founded, we have been striving to make our union more perfect. And that is infused with the sense that we have the capacity to change and improve our country, and to build on the progress that we've made, and to capitalize on the momentum that exists.\nAnd particularly when you take a look at the amount of progress that we've made over the last seven years, digging out of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, when you compare the strength and durability of the U.S. economy to economies around the world, you quickly see why the United States is so well positioned. And it doesn't mean that we should take the challenges that we face lightly. It doesn't mean that there isn't a whole lot more work to do to expand economic opportunity for everybody in this country, to do more to fight for the middle class -- sure, all those things are true. But we should feel confident about our ability not just to confront but to overcome those challenges, not by turning against one another or contradicting the kinds of values that were critical to the founding of this nation, but actually by drawing upon the strength of the American people and the strength of the values that have served our country so well over the last two centuries.\nQ: That's a lot of what you hear virtually every time the President goes somewhere and gives a speech. He starts it out, of course, by listing all of the progress over the last seven years. So it must be frustrating when a poll comes out like that -- and we've seen several over the last year -- where there does seem to be a sense that things are going badly. So is it frustrating to you in the message that is being put out there, and to what do you account for that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, you've got 14 Republican candidates for president that are running around the country telling everybody that things are bad. And they're spending tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising trying to convince people of that. That's not surprising to me that that's having some kind of an effect. But it doesn't change the fact of the strength and durability of our economy, about the way that the rest of the world looks to the United States as a beacon of hope and opportunity and a source of strength. It doesn't change the fact that we're seeing higher graduation rates and higher percentages of students enrolling in college; that we're seeing health care inflation at an all-time low and the un-insurance rate -- or the rate of people who are uninsured at an all-time low\nThere's tremendous progress that this country has made. And whether you consider domestic politics or our standing in the international community, there's just no denying those facts. And I recognize that that makes it inconvenient for those who are peddling a lot of doom and gloom, but it does give the President optimism not just about the future of our country, but also the likelihood of success of politics candidates who are, frankly, aware of and prepared to capitalize on the momentum that our country has built up.\nQ: It does seem to tell you that the message isn't quite getting out, right? I mean, you list a lot of progress. The President lists a number of points every time he speaks. Is there something you think that prevents that message from really registering?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think what is clear is that there are 14 -- or however many there are now -- Republican candidates for president that are saying something a lot different, and they're spending a lot of time on the campaign trail and they're getting a lot of media attention, and they're spending a lot of time with their advertising campaigns making a different case.\nSo, no, I'm not particularly worried about that. I think we're actually focused on the results. And I think the strength of the results speaks for itself.\nQ: And also the meeting that will happen on Tuesday -- because Mitch McConnell is going to be there -- is that going to count as the \"bourbon summit\"? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: My guess is that the meeting will take place either in the late morning or early afternoon. We'll get you some more updates on that. So --\nQ: It's prime time for --\nMR. EARNEST: In some offices, that may be true, but not in the Oval Office.\nQ: I mean, are you saying that this is going to be the bourbon summit?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I'm saying it's not the bourbon summit.\nQ: It's not the --\nMR. EARNEST: No.\nQ: So we can continue to look forward to, at some point in the future, a bourbon summit?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes. You can continue to look forward to it. (Laughter.) All right?\nGregory.\nQ: Today we understand is the last day in office of the United States pardon attorney, whose job it is to recommend to the President clemency actions. She's leaving a historic backlog of clemency applications -- 9,000 commutation applications, more than 1,000 pardons -- almost 1,000 pardon applications. Is the President at all concerned that his attempt to use his clemency power more rigorously in his last year in office is at all in jeopardy? And is the White House considering any structural changes in how those clemency applications are processed in order to move this caseload forward? At this rate, it would take an entire another presidential administration -- two terms -- to get through that backlog of cases.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, the President is committed to the clemency process. And I think some of the announcements that you've seen from us over the last year or so I think are an indication of the President's willingness to use that process to make our system more fair.\nWe believe the most impactful thing -- the most impactful way to reform the system is for Congress to pass legislation. And the President is working hard to try to nurture bipartisan agreement that would lead to criminal justice legislation -- criminal justice reform legislation passing the United States Congress. We're going to continue to be a leading advocate of that.\nAt the same time, the President does have authority to grant clemency in cases that are reviewed by attorneys at the Department of Justice. And the President has been aggressive about using that authority over the course of the last year, and I would expect that in the year that remains -- that he remains in office, he'll continue to look for opportunities to use that authority to make our system more fair. And I don't have any announcements about additional resources or any sort of restructuring, but based on the progress that we have made in both soliciting and approving clemency requests, I think the President is quite proud of his record thus far, but there is more that we intend to get done over the course of the next year.\nByron.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. The State Department today is reportedly releasing only about 1,000 of Secretary Clinton's remaining 9,000 emails that's in -- at least doesn't comport with the judge's order, ordering their release by today. Lawyers for your administration have asked to delay the release to the last day of February, which would be the day before the Super Tuesday primaries. Does the public, especially the Democratic voting public, have the right to see Secretary Clinton's emails before they cast ballots?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think no. I think the extraordinary request that Secretary Clinton put forward to actually release her emails is something that I'm not sure has a precedent, at least for federal office holders. So the fact is, the Democratic primary voters, to the extent that they're interested in reading those emails -- and I'm not sure very many of them are -- but to the extent that they are, have already had the opportunity to review tens of thousands of them -- at least tens of thousands of pages of them. And there is more work that needs to be done, and the State Department has been engaged in a rigorous process to ensure that the release of those emails is consistent with the standards that are laid out in the Freedom of Information Act.\nAnd given the volume of material that they had to review, they weren't able to complete that work in the timeframe that was laid out by the judge, but they have a plan in place to complete that work as soon as possible. And I know they're pursuing that even as we speak.\nQ: You said it was her request to release these emails, but you concede that these are records the public is entitled to see under the Freedom of Information Act, right? I mean, this is part of an ongoing lawsuit. It's part of a long-delayed litigation into her records, which are public. I mean, it's not like she -- this was a judge's order. Would you concede they're public records and they belong to the public?\nMR. EARNEST: I would concede that they are public records that are subject to the Freedom of Information Act request, but that is different than proactively releasing all of them. No judge ordered her to do that. She said that to demonstrate her commitment to transparency, that that's what she would do. And this administration has devoted significant resources, because that's consistent with the President's commitment to transparency, to try to fulfill that request.\nAnd all of you and Democratic voters -- again, to the extent that any of them are interested in this -- have had ample opportunity to read thousands of pages of otherwise private correspondence. So again, the State Department is going to work hard to fulfill both the request that was made by Secretary Clinton and consistent with the direction of the judge.\nQ: In this correspondence, we've seen some emails dealing with the way Secretary Clinton and her aides talk about dealing with sensitive or classified information, including an email where she asks an aide to transmit something non-secure. Another video surfaced that Fox found of Wendy Sherman, a top State Department official, saying that top diplomats were emailing things that you shouldn't -- you would never see on an unclassified system. Does the White House have any concerns about the attitude of the State Department or among the Secretary's staff about classified information and sensitive information?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't seen any of that reporting. I can tell you that certainly the President has made clear that the handling of sensitive information should be something that people are conscientious about. And that's certainly the case here.\nI know that Secretary Clinton and her team have said on a number of occasions that she neither sent nor received information on her private server that was stamped \"classified.\" That is consistent with the proper handling of sensitive materials.\nSo look, in the context of a presidential campaign, people are going to have a whole bunch of reasons to criticize any of the candidates, so it's not surprising to me that there are certain political opponents of Secretary Clinton that are looking for a way to use this situation to criticize her. That's part of the process. And she and her team I'm confident will muster a robust defense.\nRon.\nQ: On the pay gap issue that we've been hearing about this morning, just to be clear, the 79 cents on the dollar differential, how much of that does the administration now insist is the result of discrimination in the workplace versus larger societal issues? Is it still your intention -- your insistence that, in fact, discrimination plays a significant part in this discrepancy?\nMR. EARNEST: I think you'd be hard pressed to say that doesn't play any role whatsoever. Exactly what percentage that is I think probably varies by position. I think there probably are some places where we do see some discrimination. I think there are a lot of places where you don't.\nAnd I think this is precisely why the EEOC has announced today that they want to collect more information about this matter so that they can have much greater insight into what kind of pay gap exists by industry or at an individual company, and they can then draw better conclusions about both how to bridge that gap, but also see if there are ways to prevent it from happening in other places, too.\nQ: And this would apply to every company over 100 employees, from Comcast, dare I say, to Joe's whatever around the corner.\nMR. EARNEST: That's right.\nQ: And you know the criticism of that -- it's onerous, some have described it as a fishing expedition, it's unnecessary. You have existing anti-discrimination laws that are already on the books. Why does business need to do this?\nMR. EARNEST: This is just adding an additional component on a form that they already file every month or so.\nQ: But it's asking for a significantly different kind of qualitative kind of data -- not just race or gender. And it's data that I think many people see as private.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think that -- I know that there are at least some leaders in the business community, and you heard from Marc Benioff, at Salesforce, who says that this kind of transparency is actually good for running a business; that he is somebody who is known as a particularly effective chief executive. But he wasn't even aware of the fact that there was a pay gap, a gender pay gap at his company. And that by taking a closer look at the numbers, he was able to discern that there was some work that needed to be done in his own company to remedy that gap.\nThat's a good thing. He'd be the first to tell you that that was good for his business. He didn't do that out of charity. He believed that's an effective way to run his business.\nSo I do think that the request that the EEOC will now make of all these companies is consistent with good business practices. But what's also true is the EEOC has a responsibility to make sure that they're rooting out discrimination where it exists. And so what they're asking for is additional information that will help them fulfill their mission.\nQ: On the Flint situation and the Senate Democratic bill, what is the administration's position? I think you said yesterday that you're kind of waiting to see exactly what it says, or what is the -- because we're talking about $600 million, which is significant, and there's obviously a great sense of urgency out there.\nMR. EARNEST: It is. It's a significant sum of money, and it also includes some policy changes, as well. So we're carefully reviewing the proposal that they've put forward.\nWhat I can tell you is that we do believe that it's appropriate for Congress to pass legislation that would give the city of Flint and the state of Michigan the resources that they need to address this situation. For the details, we're going to continue to work with Congress and take a look at the proposals that have been floated and see what might be most effective.\nQ: It seems like it's taking a while to review something that a lot of people would like to see the President champion, get out in front of, if you will -- especially because there is still this enduring perception that the situation there isn't being taken seriously enough because it's a poor, minority community. Is the President sensitive to that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think you've heard directly from the President himself that he takes this quite seriously. And I think you could hear the emotion and passion in his voice when he was discussing it. I think if you take a look at the response that's been mobilized by the Obama administration in terms of the resources provided by FEMA, the resources provided in the budget that have been expedited to give the city of Flint and the state of Michigan more resources to deal with this situation. There has been a federal official who is an expert in public health put in charge of coordinating the federal resources that are being offered to that situation. So our response has been quite serious and I think consistent with the need there.\nQ: Still consistent with the need there, because there's still a huge gap -- even when we talk about the emergency declaration versus the disaster declaration. I don't know the legalities of why that happened. There is still a huge gap between what people are saying is needed there -- $1 billion to replace infrastructure, to the $28 million that the Governor signed off on today, to the $5 million or so in the emergency declaration.\nMR. EARNEST: And the $80 million that the President announced that he was going to expedite at the end of last week.\nQ: But we're not even close to what people seem to be saying or definitely saying that they think is needed to address this.\nMR. EARNEST: Let me say two things about that. The first is, I do think it is still unclear exactly what is needed to remedy the problems in Flint, and that's something that state, local, and even federal officials are still studying. And I think that what I've said is consistent with that observation, which is we do believe that Congress should pass legislation that would give the state of Michigan and the city of Flint additional resources to address the situation.\nNow, the question is, what kind of policy should be attached to that bill, what exactly are the numbers that are needed in terms of resources, and that is work that's still being done to determine what exactly is needed.\nRichard.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. First, a question about the refugee crisis in Europe. Germany, Finland, soon up to 80,000 in Sweden, they will be deporting tens of thousands of refugee that came in the last months, 45 percent of them not being serious candidates for refugee status. Do you see any reason to review the American refugee system -- evaluation system, just considering the steps that are being taken in Europe?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the situation in the United States is different than the situation in Germany and other countries. And the reason for that primarily lies with the fact that we're not so close to the situation. It's not as easy for refugees from the Middle East to show up in the United States. That means that we can impose a set of screening measures that take a close look at the individuals that are seeking to enter the United States. And those who apply to enter the United States through the refugee program undergo the more strict screening than any other individual that attempts to enter the United States.\nThat said, the United States actually accepts more refugees through the U.N. process than all the other countries in the world combined. So I think that's a pretty good indication that the United States can both prioritize our national security and our homeland security while, at the same time, showing the kind of generosity that is the hallmark of American values. And so I'm not going to second-guess the kinds of policies that are put in place by other countries because other countries are facing a different situation.\nBut the President has certainly made clear that the screening process for individuals seeking to enter the United States will be structured in a way that makes the safety and security of our homeland and the American people the number-one priority.\nQ: A question on Afghanistan. A new commander over there, General Nicholson, wants everyone to be cautious when talking about the potential drawdown of troops. First, is the President satisfied with the mission over there at this very point?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, at this point it's clear that there is -- it's a very difficult situation in Afghanistan right now. It's a dangerous country. And the Afghan government and the Afghan national security forces have been in charge of the security situation in that country for only about a year or so. And there are lessons that they've had to learn and some losses that they have sustained. But the United States military and our NATO partners have made substantial contributions to offering training and advice and assistance and expertise to those security forces. There's also been a mission that U.S. military personnel have undertaken that is focused on counterterrorism that has both an element of protecting the forces that are serving in Afghanistan, but also protecting the United States and our interests from extremist organizations that are operating in that region of the world.\nSo the President is certainly pleased with the performance of the U.S. military and our NATO partners in this effort. And we've actually seen from the Afghans a willingness to fight for their country, a willingness to respond to losses and to recover from them and fight back.\nWe talked about the situation in Kunduz last fall; this was a city that was taken over by the Taliban. But what you saw was the Afghan national security forces withdrew, reorganized, and then retook the city. Obviously you would prefer to be in a situation where they repelled the initial Taliban advance in the first place, but their ability to be resilient and to continue to have the passion to fight for their country will be critical to their long-term success in securing their country against extremist elements that operate there.\nQ: What do you expect -- I know the administration was expecting there would be a greater involvement of NATO partners. The President is pleased with what's being done, but more was expected and not much is coming -- am I right?\nMR. EARNEST: I think what you're right about is that we're going to continue to have intensive conversations with our NATO partners about how they can contribute to the ongoing efforts inside of Afghanistan. And over the last --\nQ: You want more from them.\nMR. EARNEST: I'm sorry?\nQ: You want more from them.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I would say that over the last 15 years we've seen countries in NATO make substantial contributions to the situation in Afghanistan, and they're going to need to sustain those kinds of contributions moving forward. And I'm confident that that will be an important part of the discussions over the course of this year leading up to the NATO Summit that's planned for later this summer.\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, a quick follow-up on your answer to the question about the Iranian fly-by, the drone fly-by, and pointing that to the Pentagon or to the Navy. Is it correct to understand that that fly-by didn't cause concern in this building, the White House?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we obviously would want to get a good sense from the Department of Defense how concerned they were about the situation. Obviously those who are on the frontlines here can best assess what sort of threat this posed to our men and women in uniform and what impact this had on their ability to conduct their mission and their regular operations in that region of the world.\nSo for an assessment of that, I'd refer you to the Department of Defense. If they tell you that they were not unnecessarily constrained by this activity, then yes, I think it would be fair for you to assume that the White House wasn't concerned about it. But you should check with the Department of Defense.\nQ: And in other drone news, I wanted to ask you about a report in The Intercept you probably saw about the U.S. allegedly hacking into Israeli drones to get a sort of bird's-eye view of what they were looking at. They're said they're reporting based on files provided by Edward Snowden. Do you have a response to that? And anything you can say to us in regard to the status of Mr. Snowden? Give us information?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any update on Mr. Snowden's status. He is somebody who continues to face serious charges here in the United States, and we believe that he should face those charges. If he does, he will obviously be given all of the rights and access to due process that other American citizens enjoy. But he's facing serious charges and that's his status.\nAs it relates to the news reports, I have some language that probably will sound familiar to you, and this is the language that we used in response to other reports that were based on Mr. Snowden's activities, and that simply is that I'm not in a position to comment on any specific alleged intelligence activities. As a general matter, and as we have said many times previously, we do not conduct any foreign intelligence surveillance activities unless there is a specific and validated national security purpose.\nMore generally, our commitment to Israel's security is sacrosanct. And those aren't just words and rhetoric that you hear from government officials. That is actually backed up by specific commitments and actions by the United States of America. And this President has certainly lived up to those commitments in a way that caused Prime Minister Netanyahu to remark that the cooperation between our two countries on security matters is unprecedented. And the President is committed to continuing that cooperation.\nI noted yesterday that there are these ongoing discussions about deepening and even expanding our security cooperation with Israel. I can tell you that those meetings that were planned between senior national security officials in the United States and Israeli counterparts was, like many other things, affected by the bad weather over the weekend. But I can tell you that those officials will leave and travel to Israel early next week to begin those discussions -- or to continue those discussions, which have been ongoing since President Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu met here at the White House at the end of last year.\nQ: Unwavering except for the weather delay. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Exactly.\nQ: Okay. Can you tell us who's going?\nMR. EARNEST: No, but I can look into that for you and get you some more details on that.\nQ: One other question to follow up on Hillary Clinton's email release from the State Department. In terms of the delay, there have been some allegations that there's something specific to this last cache of emails in terms of perhaps the clearance level security -- classification level of the content of these emails. Can you respond to that and the allegation that because of that particular element and that particular aspect, that the delay towards the time on the calendar that is after early state voting, that there are allegations that this is politically motivated? Can you respond to that idea that the administration has somehow tried to tip the scales on this?\nMR. EARNEST: I can tell you with full confidence that there has been no political interference in this process. I don't have a lot of knowledge, granular knowledge about the content of the materials that are being prepared for release. I can tell you that their work has been important because there are guidelines that are laid out in the Freedom of Information Act that require a lot of coordination with other agencies that may have equities in the release of those materials.\nSo I think what you can infer from the delay are two things. One is that the volume of materials was large. And, second, that they're being quite conscientious about the need to coordinate with other agencies that may have a stake in the release of these materials to ensure that the materials are properly handled and properly released.\nQ: Can I follow up?\nMR. EARNEST: I'll come back to you.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Staying with emails for just a moment, can you say with certainty and confidence that Secretary Clinton will not be indicted because of this email scandal?\nMR. EARNEST: That will be a decision that is made by the Department of Justice and prosecutors over there. What I know that some officials over there have said is that she is not a target of the investigation. So that does not seem to be the direction that it's trending, but I'm certainly not going to weigh in on a decision or in that process in any way. That is a decision to be made solely by independent prosecutors. But, again, based on what we know from the Department of Justice, it does not seem to be headed in that direction.\nQ: As a Democrat, should there be a plan B just in case? In other words, if Secretary Clinton were to get the nomination or be leading significantly after Super Tuesday or deeper into the process, should there not be a plan B for Democrats in the event that she is indicted?\nMR. EARNEST: That's not something I'm worried about.\nQ: Not at all?\nMR. EARNEST: No.\nQ: Okay. On the economy, it's been described as -- the fourth quarter we're talking about -- by some as sluggish, anemic, very little growth. Are you surprised? And is this -- low expectation performance by the economy, especially when you add it to the fact that we've just learned from the White House that the deficit will likely rise in 2016 as well?\nMR. EARNEST: Kevin, the numbers that we saw from the Department of Commerce today were actually right on expectations. And they are an indication that the United States continues to have the strongest, most durable economy in the world. In fact, our economy is the envy of the world, particularly when you consider what's happening in other economies with whom we have -- do a lot of a business.\nQ: So this is a day of celebration?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think this is a day in which we acknowledge that the United States is in a much better position than basically any other country in the world, particularly when it comes to advanced economies. And, in fact, one thing that is restraining even stronger -- an even stronger performance by our economy is the fact that these other economies around the world are showing some weakness right now; that what we're encountering right now primarily are headwinds from overseas. And that's the biggest challenge to our economy right now.\nThe good news is, there are several things that we can do about that. The first is, we can take care of more of our business here at home. We can make deeper investments in infrastructure that we know create jobs in the short term but actually lay a long-term foundation for economic strength. We can do more to look out for the hardest-working Americans by raising the minimum wage.\nAnd we can also do more to strengthen our relationships with those economies that are the most dynamic. And that's why the President has advocated the completion of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. This is a trade agreement that, if we can get it done this year, would have a positive impact on economic growth, would have a positive economic impact on job creation, and would position the United States even better to weather some of the international headwinds that we're experiencing right now.\nQ: Okay, last one. I want to ask you about the strategy as it relates to ISIS. We talked earlier -- or you did -- about Secretary Carter's interview on NPR, where he suggested that all the proposals that we've given the President he has readily accepted. And yet, the New York Times in its reporting said that the President resented efforts to pressure him to have more troops in Afghanistan and Iraq. Is that true? Or did they get that wrong?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I have learned long ago that I'm not going to stand up here and critique others' reporting. I will note that my eyebrow is raised in the same way that yours apparently did when you read that.\nWhat I can tell you is the President is quite pleased with the kind of advice that he gets from his national security team. He relies heavily on the expertise of our men and women in uniform at the Department of Defense for suggestions and recommendations about the best way to intensify those elements of our counter-ISIL strategy that are showing some progress. And I assure you that, if anything, it is the leaders at the Department of Defense who are feeling pressure from the Commander-in-Chief to find new ideas and new ways to further intensify those elements of our strategy that are working.\nJohn.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I wanted to get your take on the Iowa caucus coming up tonight. Last opportunity to ask you about this before I head out to the Hawkeye state.\nMR. EARNEST: Dress warm. (Laughter.)\nQ: I will indeed. Snowstorm on Tuesday. You have some experience here helping the President, then Senator Obama, win the Iowa caucus back in 2008. I wanted to get your sense about how important it is for Democrats to win Iowa. Does it give you that momentum? If the President, then Senator Obama, had not won Iowa, would it have, in your opinion, hurt him in the process to winning the Democratic nomination? Give me your take as someone who's experienced this before.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, each race is different, and the dynamics of the race and the calendar are different every year. And I think in some ways that's what makes the primary process and even the Iowa caucus process so interesting.\nI do think that it's true, in 2008, if Barack Obama had not won the Iowa caucuses, that he probably would not have won the nomination and therefore would not have become President. At the time, in 2008, there was a lot of skepticism about a couple of different things.\nFirst is, then-Senator Obama demonstrated an ability to draw large crowds in ways that Democratic candidates had traditionally not been able to draw. And he even had been able to inspire a lot of young people, a lot of people who had not previously been engaged in the political process, to be interested in his campaign.\nAnd so there's a fundamental question about whether or not he was going to be able to take that interest and that passion at a rally and turn it into a high-functioning political organization that's required to turn out and win a caucus campaign. And the skepticism about his ability to do that I think was entirely understandable. That was a credible thing and a proposition that could only be tested on caucus night. And it clearly passed the test with flying colors.\nThere was also some skepticism about whether or not an African American senator who didn't have much experience in Washington, D.C. -- he looked pretty young; certainly a lot younger than he looks now -- about whether or not he would be able to sort of pass the Commander-in-Chief test. And there were a lot of people that said, well, you know, Democratic activists and people who follow the political process will be interested in hearing him speak, but it will be a different thing when they actually have to consider whether or not they'll support him to be Commander-in-Chief.\nThe third question was, frankly, about race. Iowa, it's no secret, even in the Democratic caucus process, is overwhelmingly white. And there were questions about whether or not an African American candidate could earn so much support from white voters. And again, he passed that test with flying colors.\nSo that's why the Iowa caucus in 2008 was so significant to the prospects for then-Senator Obama's campaign. The dynamics of this face are obviously a whole lot different, and I'll leave it to you guys to analyze sort of the stakes in this contest for Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders and Governor O'Malley. I'm sure they all have their own take on it.\nBut look, I think what's notable is it's the first contest of the presidential cycle. And I think that's the other reason that it's so interesting. It's the first time that all of our own personal assumptions and hypotheses about the candidates and their strategy can be put to the test. And that's what will make Monday night a pretty interesting night of television.\nQ: Do you think that -- I realize -- I agree with you, dynamics are always different in each election cycle. Do you think Iowa will give momentum to whoever wins on Monday? Momentum to either Hillary Clinton or Senator Bernie Sanders?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as important as Iowa was in 2008 for then-Senator Obama, it didn't give us very much momentum in New Hampshire, as many of us rather vividly recall. Obviously, then-former Senator Clinton did quite well in the New Hampshire primary against Senator Obama.\nSo again, I think the dynamics of each of these contests are a little different, so it's hard to assess whether or not the candidate that wins this time will get the same kind of -- or will get a boost, unlike President Obama did in 2008.\nVictoria.\nQ: The Syrian opposition High Negotiations Committee is boycotting the peace talks starting today in Syria, so there's really nobody to negotiate with. So haven't the talks sort of failed before they've even started?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Victoria, this has been a long-running process, and there have been a number of diplomatic engagements that have brought us to this point. And it's my understanding that the U.N. right now is engaging with representatives of the Syrian government as a part of this ongoing process.\nFor updates about the participation of the high negotiating council, I'd refer you to the State Department. They're sort of tracking this most closely.\nBut, obviously, the resolution of the political situation in Syria is critical to our efforts to address the chaos in that country. And the political failures inside of Syria have led to terrible consequences both in terms of the humanitarian toll that this situation has taken, but also on the broader instability not just in the Middle East but around the world. And there's a lot riding on this diplomatic process, and it's why the United States is so invested in it.\nI think that's also why I'd caution against sort of a snap judgment about success or failure. I think it's only over the long term where we will be able to determine if these talks will eventually prove to be fruitful.\nQ: What is the United States willing to do to try to get them to the table at this point?\nMR. EARNEST: We believe there's a pretty clear interest that the opposition groups have in trying to negotiate the long-overdue political transition inside of Syria.\nQ: They feel that the U.S. is putting undue pressure on them.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the international community is putting a lot of pressure on them to be constructive and to constructively engage in a process that will bring about the kind of political transition that is badly needed inside of Syria.\nConnie.\nQ: Thank you. A follow-up on the Middle East. The President's Holocaust speech was very, very powerful. Have you had much reaction from the Arab governments about the speech?\nMR. EARNEST: That's a good question. I'm not aware of the specific reaction that we've received from them, but we can check on that and see if there's anything notable to share with you.\nI'll just say that the President did feel strongly about having the opportunity to deliver those remarks both to demonstrate -- well, I think primarily to sort of demonstrate how the actions that were taken by those brave Americans to save Jews who were fleeing the Holocaust represents the best of America. It represents American values saving innocent lives. And that is worthy of celebrating all these many years later.\nQ: And on the MOU, do you know if American aid levels to Israel and to Egypt will remain at the present level? It's very high.\nMR. EARNEST: At this point, right now, what is being discussed is the kind of security and military assistance that the United States provides to Israel. I wouldn't speculate at this point about what those levels will be, because that's precisely what's being negotiated. But once we have an agreement, we'll have more detail to share about the kind of assistance the United States is providing our close ally in the Middle East.\nSusan, I'll give you the last one then we'll do the week ahead.\nQ: Back to the Syria question. Can you unequivocally say that John Kerry did not threaten the Syrian opposition leaders with defunding or failing to back their efforts anymore if they did not --\nMR. EARNEST: You'd have to talk to the State Department about the conversations that they're having with the agency. They're in the best position to try to describe that situation to you.\nQ: Surely, though, the EU would have checked in with the State Department by now, and the White House would have --\nMR. EARNEST: Oh, we're in touch with them all the time about a range of issues, as Byron well knows. But I don't want to characterize the kinds of conversations they're having. I mean, I think what I did acknowledge to Victoria is I'm not surprised if there are some representatives of the opposition who are saying they're feeling pressure from the international community to engage in diplomatic talks to try to resolve the political situation inside of Syria. If they are, that's good, because that's what we're trying to do.\nWe want to bring both sides together through this U.N.-led process and try to resolve the political situation inside of Syria. That's not going to happen overnight. It's not going to happen in the context of one set of talks. But we've got to continue making progress in this effort.\nAnd Secretary Kerry deserves a lot of credit for being so tireless and dogged in his attempt. There are lives that are on the line here, hundreds of thousands if not millions of lives that have been terribly affected by the chaos inside of Syria. And look, it only continues to get worse.\nQ: And the opposition leaders have put a lot on the line, obviously, for that -- I mean, their own lives, the lives of their families.\nMR. EARNEST: Obviously they have.\nQ: But what I'm talking about -- when you say the word \"pressure,\" are you talking about defunding the opposition?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not going to get into the details of the conversations. We believe strongly that both sides need to play a constructive role in these conversations. And it's not just the United States who feel strongly about this, it is the broader international community who was quite focused on trying to resolve the political situation inside of Syria.\nFor all of our military might and all of our military effort, the situation inside of Syria will only be resolved when the political failures in that country have been resolved.\nQ: Can you address the Syrian opposition leaders' concern about your closeness, and Kerry's closeness specifically, with his Iranian counterpart and also his Russian counterpart? They have said to me and others that they are very -- that they're worried that they're going to be cut in a bad deal, and that they're going to have to accept Bashar Assad's reelection and not going to get any humanitarian protections out of this.\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I think there is a lot of evidence that would ease whatever concerns may have been expressed. I'll go through a few of them.\nFor years, and repeatedly, we have made clear that Bashar al-Assad must go, that he's lost the legitimacy to lead that country, again, not just because of the great moral offense that we've taken to his willingness to slaughter innocent civilians, but also because, as a practical matter, he's not going to inspire the confidence of the Syrian people if he continues to attack them. So we've made clear that Bashar al-Assad needs to go.\nThe United States I think has demonstrated quite a clear commitment to trying to meet the humanitarian needs of the Syrian people who are fleeing violence. The United States is the largest bilateral donor of humanitarian assistance to Syrians who are fleeing violence, both within Syria but also in the broader region. And I think you also heard -- Margaret and I had a conversation yesterday about the Russian role in all of this. And I think I was pretty blunt in saying that the Russian military support for the Assad regime was having a negative impact on our ability to try to reach a political resolution to the situation.\nAnd so it's not as if there's been any reluctance on the part of me, frankly, or anybody else publicly, to express our significant concerns about the way that Russia is handling their business when it comes to this situation. Their military strategy directly contradicts their stated political strategy, and we've held that up and made that clear, and told them in no uncertain terms that their military strategy needs to change.\nQ: My question was Bashar Assad's reelection -- are you saying right now that the deal would not include any provision for him to be reelected?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not going to draw any sort of -- look, the political situation inside of Syria has to be negotiated between the government and the opposition. You've got the U.N. negotiator in place that's prepared to facilitate those discussions, because what we're talking about right now are just proximity negotiations. We're not even talking about sitting across the table from one another -- we're talking about the U.N. doing some shuttle diplomacy here. And we've been clear about what our position is, and the details are going to have to be worked out by the Syrian people. And that's entirely appropriate. We're not dictating outcomes here. We need the Syrian people to engage in this.\nLet me do the week ahead, and then we'll let you guys get started on your weekend.\nOn Monday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.\nOn Tuesday, as I mentioned, the President will meet with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. They'll discuss a range of legislative priorities for the upcoming year. And the President is certainly hopeful that they'll be able to build on the momentum of the bipartisan budget agreement that was reached at the end of last year and discuss areas of cooperation for the year ahead.\nOn Wednesday, the President will be here at the White House hosting meetings.\nOn Thursday, the President will deliver remarks at the national prayer breakfast. This is something that the President has done each year that he's been in office, so I know he's looking forward to this year's event.\nIn the afternoon, the President will welcome the 2015 NBA Champion Golden State Warriors to the White House. We'll obviously be honoring the team for winning the NBA Finals last year. This visit will continue the tradition begun by President Obama of honoring sports teams for their efforts to give back to their communities.\nLater that afternoon, still on Thursday, the President will welcome President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia to the White House for an official working visit. The leaders will hold a bilateral meeting and mark 15 years of bipartisan cooperation through Plan Colombia, the joint effort to create a safer, more prosperous future for the people of Colombia.\nAnd on Friday, the President will be here at the White House.\nI have one additional bonus announcement. Not this coming Monday, but the Monday after, February 8th, President Obama will host President Sergio Mattarella of Italy at the White House. President Mattarella will visit the United States from February 16th -- I'm sorry, from February 6th through the 13th. Italy is a valued NATO ally and a close partner on a broad range of global challenges. During their meeting, the two Presidents will discuss our shared efforts to counter ISIL and the global refugee crisis. They will also exchange views on economic developments on Europe, the importance of concluding the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, and a variety of other areas of mutual interest.\nSo lots to look forward to in the next couple weeks. But until then, have a great weekend.\nEND 2:04 P.M. EST", "timestamp": "2016-01-29", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}

Please remember to keep sending me your thoughts and questions by texting the number 275-236 (ASKBEN). Let's jump right in!\nFirst, I wanted to thank the thousands of you who sent me your prayers and well-wishes yesterday before the debate — it always centers me and puts me in the right frame of mind to know who I am fighting for, We the People. So much attention has been given to \"sound-byte sensationalism\" and pitting this person against that one — we must always remember that this is not about 'them', it is about us. The future we sow for will be what our children reap, and I am confident, together, we will be planting the seeds for our children to bear the fruit of a prosperous tomorrow.\nDivision and demonization are not the answer — it is healthy to recognize 'differences' that are inherent in our 'melting pot' society steeped in tradition and common purpose, unique perspectives and voices are at the very essence of our nation's formation. However, when we lose sight of our commonality — to the point of demeaning rhetoric and dehumanizing insult — our neighbor becomes nothing more than an accumulation of 'material', without dignity and meaning.\nI refuse to belittle, We the People are bigger — it's time \"politicians\" learn how to lift ideas up rather than pushing other people down. This election means more than the person who will hold the office of President because the American people ultimately govern from that desk, and I'm not quite sure there's enough room for one man's ego and We the People to fit at the same time.\nBefore I head off to bed, I'd like to answer Don's question about last night; he asked \"were you frustrated about the lack of time and questions you got during the debate?\" This was a common response from many of you, so I wanted to make sure I shared my thoughts with you on this.\nYes and no, Don. No, I wasn't personally frustrated over the lack of time I was given — I don't think it takes a verbose and drawn-out answer to get to the point. According to the reporting, I had the \"lowest time\" answering on stage, but I always prefer quality over quantity. On the same note, however, I do wish that more time was spent getting to the focus of this debate: the American people. There was plenty of \"back and forth\", from side to side on that stage, not enough discussion about giving this country back to We the People, forthright solutions that speak directly to a divided America. Let's leave the bickering on the playground, this is not a game.\nI stand with you — not over you. We the People are united in actually solving problems, telling it like it is — who cares about scoring political points when the score always ends up zero. We all lose when fall divided, but, united we stand. Let's get back to winning again. I am confident we will secure the victory Americans are known for, time and time again, leading the way for others to follow.\nAs always, thank you for allowing me into your homes for another night together, just We the People connecting without all the noise. It's always a highlight of my day.\nGoodnight,\nBen", "timestamp": "2016-01-29", "title": "Press Release - #AskBen Fireside Chat - January 29"}

In fact, they received income tax rebates from the Internal Revenue Service totaling more than $4.1 billion, according to a report from Citizens for Tax Justice.\n\"In America today we are losing $100 billion in revenue every single year because large corporations are stashing their profits in the Cayman Islands and other offshore tax havens,\" Sanders said.\nSanders' tax plan would close loopholes those and other corporations have exploited and use the revenue to create and maintain at least 13 million good-paying jobs by rebuilding our crumbling roads, bridges, water systems, railways, airports and more.\nSanders singled out GE, Boeing, Verizon and others on his Top 10 list of corporate tax dodgers during a swing through eastern Iowa three days before Iowa's precinct caucuses.

Our country is in desperate need of leaders who will guide us toward what is moral and right and Clint is one of those leaders. He understands where our country is headed and what needs to be done and I truly appreciate his support.\"\n\"When candidates began declaring their intentions to run for President, I started doing research and quickly landed on Ted Cruz. I discovered a guy who has deep conviction for a set of principles and ideas I believe in,\" Clint said. \"I like Mr. Cruz because he has courage to fight and take the flak from people who want to undermine those ideas.

{"author": "Mike Huckabee", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116349", "text": "By Adam Graham\nEvery politician makes promises, but only a few keep them. If you want to know if you can trust a candidate, examine their character.\nToo often we've defined character too narrowly as if it were only a question of whether a candidate has been faithful to their spouse and avoided trouble with the law. Yet, our character is built one decision at a time over the course of our lives, and these decisions establish patterns. A wise man has said, \"You make decisions and those decisions turn around and make you.\"\nEach candidate has made decision that show the type of president they would be. When you examine the truly important decisions Mike Huckabee made in his life, you see a man who is well-prepared to be a great leader for our country.\nWhen Huckabee became Governor, Arkansas had an onerous car registration process that required many people to take a day off from work to register their cars. Governor Huckabee streamlined the process so people could renew their registrations online. That means nothing to those of us who don't live in Arkansas, but that's why it matters. When Mike Huckabee became Governor, his goal wasn't to grandstand so he could impress future Iowa Caucus voters. Governor Huckabee decided to be a servant to the people of his state rather than using his office as nothing more than a means to climb the political ladder..\nWe need someone who will serve the people of this nation, not just their own agenda. Aren't you tired of politicians who look at people suffering, losing their jobs, losing their homes, and say, \"Never let a good crisis go to waste\"? That's how the Obama Administration made a pork-laden stimulus bill that paid off big contributors as its first major \"accomplishment.\"\nIn a similar way, politicians in both parties have refused to secure the border. Instead, they insist Congress pass an amnesty bill that promises to secure the border eventually. Americans are being killed by criminals who entered this country illegally while politicians continue to play games with the lives and safety of the American people.\nMike Huckabee believes the safety and security our country isn't a bargaining chip, it is the first responsibility of the President of the United States. The President already has the tools to secure the border. Within one year of taking office, Mike Huckabee would get the job done.\nOur veterans continue to suffer at the hands of the incompetent VA with waiting lists that go on for months, with many veterans dying while waiting for care. The veterans' problems are barely talked about on the Presidential campaign trail. Why? They may have served our country honorably and been promised care, but they don't have $100 million to give to a Super PAC.\nTo Mike Huckabee, their care is a top priority. They've served us and we owe them the best. Using his experience from governing Arkansas and reforming bureaucracy, he'll reform the VA and end the crisis of long wait times.\nAs a result of the choice to use his office to serve, Governor Huckabee earned the respect of the people of Arkansas. He won four straight statewide elections, which was unprecedented for a Republican. At the same time, ninety percent of his legislative agenda was enacted including education reform, the first broad-based tax cuts, and a partial birth abortion plan. He did this with an overwhelmingly Democratic legislature. Many candidates promise to fight for legislation, but Governor Huckabee has a record of actually winning.\nIn 2008, American conservatives panicked in the midst of the financial crisis. It was hard to find a fiscal conservative who believed consistently in small government. Most of Congress believed only big government could save America's most powerful corporations from going under. President Bush said at the time, \"I've abandoned free market principles to save the free market.\"\nIn contrast, respectfully but forcefully, Mike Huckabee stood against the betrayals of conservative principles that were so readily made during that crisis. Governor Huckabee made a decision to stand for principle rather than to panic. Long before Rick Santelli made his famous rant on CNBC in February 2009 that keyed the start of the Tea Party movement, Governor Huckabee was standing firm against the heavy hand of big government intervention to \"save our economy\" from the free market.\nIt's easy to be conservative in good times at a conservative conference or in a town hall meeting. It's a crisis that tests your dedication to principle. Presidents are elected for the crisis, and Mike Huckabee has shown he will not lose his head or his principles when times are tough.\nGovernor Huckabee came of age in a time when the South was coming to terms with integration. Mike Huckabee chose time and time again to be a leader in bringing about unity and racial reconciliation. He helped integrate his high school. Then as a young pastor of a small church, he welcomed the church's first Black member. When dealing with a few members who didn't like it, he said, \"If he goes, I go.\" His efforts to serve, reach, and bring healing was reflected in his 1998 re-election bid when he won nearly half of the Black vote in his state.\nDuring the last eight years, we've had a President who promised to bring us together, but he has instead torn us apart and stoked the fires of racial hatred and division and set race relations back decades in order to help his political fortunes. Mike Huckabee has had a focus throughout his life and career in bringing healing and reconciliation and as a president will work to heal the damage done by this administration.\nGovernor Huckabee has many great skills that even those who don't agree with him recognize. He's a great public speaker with an ability to emotionally connect with people, and he has more than a decade of executive experience. If he had a huge campaign budget, he'd be unstoppable. And he had a chance for that. Three different billionaires offered to support him through their own contributions and through people they could raise money from. But they wanted him to stop talking about the sanctity of human life and the sanctity of marriage. He refused, and the billionaires chose to endorse other candidates.\nIt's a decision that shows that, if president, Mike Huckabee will be a leader on the issues of life and marriage. The most powerful tool a President has is the bully pulpit, the ability a President has to use the power of his office to advocate for great values and ideas. Mike Huckabee has shown he would use that power well and faithfully. He has shown the willingness to stand up and advocate for traditional values at locations as unfriendly as the View and the Daily Show with Jon Stewart. If you're only willing to advocate for traditional values before a friendly audience, that's not leadership, it's pandering.\nWe can't afford another person in the White House whose looking out for the interests of well-connected special interests. We need a President who cannot be bought, whose interest is doing the right thing for the American people rather than big donors who are looking for a big payoff.\nMany people who had come to him urging him to run and promised to support him didn't. They were disappointed by the money he hadn't raised, money he could have raised by selling out his principles. The media and the establishment has counted him out. He could have chosen to pack it in, to call it a campaign, and he could have spent two weeks lounging around at his lovely Florida home before restarting his media and public speaking career.\nGovernor Huckabee's made of sterner stuff than that. He chose to endure. He didn't retire from the race, he hit the ground running with 150 events in the month of January in the freezing weather of Iowa. The political insiders and establishment believe in the power of big money and big endorsements to win the day. He's chosen to trust the people of Iowa. He believes on Caucus Night, people will cut through all of the hype and all of the clever packaging. He believes, when people Caucus, they will vote based on hope rather than fear, and they'll think who they can trust with the high responsibility of righting our country after the disastrous age of Obama.\nSome candidates are trusting in massive campaign contributors and a phalanx of well-healed consultants. Governor Huckabee still believes ordinary citizens working hard for what they believe in can do extraordinary things.\nRonald Reagan called America \"a shining city on a Hill,\" and it should be our goal to make it that again. In his Farewell Address, he explained what he meant. \"It was a tall, proud city built on rocks stronger than oceans, windswept, God-blessed, and teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace; a city with free ports that hummed with commerce and creativity,\" and it speaks to our highest hopes and aspirations for America. The question Iowa must answer is, \"Who can lead America back to being that sort of city?\"\nDecisions are not only powerful for individuals but parties and states. Eight years ago, the other party held a Caucus and were presented with a lot of promised by a young inexperienced Senator named Barack Obama. He had a big ego and made big promises he couldn't keep but managed to inspire a fan base so fanatical it was more suited to Comic Con than in the political life of a free people. The result has been eight of the most divisive and damaging years in American history. They made a decision that has helped to make America into a gloomier, angrier, and less free nation.\nNow, eight years later, Republicans have a choice, and it will help make the future of our nation. If Iowa decides for Mike Huckabee, it will decide America needs a proven statesman who will lead our country towards liberty, respect for the inherent worth of every person, and the rule of law, and away from the hatred, anger, lawlessness, and division stirred up by power-hungry demagogues over the past eight years.\nRemember, the decision you make will help make the future of our nation.\nThis column originally posted to the popular Iowa based blog Caffeinated Thoughts.", "timestamp": "2016-01-29", "title": "Press Release - A Closing Argument for Mike Huckabee"}

Today—nearly 10 months and 160,000 miles of travel later—our campaign has come full circle: America's first voters are about to begin electing our next president. From the very beginning, I wanted this campaign to be a little different. So instead of kicking things off with a big speech, we headed out to talk directly with people—in coffee shops, at churches, in backyards, at community colleges, and yes, at a Chipotle in Maumee, Ohio.\nFrom our very first trip to Iowa of this campaign—listening to Bryce Smith talk about his bowling alley and his student loans. I recently made good on my promise to come visit!\nWhat I heard in those early days—and every day since—has stuck with me. People have shared their hopes and their worries. But even as they talked about the challenges their families, businesses, schools, and communities are facing, there was a sense of positive possibility.\nA memorable moment at Rancho High School in Nevada: sitting down with a group of young people who are DREAMers in more than name alone.\nThose conversations have informed me and helped shape this campaign. They've made me a better candidate. And I believe that, thanks to everyone I've met, I will be a better president—someone who truly understands what we need to do to give our kids and grandkids a better future.\nKiki's Chicken and Waffles in Columbia, South Carolina. Kiki had a hard time getting her business up and running, but she stuck it out—and today, it's thriving.\nWhen I started running for president, I didn't know that some of the issues I've been talking about would end up front and center in my campaign. I knew I'd present my vision for where our economy should be in the 21st century. I knew we'd talk about national security, about how we can build on and improve the Affordable Care Act, and about my proposals to support small businesses, raise wages, and create good-paying jobs.\nAt the VFW Historic Post 9211 in Reno, Nevada.\nThen there were the issues that simply came up again and again—like substance abuse, the rising cost of prescription drugs, and the struggle to care for loved ones who are aging or have disabilities.\nAnd of course, some topics have come into even sharper focus over the past few months: the threat of global terror, the need to take action on gun violence, attacks on reproductive health and rights, the epidemic of violence facing the transgender community, the need to take on systemic racism and stand up to bullies, the crisis in Flint. Everywhere I've been, I've learned more about the concerns that keep families up at night—and what we need to do to solve them.\nA moment of reflection and community with faith leaders at Mother Bethel African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church in Philadelphia.\nOn my very first trip to New Hampshire, the subject of addiction came up—and it kept coming up, wherever I went. I met a grandmother who is raising her grandchild, because her own daughter is struggling with substance abuse and can't be the parent she should be. I've listened to moms and dads who have lost their children to addiction, and I've heard from doctors and counselors who are doing everything they can to save lives. As one woman told me at a discussion in Keene, \"We're not bad people trying to get good; we're sick people that deserve to get well.\" Those words have stuck with me.\nI've heard from people who work full time as caregivers but struggle to afford care for their own children and parents. A woman named Lulu told me that she has spent 42 years doing this backbreaking work, and people constantly ask why she doesn't just quit. She says she wouldn't dream of it—she cares too much for her clients, some of whom live alone and have no other help or companionship.\nCaregivers from around the country shared their stories at a roundtable in Los Angeles.\nKeith in New Hampshire told me about his 84-year-old mother who has Alzheimer's. She can't be left alone, and he can't afford adult day care for her—so he brings her to work with him every day.\nAnd on one heartbreaking day in Chicago, I sat down with a group of mothers who belong to a club that no parent ever wants to join: All have suffered the loss of a child to gun violence, some at the hands of police, others at the hands of gangs, random shootings, or other senseless violence that stalks too many of our young men and women. As they handed me pictures of their beloved children, they talked about turning their grief into national action that could spare other families the pain they've endured. After I left, I learned that as we spoke, a 9-year-old boy was shot and killed just miles away.\nI met a woman in Iowa named Bethany, a single mother of three. She is determined to create a better life for her family, and so she's juggling a job, raising her kids, and finishing a degree at the local community college. She doesn't expect anything to come easy, but she did ask me what we could do so that things wouldn't be so hard.\nThe answer is, there's a lot we can do—if we work together. I've said many times that I'm running for president to deal with the big problems, but also the problems that often go overlooked in politics. That's why, in addition to a broad economic plan to raise incomes for middle-class Americans, I've introduced specific proposals for creating debt-free public college tuition, preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease, supporting families affected by autism, lowering the cost of prescription drugs, and curbing the substance abuse epidemic.\nTexas has been a special place for me ever since I registered voters in San Antonio and the Rio Grande Valley. It was fitting to return to the community, and it was such a warm welcome.\nThe past 10 months have been inspiring and eye opening, to say the least. We have had rallies with thousands of voters and quiet moments of reflection.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118058", "text": "\"It is fitting that with the very first bill I sign...we are upholding one of this nation's first principles: that we are all created equal and each deserve a chance to pursue our own version of happiness.\" - President Barack Obama, January 29, 2009\nSeven years ago today, President Obama signed into law his first piece of legislation as President, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. Policies that ensure fair pay for all Americans and that help businesses to attract the strongest talent can not only narrow the pay gap, but also boost productivity and benefit our economy. Yet today, the median wage of a woman working full-time year-round in the United States is about $39,600—only 79 percent of a man's median earnings of $50,400. While the gap has narrowed slightly over the past two years, there is much more work to be done to ensure fair pay for all.\nToday, the President is highlighting several additional actions that his Administration is taking to further advance equal pay for all workers and to further empower working families:\n• EEOC Action on Pay Data Collection: The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), in partnership with the Department of Labor, is publishing a proposal to annually collect summary pay data by gender, race, and ethnicity from businesses with 100 or more employees. The proposal would cover over 63 million employees. This step - stemming from a recommendation of the President's Equal Pay Task Force and a Presidential Memorandum issued in April 2014 - will help focus public enforcement of our equal pay laws and provide better insight into discriminatory pay practices across industries and occupations. It expands on and replaces an earlier plan by the Department of Labor to collect similar information from federal contractors.\n• Call to action: The President is renewing his call to Congress to take up and pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, commonsense legislation that would give women additional tools to fight pay discrimination. States are increasingly taking action to fight pay discrimination, such as California and New York which passed equal pay laws last year and a number of states that will see legislation introduced this year. The President urges states—and employers—to take action to advance pay equality.\n• White House Report: The Council of Economic Advisers is releasing an issue brief, \"The Gender Pay Gap on the Anniversary of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act,\" that explores the state of the gender wage gap, the factors that influence it, and policies put forward by this Administration that can help address it. The brief highlights that the U.S. gender wage gap is now 2.5 percentage points larger than the average for industrialized countries. It also points to significant progress made since 2000 by the United Kingdom to reduce their pay gap by almost 9 percentage points and by Japan, Belgium, Ireland, and Denmark to reduce each of theirs by around 7 percentage points.\n• 2016 White House Summit: The White House will host a Summit on \"The United State of Women\" on May 23rd together with the Department of State, the Department of Labor, the Aspen Institute, and Civic Nation. The summit, which comes nearly two years after the first-ever White House Summit on Working Families, will create an opportunity to mark the progress made on behalf of women and girls domestically and internationally over the course of this Administration and to discuss solutions to the challenges they still face. The Summit is being held with additional cooperation from Goldman Sachs 10,000 Women, the Tory Burch Foundation and the Ford Foundation.\nBACKGROUND\nThe Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, named after a woman who discovered her employer was paying her less than men doing the same job, has made it easier for working Americans to effectively challenge illegal unequal pay. Ledbetter took her pay discrimination complaint all the way to the Supreme Court, which ruled in 2007 that claims like hers had to be filed within 180 days of an employer's decision to pay a worker less—even if she did not learn about the unfair pay until years after the discrimination began. To make sure that people can effectively challenge unequal pay, the law signed by President Obama shortly after taking office amended the Civil Rights Act of 1964 so that unfair pay complaints can be filed within 180 days of a discriminatory paycheck—and that 180 days resets after every such paycheck is issued.\nSince his first day in office, President Obama has worked to create more equality in the workplace through a number of steps. In April 2014, to celebrate Equal Pay Day, he signed  two executive actions to recognize the full equality of women and increase equity for all in the workplace. The first was an  Executive Order prohibiting federal contractors from discriminating against employees who discuss their compensation. The second was a  Presidential Memorandum instructing the Secretary of Labor to propose a new regulation requiring federal contractors to submit summary data on compensation paid to their employees, including by race and gender.\nEXPANDING THE COLLECTION OF PAY DATA\nToday, the EEOC is proposing revisions to its longstanding EEO-1 form to require all employers with 100 or more employees, not just contractors, who currently submit the EEO-1 to submit additional summary data on wages paid to their employees, including by gender, race, and ethnicity. As currently proposed, this information would be reported across 10 job categories and by 12 pay bands, and will not require the reporting of specific salaries of each individual employee. The proposal is broader than one previously published by the Department of Labor, which would have applied only to federal contractors.\nThis new policy lays important groundwork for progress toward achieving equal pay, as it will encourage and facilitate greater voluntary compliance by employers with existing federal pay laws - such as by evaluating how they are currently paying their employees. It will also assist the EEOC, and in the case of contractors the Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP), in better focusing investigations on employers that are unlawfully shortchanging workers based on their gender, race, or ethnicity. In addition to expanding the scope of the data collection, the new approach will utilize an existing data collection mechanism familiar to most businesses, as many commenters had proposed. In so doing, the proposed revisions have the potential to lower the compliance burden on businesses and the implementation costs to government. Under the proposal, employers would first submit pay data as of the September 30, 2017 EEO-1 filing deadline.\nToday's publication of a proposed revision to the EEO-1 form comes after the EEOC approved this action by a vote of the Commission, and it will follow the normal procedures and public comment process required under the Paperwork Reduction Act before it can be implemented. Anyone who wants to comment on the proposal will have 60 days after publication in the Federal Register to do so, with additional information on the EEOC's website. The EEOC is an independent government agency established in 1965 to give life to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act; today it enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, and genetic information.\nWHITE HOUSE SUMMIT: THE UNITED STATE OF WOMEN\nThe White House Council on Women and Girls, together with the Department of State, the Department of Labor, the Aspen Institute and Civic Nation, is announcing The White House Summit on the United State of Women, with the theme \"Today, we change tomorrow\" which will take place at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in Washington, DC on May 23, 2016. From the launch of the Let Girls Learn initiative to help adolescent girls worldwide attend school, to nationwide efforts to prevent campus sexual assault through the \"It's on Us\" campaign, to policies and programs to help workplaces better support working families, advancing equality for all women and girls has been at the forefront of this President's agenda.\nThis Summit will be a moment to mark the significant progress we made on behalf of women and girls both domestically and internationally over the course of the Administration, and will also offer an opportunity to discuss solutions to the challenges they still face. The White House Summit on the United State of Women will bring together a diverse group of business leaders, academics, activists, nonprofit leaders, elected officials and others and will focus in on six key areas that impact women and girls: (1) Educational Opportunity, (2) Health and Wellness, (3) Economic Prosperity, (4) Violence Against Women, (5) Civic Engagement, Leadership and Visibility, and (6) Entrepreneurship and Innovation.\nTogether with our co-hosts, we seek to address these critical issues, and bring together people from all backgrounds to learn from each other. The Summit is being held with additional cooperation from Goldman Sachs 10,000 Women, the Tory Burch Foundation and the Ford Foundation.

Since the creation of the Equal Pay Task Force in 2010, the EEOC has received tens of thousands of charges of pay discrimination, and through enforcement efforts, the EEOC has obtained over $85 million in monetary relief for victims of sex-based wage discrimination. The Task Force has issued reports on its progress, including  Fighting for Equal Pay in the Workforce, Keeping America's Women Moving Forward, and  Fifty Years After the Equal Pay Act.\n• Calling on Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, commonsense legislation that would strengthen the Equal Pay Act of 1963 by closing loopholes in the defenses for equal pay violations, providing stronger remedies, and expanding protections against discrimination for employees who share or inquire about information about their compensation at work.\n• Signing a Presidential Memorandum in May 2013 directing the Office of Personnel Management to  develop a government-wide strategy to address the gender pay gap in the federal workforce, leading to a  report in April 2014 and new  guidance in July 2015—which cautioned against required reliance on a candidate's existing salary to set pay, as it can potentially adversely affect women who may have taken time off from their careers or propagate gaps due to discriminatory pay practices by previous employers.\n• Issuing an Executive Order in April 2014 and publishing a Department of Labor rule in September 2015 prohibiting federal contractors from discriminating against employees who  discuss or inquire about their compensation.\n• Hosting the first-ever  White House Summit on Working Families in June 2014, highlighting the issues that women and families face, setting the agenda for a 21st century workplace, and announcing of a number of steps to help working families thrive.\n• Signing a Presidential Memorandum in January 2015 directing federal agencies to advance six weeks of  paid sick leave to federal employees with new children, calling on Congress to grant another six weeks of paid leave for federal employees, and calling on Congress to pass legislation that gives all American families access to paid family and medical leave.\n• Issuing an Executive Order in September 2015 requiring federal contractors to provide employees working on federal contracts up to seven  paid sick days each year—and urging Congress, states, cities, and other businesses to do the same.\n• Publishing a proposed Department of Labor rule in June 2015 updating outdated  overtime regulations, which, if finalized, would expand overtime pay protections for nearly 5 million Americans, promoting higher take home pay, and allowing workers to better balance their work and family obligations.\n• Issuing an Executive Order in February 2014 requiring federal contractors to raise their  minimum wage to $10.10 an hour and lift the tipped minimum wage (which disproportionately impacts women)—and urging Congress, states, cities, and businesses to do the same.\n• Issuing an Executive Order in July 2014 and publishing a Department of Labor rule in December 2014 prohibiting federal contractors from discriminating in employment on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.\n• Directing the Office of Personnel Management and federal agencies to enhance  workplace flexibility for federal employees to the maximum extent practicable, including enshrining a right to request flexible work arrangements.\n• Calling on Congress to pass the  Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which would require employers to make reasonable accommodations to workers who have limitations from pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions (unless it would impose an undue hardship on the employer). The legislation would also prohibit employers from forcing pregnant employees to take paid or unpaid leave if a reasonable accommodation would allow them to work.\n• Publishing a proposed Department of Labor rule that, if finalized, would update its sex discrimination guidelines for federal contractors for the first time since 1978, to align with current law and address barriers to equal opportunity and pay, such as pay discrimination, sexual harassment, hostile work environments, a lack of workplace accommodations for pregnant women, and gender identity and family caregiving discrimination.\n• Increasing investments to expand access to high-quality early care and education, including efforts under the  Race to the Top-Early Learning Challenge program,  Preschool Development Grants, Head Start and Early Head Start, and a  landmark proposal that helps all eligible working families with young children afford high-quality child care.\n• Expanding access for women to higher-paying jobs through a proposed rule updating equal employment opportunity requirements in registered apprenticeships and through a Mega-Construction Projects (MCP) Initiative at the Department of Labor.\nAdditionally, the President's Council of Economic Advisers has continued to spotlight the pay gap and other challenges women face in the workforce as well as policy solutions proposed by the Administration to address these persistent challenges.

One of my favorites, the outstanding Billie Jean King is in the house. And of course, Lilly Ledbetter is here. Lilly has just become a dear friend to our family, and I can tell you that she's beloved not just by us, but by all the staff that work with her. She's just terrific.

Today, women account for almost half of the workforce. But the typical woman who works full time still earns 79 cents for every dollar that the typical man does. The gap is even wider for women of color. The typical Black working woman makes only 60 cents. The typical Latino woman makes only 55 cents for every dollar a White man earns. And that's not right. We're talking about oftentimes folks doing the same job and being paid differently.

At a time when women are increasingly the breadwinners in our households, paying them less makes it harder for families to cover the necessities like childcare or health care, just to pay the bills. It makes it harder for a family to save, harder for families to retire. It means local businesses have customers with less money to spend. So it's not good for our communities. It's not good for our families. It's not good for our businesses. What kind of example does paying women less set for our sons and daughters?\nSo today we're taking one more step in the right direction. We are proposing to collect and report pay data by race, ethnicity, and gender from businesses with 100 employees or more. And the goal is to help businesses that are trying to do the right thing, like the ones here today, to get a clearer picture of how they can ensure their employees are being treated equally. A better picture of the data will also help us do a better job enforcing existing equal pay laws.\nNow, this won't solve every problem. We've still got to get more women and girls into high-paying fields like science and technology, engineering and math. We've still got to make sure that women are not penalized or held back in the workplace simply for starting a family. Guys, we're responsible for the family thing too. [Laughter] And they're already doing more work than we are in getting that thing going. They shouldn't be penalized twice or three times. [Laughter] We still need to raise the minimum wage, guarantee sick—[applause]—guaranteed paid sick and family leave, fully protecting pregnant workers, finally passing the Paycheck Fairness Act to give workers more tools to fight pay discrimination.\nAnd all of us have to make sure that all of our young girls know that we're invested in their success. And by the way, I do want to emphasize there are businesses that are doing the right thing. We've got a good friend of ours, Marc Benioff, CEO of salesforce.com, which is consistently shown as one of the companies people most like to work for. And part of the reason is, is that Marc understands that his company thrives when he is drawing from the entire pool of talent out there and making sure that everybody is having a chance to thrive and succeed at his company. And when people see that, they're working harder and more productive and more enthusiastic. And ultimately, they make more money.\nSo this is not an either-or proposition, this is a win-win situation proposition if we think about it in the right way. That's part of what Billie Jean taught us so many years ago. I mean, those of you who are tennis fans, let's face it, a lot of times the women's tournaments are more interesting than men's. [Laughter]And the notion that somehow we would be keeping my daughters or Marc's daughters or any of your daughters out of opportunity, not allowing them to thrive in every field, not letting them fully participate in every human endeavor, that's counterproductive. That's not how we're going to build a great future for our country.\nSo that's why, this May, the White House Council on Women and Girls will lead a day focused on women in America and around the world. And we're going to bring people from all across the country to examine the progress that we've made and the work that remains to give every woman and girl in this country a fair shot at success. And we're going to keep pushing until every single girl has the rights and the opportunities and the freedom to go as far as her dreams will take her.\nThis will be a long haul. One of the things that I am consistently reminding young people when they're working here in the White House is that social change never happens overnight. It is a slog. And there are times where you just have to chip away and chip away, and then suddenly, there may be some breakthroughs. But it's reliant on all of us to keep pushing that boulder up the hill, to just be steady and persistent and understand that the work that we do today is ultimately going to lead to a better future tomorrow.\nAnd we will not see necessarily all the fruits of that labor. The same way that Lilly described her endeavors—when she lost that court case, she could have given up, but she didn't. And that spirit is what all of us have to adopt. That's the spirit that built America. That's the spirit that opened up opportunity for so many more people than a generation ago. And that's the spirit that I intend to keep pushing as long as I have the privilege to be in this office. All right?\nThank you, everybody.", "timestamp": "2016-01-29", "title": "Remarks Commemorating the Seventh Anniversary of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act"}

Though usually preventable, heart disease can manifest itself in sudden and unforeseen ways, and it costs our Nation hundreds of billions of dollars annually. During American Heart Month, we remember those we have lost to this devastating disease, promote healthy lifestyles that mitigate its impacts, and pledge to continue our fight against it.\nHeart disease must be addressed with urgency. Every person can take steps to reduce the risk factors associated with heart disease in themselves and in those they care about—whether as parents, caretakers, or friends—by encouraging healthy eating, physical activity, and by discouraging the use of tobacco. Almost half of all Americans face increased risk of heart disease for reasons that include being a smoker, having high blood pressure, or having high cholesterol. You can reduce your chances of developing heart disease by reducing alcohol intake, exercising regularly, maintaining a nutritious diet, living tobacco-free, and staying aware of early warning signs. For more resources and information, visit www.CDC.gov/HeartDisease.\nTesting cholesterol levels for individuals particularly vulnerable to heart disease and checking blood pressure regularly are both critical preventive measures for detecting heart disease early on, and thanks to the Affordable Care Act, tens of millions of Americans now have access to recommended preventive services for free. First Lady Michelle Obama's Let's Move! initiative is working to reduce obesity—another primary contributing factor to cardiovascular issues—among children to offset their susceptibility to heart disease and other obesity-related health problems. Additionally, my Administration launched Million Hearts 5 years ago, a national initiative aimed at preventing 1 million heart attacks and strokes by 2017. Moving forward, we will continue to invest in research that helps target medical treatments and gives all of us access to the personalized information we need to keep ourselves and our families healthy.\nMichelle and I encourage everyone to participate in National Wear Red Day on Friday, February 5, by wearing red in honor of those we have lost to heart disease and to raise awareness of this devastating disease and the steps we can all take to prevent it. Every 43 seconds, someone in the United States suffers a heart attack, and many of them are fatal. Combating heart disease is imperative for improving public health in America, and together, we can work to ensure everybody knows its signs and symptoms and can access needed care. This month, let us renew our efforts to raise awareness of this disease and its consequences, and let us recommit to building a healthier, heartier future for all.\nIn acknowledgment of the importance of the ongoing fight against cardiovascular disease, the Congress, by Joint Resolution approved December 30, 1963, as amended (77 Stat. 843; 36 U.S.C. 101), has requested that the President issue an annual proclamation designating February as \"American Heart Month.\" Now, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim February 2016 as American Heart Month, and I invite all Americans to participate in National Wear Red Day on February 5, 2016. I also invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, officials of other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and the American people to join me in recognizing and reaffirming our commitment to fighting cardiovascular disease.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-01-29", "title": "Proclamation 9391—American Heart Month, 2016"}

For too long, our most basic liberties had been denied to African Americans, and today, we pay tribute to countless good-hearted citizens—along the Underground Railroad, aboard a bus in Alabama, and all across our country—who stood up and sat in to help right the wrongs of our past and extend the promise of America to all our people. During National African American History Month, we recognize these champions of justice and the sacrifices they made to bring us to this point, we honor the contributions of African Americans since our country's beginning, and we recommit to reaching for a day when no person is judged by anything but the content of their character.\nFrom the Revolutionary War through the abolitionist movement, to marches from Selma to Montgomery and across America today, African Americans have remained devoted to the proposition that all of us are created equal, even when their own rights were denied. As we rejoice in the victories won by men and women who believed in the idea of a just and fair America, we remember that, throughout history, our success has been driven by bold individuals who were willing to speak out and change the status quo.\nRefusing to accept our Nation's original sin, African Americans bound by the chains of slavery broke free and headed North, and many others who knew slavery was antithetical to our country's conception of human rights and dignity fought to bring their moral imagination to life. When Jim Crow mocked the advances made by the 13th Amendment, a new generation of men and women galvanized and organized with the same force of faith as their enslaved ancestors. Our Nation's young people still echo the call for equality, bringing attention to disparities that continue to plague our society in ways that mirror the non-violent tactics of the civil rights movement while adapting to modern times. Let us also not forget those who made the ultimate sacrifice so that we could make our voices heard by exercising our right to vote. Even in the face of legal challenges, every eligible voter should not take for granted what is our right to shape our democracy.\nWe have made great progress on the journey toward ensuring our ideals ring true for all people. Today, African American high school graduation and college enrollment rates are at an all-time high. The African-American unemployment rate has been halved since its Great Recession peak. More than 2 million African Americans gained health insurance thanks to the Affordable Care Act. The incarceration rates for African-American men and women fell during each year of this Administration and are at their lowest points in over two decades. Yet challenges persist and obstacles still stand in the way of becoming the country envisioned at our founding, and we would do a disservice to all who came before us if we remained blind to the way past injustices shape the present. The United States is home to 5 percent of the world's population, but 25 percent of the world's prisoners—a disproportionate number of whom are African American—so we must find ways to reform our criminal justice system and ensure that it is fairer and more effective. While we've seen unemployment rates decrease, many communities, particularly those of color, continue to experience significant gaps in educational and employment opportunities, causing too many young men and women to feel like no matter how hard they try, they may never achieve their dreams.\nOur responsibility as citizens is to address the inequalities and injustices that linger, and we must secure our birthright freedoms for all people. As we mark the 40th year of National African American History Month, let us reflect on the sacrifices and contributions made by generations of African Americans, and let us resolve to continue our march toward a day when every person knows the unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 2016 as National African American History Month. I call upon public officials, educators, librarians, and all the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-01-29", "title": "Proclamation 9392—National African American History Month, 2016"}

Perpetrated by a current or past intimate partner, dating violence takes many forms, including physical, sexual, or emotional abuse, and can occur in person or through electronic communication and social media. Violent dating relationships can lead to depression, anxiety, drug and alcohol use, and thoughts of suicide, and victims may continue to experience detrimental effects throughout their lives. During National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month, we recognize the urgency needed in addressing this problem and recommit to preventing it by educating our youth about its dangers and consequences, and reaffirm the basic human right to be free from violence and abuse.\nDating violence may include physical force, such as kicking, hitting, and shoving; emotional abuse, consistent monitoring, and isolation; or sexual assault. Dating violence can occur in any relationship, whether it is casual and short-term or long-term and monogamous, and any young person can experience dating violence or other unhealthy relationship behaviors—regardless of gender, race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or socioeconomic status. Approximately 1 in 10 teenagers reports being physically or sexually victimized by a dating partner, and too many other victims do not report it. The cycle of violence can begin with anyone at any time, and as a society, we must acknowledge that we each have a role to play in teaching children about healthy relationships. In their formative years, teens are influenced by their early relationships, and the example set by those around them can have lasting consequences.\nMy Administration is working diligently to address teen dating violence in a number of ways. Vice President Joe Biden's 1is2many initiative is strengthening efforts to reduce dating violence among those most vulnerable, particularly young women between the ages of 16 and 24, and is utilizing technology to engage students, teens, and young adults in this cause. To build on our efforts, I established the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault. The Task Force will, in addition to working to combat sexual violence on college campuses, explore ways its recommendations may apply to elementary and secondary schools across our country. My Administration will keep forging a future in which no teenager must suffer due to having an abusive partner.\nAll Americans have a role to play in ending dating violence and fostering safe, healthy environments for our young people. This month, let us seize our responsibility to set positive examples for our Nation's teenagers by celebrating and demonstrating healthy relationships, and let us recommit to ensuring all people who may be in an abusive relationship have access to help and support. Together, we can reach a day when no young person knows the pain caused by dating violence. If you or someone you know is involved in an abusive relationship of any kind, you can get immediate and confidential support by calling 1-866-331-9474, texting \"LoveIs\" to 22522, or visiting LoveIsRespect.org. For additional information and resources on dating violence, please visit VetoViolence.CDC.gov.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 2016 as National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month. I call upon all Americans to support efforts in their communities and schools, and in their own families, to empower young people to develop healthy relationships throughout their lives and to engage in activities that prevent and respond to teen dating violence.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-01-29", "title": "Proclamation 9393—National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month, 2016"}

It's through the American innovator. And that's what anything we do should be based upon.

Instead of adopting measures that will have little if any impact on our environment and make life in Florida more expensive, we need a strategy that encourages environmental conservation, fuel efficiency and energy diversity, while continuing to stimulate our economy.\nAs National Journal wrote in 2015, liberals in Florida actually attack Marco for killing attempts to implement a liberal cap-and-trade system in Florida:\nIn his second session, Rubio played hardball with Crist. Climate change was one of Crist's signature issues, and he wanted the Legislature to pass a bill that would lay the groundwork for a California-style cap-and-trade system to cut carbon emissions.

We are pleased to do it on March 3 before the Michigan primary provided the Clinton campaign will agree to Brooklyn, New York, on April 14. Why won't they debate in Brooklyn?

Before, Sanders spoke to the University of Iowa audience about income and wealth inequality, the planetary crisis of global warming, making public colleges and universities tuition-free and other issues.\nA new poll released on Saturday by The Des Moines Register and Bloomberg Politics showed Sanders' come-from-nowhere candidacy had turned into a too-close-to call contest with Hillary Clinton, once the pundits' presumptive nominee. The poll showed Clinton and Sanders in a virtual tie, a far cry from her 41-point lead when Sanders began his campaign eight months ago.\nEarlier Saturday, Sanders said his record was being distorted by Clinton's campaign. Speaking to a group of supporters in Charles City, Iowa, Sanders said he was disappointed in \"a lot of inaccurate statements regarding what I believe.\"\n\"The new poll results reflect the remarkable grassroots excitement and energy that are the driving force behind Bernie's campaign to fix a rigged economy and the corrupt campaign finance system that props it up,\" said Robert Becker, Sanders' Iowa campaign state director.\nA Clinton television ad insinuated, for example, that Sanders somehow had attacked Planned Parenthood when, in fact, he has a \"100 percent lifetime voting record for Planned Parenthood.\" He also said Clinton had tried to falsely brand him as a friend of the National Rifle Association when, in fact, he has a D-minus grade from the NRA. \"So don't tell me that I'm defending or protecting the gun lobby,\" he said.\n\"Those are inaccuracies, and we can do better than that. Secretary Clinton and I have differences of opinion. Let's debate those differences of opinion, but let's not go around distorting a record that I am very proud of.\"\nWatch Sen.

He noted that Gov. Terry Branstad advised earlier in the week for people to keep their eyes Huckabee as somebody who might post a surprise finish similar to an upset GOP Iowa caucus win he engineered in 2008….\"There is nobody who is a more astute observer of Iowa politics,\" said Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor who noted Branstad has never lost an election in Iowa and currently is the longest-serving U.S. governor in history….\"We're going to prove that he is not only a great politician, but he is a prophet of biblical proportions,\" Huckabee said at the start of his \"super Saturday\" of campaigning activities that included a visit to a shooting range to \"get out a little frustration.\" It was his second campaign stop at the Johnston gun shop….Huckabee has been \"all in\" in Iowa, where he has visited all 99 counties -- some more than once -- after he began the final month of campaigning leading up to the Feb. 1 caucuses with the expectation he would have to end among Iowa's top three finishers to stay in the race for the 2016 GOP nomination…..\"Folks, we've got a lot of work to do, a short time to do it,\" he told his supporters Saturday, \"let's shock the world on Monday night. Let's come out with a big surprise victory.\"….Huckabee later told reporters he has to be \"up in the top of the cluster\" but he said expectations are \"sky high\" for some of the other GOP frontrunners, which may make them more vulnerable in Monday's caucus outcome…..\"If they don't end up winning, people are going to say 'maybe there was just more air that there was juice,' so that's an issue for them,\" he said…..\"For me, we've got to exceed the expectations. I think we have a real opportunity to be a contender on Monday night. We could win. It's not inconceivable at all that a person that nobody is picking to be in the top two or three ends up winning the Iowa caucuses,\" he added. \"We've put most of our resources and investments here in Iowa. I believe we have a shot to pull this off.\"\n\"Huckabee note to daughter draws tears\", Des Moines Register—...Mike Huckabee brought tears to the eyes of his daughter Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Saturday with a note he penned on a paper shooting target. \"To Sarah — my little girl — and always a straight shooter — she hits the bullseye of her Daddy's heart!\" Sanders, who is her father's campaign manager, wiped tears from eyes as she read the note. \"I didn't expect to come to the shooting range and cry,\" she said to no one in particular. Huckabee, his wife Janet, and about a dozen campaign staffers and friends spent about 45 minutes Saturday afternoon shooting targets at CrossRoads Shooting Sports in Johnston. The range has been a popular place for Republican presidential candidates to visit.\nHuckabee: 'The people of Iowa know me' Des Moines Register—...While many candidates running for president crisscrossed Iowa Saturday, Mike Huckabee met with volunteers, did media interviews and spent more than an hour at a Johnston shooting range….\"We've already been to the far corners of the state and to every county,\" Huckabee told The Des Moines Register Saturday afternoon. The media interviews will \"reach more people than we would have reached if we had gone back to places we were two weeks ago.\" Huckabee has spent 73 days in Iowa since May when he announced his bid for the Republican presidential nomination. The former Arkansas governor on the 2008 Iowa caucuses, garnering nearly 41,000 votes, the most ever for a Republican. Huckabee has been back to the state every year since 2008, he said. \"The people of Iowa know me — I've kept coming back here and I've been in their homes on weekends,\" said Huckabee, who for several years hosted a show on Fox News. \"They don't know some of these other guys ... and they're starting to have questions.\" Huckabee on Sunday afternoon will host a town hall gathering with Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley; Sunday evening the campaign is hosting an exclusive showing of the yet-to-be released moving \"God is Not Dead 2.\" Demand for the free tickets prompted the campaign to rent a second theater, Huckabee said….Earlier Saturday, Huckabee meet with campaign volunteers, several from out of state. One was Gil Buenrostro, who vowed in 2008 to do whatever he could to help Huckabee become president if he ever ran again for the office… Buenrostro has a wedge-shaped red, white and blue vinyl banner that reads \"Mike Huckabee For President 2016\" on the top of his green-gray Volkswagon Passat. Buenrostro, of Clearwater, Fla., has been driving around the country with the nearly 3-foot tall sign on his vehicle since spring...He estimates he's put about 30,000 miles on his Passat, which is missing the \"A\" and \"T\" from the vehicle name above the rear bumper. On Saturday, Buenrostro and his wife Jeanette were at Huckabee's Iowa headquarters in Urbandale….\"People stop us a lot,\" Buenrostro said. \"I hardly ever find anyone who doesn't like the governor. So when the media says he's not on top, I find it hard to believe.\"...\"One of the things I always remind people — at least the East Coast media — is that people never pick exactly what is going to happen,\" Huckabee told supporters. \"They get it wrong every four years. And folks, we are not just hanging on, we're fighting to the end…..\"I want you to believe there is a real possibility for a stunning upset and it's just not me saying that. Gov. Terry Branstad said the person who might surprise people is Mike Huckabee,\" the candidate said as the room erupted in applause and whistles.\nHuckabee Keeps the Faith as Iowa Caucuses Near—Time Magazine….Mike Huckabee may be feeling like a zombie, but he's still got some fight left in him. At least that was the message from the former Arkansas Governor during a meeting with supporters Saturday morning at his campaign headquarters in Urbandale, Iowa...Huckabee began the day with a story, with his three-year-old granddaughter clinging to his side in an oversized campaign T-shirt…...\"Thursday night we were up very late because we had a lot of late interviews after the debate and then the veterans rally, and got about three hours of sleep yesterday,\" he said. \"But we had appearances all day long, and by the end of the day the three guys traveling with me we were all like zombies by about 5 o clock. … By the time we started wrapping things up, it was truly we were thinking we should inject high-octane coffee in our veins. And it was the night that we had committed that we would keep our granddaughter Scarlett. So we took her to dinner late last night and then we took her home, thinking that she was as tired as we were. Wrong.\"…..The crowd chuckled and Huckabee wound up for his punchline: \"Finally, she was sleepy,\" he said. \"And by then, we were dead.\"….But exhausted as he is, Huckabee maintains a relentless optimism about his prospects Monday night, at least in front of volunteers and members of the media. \"People never pick exactly what's going to happen,\" he said of Iowa polls. \"They get it wrong every four years. And folks, we are not just hanging on, we are fighting to the end. And I want you to believe that there is a real possibility for a stunning upset.\"….Huckabee supporters and strategists alike seem to share his vision. Linda Bauer-Lohmeier was sitting eagerly in the front row, and could barely contain her excitement when Huckabee walked in. She sprang up to hug him and as he walked away she said, almost to herself, \"He's my rock star.\"...Bauer-Lohmeier, 59, grew up in Arkansas and now lives in Peoria. She said she used to schedule her evenings so she could be home to see Huckabee on Fox, and that she supported him in 2008, as well….\"I think [Huckabee] hasn't gotten as much publicity, but things like this help a lot. I'm expecting him to do well. He did well last time, and I think people will get wise and realize we need a strong person that's not a show person.\" Pat Harris, 62, is another die-hard Huckabee fan who was with him on the trail in 2008. But her loyalty runs even deeper: she's also his sister. \"At this point, familiar,\" she joked, when asked what it's like having a sibling run for president…...\"Everybody loves him. I think they're just so confused because there are so many candidates,\" Harris said of what she's seen in Iowa this year…..As for why her brother isn't getting nearly the traction in the state that he did in 2008, she said, \"I don't know. And that's honest. I don't get it. Because I can't find anybody that'll step up and say, Here's what's wrong with your brother. And people that don't know that I'm kin, or they do or whatever, they'll all say, Well I really like the Huckabee guy. Well are you going to caucus for him? Well I don't know,\" she said, imitating conversations she's had with voters….Still, she's hopeful about Monday night. \"They don't know who they're going to be for,\" she said of Iowans. \"So they may be for him.\"\nFANTASTIC Debate Answer=> Poverty: \"I know a little bit about poverty. My sister is here tonight. Both of us can tell you we both did not grow up rich. My mother grew up in a house—the oldest of seven kids. She had lived in a house that didn't have floors. Just dirt. No electricity. No running water. I resent it when people say, 'Oh, people are poor because they want to be.' No, they are not. Nobody wants be poor. And that's a stupid, foolish thing, mean thing to say. People are poor because they don't know how to get out of the hole. And government shouldn't push them back in the hole.\" => Iowa Manufacturing: \"The other day I was in Newton, Iowa. It used to be a vibrant place where Maytag washers and dryers were built...There was a guy in my forum that day who lost his job….Let me ask you, how many people do you think living around the Beltway know a guy like that, care about a guy like that?...People who live in bubbles of the New York world of high finance, the government world of Washington, and the entertainment world of Hollywood don't have a clue about how hard people out here in Iowa are working every single day.\" => Hello Iowa: \"This week there was a little dust-up about a video we put together with music of Adele. So I thought it would be appropriate for me to begin tonight by saying, 'Hello, Iowa. It's me!' You gave me the largest number of votes in the history of the Iowa caucuses eight years ago. I think you did it because you trusted me. You believed that I had your best interest at heart. When I was governor, I had a plaque in my office. And it said this, 'Come. Let us reason together.' I believe the next president needs to put that plaque in the Oval Office. And needs to lead this country by saying, 'Come. Let us reason together.'\n\"Parkersburg mayor backs Huckabee\" — Waterloo Cedar Falls Courier ... PARKERSBURG, Iowa - Parkersburg Mayor Perry Bernard announced Thursday he is endorsing Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee. \"It's time for our country to restore the United States and reject the divided states we have been moving towards,\" Bernard said in a statement. \"America needs Gov. Huckabee's moral clarity, executive leadership and conviction in the White House.\" Bernard continued that he shares the same values as Huckabee, and uses them to run the community of Parkersburg. \"As president, I'll lead America with conviction, common-sense and moral clarity, and I'm excited to have Mayor Perry Bernard's support in our final push before the Iowa caucuses,\" Huckabee said in a statement. Huckabee is a former governor of Arkansas and was the 2008 winner of the Iowa caucuses.\nIowa Gazette \"Mike Huckabee is good for country's future\"… \"Apparently, many Iowans have not decided who to vote for. Perhaps, it's because they haven't settled on the most important criteria for making a choice…I believe character and experience are critically important qualifications for the person we elect for the president of the United States. So, we should be asking ourselves: Which candidate can we trust and who has the integrity, values and experience needed to make wise decisions?….As governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee cut taxes, balanced the budget, increased family income, fought for life, family, marriage and religious liberty; and he defeated the Clinton machine. As president, he will work to rebuild U.S. military superiority, restore our country's role as leader of the free world and defeat the evil forces of radical Islam. He will pass a FairTax and abolish the IRS (an annual cost to the taxpayers of $431 billion). He will protect and strengthen Social Security and Medicare. And, he will defend the Second Amendment, oppose new gun control laws and protect the rights of gun owners. He says, \"This issue is crystal clear. Abolishing guns because of reckless abusers makes as much sense as abolishing cars because a drunken driver kills someone.\" He opposes amnesty for immigrants here illegally and supports securing the border. He supports traditional marriage, parental rights, rights of unborn children and home schooling. He's a great communicator; he says what he means and he means what he says. Let's assure our county's future by supporting Huckabee for president. -Gary Fischer, Iowa City\"\n\"Huckabee: Cruz is a chronic flip-flopper who can't be trusted\" — CNN ... Washington (CNN) -Mike Huckabee painted Ted Cruz as a non-stop flip-flopper Friday, saying that raised questions about whether the Texas Republican can be trusted. \"Ted Cruz has changed his positions on ethanol, immigration, H-1B visas. He's changed it on whether marriage is a state or a federal issue. He's changed it on whether he's going to be a real champion for religious liberty or whether that's going to be way down the road and it's not important,\" Huckabee told CNN's Chris Cuomo on \"New Day.\" \"I think it's pretty clear while Ted Cruz has questioned the integrity of a lot of different candidates on that stage, if you look at how many different things, including trade -- he wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal saying it was the greatest thing since toothpaste, then he came out when the political wind shifted and said he was against it.\" ... Huckabee, who has repeatedly accused Cruz of offering varying stances on issues to different audiences, said that when a candidate shifts positions so frequently it raises an issue of whether voters can trust that person. \"When people change their views depending on geography of where they happen to be, if they say one thing in Manhattan and another thing in Marshalltown, Iowa, that's when you start wondering whether you can trust them,\" Huckabee said on \"New Day.\" \"When a person changes views time after time and is always moving with the political wind vane, when a person is a thermometer instead of a thermostat, that person is not a leader and, no, you cannot trust them.\"\n\"Huckabee, Santorum Unite With Donald Trump at Iowa Fundraiser Raising $6M for Veterans\" — CP Politics ... In a rare show of solidarity Donald Trump's Republican presidential rivals Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum joined the billionaire frontrunner Thursday night at a benefit event for veterans in Iowa, which raised some $6 million for several veteran organizations. \"Rick Santorum, Donald Trump and I may be competitors in a presidential race, but tonight, we are colleagues in unison, standing here for the people who let us breathe every breath of free air that we breathe,\" said Huckabee after Trump invited him to speak at the podium…..\"It says something about him that he would bring us here to his own event because bigger than even the election is the fact that we wouldn't have free elections in this country if it weren't for the people who stood between bullets, bombs, and our freedom,\" said Huckabee who told Trump \"thank you\" for the invitation. \"I want to say how grateful I am to Donald Trump for inviting us here because the easy thing for him to do is to simply ignore that anybody else cares about veterans and he is not that kind of person…..\n\"Huckabee looks for Iowa revival\" — ArkansasOnline ... URBANDALE, Iowa - Trailing badly in all of the polls, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee is counting on friends from Arkansas and voters in Iowa to help him shock the pollsters and keep his presidential hopes alive. Borrowing a racetrack analogy, he says it's possible the front-runners will hit a wall or blow a tire before reaching Monday's finish line. Thursday, Arkansas Treasurer Dennis Milligan and Attorney General Leslie Rutledge arrived at Huckabee 2016 headquarters in Urbandale, Iowa, and prepared to join the final push. They were joined by former South Carolina Lt. Gov. Andre Bauer, Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill, Home Improvement actor Jimmy Labriola and a host of Huckabee's relatives. \"This is the insane part of the Iowa caucus as we get to the funnel,\" Huckabee said before exiting the office Thursday afternoon. \"Every four years, nobody really knows what's going to happen until it happens.\" Unlike eight years ago, when he won the Iowa caucuses, this time there aren't hordes of reporters trailing Huckabee wherever he goes. Right now, he concedes, the throngs are chasing New York billionaire Donald Trump and U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, focusing on that increasingly heated rivalry. \"There's a focus on that battle that is unquestionable, but there's also the possibility that people will say, 'I'm tired of that.' That's our strategy. In a NASCAR race, if you're driving around the track and there's some folks in front of you and they have a car wreck, you can go get the checkered flag,\" Huckabee said. Finishing first isn't essential, he suggested. \"There are some of us that need to exceed the expectations, which for me, right now, are not high,\" he said. \"There are others, for example, Cruz. If he doesn't win here, then this inevitability stuff is gone and I think he has as much to lose here as we do here.\" Campaign staff members say they're reaching out to undecided voters and that there are positive signs as the vote nears. \"The last couple of days on the ground, we've seen more people coming to our events. I'd say the volume has been turned up a little bit. You can tell people are starting to make some decisions,\" said campaign senior adviser Chip Saltsman. There's ground to make up between now and Monday. \"Look, we know where we are in the world. We're not the front-runner right now. We know we've got to close like a freight train, but the good news is there's been a lot of people in Iowa that's voted for him before and they know who he is,\" Saltsman said. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the governor's daughter and his campaign manager, said he needs \"a strong showing,\" adding, \"We need to beat expectations and I think we'll do it.\" It's a good sign, she said, that so many volunteers are showing up at Huckabee headquarters. Thursday, dozens of supporters traveled to the site, sandwiched between Midwest Mattress and Hungry Boyz restaurant, in strip-mall country 10 miles northwest of Des Moines. As others loaded up on a free barbecue luncheon, Labriola, the actor and comedian, earnestly praised his friend from Arkansas. The TV star appeared on Huckabee's TV show a few years ago; he says they quickly became pals. \"What I love about him is the realness. What you see is what you get and, obviously, he has a great sense of humor or I couldn't hang with him, no matter who he was,\" the New York native said. \"I really believe he could be the Reagan of our time, what we really need. So I'm willing to do whatever I can.\" Huckabee's Arkansas allies said they'll also do anything they can to help. \"If it means sweeping the floor, I'll be jumping in sweeping the floors,\" Milligan said. \"Mike's been a great leader for Arkansas, a great influence on me and we're just proud to be up here helping him out any way that we possibly can. He's demonstrated a great ability to be able to lead our state and I have no doubt in my mind he's very capable of leading our country.\" Although Huckabee later joked about getting a broom for Milligan, campaign officials said Milligan's primary task, at least Monday evening, would be to speak on the candidate's behalf at one of the caucus sites. Thursday, Milligan and Rutledge had tickets to the night's Republican debates and were scheduled to appear and praise Huckabee's performance later in the evening. Officials have printed \"talking points\" to help Huckabee surrogates make their case in the coming days, but Rutledge didn't refer to them as she praised Hope's most famous Republican earlier in the day. \"Gov. Huckabee's experience. No one can match it,\" she said, praising Huckabee's decade of leadership and his ability to work with Democrats as well as Republicans. \"That's what Americans are fed up with right now. They're fed up with government not working and the divisiveness that we see in Washington and he has a proven record of reaching across the aisle, working with people to get things done. ... He did amazing work in Arkansas and he needs the opportunity to do that across America.\" In addition to Arkansas elected officials, Huckabee family members also have been deployed and will speak on his behalf at caucus gatherings Monday evening. The ex-governor's sister, Pat Harris of Bryant, said she's been told she can stray from the talking points, because \"they'd rather we speak from our hearts.\" The retired schoolteacher gave a similar speech here in 2008, the night Huckabee claimed victory. Asked how her brother will do this time, Harris said \"I truly have no idea. We're more about miracles than math, so we'll just have to see. All you can do is do your best, keep a happy face and keep rolling.\"\n\"Overwhelming Response to Huckabee's 'God's Not Dead' Screening in Iowa Leads to Second Showing\" — TownHall.com ... Religious freedom has proven to be a popular concept in Iowa. Not long after Mike Huckabee's presidential campaign announced they would be offering a pre-release screening of the film \"God's Not Dead 2\" for Iowans on the eve of the caucuses, they find themselves having to offer a second screening to meet the overwhelming demand. Tickets sold out within just 24 hours. The sequel to \"God's Not Dead\" tells the story of a history teacher, Grace Wesley (Melissa Joan Hart), who is punished for answering a student's question about Jesus. Because she spoke about Him in the classroom, she was forced to the courtroom. Huckabee, who makes a cameo in the film, said the story is a good reminder why this year's election is so important to \"preserving religious liberty.\" Producer and Pure Flix Entertainment founding partner Michael Scott echoed Huckabee's comments, insisting the film offers a \"critical\" message for today's culture: \"Cases like these - where the religious freedoms of everyday men and women are being restricted by courts and government agencies - are sadly quite common today,\" explained Scott. \"Our hope is that we can start a conversation in the country with this movie about how critical the right to believe, and to talk about that belief in public, is to our nation.\" Check out this exclusive clip from the film, in which Grace's lawyer Tom Endler, played by Jesse Metcalfe, boldly asks the principal if Christians are excluded from the \"tolerance\" her school supposedly preaches. It's encouraging that so many people are excited to see a film that teaches how important it is to stand up for one's faith. Seats are limited. To sign up for the screening, participants are encouraged to visit MikeHuckabee.com/godsnotdead.\n\"SD Senator Mike Rounds Sticking by Mike Huckabee for President\" — WNAX Radio 570 ...South Dakota Senator Mike Rounds is sticking with [Mike Huckabee] ...

GOP presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, who dropped in at Donald Trump's veterans' fundraiser….\" \"Many [of them] are getting gut punched every day by a system who does not want to give them what they not only deserve, but what they desperately need,\" the former Arkansas governor told CNN's \"New Day\" program. \"None of us want to see a suicide rate of 22 a day, which is just disgraceful in this country.\" Huckabee said he doesn't understand skeptics who are saying that real policy reform, not special events to use veterans for political reasons, should be the focus. \"Last night over $6 million was raised for veterans groups — $6 million towards helping these people,\" Huckabee said. \"The truth is there shouldn't have to be any outside veterans groups to help veterans. There shouldn't be any. That is a responsibility of the United States of America. \"They should be getting the first fruits of our treasury. Everyone else ought to wait in line until the veterans gets served and then everyone else lines up behind them. That's not how it is happening. People are waiting three months, six months to get treated.\" Trump chose not to come to the debate because of his disagreement with Fox News' refusal to remove Megyn Kelly as a moderator, but Huckabee pointed out he showed up and he doesn't \"have a beef\" with the network, where he had his own show for six and a half years. \"They don't treat me any way special because I was there,\" he said. \"Sometimes I feel like they go out of their way making sure I don't get special treatment . . . I offered to take [Trump's] podium last night, which I think they should have let me do. Unfortunately, that didn't go over very well.\"….Meanwhile, Huckabee told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" program that he disagrees with offers from Ted Cruz' super PACs and Carly Fiorina to give veterans' causes millions in exchange for one-on-one debates with Trump. \"If it's conditioned upon a debate then is it about the veterans or is it about them getting a debate?\" he said. \"I went and I got nothing out of it other than just to go and I got — by a lot of people — criticized for showing up at some other candidate's event. \"I'm sure that there will be people who say I shouldn't have. In fact, even on my own Facebook page I had criticism from some of my own supporters. But you know what? I didn't ask for anything other than he's going to do a salute to the vets.\"\nThe Hill ... Republican presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee says primary rival Ted Cruz cannot be trusted to be a conservative leader in the White House, accusing the Texas senator of flip-flopping on several issues. \"Ted Cruz has changed his positions on ethanol, immigration, H-1B visas,\" Huckabee said Friday on CNN's \"New Day.\" \"He's changed it on whether marriage is a state or a federal issue. He's changed it on whether he's going to be a real champion for religious liberty or whether that's going to be way down the road and it's not important,\" he added. The former Arkansas governor said voters shouldn't trust candidates who repeatedly change their stances based on what's popular.He had previously accused Cruz of hypocrisy for campaigning at the New York penthouse of two gay businessmen, despite his staunch opposition to gay marriage. \"When people change their views depending on geography of where they happen to be, if they say one thing in Manhattan and another thing in Marshalltown, Iowa, that's when you start wondering whether you can trust them,\" Huckabee said Friday. After the GOP primary undercard debate on Thursday night, Huckabee attended an event hosted by Republican primary front-runner Donald Trump.\n\"A Closing Argument for Mike Huckabee\" — Caffeinated Thoughts ... Too often we've defined character too narrowly as if it were only a question of whether a candidate has been faithful to their spouse and avoided trouble with the law. Yet, our character is built one decision at a time over the course of our lives, and these decisions establish patterns. A wise man has said, \"You make decisions and those decisions turn around and make you.\" ...Governor Huckabee decided to be a servant to the people of his state rather than using his office as nothing more than a means to climb the political ladder. We need someone who will serve the people of this nation, not just their own agenda. Aren't you tired of politicians who look at people suffering, losing their jobs, losing their homes, and say, \"Never let a good crisis go to waste\"? That's how the Obama Administration made a pork-laden stimulus bill that paid off big contributors as its first major \"accomplishment.\" In a similar way, politicians in both parties have refused to secure the border. Instead, they insist Congress pass an amnesty bill that promises to secure the border eventually. Americans are being killed by criminals who entered this country illegally while politicians continue to play games with the lives and safety of the American people. Mike Huckabee believes the safety and security our country isn't a bargaining chip, it is the first responsibility of the President of the United States. The President already has the tools to secure the border. Within one year of taking office, Mike Huckabee would get the job done. Our veterans continue to suffer at the hands of the incompetent VA with waiting lists that go on for months, with many veterans dying while waiting for care. The veterans' problems are barely talked about on the Presidential campaign trail. Why? They may have served our country honorably and been promised care, but they don't have $100 million to give to a Super PAC. To Mike Huckabee, their care is a top priority. They've served us and we owe them the best. Using his experience from governing Arkansas and reforming bureaucracy, he'll reform the VA and end the crisis of long wait times. As a result of the choice to use his office to serve, Governor Huckabee earned the respect of the people of Arkansas. He won four straight statewide elections, which was unprecedented for a Republican. At the same time, ninety percent of his legislative agenda was enacted including education reform, the first broad-based tax cuts, and a partial birth abortion plan. He did this with an overwhelmingly Democratic legislature. Many candidates promise to fight for legislation, but Governor Huckabee has a record of actually winning. In 2008, American conservatives panicked in the midst of the financial crisis. It was hard to find a fiscal conservative who believed consistently in small government. Most of Congress believed only big government could save America's most powerful corporations from going under. President Bush said at the time, \"I've abandoned free market principles to save the free market.\" In contrast, respectfully but forcefully, Mike Huckabee stood against the betrayals of conservative principles that were so readily made during that crisis. Governor Huckabee made a decision to stand for principle rather than to panic. Long before Rick Santelli made his famous rant on CNBC in February 2009 that keyed the start of the Tea Party movement, Governor Huckabee was standing firm against the heavy hand of big government intervention to \"save our economy\" from the free market. It's easy to be conservative in good times at a conservative conference or in a town hall meeting. It's a crisis that tests your dedication to principle. Presidents are elected for the crisis, and Mike Huckabee has shown he will not lose his head or his principles when times are tough. Governor Huckabee came of age in a time when the South was coming to terms with integration. Mike Huckabee chose time and time again to be a leader in bringing about unity and racial reconciliation. He helped integrate his high school. Then as a young pastor of a small church, he welcomed the church's first Black member. When dealing with a few members who didn't like it, he said, \"If he goes, I go.\" His efforts to serve, reach, and bring healing was reflected in his 1998 re-election bid when he won nearly half of the Black vote in his state. During the last eight years, we've had a President who promised to bring us together, but he has instead torn us apart and stoked the fires of racial hatred and division and set race relations back decades in order to help his political fortunes. Mike Huckabee has had a focus throughout his life and career in bringing healing and reconciliation and as a president will work to heal the damage done by this administration. Governor Huckabee has many great skills that even those who don't agree with him recognize. He's a great public speaker with an ability to emotionally connect with people, and he has more than a decade of executive experience. If he had a huge campaign budget, he'd be unstoppable. And he had a chance for that. Three different billionaires offered to support him through their own contributions and through people they could raise money from. But they wanted him to stop talking about the sanctity of human life and the sanctity of marriage. He refused, and the billionaires chose to endorse other candidates. It's a decision that shows that, if president, Mike Huckabee will be a leader on the issues of life and marriage. The most powerful tool a President has is the bully pulpit, the ability a President has to use the power of his office to advocate for great values and ideas. Mike Huckabee has shown he would use that power well and faithfully. He has shown the willingness to stand up and advocate for traditional values at locations as unfriendly as the View and the Daily Show with Jon Stewart. If you're only willing to advocate for traditional values before a friendly audience, that's not leadership, it's pandering. We can't afford another person in the White House whose looking out for the interests of well-connected special interests. We need a President who cannot be bought, whose interest is doing the right thing for the American people rather than big donors who are looking for a big payoff. Many people who had come to him urging him to run and promised to support him didn't. They were disappointed by the money he hadn't raised, money he could have raised by selling out his principles. The media and the establishment has counted him out. He could have chosen to pack it in, to call it a campaign, and he could have spent two weeks lounging around at his lovely Florida home before restarting his media and public speaking career. Governor Huckabee's made of sterner stuff than that. He chose to endure. He didn't retire from the race, he hit the ground running with 150 events in the month of January in the freezing weather of Iowa. The political insiders and establishment believe in the power of big money and big endorsements to win the day. He's chosen to trust the people of Iowa. He believes on Caucus Night, people will cut through all of the hype and all of the clever packaging. He believes, when people Caucus, they will vote based on hope rather than fear, and they'll think who they can trust with the high responsibility of righting our country after the disastrous age of Obama. Some candidates are trusting in massive campaign contributors and a phalanx of well-healed consultants. Governor Huckabee still believes ordinary citizens working hard for what they believe in can do extraordinary things. Ronald Reagan called America \"a shining city on a Hill,\" and it should be our goal to make it that again. In his Farewell Address, he explained what he meant. \"It was a tall, proud city built on rocks stronger than oceans, windswept, God-blessed, and teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace; a city with free ports that hummed with commerce and creativity,\" and it speaks to our highest hopes and aspirations for America. The question Iowa must answer is, \"Who can lead America back to being that sort of city?\" Decisions are not only powerful for individuals but parties and states. Eight years ago, the other party held a Caucus and were presented with a lot of promised by a young inexperienced Senator named Barack Obama. He had a big ego and made big promises he couldn't keep but managed to inspire a fan base so fanatical it was more suited to Comic Con than in the political life of a free people. The result has been eight of the most divisive and damaging years in American history. They made a decision that has helped to make America into a gloomier, angrier, and less free nation. Now, eight years later, Republicans have a choice, and it will help make the future of our nation. If Iowa decides for Mike Huckabee, it will decide America needs a proven statesman who will lead our country towards liberty, respect for the inherent worth of every person, and the rule of law1, and away from the hatred, anger, lawlessness, and division stirred up by power-hungry demagogues over the past eight years. Remember, the decision you make will help make the future of our nation.", "timestamp": "2016-01-30", "title": "Press Release - War Room Update: Jan. 30 Edition"}

We've made real progress in education — over the past seven years, 49 States and Washington, D.C. have raised expectations by adopting higher standards to prepare all students for success in college and careers.\nIt is now time to take the next step forward. Our economy is rapidly shifting, and educators and business leaders are increasingly recognizing that CS is a \"new basic\" skill necessary for economic opportunity and social mobility. By some estimates, just one quarter of all the K-12 schools in the United States offer CS with programming and coding, and only 28 states allow CS courses to count towards high-school graduation, even as other advanced economies are making CS available for all of their students.\nFortunately, there is a growing movement being led by parents, teachers, states, districts, and the private sector to expand CS education. The President's Computer Science for All Initiative builds on these efforts by:\n• Providing $4 billion in funding for states, and $100 million directly for districts in his forthcoming Budget to increase access to K-12 CS by training teachers, expanding access to high-quality instructional materials, and building effective regional partnerships. The funding will allow more states and districts to offer hands-on CS courses across all of their public high schools, get students involved early by creating high-quality CS learning opportunities in elementary and middle schools, expand overall access to rigorous science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) coursework, and ensure all students have the chance to participate, including girls and underrepresented minorities.\n• Starting the effort this year, with more than $135 million in investments by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) to support and train CS teachers, who are the most critical ingredient to offering CS education in schools. The agencies will make these investments over five years using existing funds.\n• Calling on even more Governors, Mayors, education leaders, CEOs, philanthropists, creative media and technology professionals, and others to get involved. Today, Delaware, Hawaii and more than 30 school districts are committing to expand CS opportunities; Cartoon Network, Google and Salesforce.org are announcing more than $60 million in new philanthropic investments, and Microsoft is announcing a fifty-state campaign to expand CS; and Code.org is announcing plans to offer CS training to an additional 25,000 teachers this year. Read more about the more than 50 organizations responding to the President's call to action  HERE.\nTHE NEED FOR CS FOR ALL\nBuilding on the progress made by states in raising standards to help students graduate from high school ready for college and career, President Obama signed the bipartisan Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) in December 2015. This law cements this progress by requiring that all students in America be taught to high academic standards that will prepare them to succeed in careers and in college.\nFurthermore, more than nine out of ten parents surveyed last year say they want CS taught at their child's school. They understand that today's elementary, middle and high school students are tomorrow's engineers, entrepreneurs, and leaders who must be equipped with strong computational thinking skills and the ability to solve complex problems.\nThe Challenge\nAccess to CS education is limited and wide disparities exist even for those who do have access to these courses. For example, in the fewer than 15 percent of all high schools that offered any Advanced Placement (AP) CS courses in 2015, only 22 percent of those who took the exam were girls, and only 13 percent were African-American or Latino students. Media portrayals and widely-held stereotypes exacerbate this dynamic, with far more men than women depicted in technology roles in film and television roles. As highlighted in the first-ever White House Demo Day, these disparities in who gets included, and who feels included, are one reason why women compose less than one-third of the technical employees, and African-Americans less than three percent, at some of America's largest and most innovative technology companies.\nThe Opportunity\nProviding access to CS is a critical step for ensuring that our nation remains competitive in the global economy and strengthens its cybersecurity. Last year, there were over 600,000 tech jobs open across the United States, and by 2018, 51 percent of all STEM jobs are projected to be in CS-related fields. The Federal government alone needs an additional 10,000 IT and cybersecurity professionals, and the private sector needs many more. CS is not only important for the tech sector, but also for a growing number of industries, including transportation, healthcare, education, and financial services, that are using software to transform their products and services. In fact, more than two-thirds of all tech jobs are outside the tech sector.\nCS is also an active and applied field of STEM learning that allows students to engage in hands-on, real-world interaction with key math, science, and engineering principles. It gives students opportunities to be producers, not just consumers, in the digital economy, and to be active citizens in our technology-driven world. CS can also help foster computational thinking skills that are relevant to many disciplines and careers, such as breaking a large problem into smaller ones, recognizing how new problems relate to ones that have already been solved, setting aside details of a problem that are less important, and identifying and refining the steps needed to reach a solution. CS also complements the President's Nation of Makers initiative, which focuses on the growing democratization of the hardware and software tools needed to design and make just about anything.\nTHE PRESIDENT'S PLAN TO EXPAND CS FOR ALL\nOver the past seven years, President Obama has led an ambitious effort to expand science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) opportunities for American students. From starting the tradition of the White House Science Fair to launching the \"Educate to Innovate\" initiative, the President's efforts are helping more than 50,000 new STEM teachers get trained, have catalyzed more than $1 billion of private-sector investment for STEM education, and have expanded opportunities for students who are traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields.\nIn 2014, President Obama  became the first President to write a line of code, and issued a broad  call to action to expand CS across the nation's classrooms. In just the past three years, 17 states have allowed CS to count towards graduation requirements, and growing list of states like Arkansas and Washington are creating high-quality CS learning opportunities in elementary and middle school, and providing greater access to CS courses in high school. Under the President's TechHire and  ConnectED initiatives, more than 500 employers have partnered with 35 cities, states, and rural areas to expand access to tech jobs, and the connectivity divide in schools has been cut by about half since 2013. Major school systems such as New York City, Chicago and San Francisco have announced plans to offer CS to every student throughout elementary, middle and high school, with strong support from business leaders, philanthropists, and non-profits. In addition, the President  signed the bipartisan ESSA law in December 2015, which expands the opportunities that states and districts have to offer CS and other rigorous STEM coursework.\nHistoric Investment to Empower States and Districts\nThe President's Computer Science for All plan builds on the momentum at the state and local level. The President's upcoming budget will include $4 billion in funding at the Department of Education, available over three years, for states to increase access to CS in P-12 classrooms. Under the program, states would submit comprehensive five-year \"Computer Science for All\" plans, and every state with a well-designed strategy would receive funds. In addition to state-level grants, the budget will also dedicate $100 million in competitive grants specifically for leading districts to execute ambitious CS expansion efforts for all students, including traditionally underrepresented students, and serve as models for national replication.\nThe funds would give states and districts the resources to train both existing and new teachers to teach CS, build effective regional collaborations, and expand access to high-quality learning materials and online learning options. States and districts could use these funds to provide access to CS courses to every high school student within five years, create a progression of CS learning experiences in elementary and middle schools, and ensure additional support and resources for students traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields.\nParticipating states and districts would also be encouraged to create plans for expanding overall access to rigorous STEM classes, utilizing CS as a catalyst for increased interest in STEM more broadly, and reducing course equity gaps for all students, including underrepresented groups such as minorities, girls, and youth from low-income families. For high school students, this could include expanded access to AP, International Baccalaureate, dual-enrollment, and other rigorous coursework that lead to college and career readiness, and to earn college credit while in high school. For students in the early grades through middle school, these plans could support implementation of high-quality curriculum, instruction, and learning opportunities that promote computational thinking and that lay the groundwork for CS and STEM coursework in high school.\nStates and districts would also be encouraged to build robust regional collaborations, such as with industry, non-profits, and out-of-school providers, as well as securing potential financial and in-kind support from private partners.\nAction by Federal Agencies Starting This Year\nThe Administration is also announcing Federal actions to expand CS in K-12 education starting this year. These include actions by the Department of Education (ED), the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS), the Department of Defense (DoD) and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO), within the Department of Commerce.\n• NSF is committing $120 million for the Computer Science for All initiative over the next five years:Under this Administration's tenure, NSF has funded efforts to build the necessary research foundations for implementing effective academic CS instruction in U.S. schools. NSF has funded the development of prototypes of instructional materials, assessments, teacher professional-development programs, and teacher resources, including a new introductory CS high-school course, Exploring Computer Science (ECS), and a new AP CS Principles (CSP) course framework. Both ECS and CSP are designed to be academic, rigorous, and engaging for all students, with equity and access at their core. As the lead Federal agency for building the knowledge base for CS education, NSF will make available $120 million over the next five years to accelerate its ongoing efforts to enable rigorous and engaging CS education in schools across the nation. These funds will support continued prototyping of instructional materials, scalable and sustainable professional-development models, approaches to pre-service preparation for CS teachers, and teacher resources at the K-12 grade levels. This acceleration could enable as many as 9,000 additional high-school teachers to be well prepared to teach CS over the next five years.\n• CNCS is committing $17 million to support teacher training: CNCS — the Federal agency that engages millions of Americans in service and in developing community solutions through its AmeriCorps, Senior Corps, and Social Innovation Fund programs — is committing up to $17 million in Segal AmeriCorps Education Awards over the next three years to support teacher training in CS education. CNCS, in partnership with NSF, will collaborate with 100Kin10 to help thousands of teachers access the AmeriCorps Educational Awards, which will help pay for the training teachers need to learn CS fundamentals, and educate and inspire the next generation of great innovators, problem-solvers, and STEM educators. In addition, 100Kin10 is pledging to support its growing network of more than 200 partners, which includes Center for STEM Education-TRC at UT Austin, Colorado Education Initiative, New York Academy of Sciences, Industry Initiatives for Science and Math Education (IISME), Roadtrip Nation, SRI International, Teach For America, the University of New Hampshire, The UTeach Institute and others, to directly prepare and support no fewer than 10,000 teachers to teach CS by 2021. As part of that commitment, 100Kin10 will launch a $1 million \"coopetition\" to identify and network leading-edge efforts to prepare and support engineering in K-12 schools in the state of New York, with a focus on CS.\n• The Department of Defense (DoD) and NSF are collaborating with the National Math and Science Initiative (NMSI): DoD and NSF will collaborate with the NMSI, a non-profit, to implement the new AP CS Principles course within the NMSI College Readiness Program for Military Families, providing teacher and student support interventions at 200 DoD-related NMSI sites across the country.\n• NSF will also collaborate with the private sector to support high-school CS teachers: As part of its $120 million investment, NSF will provide $5 million to pilot and expand professional-development approaches in CS to additional schools across the United States, with funding from industry that will enable teachers to attend those pilot programs. Infosys Foundation USA will be a founding member of this public-private collaboration with a $1 million philanthropic donation, and, as an initial participant, Tata Consultancy Services is providing additional support in the form of grants to teachers in 27 U.S cities. This collaboration will ultimately provide opportunities for as many as 2,000 middle- and high-school teachers to deepen their understanding of CS.\n• CS Teacher Institutes: The Department of Education's Office of Career, Technical, and Adult Education (OCTAE) and NSF will participate in a joint effort to expand the field of CS educators in Career and Technical Education (CTE) programs. This effort will create a first cohort of educators who will provide additional CS professional development for educators across the country. In addition, PTO will also launch a national network of teacher training institutes, open to districts across all 50 states, to upgrade existing CS professional development with new robotics programming and intellectual property modules that can animate the interests of all students, including young girls and students of color.\n• Creating 21st Century Learners and Coders: The U.S. Department of Education's 21st Century Community Learning Centers (21st CCLC) program, funded at more than $1 billion and the Federal government's largest investment in afterschool and extended day programs, will increase awareness of high-quality CS resources for out-of-school programs. The 21st CCLC program will showcase promising practices and resources within its network of State Directors, site Directors, and front-line staff, and will feature CS in the STEM session at the program's Summer Institute.\n• Guidance for Additional Funding Opportunities at ED: Building on the STEM Act of 2015 and new ESSA, ED will release a Dear Colleague Letter this year that will include guidance on funding opportunities for STEM and CS. ED will also release a report entitled \"STEM 2025\" in the spring. The report will detail considerations for the next ten years in P-12 STEM education, including a discussion on the importance of computational thinking and other CS-related activities.", "timestamp": "2016-01-30", "title": "Fact Sheet: President Obama Announces Computer Science For All Initiative"}

That's why my administration has encouraged States to raise standards. We've cut the digital divide in our classrooms by half. We've worked with Congress to pass a bipartisan bill to set the expectation that every student should graduate from high school ready for college and a good job. And thanks to the hard work of students, teachers, and parents across the country, our high school graduation rate is at an alltime high.\nNow we have to make sure all our kids are equipped for the jobs of the future, which means not just being able to work with computers, but developing the analytical and coding skills to power our innovation economy. Today's auto mechanics aren't just sliding under cars to change the oil, they're working on machines that run on as many as a hundred million lines of code. That's a hundred times more than the space shuttle. Nurses are analyzing data and managing electronic health records. Machinists are writing computer programs. And workers of all kinds need to be able to figure out how to break a big problem into smaller pieces and identify the right steps to solve it.\nIn the new economy, computer science isn't an optional skill, it's a basic skill, right along with the three \"Rs.\" Nine out of ten parents want it taught to their child in school. Yet right now only a quarter of our K-through-12 schools offer computer science. Twenty-two States don't even allow it to count toward a diploma.\nSo I've got a plan to help make sure all our kids get an opportunity to learn computer science, especially girls and minorities. It's called Computer Science for All. And it means just what it says: giving every student in America an early start at learning the skills they need to get ahead in the new economy.\nFirst, I'm asking Congress to provide funding so that our elementary, middle, and high schools can provide opportunities to learn computer science for all students. Second, starting this year, we're leveraging existing resources at the National Science Foundation and the Corporation for National and Community Service to train more great teachers for these courses. And third, I'll be pulling together Governors, mayors, business leaders, and tech entrepreneurs to join the growing bipartisan movement around this cause. Americans of all kinds are getting involved, from students teaching each other to code to teachers adding programming to their classes. And just today States like Delaware and Hawaii, companies like Google and Salesforce, and organizations like Code.org have made commitments to help more of our kids learn these skills.\nThat's what this is all about: each of us doing our part to make sure all our young people can compete in a high-tech, global economy. They're the ones who will make sure America—the country that invented all this stuff in the first place—keeps growing, keeps innovating, and keeps leading the world in the years ahead. And they're the reason I've never been more confident about our future.\nThanks everybody, and have a great weekend.", "timestamp": "2016-01-30", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}
{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111593", "text": "STEPHANOPOULOS: Thank you for joining us, Madam Secretary.\n[crosstalk]\nLet's talk about that \"Des Moines Register\" — that \"Des Moines Register\" poll that has you in the lead — eight years ago, your hopes were dashed by that surge of new voters for Barack Obama. Are you confident that won't happen again?\nCLINTON: Well, George, here's what I'm confident about. We've run a terrific campaign from the grassroots up. I feel so proud and grateful to the thousands of Iowans who have joined this campaign. And we're going to keep working as hard as I can and everybody else, until the caucuses conclude tomorrow night. Of course, it's close. It's competitive. That's why I hope everybody who has decided to caucus for me will be sure to come out on Monday night.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You did have that surprise on Friday; the State Department saying they will not release 22 emails of yours deemed top secret. You want them released. Why are you so confident that release would not compromise national security? What do you know about those emails that we don't?\nCLINTON: Well, here's what I know. I know that this is, I think, a continuation of the story that has been playing out for months. There is no classified marked information on those emails sent or received by me. Dianne Feinstein, the ranking member of the Intelligence Committee, who's had a chance to review them, has said that this email chain did not originate with me and that there were no classification markings. So I do want them released and of course I can't be clear about exactly what the reasons might be for some in the government, as part of this interagency dispute, to make this request not to make them public. But I would like to see them disclosed and I think they can. It should be disclosed —\n[crosstalk]\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Your supporters —\nCLINTON: — that I'm told about them.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: — your supporters including Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, former governor of Iowa, and Senator Feinstein herself, has suggested it's political. Is that what you think?\nCLINTON: Well, it's — I'm going to leave that to others who are quite experienced in the ways of Washington to comment on. I just have to point out that the timing and some of the leaks that have led up to it are concerning. And I just want this matter resolved. The best way to resolve is to do what I asked months ago, release these, let the public see them and let's move on.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You know, you've said many times that the emails were not marked classified. No evidence that that's not true. But the non-disclosure agreement you signed as secretary of state said that that really is not that relevant. It says classified information is marked or unmarked classified and that all of your training to treat all of that sensitively and should know the difference.\nCLINTON: Well, of course. And that's exactly what I did. I take classified information very seriously. You know, you can't get information off the classified system in the State Department to put onto an unclassified system, no matter what that system is. We were very specific about that and you — when you receive information, of course, there has to be some markings, some indication that someone down the chain had thought that this was classified and that was not the case. The final thing I would say because clearly the best answer to all of this is release and disclose these materials is that what I'm told is that this chain of emails very well included a published newspaper report. That seems a little hard to understand, that we would be retroactively over classifying a public newspaper article. So let's just get it out. Let's see what it is and let the American people draw their own conclusions. This is very much like Benghazi, George. You know, the Republicans are going to continue to use it, beat up on me. I understand that. That's the way they are. But after 11 hours of testimony, answering every single question, in public, which I have requested for many months, I think it's pretty clear they're grasping at straws and this will turn out —\n[crosstalk]\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Finally on this matter, you know, a few months back, you told my colleague, David Mir it was a mistake to set up this private server. Yet just this Monday, you said there was no error in judgment. How do you square those two statements?\nCLINTON: Well, look, as I've said many times, it was permitted. My predecessors had engaged in a similar practice. It was not the best choice. I wouldn't be here talking to you about it. I'd be talking about what people in Iowa are talking to me about, about affordable health care and jobs and rising wages and all of the concerns that are on their minds. And be, you know, really able to answer their questions as I have been now for so many months.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You and Senator Sanders really going at it right now. And here was — he was on the stump there yesterday, saying this about your attack.\n[begin video clip]\nSANDERS: Don't tell me that I'm defending or protecting the gun lobby. Don't tell me I'm attacking Planned Parenthood. Those are inaccuracies. And we can do better than that.\n[end video clip]\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: He's calling you on this, says he got a D- rating from the NRA and 100 percent record with Planned Parenthood.\nCLINTON: Well, let me tell you what the people who work on these issues every day have said. They say I'm the leader. I'm the leader who has taken on tough issues. I've taken on difficult issues like Planned Parenthood, the gun lobby, for many years. And they concluded to endorse me by the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. I was very honored to have that. That's not saying that others haven't voted with them. But they were looking for a leader and they found it with me. I've been endorsed by The Brady Campaign and yesterday in a very emotional event in Ames, Iowa, endorsed by Gabby Giffords and her husband, Mark Kelly, because they believe I'm the leader that they want to stand up to the gun lobby, the same with the Human Rights Campaign. They concluded I was the leader to protect and advance the cause of the rights of the LGBT community. Now that is just the facts. People who have known us, people who have evaluated us, people who have concluded what they want in the next president have sided with me. And I'm very proud of that.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You know, you just mentioned [inaudible] hitting you with the email issue. They're clearly going to hit Bernie Sanders with the fact that he's a Democratic socialist if he gets the nomination. Some of your supporters concerned about that, Senator Claire McCaskill, are saying they can't wait to run an ad with a hammer and a sickle. Steny Hoyer, Congressman Steny Hoyer, saying he calls himself a socialist. I don't think that's a good title to be running for President of the United States. Is that what you think? Will the fact that he's a Democratic socialist make it harder for Democrats to win in November?\nCLINTON: Well, that certainly is what a lot of Democratic leaders are saying. And I take them at their word. They know their states. They know the country. They know we have to take back the Senate. They want to make some advances in the House as well as at governor and legislature levels across the country. Here's what I think. I think I've been subjected, as you know so well, to years of scrutiny and I'm still standing, talking to you in the lead here in Iowa for the caucuses and going on after that. And it's a very tough gantlet to run. And if there are issues, that Republicans and their allies on the Right believe they could use to bring down a Democratic, they're going to use it. I feel vetted. I feel ready. I feel strong and I think I'm the best person to be the nominee and to defeat whoever they nominate in November.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Finally, I wonder what your response to this quote from your old friend, Robert Rice, Secretary of Labor under President Clinton. He said you're the most qualified candidate for the political system we now have. But Bernie Sanders is the most qualified candidate to create the political system we should have. How do you respond to that?\nCLINTON: Well, look, I'm a progressive who thinks it's important to actually make progress. That's what I've done my entire life. That's what I will do as president. Obviously I have big goals. I want to get to universal coverage; I want to get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top. Get incomes rising, get women equal pay, raise the minimum wage, have a renaissance in manufacturing, move toward clean, renewable energy — I have big goals. And I tell you how I'm going to get there and how I'm going to pay for them. And I think that is what the Americans want. I'm not going to sit here and overpromise and under-deliver. I'm going to tell you what I know we can achieve, and that's going to take the political system we have right now, and then I intend to bring in more people, as always have, George. When I ran for Senate the first time, you remember, you know, people didn't give me much of a chance. I won and then when I was reelected, I won with a bigger percentage. And then when I was Secretary of State, even the Republicans said I was doing a good job. So I understand politics. I understand a campaign. I am focused on my mission to make sure this country works for everybody, particularly hardworking middle-class families who rightly feel they've been left out and left behind. I think I know how to do that, and I think the voters know that I know how to do that.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Secretary Clinton, thanks for joining us this morning.\nCLINTON: Great to talk to you, George. Thank you.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And we will be right back with Bernie Sanders.", "timestamp": "2016-01-31", "title": "Interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News \"This Week\""}

Combined with plans to overhaul government bureaucracy, the tax code, education and health care, these strategies represent Dr. Carson's extraordinary vision to empower 'We the People' to re-invigorate the nation. The plan is available for download here.\nFor decades, career politicians have watched as our borders have been overrun by illegal immigration and drug and weapons trafficking. Politicians in Washington have turned a blind eye to our borders, the American people have paid the price. At the same time, politicians have held immigration policies hostage to political gamesmanship.\nAs a political outsider, Dr. Carson will finally fix America's broken immigration system. His plan is built around five central tenets: 1) securing the border, 2) implementing sensible admission and removal procedures, 3) offering a solution for the large illegal immigrant population already here in the United States, 4) addressing legal immigration and 5) restoring the concept of the American melting pot. By adhering to these principles, Dr. Carson will ensure that entrants to our country are properly vetted and documented, while preserving America's legacy as a nation welcoming of anyone who respects our nation, our laws and our ideals.\n\"We simply cannot afford to ignore our broken immigration system any longer,\" said Dr. Carson. \"Career politicians in Washington have opted to play games rather than solve the problems unregulated immigration has caused for the American people. As President, I will restore faith in America's laws through fair and equal enforcement, while investing the resources and personnel necessary to protect and seal our border. Our founders sought a nation of immigrants and laws. I share their vision, and will return this country back to the hands of 'We the People.'\"\nThis immigration plan is Dr. Carson's fourth policy prescription.

That's a record at this point in the campaign for any White House candidate.\nUnlike other campaigns which rely heavily on wealthy donors who give the maximum allowed by law, more than 99.9 percent of Sanders' donors can give again. In sharp contrast, Federal Election Commission reports indicate that more than 3 in 5 dollars given to Hillary Clinton come from donors who already have given her the maximum allowed by law.\n\"The numbers we've seen since Jan. 1 put our campaign on pace to beat Secretary Clinton's goal of $50 million in the first quarter of 2016,\" said Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager. \"Working Americans chipping in a few dollars each month are not only challenging but beating the greatest fundraising machine ever assembled.\"\nWhile the Sanders campaign is supported by millions of small-dollar contributions, Clinton left the campaign trail in Iowa one day last week to hold a fundraiser in Philadelphia sponsored by leading executives of a large investment firm. It's not yet known how much she added at that event to her reported $17 million in campaign contributions over the years from Wall Street and financial services interests.\nSanders also has refused to coordinate with a super PAC which Clinton and other candidates have used to take unlimited contributions from millionaires and billionaires. For example, Priorities USA Action, a super PAC backing Clinton, claimed on Friday to have nearly $45 million cash on hand. Donors have pledged at least $42 million in additional contributions that would give her a bigger super PAC war chest than any Democratic fund ever before.\n\"As Secretary Clinton holds high-dollar fundraisers with the nation's financial elite, our supporters have stepped up in a way that allows Bernie to spend the critical days before the caucuses talking to Iowans about his plans to fix a rigged economy and end a corrupt system of campaign finance,\" Weaver said. \"Bernie's campaign is built for the long haul and we look forward to bringing his message to voters all across the nation, and to drawing millions of new people into the Democratic Party primary process,\" he added.\nSanders' campaign on Sunday will file a year-end Federal Election Commission report showing that almost $33.6 million was raised in the fourth quarter of 2015. Seventy percent came from contributors giving $200 or less. Only 1.3 percent of the campaign's fourth quarter donations came from maxed-out contributors.\nWhile the Clinton campaign has not released information about the breakdown of its campaign contributions, its most recent report indicated that only 17.4 percent of the money raised came from small-dollar, un-itemized contributions. Her third quarter report indicated that about 60 percent of her money came from donors who already have contributed the maximum allowed by law and may not give again to her primary campaign.\nTo read the report, click here.", "timestamp": "2016-01-31", "title": "Press Release - Sanders' Campaign Raises $20 Million in January, FEC Report Showcases Small-Dollar Fundraising Power"}

Hillary will send us down the same path of destruction as Obama, and Bernie will send us down an even worse path - if worse is even possible!\nEvery adult American needs to see the movie \"13 Hours,\" then ask yourself: \"Where was Hillary during the Benghazi attacks and does her type of AWOL leadership demonstrate what we need as commander in chief, especially with ISIS and al-Nusra on the hunt for Americans here and abroad?\"\nTo me, any one of the GOP candidates would make a good president. Some of them could even be great. All of them would be far superior to Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders.\nOf course, my personal favorite is Mike Huckabee. Most know my wife, Gena, and I were on the campaign trail with Mike for five months in 2008. During that time, we clearly saw his vision and concern for our country as well as his executive experience to unite and lead our country forward. Mike had, and continues to have, a message that resonates with the American people and is a man of great authentic character.\nChuck Norris provides real solutions to our county's problems and a way to reawaken the American dream in his best-seller, \"Black Belt Patriotism.\"\nMike's qualifications include:\nHe has supreme executive leadership experience as governor of Arkansas from 1996 to 2007.\nHe has already run against the Clinton machine multiple times throughout his years as governor of Arkansas.\nHe is pro-Israel, pro-military and knows the Middle East better than any candidate.\nHe has already won the Iowa caucus (2008).\nHe's been fighting conservative causes his entire adult life. The 22 conservative leaders cited in the National Review could never make a case against Huckabee as a principled consistent conservative.\nHe's rallied millions of citizens for years behind various fights for freedom, family and faith via his Fox News \"Huckabee\" show.\nIn 2008, very few people knew who Mike Huckabee was, but because of the \"Huckabee\" show, over the last six years Mike has become very well known and has his own notoriety to draw crowds to hear his message.\nWhat most people seem to have forgotten is that Mike came in second place behind John McCain in the 2008 GOP primaries. In fact, when the totals came in, Mike had \"more than 20 percent of all the votes cast nationwide.\" He not only won Iowa, but swept many of the southern states on Super Tuesday.\nI believe Mike would have won the nomination if Sen. Fred Thompson had not jumped in the race at the last minute to siphon off votes in South Carolina. It appeared to be a strategy implemented by the GOP establishment.\nHistorian Dr. Timothy Stanley agreed. He cited Aaron Blake from the Washington Post, who explained how Huckabee \"had a tremendous potential that went unrealized in '08. Huckabee quit early due to a shortage of cash, so we never got to see how well he could run in a great number of states. Moreover, his early performances were hindered by the candidacy of Fred Thompson - a dour, sour old stick who only seemed to be in the race to hurt Huckabee. It's fair to say that Thompson denied Huckabee a win in South Carolina and thus the momentum he needed to go the distance.\"\nAnd to the person who might say, \"But Mike is presently trailing in the polls,\" I'd ask: \"Since when have polls hijacked the American voter before he or she even votes?\"\nJust because the media have tried to narrow down the choices doesn't mean the voters have to. We all want to be on a winning team, but we should never hand over our convictions and votes because media or pundits tell us there are only two or three viable candidates.\nMike may not be the \"flavor of the day\" to the temperamental media or cause a media frenzy like certain candidates do. However, highlighting hype is no substitute for substance, and substance is what we need more than ever in the Oval Office. We already know what voting for smoke and mirrors can get us: Obama.\nOne of the things I repeatedly tell people is: Vote your conviction even if it's not what's most popular, and rest assure that America's founders and God Himself back you because you're being true to who you are and what you believe.\nI've wondered if Ronald Reagan himself could be elected in today's political environment. I would propose that Huckabee is actually more like Reagan than any other candidate, and I'm not alone.\nIn his article, \"Is Huckabee the Next Reagan?,\" historian Dr. Timothy Stanley summarized Mike's uniqueness among the presidential candidates: \"But none of these men has Huckabee's unique ability to speak through the television cameras and straight to the viewer at home. And, aside from Santorum, none of them has run for the nomination before. Republicans are typically cautious voters who encourage a candidate to run twice, or even thrice, before nominating them: … George H.W. Bush and Reagan were veterans of the presidential primaries. As such, Huckabee enters this race with a key asset: He's a conservative statesman. His history alone ought to guarantee him top-tier status.\"\nFew knew Ronald Reagan better than Ed Rollins, who served in the administrations of Presidents Nixon, Ford and Reagan, including serving two tours of duty at the highest level of the White House as assistant to the president and White House political director. Rollins also served as the national campaign director to Ronald Reagan in the 1984 presidential election in which Reagan won 49 states.\nRollins described Huckabee in this way: \"Gov. Huckabee has probably inspired me as much as Ronald Reagan … he can connect with ordinary voters. I was with the old Reagan and I can promise you this man comes as close as anyone to filling those shoes.\"\nMike truly is a first-class patriot and a renowned man of integrity. Our country can use his caliber of character in the White House, not only to help restore the Oval Office but also our nation.In the end, whoever the American voters decide will be their choice for the Republican candidacy, I will certainly support and encourage others to do the same. Like I said, any of them will be good for our country. And it is only by rallying around that single GOP candidate that we are going to ensure the presidential win and restoration of our country.", "timestamp": "2016-01-31", "title": "Press Release - Chuck Norris: This Man Should Be Our Next President"}

{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116887", "text": "\"I could keep you here until tomorrow morning telling you these stories.\"\nPresident Bill Clinton has been by Hillary's side since law school—and as he puts it, she's the \"single best changemaker\" he's ever known. At a recent campaign stop, he shared a few lesser-known stories about Hillary's ability to make things happen.\nExample one: better schools for Arkansas\nWhen he was governor of Arkansas, he put Hillary in charge of coming up with new state educational standards. She traveled to every county in the state to talk to parents and teachers, and she came up with a plan to improve the public schools:\nAnd her hard work paid off for the students of Arkansas; the state became one of the most improved school systems in the nation.\nExample two: juvenile prison reform\nAs one of her first jobs out of law school, Hillary went to work for the Children's Defense Fund. She traveled to prisons in South Carolina to investigate why African American teenagers were being jailed as adults—and her work helped to change federal law.\nExample three: expanding early childhood education\nWhen he became governor, a lot of poor and rural Arkansas counties didn't have preschool or kindergarten, meaning many kids weren't getting off to the strongest possible start. Hillary made it her mission to change that. She came home one day and told him:\nThe program was called HIPPY (Home Instruction for Parents of Preschool Youngsters), and Hillary was determined to bring it to Arkansas children.\nHillary got the program started in Arkansas, and soon it became a model for states across the country.\nThe story is a classic example of Hillary's determination and ability to make change happen. And President Clinton has plenty more examples where that came from.\nWatch President Clinton tell all three stories about Hillary:\nShe is the best qualified person for this moment in history I have ever seen. And I have studied all my predecessors.\nThe average person who gets elected president is intelligent, hardworking, and honestly tries to do what they say they're gonna do when they get there, but there's a big difference in a who can do and who can't.\nHere's what I know about Hillary. She's the single best changemaker I've ever met in my life, and we need a changemaker, not a change talker a changemaker.\nSo I'll tell you a couple of stories you may not know. A court said our schools weren't properly financed in Arkansas, and we we're going to have to reallocate the money. I put Hillary in charge of coming up with new standards; she went to every county in the state, made all the people who didn't want to change mad, presented it to the legislature. The crusty old head of the education committee in the legislature said it was so good that maybe we had elected the wrong member of our family. There's something to be said for that. Anyway.\nNine years later I come to Iowa, running for president telling you, one reason you ought to vote for me is that the same guy had just given us a report saying the two most improved school systems in America were in Arkansas and South Carolina. She did that, not me. She had never been elected to anything; she just always made something good happen.\nShe went to South Carolina to see why all these African American teenagers were being jailed as adults; 13, 14, 15 years old being kept for years in adult prisons. And she went back and they changed that too. She hadn't been elected to anything but she was making change. That's just the beginning I could keep you here until tomorrow morning telling you these stories.\nIt's hard work. It's policy. The country needs somebody who can actually get something done.\nShe comes in one day just jumping up and down happy. She said, \"You know, I've been so worried we have six of the 20 poorest counties in America.\" She said, \"These kids are going to school, they're not able to learn. There's no kindergarten, there's certainly no pre-kindergarten and there's no preschool. I found it. I found a preschool program in Israel that teaches people to be their children's first teachers even if they're illiterate. I think it would work here.\" I said, \"Well, what are we gonna do?\" She said, \"I did it. I called the woman who started it, she'll be here in 10 days and we're gonna start this program.\" Now ...\nHere's what happened. Next thing I know I'm going to these little graduations for preschoolers. Next thing you know it's in 26 states, it's still thriving. And there are thousands of people in this country today who have learned more and grew up just because of her. And they have no clue, and she didn't care, and she hadn't been elected to anything. She just made something good happen.\nYou're entitled to give all these remarks the love discount if you want. But everything I have told you I believe with all my heart. She's the best person to win the election, the best person to implement the changes we need, economically and socially, the best person to preserve the gains we've made under President Obama. But mostly, I want you to do what's best for you. Most of the people in this audience have more tomorrows than yesterdays.\nThose of us who have more yesterdays than tomorrows, believe it or not, spend most of our time thinking about the future. And I believe it would be a gift that would keep on giving, because she made everything she ever touched better.
