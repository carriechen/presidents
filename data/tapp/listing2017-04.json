Last fall, thanks to all of you -- thanks to your hard work, your support, and your prayers -- Ohio voted to make Donald Trump the 45th President of the United States of America. (Applause.)\nI spoke to the President this morning, and he asked me just simply to say thank you -- and to tell you, to promise you, we will never forget the support of the great people of the Buckeye State. (Applause.)\nAnd let me say thank you to Senator Rob Portman for that kind introduction and for joining us today. The people of Ohio appreciate your principled leadership, and Karen and I truly cherish our friendship with you and Jane. Would you give Senator Rob Portman another vigorous round of applause for his great leadership? (Applause.)\nSpeaking of my wife, Karen, she's really sorry she couldn't be with us today. She already had dinner plans. (Laughter.) All kidding aside, my wife of 31 years is an amazing woman.\nThis week alone, she traveled across the country to support military families and also went out and stood by children recovering from serious illness. I'm just so proud of her, and my wife and I are so grateful for your support and your prayers for our little family. Thank you all. (Applause.)\nLet me also thank to my friend of so many years Congressman Pat Tiberi. He's a member of the ways and means committee. He is chairman of the health subcommittee. He's chairman of the joint economic committee. He's one of the most respected voices on tax reform in the United States Congress, Pat Tiberi, the hometown congressman. Thank you so much, Pat. (Applause.)\nAnd thank you to Mayor Brad McCloud for being here today and for your great leadership of this great community. It's a privilege to have all of you with us today, and the President and I are grateful for your support.\nAnd finally, thank you to Gary James and the whole Dynalab team here for hosting us here today. Dynalab is a true American success story. Since 1981, you all have been doing here what our country does best -- taking big ideas and bringing them to life on the factory floor.\nIt's amazing to see what you've accomplished. Over 300 employees in a state-of-the-art facility, a great reputation -- congratulations to the whole Dynalab team. You are American Dream, and we congratulate you on your success. (Applause.)\nJust so great to be with all the job creators that we met with for conversation earlier today, many of whom are still with us. People like the Flag Lady are here -- Mary Leavitt, from The Flag Lady Store; and Raine Neenan, from Tommy's Pizza. I can personally testify that that is a great business. And all these great business leaders, thank you for coming out today and sharing your perspective on the challenges and opportunities we have to turn this economy loose.\nSo let me say from my heart, it is the greatest privilege of my life to be Vice President to President Donald Trump. (Applause.) It's humbling for me to say it. The President of the United States is my friend. He loves his family. He loves this country with boundless energy, optimism, courage, and determination. And President Trump has a three-part agenda. I hear about it every day: Jobs, Jobs, and Jobs! And it's happening right here in Ohio already. (Applause.)\nIt's just amazing. The first two jobs reports under President Donald Trump are already out showing that nearly 500,000 jobs have been created this year -- including more than 135,000 new jobs in construction and manufacturing. (Applause.)\nThanks to our new President, it's been a great week for American jobs. On Monday, Ford Motor Company announced it would invest $1.2 billion right here in America to protect and create nearly 4,000 jobs. On Tuesday, the President signed a historic executive order to put America on the path to energy independence -- and give American job creators the kind of low-cost power that they need to grow. And yesterday, the President took decisive action to level the playing field on international trade. Under President Donald Trump, trade will mean jobs, but it's going to mean American jobs and put American workers first. (Applause.)\nAnd American businesses are already getting the message. The President and I just yesterday were joined by the leadership of the National Association of Manufacturers, and they announced that manufacturing companies haven't been this optimistic in more 20 years. (Applause.) Get this -- 93 percent of manufacturers are excited about what they have in store in President Trump's leadership.\nAnd so are the American people. People in this country haven't been this confident about our economy since the year 2000.\nAnd they should be excited because President Trump knows what all of you know -- that when manufacturing is strong, America is strong. And he's fighting every day to bring American manufacturing back.\nPresident Trump meant it when he said on Tuesday \"we believe in those really magnificent words: Made in the USA.\" (Applause.)\n? Manufacturers are the engine of our economy, and thanks to President Trump, that engine is about to roar. It's not just this past week, but literally since day one, President Trump has been fighting to get our economy moving again. He's been signing bill after bill to roll back excessive regulations enacted in the closing days of the Obama administration.\nHe ordered every agency in Washington, D.C. to find two regulations to get rid of before issuing any new red tape on American business and American job creators. (Applause.)\nAnd just last week, President Trump authorized the Keystone pipeline, creating tens of thousands of American jobs and strengthening America's energy future.\nHe's taken decisive action to protect American jobs and American workers, as well, by enforcing the laws of this country for the citizens of this country, and illegal immigration is already down by 60 percent since President Trump was elected. (Applause.)\n? And we're just getting started. Since the day the President was elected, he's worked tirelessly to keep his promise to repeal and replace Obamacare. (Applause.)\nThe President and I know what all of you know -- that every day Obamacare survives is another day that the American people struggle. We all know the truth about this failed law. Higher prices, lost plans, fewer choices -- Obamacare is a burden on the people of Ohio and it's a burden on Ohio's job creators.\nThat's why the President has worked so hard to keep his promise to the American people to repeal and replace Obamacare with something that actually works.\nI've been incredibly inspired by the President's hands-on leadership on this issue. And the President and I are so grateful -- we're so grateful to Speaker Paul Ryan and all the House Republicans, like Congressman Pat Tiberi, who stood with us over the past month to begin the end of Obamacare. Thank you, Congressman. (Applause.)\n? But as we saw about a week ago, Congress wasn't quite ready. With 100 percent of House Democrats -- every single one -- and a handful of Republicans, Congress basically said that they weren't ready yet to begin the end of Obamacare. It really is a shame. But as Congressman Tiberi just said to me a few minutes ago, it ain't over yet. (Applause.)\nObamacare is going to continue to explode, putting a great weight on millions of Americans. But the President and I have faith. We have faith that Congress is going to step and do the right thing. Even as we speak, I'm told the members of Congress are forging ahead -- working to craft legislation that will usher in the end of Obamacare. So be assured of this, folks here in the Buckeye State, when Congress finally decides to repeal and replace Obamacare, President Trump and I will be ready to work with them hand in glove. (Applause.)\nYou can take it to the bank: President Trump is never going to stop fighting to keep the promises he made to the American people -- and we will make America great again. We will repeal and replace Obamacare and give the American people the world-class health-care they deserve.\nAnd once Obamacare is gone, we're going to cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses, manufacturers, and family farms. (Applause.) We're going to work with these great leaders in the Congress to pass the biggest tax cut since the days of Ronald Reagan. We'll make the tax code flatter and simpler and fairer for everybody.\nThere's an old joke about how the tax code is 10 times the size of the Bible, with none of the good news. (Laughter and applause.)\nWell, here's some real good news -- President Trump's plan is going to put more money in your pocket and make American business competitive again.\nWe're going to cut the corporate tax rate in America, one of the highest in the world, so that companies in American jobs can invest and create opportunities for America's workers right here in Ohio. (Applause.)\nAnd President Trump is going to keep slashing through the red tape that's strangling Ohio's small businesses and manufacturers. The truth is that bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. are too often standing in the way of job creators, making it harder for them to grow and thrive.\nYou know, complying with federal mandates actually costs businesses like this one here over $13,000 dollars a year for every single employee. All told, red tape from Washington, D.C. actually costs the economy over $2 trillion dollars a year. That's enough money to create more than 24 million new good-paying manufacturing jobs. But it's wasted on pushing papers and jumping through government hoops.\nFolks, that's just not right, and that's why President Donald Trump is getting government out of the way. He's reining in unelected bureaucrats so they can no longer cripple Ohio's economy from the comfort of their taxpayer-funded metal desks in Washington, D.C., and we're going to keep that fight going. (Applause.)\nAnd as President Trump announced just this week, a new era of American energy has begun -- the war on coal is over. (Applause.)\nYou know, it's really heartbreaking to think that nearly a quarter of Ohio's coal miners have lost their jobs in the past few years, and that nearly half the state's mines have shut down. Countless Ohio families have been forced to watch good-paying jobs disappear from their communities. But now they have hope.\nFrom the first day of this administration, President Trump has been fighting for Ohio and fighting for American energy. The executive order President Trump signed on Tuesday will end Washington's assault on affordable energy and give hardworking Americans and manufacturers the relief they need.\nAnd President Trump is going to put coal miners back to work. As he likes to say, we all like to say: President Trump digs coal. (Laughter.)\nWe're going to unlock our country's amazing national resources -- not just coal, but shale oil, natural gas, clean coal, you name it -- because lower energy costs mean more jobs, more growth, and more opportunity for American families and American businesses.\nAnd folks, under President Donald Trump, we're also going to rebuild America. If you haven't noted it, the American people elected a builder to be President of the United States. And with his Hire American, Buy American strategy, we're going to work with the Congress, and we're going to give our nation the best roads, the best bridges, the best highways and airports that America has ever had. (Applause.)\nThanks to President Trump, we're going to have jobs and growth and prosperity like never before. But making America great again isn't just about our economy. It also means standing with those who are protecting our communities, our nation, and protecting our way of life.\nI can tell you -- I'm with him every day -- President Trump has no higher priority than the safety and security of the American people. That's why the President every single day is standing with the men and women in law enforcement here in Ohio and all across this country. (Applause.)\nWe've got a fair amount of men and women in uniform who are with us today. Would you all mind getting on your feet and showing these men and women in law enforcement just how much we appreciate the job they do protecting our families each and every day? (Applause.)\n? President Trump is strengthening our borders. He's building a wall, enforcing our laws, and as he said in his joint address to Congress, we're taking measures to remove all the \"gang members, drug dealers, and criminals who threaten our communities and prey on our citizens\" off the streets of Ohio and off the streets of America. (Applause.)\nWe're working with law enforcement every day -- Immigrations and Customs Enforcement to accomplish that.\nBeyond our borders, I have to tell you, I couldn't be more grateful, couldn't be more proud, as the father of a United States Marine, that we now have a President who will rebuild our military, restore the arsenal of democracy, and give our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard the resources and the training they need to accomplish their mission and come home safe. (Applause.)\nAnd here in the homeland, in the wake of last November's terrorist-inspired attack on the grounds of Ohio State, I just want to assure all of you here in this community under President Donald Trump's leadership, America is standing strong and taking the fight to the terrorists on our terms, on their soil -- and ISIS is on the run. (Applause.)\nAnd I'll make you a promise. President Donald Trump will not rest and will not relent until we hunt down and destroy ISIS at its source so it can no longer project violence around the world or inspire violence here at home. (Applause.)\nSo it's jobs. It's health care. It's energy, and it's the national security.\nAnd this President is also keeping his promise to appoint a strict constructionist to the Supreme Court in the tradition of the late and great Justice Antonin Scalia. (Applause.)\nBy nominating Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Trump has kept his word to appoint to the Supreme Court a justice who will keep faith with our Constitution and uphold the God-given liberties enshrined there.\nNext week the United States Senate will take his confirmation up. Let me just say emphatically, as America saw in those hearings just a little more than a week ago, Judge Neil Gorsuch is one of the most respected, qualified, and mainstream nominees to the Supreme Court in American history. (Applause.) It's true.\nBut remarkably, yesterday your very own senator, Sherrod Brown, announced that he and the obstructionist Democrats in the Senate plan to filibuster Judge Gorsuch's nomination as an associate justice -- something that's never been successfully done in American history.\n? But let me say the President and I are confident, with the strong support of Senator Rob Portman, we know: For the sake of our Supreme Court, for the sake of our country, for the sake of our Constitution, we will overcome the obstructionists. And the United States Senate will confirm Judge Neil Gorsuch -- one way or the other. (Applause.)\nMy friends, the record is clear: President Donald Trump is a man of his word, and he's a man of action.\nBefore I wrap up, there's one other issue I'd like to address that I know also hits close to home here in Ohio, just as it did back in my home state of Indiana. I want you all to know, as America saw this week from the Cabinet Room in Washington, D.C., President Trump is working every day to end the opioid crisis that's ruining lives and tearing apart families and communities across Ohio and across America. Ohio knows all about the tragic consequences of this crisis. Over 2,500 Ohioans died from an opioid overdose in 2015, one of the hardest hit states in the nation. It grieves my heart to think of it. Tens of thousands more still suffer in the grip of addiction.\nLet me say your own senator, Rob Portman, and Congressman Tiberi have been true leaders on this issue, and we're grateful for their leadership -- helping countless people through their work on Capitol Hill. And the President and I are grateful for their strong and compassionate leadership, as I know all of you are. (Applause.)\nOn Wednesday of this week in the Cabinet Room in the White House, President Trump and I met with a group of people who've seen opioid addiction up close and personal. We heard the inspiring stories of Vanessa and AJ, two young people who courageously overcame drug addiction, found hope and healing through counseling and medication to break the grip of addiction on their lives.\nAnd tragically, we also heard from a mom, Pam Garozzo, who lost her son Carlos, the light of her life, a young man of incredible promise and creativity, to the scourge of drug addiction. President Trump told Pam -- with real emotion, he said, Pam, \"your son will not have died in vain.\" And that very day, the President announced the creation of the President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Abuse.\n? Under President Trump's leadership, we're bringing together public servants, medical experts, community leaders. And we will find innovative solutions to stop the flow of drugs into our communities and help families who need it most.\nAs the President said in his joint address to the Congress, in his own words, we will \"stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth, and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.\" Those two promises will be kept by this President and this administration. (Applause.)\nUnder President Donald Trump's leadership, I just know our communities, our country are on the road to healing.\nMy friends, we've really come to a pivotal moment in our nation's history. I believe with all my heart in this moment, we need every freedom-loving American -- we need all of you -- to stand up and to speak out.\nWe need you to tell the world that you believe we can do better, that you know it; that President Trump and his vision can renew and restore this country and put us on a path to a brighter future.\nFor my part, I know we're going to get it done because I have faith. As your Ohio State motto says, \"With God, all things are possible.\" (Applause.)\nOne of my favorite verses in the Old Book, comes out of the Book of Jeremiah. It's actually -- it was a gift from my wife the first year I was elected to Congress. It was the same year as your congressman, back in the year 2000. It hung over the mantle of our little home in Indiana when I served in Washington, D.C. It hung over the mantle in the Governor's Residence. And now these words hang over the mantle in the residence of the Vice President of the United States.\nIt simply says: \"For I know the plans I have for you, plans to prosper you, and not to harm you, plans to give you a hope, and a future.\"\nThose words a millennia ago have been words that Americans throughout our history have clung to, and I believe they're as true today as they were throughout our history.\nIn November, the people of Ohio voted to give America a President with the strength, the courage, and the vision to make America safe again. You voted to give us a new leader who will make America prosperous again. And I believe with all my heart, that with your continued support, and with God's help, together we will make America great again. (Applause.)\nThank you very much. Thank you for being here today. God bless you and God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)", "timestamp": "2017-04-01", "title": "Remarks by the Vice President at Dynalab Incorporated in Reynoldsburg, Ohio"}

{"author": "Sean Spicer", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123695", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n2:37 P.M. EDT\nMR. SPICER: Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome back. Got a busy week ahead of us. Before I get started, I want to just give you a quick update on something I know in the past there's been several questions about the President donating his salary to charity. I got an update for you on that.\nTo that end, the President has spoken with Counsel and made the decision to donate his first-quarter salary, in total, to a government entity, and he has chosen this quarter to donate it to the National Park Service. The Park Service has cared for our parks since 1916, and the President is personally proud to contribute the first quarter of his salary to the important mission of the Park Service, which is preserving our country's national security.\nSo it is my pleasure, on behalf of the President of the United States, to present a check for $78,333 to the Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, and Superintendent of the Harper's Ferry Park site, Superintendent Brandyburg.\nQ: After taxes?\nMR. SPICER: No, it's straight up. It is every penny that the President received from the first quarter since the day he was --\nQ: But it's not a full quarter.\nMR. SPICER: Yeah, right, because the Constitution says that -- (laughter) -- sorry, that was -- so it's from January 20th, noon, forward.\nSECRETARY ZINKE: We think it will cash, though. (Laughter.)\nMR. SPICER: With that, I'm going to let Secretary Zinke make a few comments about the Department of Interior and the work that they're doing.\nSECRETARY ZINKE: Well, thanks. I'm Secretary Zinke, from the Department of Interior, for those who don't know me. Obviously, great to be with you. Those who don't know, I get my inspiration from Teddy Roosevelt. And the motto now in the Department of Interior, if you go to Yellowstone and you have the opportunity to look at the Roosevelt Arch, it says, inscribed in stone is: \"For the benefit and enjoyment of the people.\" And that's our pledge.\nSo for those who aren't familiar with the Department of Interior, we span 12 time zones, from the Virgin Islands, all the way to Palau. And within our holdings are 20 percent of the nation's land. We have 417 national parks, we have 562 federally recognized Indian nations, 567 wildlife refuges, and 221 wilderness areas. And I'm the steward of our nation's finest and most majestic holdings.\nAfter riding on a horse on my first day -- we were pretty busy -- just on public lands alone, I signed directions, on the first day, to expand public access -- important if you're in the West, especially in the far West, as Montana is. We've made sure we increased opportunities for traditional hunting, fishing, and conservation efforts. And we've invested millions across 12 states on preserving our conservation efforts there.\nOn energy, much of last week was spent on energy. We held one of our most successful leases -- 122,000 acres for wind development on federal lands, off Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. We also stopped the war on coal by continuing a coal leasing program. And I established an oversight committee to review and analyze across the board rents, royalties on our federal lands, with the objective of, number one, being transparent; number two, being Reagan -- trust, but verify; and number three, making sure the taxpayers that own the public lands are getting fair value.\nOn the management side, we have unfortunately uncovered a lot of internal controls that weren't there. There's been in the news several incidents of sexual harassment and a culture of discrimination. And you can hear it from me -- I put policies forth -- zero tolerance for sexual harassment or discrimination. We have 70,000 full-time employees, and each employee deserves the right to enter a workplace that's innovative, teamwork, but free from harassment.\nOn the brighter side, we will pilot the first-ever dog-friendly Department of Interior. Puppy Day is coming up, so we've established that. And people ask, why are you doing that? Well, in some way we compete on millennials. So we're trying to develop ourselves as a friendly department that's going to work with people, who are going to be an advocate for collaboration. And in doing that, we're going to start with being dog-friendly. And also, we've taken to Twitter. As you know, this administration is Twitter-friendly, and so am I -- @SecretaryZinke. (Laughter.)\nAnd finally, as a veteran myself, I tell you, I am thrilled at the President's decision to donate the check he did today. I did talk to the President last night, and he has decided, as you know, to donate his entire quarter salary. And we're going to dedicate it and put it against the infrastructure on our nation's battlefields. We're about $100 [million] or $229 million behind in deferred maintenance on our battlefields alone, and that's on our 25 national battlefields. And we're excited about that opportunity.\nSo thank you very much for the opportunity to be with you, and thank you for -- the American people to trust the stewardship of our nation's greatest holdings with us.\nSo I'd like to thank our Superintendent Brandyburg for being here. He's Harper's Ferry. If you haven't been out there, please do.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Sean and I will take questions.\nQ: How is that war on coal been working there? You're saying that you're going to open it up because of the war on coal. Isn't that kind of contrary to what Teddy Roosevelt wanted and preserving land?\nSECRETARY ZINKE: Well, there's no doubt -- three things. One is, environmentally it's better to produce energy here under reasonable regulation than watch it get produced overseas with none. Secondly, jobs matter. There's a social cost of not having a job. In some communities, coal mining, forestry are the only jobs. And you can take it from the Crow Nation in Montana, which I'm familiar with. Chairman Old Coyote -- the chairman once said, a war on coal is a war on Crow Nation, and coal jobs are the only jobs.\nAnd lastly, national security. It is, from a SEAL perspective, it is better to make sure we're not held hostage on our energy needs in this country. And like you, I don't want my kids -- sons and daughters -- to have to fight for war or energy resources we have here. So national security is critical in our energy picture. And look, the world is safer when America is stronger, and America stronger is not being dependent on foreign services for energy. We can do it here right, and we will. I'm the steward, and certainly we're not going to sell or transfer public land. And I don't pick winners and losers.\nSo coal isn't getting any more of a better deal than anything else. We'll let the market play. But I want to make sure that what we do is cost-effective and it produces reliable, abundant, and affordable energy.\nQ: But I think, to the point, are you going to return the land to its original, pristine value when you're done?\nSECRETARY ZINKE: I'm a Boy Scout. So I was taught long ago that when you leave a campground, you leave it in the same or better condition than you found it. And that's why we're looking at royalties to make sure we have a reclamation program that makes sense. All of us want clean air, clean water. And I'm concerned, as well as you are, to make sure what we're doing is in the best interest of the public in perpetuity.\nLast question.\nQ: Have you thought about re-designating the Gold Butte Monument in Nevada?\nSECRETARY ZINKE: We are looking at everything across the board. When I came in, there was a lot of talk about different monuments in different places, and I talked to the senators. And so everything is on the board, looking at it. No monument in specific, but looking at the process, looking at the law, making sure that the monuments follow the law. And at the end of the day, it's important that we operate collaboratively.\nIf you're outside of Washington, D.C., there's a lot of anger out there. And I want the Department of Interior, our rangers and land managers, to be first viewed as rangers and land managers, not law enforcement. I don't want us to be heavy-handed. And I want us to work with local communities, because that's where we're embedded. Our rangers, they have children, they play soccer, they coach, they do all those things -- I want to make sure the Department of Interior is the department that works with local communities, works with the states, and we want to be the \"yep\" team; that means be an advocate rather than an adversary.\nThanks. We'll come back.\nMR. SPICER: Okay. I know it's already been a full first day back, but I want to run down a couple of quick things that happened over the weekend. We're fortunate to be championing many great causes during the month of April that are near and dear to the White House. We released several proclamations on Friday that are available at White House.gov.\nThis morning, specifically, the President proclaimed April 2nd through the 8th as National Crime Victims' Rights Week.\nOn Saturday, the President declared a major disaster in the state of California as a result of severe winter storm flooding and mudslides in February. Federal assistance will be supplementing recovery efforts in the area moving forward.\nAlso on Saturday, the Vice President traveled to Columbus, Ohio to discuss American jobs and the economy. He spoke with business leaders at DynaLab, an American-owned and operated electronic manufacturing services company. The Vice President told the crowd that the actions that the President has already taken to create jobs in this country make it easier to do business, from taking a serious look at the regulatory process to ushering in a new era of American energy.\nWith respect to today, the President, as you know, welcomed President Al-Sisi of Egypt to the White House this morning. The two Presidents had an honest discussion focused on areas of cooperation. The President made clear that this is a new day in the relationship between Egypt and the United States, and the President affirmed his strong support of the Egyptian people. It was a candid dialogue during which they discussed both areas of cooperation and of concern.\nAlso this morning, the White House released the official portrait of the First Lady, which is similarly available on White House.gov.\nAnd just about now, the President began a meeting with Secretary of State Tillerson, where they're expected to discuss several topics, including the Secretary's recent trip to Brussels where he attended the NATO foreign ministers meeting.\nAs you may have known, just prior to the briefing the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to advance the President's selection for Neil Gorsuch to the full Senate. While the White House was pleased that beyond the committee partisan vote, more Democrats have moved passed partisan obstruction to acknowledge that Judge Gorsuch is simply qualified and deserving to be on the bench, but we're obviously disappointed that the overwhelming majority of them are still playing politics with the nation's highest court. If the Democrats get their way -- and I know the numbers are looking that way -- this is going to be the first successful filibuster of a nominee to join the Supreme Court, which is clearly unprecedented.\nWith a vote on Judge Gorsuch expected Friday, the American people will see which senators are willing to keep this seat open to get in the way of President Trump making progress on one of his most significant choices so far.\nAlso, today opens the application process for this year's H1B visas. The President has spoken about the H1B visa program in the past. The White House acknowledges that there are issues with the program as it currently stands; however, there are several laws that are on the books that went unenforced in the previous administration. As the Department of Justice made clear and was released this morning, the Trump administration will be enforcing laws protecting American workers from discriminating hiring practices.\nLooking ahead to the schedule for the rest of the week, the President will host a CEO town hall meeting on the business climate tomorrow morning. And then in the afternoon, he'll make remarks to the 2017 North America's Building Trades Union National Legislative Conference.\nOn Wednesday, as I mentioned last week, he will host His Majesty King Abdullah II of Jordan. And on Thursday, after welcoming participants of the Wounded Warrior Project, Soldier Ride, the President will depart for a visit with President Xi of China to Mar-a-Lago.\nThe President has been briefed on the devastating flooding that has killed several hundred people in Colombia, and we are working closely with the governments of both Colombia and Peru to support efforts to address the extensive losses and damage caused by this natural disaster.\nThe President has also been briefed on today's attacks in the St. Petersburg metro. The United States condemns this reprehensible attack and act of violence. Our thoughts and prayers are with the injured and with the Russian people as we extend our deepest condolences to the loved ones who have been killed and injured.\nAttacks like these on ordinary citizens just going about their lives remind us that the world must work as one to combat violence in all forms. The United States is prepared to offer assistance to Russia that it may require in investigating this crime.\nAnd with that, I'll be glad to take your questions.\nCecilia.\nQ: Thanks. A couple questions on the same topic. Jared Kushner's trip to Iraq today -- why is he there and not the Secretary of State? What is the message that the President is sending by having Jared Kushner be the one to take this trip?\nMR. SPICER: I don't think -- it's not a binary choice. In this particular case, both Jared Kushner and Tom Bossert, the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security, are on the trip at the request and invitation of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who was going there and believed it was an opportunity for both of them. It's, ironically, the first trip for both Mr. Kushner and Mr. Bossert.\nThey're going to receive briefings and updates with respect to what's going on on the ground, our military involvement there, and our efforts to defeat ISIS. Jared is going to specifically express the commitment of U.S. -- of the United States to the government of Iraq, meet with U.S. personnel engaged in the campaign. And Mr. Bossert will participate in meetings and briefings to reinforce the strong U.S.-Iraqi partnership to defeat ISIS.\nBut it's not like this is a one-shot deal. In the course of conversation and extensive meetings, that invitation was extended and they took it up.\nQ: His portfolio is jam-packed. It has grown in recent weeks. Among the things that is our understanding that are in his portfolio is to broker Middle East peace and overhaul the federal government. Can he do all of these things?\nMR. SPICER: I think -- not to -- it's not like he does -- he has a team that he oversees, and I think there's a lot of areas that he has been working very diligently on behalf of the government, on behalf of the President's agenda. So going over and getting a firsthand understanding of the work that's being done -- to thank the government of Iraq, to see some of the sacrifice and progress that our team is making on the U.S. side -- is an opportunity that I think every government official and every member of the media should, frankly, take advantage of if offered that opportunity.\nMatt.\nQ: A recent ProPublica report out today revealed that President Trump can draw money from his businesses at any time without disclosing it. So on that, I have two questions. One, has the President withdrawn any money from his businesses since taking office? And two, can the White House commit that the President will disclose future withdrawals if they take place?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not sure what he's withdrawn. I think that -- I'm somewhat surprised in the sense that anyone would find it shocking. A blind trust, or any kind of trust, rather, the whole entire point of setting it up is that somebody can withdraw money. And that's, frankly, part of the point of setting it up.\nQ: Then why was this change not made -- it was made after -- (inaudible) --\nMR. SPICER: No, no, I do -- but again, I think that you just went and started to say \"this change was made.\" I'm not aware that there was any change. Just because a left-wing blog makes the point of something changing doesn't mean it actually happened. I'm not aware that there was ever a change in the trust. And the idea that the President is withdrawing money at some point is exactly the purpose of what the trust -- why a trust is set up regardless of an individual.\nQ: So just last question on this. So you're not saying whether or not it has changed? Just to clarify, you're not sure whether this was --\nMR. SPICER: No, no. I'm actually -- to the best of my knowledge, it hasn't changed.\nOlivier.\nQ: I got a couple for you. One, there are multiple reports that the administration is looking at arms packages for Taiwan, including missile defense and fighter jets. Can you confirm or clarify?\nMR. SPICER: No. I'm not going to discuss.\nQ: Okay. And then, last August, the President sharply criticized then-President Obama for not making more of a public case for human rights throughout the Muslim world -- throughout the Arab world. You guys have now said that it's better to raise those issues privately; I'm trying to understand the evolution of the thinking there. What changed his mind?\nMR. SPICER: What changed --\nQ: The President's mind.\nMR. SPICER: I think the President recognizes that those are conversations where we can -- as I said in the statement -- that there are areas of -- that we can work with in cooperation and concern. And that's best discussed privately in terms of how we address areas that need to be discussed like that in order to make progress on them. I don't think that should be a huge surprise.\nQ: Did he raise them in this meeting, do you know?\nMR. SPICER: Again, I'm not going to get into what they discussed privately, but I will tell you that we understand the concern, and I think those are the kind of things that I believe progress is made privately.\nSarah.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. I have two. One, has President Trump spoken with President Vladimir Putin about the terror attack in Russia?\nMR. SPICER: Not yet. I know that obviously the President of Egypt just left moments ago, prior to me coming out. But I do know that, as I mentioned at the top, our teams have been reaching out to both the government of Russia, the government of Colombia -- and I know that there has been some outreach, I believe, to the folks -- the government of Peru with respect to their situation, the mudslides there.\nAnd then obviously, the violence that occurred in Russia is something that we've already started reaching out from a government-to-government standpoint. If there is a call, we will make sure that we read that out.\nQ: Okay. And secondly, Senator Rand Paul has called the reports that Susan Rice ordered the unmasking of President Trump's associates a \"smoking gun.\" Does the President agree with that characterization? And what does he think of these reports?\nMR. SPICER: Yeah, I saw Senator Paul's tweet. Look, I think -- I want to make sure I'm clear and consistent. I think we've been trying to say that, from the get-go, that there's been an ongoing investigation that we have supported.\nLooking into this matter, I will say that we have continued to say that I think there is a troubling direction that some of this is going in, but we're going to let this review go on before we jump to it. But I think that it is interesting the level of -- or the lack of interest that I've seen in these developments when it goes in one direction versus where I think it was going -- where other amounts of interest that have come from this room and beyond. I am somewhat surprised in terms of the level of interest that I've seen from the press corps at one set of developments versus another set of developments.\nThat being said, I'm not going to start getting into a further discussion of that.\nBlake.\nQ: Sean, thanks. Let me pick up here. A couple questions, but I'll start here. Does the White House believe Susan Rice may have done anything illegal?\nMR. SPICER: I think -- I'm not going to -- appreciate the effort there. I'm not going to start going down that road. As we've said before, we go down one road, we need to go down them all. And I think at this point, we have supported this review that we've asked for.\nBut I do think that when you see the developments that we've seen in terms of the public, on-the-record comments that Dr. Farkas -- Evelyn Farkas, who is the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Defense for Russian Affairs, said very publicly that this was part of an attempt of the Obama administration to spread classified information, and then you see the developments that have happened today, I would just say that as, again, I'm -- somewhat more from a media standpoint -- somewhat intrigued by the lack of interest that we've seen in some of these public revelations in reporting that has gone in that direction that we've seen in some of the other directions that we've seen.\nThat being said, I'm not going to get into --\nQ: So let me ask you, as it relates to Neil Gorsuch, is the White House comfortable with the nuclear option potentially being invoked?\nMR. SPICER: The President said several weeks ago that this was something that he would support. We're comfortable in the sense that obviously that decision is up to Leader McConnell to make how he wants the Senate to deal with this. I think the Majority Leader's comments are very clear in the direction that he's heading in.\nBut I think this is -- we have entered a whole new league if this goes forward in terms of Democrats really going and saying -- it's one thing to vote against the nominee; we've seen that in the past, and I understand that. But we've now gone from the devolution of agreeing that there are certain people that a President has the right -- as long as they're qualified, right? We've seen that in the past; John Roberts, I think, got 78 votes.\nBut when you see that going one direction, versus now that there's literally going to be the first filibuster in modern times on a qualified judge that going to end up going on the court, we have really come a long way. And I think Democrats are setting a very dangerous precedent when it comes to how they want to do this. Because this isn't about voting against somebody or having an issue with them. It is literally trying to stop -- using the filibuster for something that it was never intended for. Nor has it ever really been the principle that we would vote down someone who was qualified.\nTrey.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. What is President Trump doing behind the scenes to make sure that his pick for the Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, ultimately is confirmed by the Senate? And what message does he have for Democrats on Capitol Hill who have said they're going to filibuster?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I mean, if you look at -- I think it's four Democrats that are now supporting, saying that they're going to vote against the filibuster. I think we feel good about that level of support.\nWe've, I think, done a very good job of making sure that we have the Republican majority support that we need to pass it. It is now an internal question for senators to determine how they want to do it. But make no mistake -- and I believe Leader McConnell when he says, on Friday, Judge Gorsuch will be voted as the next Supreme Court Justice.\nQ: Can you just take me through what Friday looks like for the President? Obviously, a major meeting with the President of China, but his eyes are going to be here on Washington. Is he going to making phone calls Thursday night trying to gauge the situation?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think he's going to be -- we look forward to heading down to Florida Thursday to engage in some bilateral and -- bilateral-plus meetings -- meetings with the President and his team from China. Obviously, that will continue into Friday morning. But we'll see how Friday evolves.\nBut again, I'm not -- I don't think there's any question right now, according to Leader McConnell and others, that we're going to have an associate justice of the Supreme Court ready to go. It's a question of how it happens.\nZeke.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Just a couple questions about the check presentation earlier in the briefing. You mentioned that, when he decided to give the money to the Park Service and had the advice of counsel. Is there going to be an issue with him making a donation to a non-profit?\nMR. SPICER: I think there was just -- that when given the options, he decided that there was a list of government entities that can accept donations. Ironically, it's not as easy to give money to the government as you would think -- aside from the IRS. (Laughter.) And then, I don't think you're giving.\nBut my point is, is that he looked through a variety, and for this quarter he chose the National Park Service. But it was a decision that he made based on -- his counsel presented him with several options, and he believed that -- as Secretary Zinke pointed out -- that there was some great work being done there, especially that needed to do to restore our great battlegrounds, and wanted to do his --\nQ: Speaking of giving money to the federal government, the President has been -- going to Mar-a-Lago again this weekend -- has been facing calls from both officials in New York and in Florida either to appropriate federal funds or request federal funds, which were not in the budget for the additional security burdens that they have faced, given his residence there, travels to those places, or to reimburse those local governments out of his own pocket. Obviously, this President is far wealthier than any President we've seen in modern times, and he has the capability to make those outlays. Is that something the President is considering, or has he decided to make those outlays to reimburse the --\nMR. SPICER: I think there's a few things. Number one, the request to go to Mar-a-Lago was something that was negotiated with the Chinese. And so I think this is a very high-level visit that really has a huge impact on both economic and national security.\nSecondly, the President has an opportunity, as all Presidents -- President Bush traveled to Crawford; President Obama went to Hawaii often -- this is not something that you can control. There is a security aspect that the Secret Service determines when the President and the family travels. That's not dictated by the President of the United States.\nAnd third, I would note, ironically, this is a day that the President just donated a significant amount of money of his salary back to the federal government. And so respectfully, it's like -- at what point does he do enough? He just gave a very sizable donation --\nQ: (Inaudible), though, that's a very small --\nMR. SPICER: But that's not how we judge -- I think to be able to say that -- he isn't taking a salary, I think he's stepped down from his business. He's walked away from a lot. I think at some point he's done quite a bit in terms of handing -- making a donation to the government.\nJohn.\nQ: Sean, back on Susan Rice, if I could. The fact that it's allegedly the former national security advisor who requested the unmasking when it came to the incidental collection of people who were associated with the Trump campaign and the Trump transition puts that now squarely in the White House. When you look at that, combine it with the NSC rules that were promulgated at the end of the Obama administration to more broadly share intelligence, does this White House look at what she allegedly requested as a national security issue or a political issue?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I'm not going to -- that's a nice backdoor into a line of questioning. I think until there's a finding of that, I don't want to start getting into the motives, because we still have a -- again, me getting to the motives assumes certain things in fact that I don't think we're ready to go to yet, because that, again, would be getting in the middle of an investigation.\nI do think that there's been enough public discussion and reporting on this stuff that I'm not going to comment on this any further until those committees have come to a conclusion of that sort. So we're not going to start going down -- guessing the motives of something that is not assumed in fact yet. But I do think that it is interesting, as I mentioned earlier, the level or lack thereof of interest in this subject versus what has been commented on previously in terms of alleged people involved and processes.\nSo I think there is -- Margaret.\nQ: Sean, you mentioned that Jared Kushner has a team working with him. Can you help us understand exactly what's in the portfolio and who's on the team? And I have a follow to that.\nMR. SPICER: Yeah, he's announced the Office of American Innovation the other day. We named a bunch of those folks that have been part of that team. And as you looked at various aspects of government, he works with different people in the White House that oversee different parts of that portfolio, whether it's part of the team that's doing the Middle East was one thing; you've got Jason Greenblatt, who's been traveling to the Middle East and other places to do that. There's people like Reed Cordish and Chris Liddell that are part of the team that are talking about the Office of American Innovation that he discussed last week with respect to opioid use and others.\nSo there is a team, depending on the subject, that is working with him, and he is providing oversight and direction.\nQ: So he's overseeing teams handling all these different issues -- whether it's Mexico, Canada, Israel, Palestine, Iraq, Saudi, all of that.\nMR. SPICER: Sure. Well, again, remember, on Iraq, don't go too far there. He was invited by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as was Tom Bossert, the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security, to see the work that's being done there firsthand. I don't think to sort of then translate it into \"he's overseeing Iraq\" is an accurate assessment.\nHe was invited to go see something by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and he's doing it.\nQ: But my follow on that is -- I appreciate how he's in such a unique position and so trusted by the President, but there are people who could look at the situation and say, the White House isn't meant to be run as a family business. There are institutions with experienced diplomats who have years of decades of linguistic and experience on the ground. Why --\nMR. SPICER: But with respect to that --\nQ: -- with whatever these issues are, the foreign policy issues in particular, that you laid out.\nMR. SPICER: But you just said -- right. Can you just be clear, though, because you just said \"with years of linguistic experience.\" So what situation are you specifically referring to?\nQ: That's partly why I was asking exactly what's in the portfolio. Because it's our understanding that Mr. Kushner is involved with Mexico, that he's involved with Saudi Arabia, that he's involved with Canada, that he's involved with a number of different issues -- China, in particular.\nMR. SPICER: I think that there has been, as he has made clear -- initially, during the transition, he played a very key role in helping facilitate a lot of those. But now that his State Department is up and running he has started to push a lot of those. But there's obviously people that are going to continue --\nQ: He's pushing those to the State Department?\nMR. SPICER: Absolutely. But there's a lot of relationships that Jared has made over time with different leaders -- Mexico being one of them you mentioned -- that are going to continue to have conversations with him and help facilitate. That doesn't mean by any means that it's being done without coordination with the State Department; quite, in fact, the opposite.\nHe continues to work with them and to facilitate an outcome, but he brings a perspective to this and began doing that during the transition. But again, it's not a binary choice where it's -- he's doing this at the expense of somebody else.\nQ: So he has a direct line to the President, whereas the other institutions are not.\nMR. SPICER: Okay, great, that's even better then. I think that's a win for our government.\nShannon.\nQ: On healthcare, has the President been reaching out, or anyone in the administration, to Democrats in Congress? Can you say specifically who? And does he still see the opportunity to work more closely with Democrats given the difficulties with the House Freedom Caucus?\nMR. SPICER: I think the President has made clear that he intends to work with anyone who wants to help him get to the number of votes. He obviously has had a very productive discussion this weekend with Senator Paul. I know the Vice President has been actively engaged, as well as other members of the staff, with members of the House in particular. And they're going to continue to try to find a way forward.\nBut there are some -- I'm not going to expose every member that's had some of these -- some of them will want to backchannel this to offer solutions and constructive ways forward. But those conversations are happening at several levels within the White House to see if we can find a way forward to get the number of requisite votes.\nBut the President continues to work hard. He's having these conversations. Members have reached out to him to make their suggestions known. And so that's -- but we continue to feel optimistic in the sense that there's a lot of constructive ideas that are coming to the table to get us to a way forward on healthcare.\nI just want to make one admin announcement. Tomorrow, the President is -- as I mentioned, he's giving a speech tomorrow with a roundtable of CEOs on the American workforce. And then tomorrow he'll be speaking again at the American National Building Trades union. So we'll have some kind of background briefing before the day because he is speaking live. So we will, on the guidance tomorrow, have something for you in terms of what we'll do for a briefing. We're working on that now.\nWith that, I'm going to end for today and let you guys have a good one. Take care. Thank you, guys.\nEND 3:11 P.M.

It's great to be with the President of Egypt. And I will tell you, President Elsisi has been somebody that's been very close to me from the first time I met him. I met during the campaign, and at that point, there were two of us, and we both met. And hopefully, you liked me a lot more. [Laughter] But it was a very long—it was supposed to be just a quick brief meeting, and we were with each other for a long period of time. We agree on so many things.\nI just want to let everybody know, in case there was any doubt, that we are very much behind President Elsisi. He's done a fantastic job in a very difficult situation. We are very much behind Egypt and the people of Egypt. And the United States has, believe me, backing, and we have strong backing. We are very much—and as you and I will be soon talking—we're building up our military to a level that will be the highest—probably the highest—that we've ever had: plane orders, ship orders, aircraft carrier orders.\nWe are rejuvenating our military to the highest level, I think, in these times, probably more than ever before or certainly almost more than ever before. That's what we need.\nAnd I just want to say to you, Mr. President, that you have a great friend and ally in the United States and in me.\n[At this point, President Elsisi spoke in English as follows.]\nPresident Elsisi. Thank you very much, sir.\n[President Elsisi continued in Arabic.]\nYour Excellency, allow me to extend my thanks and appreciation for your kind invitation for me to visit the United States. Actually, this is my first state visit to the United States since my Inauguration in office. And as a matter of fact, this is the first visit in 8 years from an Egyptian President to the United States.\nPresident Trump. Great.\nPresident Elsisi. Your Excellency, since we met last September, I've had a deep appreciation and admiration of your unique personality, especially as you are standing very strong in the counterterrorism field to counter this evil ideology that is claiming innocent lives, that is bringing devastation to communities and nations, and that is terrorizing the innocent people.\nYour Excellency, very strongly and very openly, you will find Egypt and myself always beside you in this, in bringing about an effective strategy in the counterterrorism effort.\nThe second point, Your Excellency, is that you'll find me supporting you very strongly and very earnestly in finding solution to the problem of the century. And I'm quite confident that you will be able to bring a solution to this issue.\nPresident Trump. We will; that I tell you. We will.\n[President Elsisi spoke in English as follows.] President Elsisi. Yes. Thank you very much.\nPresident Trump. We will do that together. We will fight terrorism and other things, and we're going to be friends for a long, long period of time. We have a great bond with the people of Egypt, and I look forward to working with the President. And we have some interesting conversations going to start effective immediately, and then we're going into the Cabinet Room, and we're going to meet with your representatives.\nSo again, thank you very much for coming.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "note": "This proclamation was published in the  Federal Register  on April 6.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123686", "text": "By the President of the United States of America\nA Proclamation\nDuring National Crime Victims' Rights Week, we stand with crime victims and their families, we renew our commitment to safeguarding our communities from crime, and we recognize those who devote their lives to supporting and empowering victims and survivors.\nCrime and violence rob people of their rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We must focus on the plight of crime victims and search for effective solutions. For too long, communities across this Nation have suffered from murder rates that are far too high. Gang-related shootings plague our major cities, while violence continues to afflict towns both small and large.\nThe physical, mental, and emotional scars borne by crime victims are often coupled with serious financial implications. In 1984, President Reagan signed the Victims of Crime Act, which established the Crime Victims Fund. This fund provides compensation for victims of crime for crime-related expenses such as medical payments, counseling, lost wages, and funeral and burial costs; supports victims' service programs such as domestic violence shelters and rape crisis centers; and builds capacity to improve responsiveness to the needs of crime victims. The Crime Victims Fund receives billions of dollars each year from, among other sources, certain criminal fines and penalties paid by convicted Federal offenders, which helps prevent American taxpayers from shouldering the burdens of reparations. While this fund cannot completely undo the damage caused by crime, it can at least ease the monetary burden felt by victims and their families in the midst of grief.\nAs a society, we must continue to support those who have endured the fallout from crime. My Administration is developing an office to assist victims of crimes committed by criminal aliens. The Victims Of Immigration Crime Engagement (VOICE), within the Department of Homeland Security, will work to serve the victims of open borders policies—which will no longer form the basis of our immigration system. These victims will not be ignored by the media or silenced by special interests any longer. We will restore law and order and protect our citizens from this undue harm.\nDuring National Crime Victims' Week, we renew our commitment to protecting all victims of crime, vindicating their rights, alleviating their burdens, and preventing future crime. We will assist our law enforcement community in bringing justice to victims and to their communities. My Administration is resolved to uphold this fundamental purpose of the United States Government—preserving security for all Americans.\nNow, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2 through April 8, 2017, as National Crime Victims' Rights Week. I urge all Americans, families, law enforcement, community and faith-based organizations, and private organizations to work together to support victims of crime and protect their rights. In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nDONALD J.

{"author": "Sean Spicer", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123678", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n11:45 A.M. EDT\nMR. SPICER: I know the President is leaving shortly, so I'm going to keep this relatively short.\nA couple things from yesterday. The President signed four bills: S.J. Res. 34 which disapproves of the FCC regulations that would have imposed new privacy standards on Internet service providers, allowing bureaucrats in Washington to pick winners and losers in the industry -- we've discussed that before; H.J Resolution 83, which disapproves of a Department of Labor regulation extending the statute of limitation for claims against employers failing to maintain records of employee injuries; H.J. Res. 69, the disapproval of the Bureau of Land Management regulations that would limit Alaska's ability to manage hunting of predators on national wildlife refuges in Alaska; and H.R. 1228 which makes technical amendments to the appointment procedures of members to the Board of Congressional Compliance.\nOne quick note, I mentioned this before, but the number gets higher -- we've now -- the President has signed 12 congressional review acts. In the past, all Presidents combined had signed one. So I think we have a vastly different attempt to roll back regulatory reforms that are standing in the way of freedom as well as business development.\nAlso yesterday, the President spoke with the President of Peru and the President of Colombia to express his condolences for the devastation and loss of life by recent mudslides in the country. He offered the assistance of the United States government during this tragedy. And the President also spoke with President Putin of the Russian Federation to condemn yesterday's attack in St. Petersburg. He offered the full support of the United States government in responding to the attack and bringing those to justice. We had readouts of both of those yesterday.\nWith respect to today, this morning the President hosted a CEO town hall. I think some of you had the opportunity to go over there. The town hall was broken into four separate discussions -- infrastructure, modernizing government services, workforce development, and the pro-business climate. A report released by the Pew Research Center yesterday showed an historic rise in public opinion about the economy. Fifty-eight percent of Americans say that the current economic situation in the United States is good, which is a 14 percent jump from last year, the largest one-year improvement in the survey's history. It's also the most positive Americans have been about the economy since before the recession.\nThe American economy is already showing improvements under the President's pro-job, pro-business policies. The President was glad for the opportunity to speak to the CEOs from many industries about what his administration is doing moving forward to make it even easier to create jobs in America and making it even easier to do business in the country.\nThis afternoon -- in fact, literally momentarily -- the President will be taking off from the White House to go speak at the 2017 North America Building Trades Unions national legislative conference. I'm not going to get ahead of the speech, but I think it's fairly safe to say that he looks forward to speaking to the men and women who are building so much around our nation, and the issues that matter most to them -- bringing back well-paying jobs, jumpstarting American energy, rebuilding our infrastructure and trade.\nLater this afternoon, the President will have several meetings, including EPA Administrator Pruitt, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, Congressman Dana Rohrabacher, Governor Torres of the Northern Mariana Islands. And this afternoon, we will have a background briefing here in this room at 4:30 p.m. on the upcoming visit with President Xi.\nAnd then tomorrow, I know we had mentioned earlier in the week that there will be a Wounded Warriors soldier ride. We're obviously tracking the weather on that, but this is really a great opportunity, and I know that this team is working with several media outlets who want to cover this to really pay tribute to the men and women who have fought and served for this country and some of the efforts that are being made now to really go out and show how they've recovered so well and compete. So while it may look like we're going to have some rain, I'll make sure that we share any updates with you.\nLast, before I get on to your questions, I just want to -- we have a quick update on Syria. So I'm going to read the statement for you, and obviously, as I conclude, we will put it out:\nToday's chemical attack in Syria against innocent people, including women and children, is reprehensible and cannot be ignored by the civilized world. These heinous actions by the Bashar al-Assad regime are a consequence of the past administration's weakness and irresolution. President Obama said in 2012 that he would establish a \"red line\" against the use of chemical weapons, and then did nothing. The United States stands with our allies across the globe to condemn this intolerable act.\nJohn.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. I wanted to pick up on that statement. As you know, with this chemical attack on this rebel-held Syrian town, at least 100 deaths have been reported, at least 400 injuries. And I hope you could give some clarity in terms of the administration's position on Syria. Secretary of State Tillerson just days ago said that the Syrian people themselves should decide the future of the country. And at the same time, the U.N. Ambassador -- the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley, has said that Assad is a war criminal. So you just criticized President Obama's policy on Syria and the red line. What will the administration do in response to what we saw take place there over the past 24 hours?\nMR. SPICER: Thanks. I think the statement speaks for itself. I think a couple of things. One is, statements by both Secretary Tillerson and Ambassador Haley speak to the political realities of the situation in Syria in terms of -- I think we had opportunities in the past, several years, to look at regime change. I think those are fundamentally -- the landscape is fundamentally different than it is today.\nThat being said, I think the President has made it clear in the past, and will reiterate that today, that he is not here to telegraph what we're going to do. But rest assured that I think he has been speaking with his national security team this morning, and we will continue to have that discussion both internally with our national security team, as well as with our allies around the globe. But I think the statement pretty much speaks for itself -- what we believe, that is -- and then we'll go from there.\nQ: Do you think there is any confusion with those two statements that I read earlier -- one from Secretary of State Tillerson and the other from the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley?\nMR. SPICER: No. As I said, one of them is just a statement of -- or both of their statements with respect to Assad speak to the political reality of -- it's great to say that -- there is almost an acknowledgement of the reality of the situation, politically speaking, in terms of his standing within -- where we stand. There is not a fundamental option of regime change as there has been in the past. I think we would look like, to some degree, rather silly not acknowledging the political realities that exist in Syria, and that what we need to do is fundamentally do what we can to empower the people of Syria to find a different way.\nRight now, both statements stand very squarely with what we will do today. I think that the comments and the statement are unequivocal when it comes to how we believe we view this attack on innocent people, the heinous nature of it. But I don't want to get ahead of where we're going from here.\nHunter.\nQ: Just real quick, Sean. Are you --\nMR. SPICER: Hold on. Hans, I know --\nQ: I didn't know if the point was to me or --\nMR. SPICER: No, no, it wasn't. Hunter is Hunter; Hans is Hans.\nQ: Thank you, Sean.\nMR. SPICER: I'll come back to you.\nQ: Thank you. I'm wondering if you're at all concerned to see these reports of the chemical attacks coming right on the heels of the administration suggesting it's open to Assad staying in power. Are you worried there's any correlation between the attacks and the change in posture?\nMR. SPICER: Again -- and I don't think -- I would hardly characterize it as -- I forgot the way that you phrased it -- but there's not a comfort level with Assad. I think it's a political reality. That being said, I think the idea that someone would use chemical weapons on their own people, including women and children, is not something that any civilized nation should sit back and accept or tolerate. And I think that is what we are making very clear today.\nQ: Right. But in addition to you describing Assad as the\n\"political reality,\" Ambassador Haley said the priority \"is no longer to sit there and focus on getting Assad out.\" That's a direct quote. So this is clearly a change in posture. Do you think there's any correlation between sort of an almost increased brazenness on his part and those statements?\nMR. SPICER: I don't. And I think that -- like I said, I'm not going to get into it, but I think the President is extremely alarmed at these revelations. He continues to meet with his national security team, and I think there will be further discussions around the globe with our allies as far as the appropriate action.\nHans.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Are you certain it was the Assad regime? Is it possible that Russia was involved? Do you know the air platform? And then one final -- do you know if any Russian forces were with Assad regime forces that launched the chemical attack?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to get into -- I know that the President was briefed on this extensively this morning by his national security team, and I'm going to let the statement speak for itself, because we feel very confident in the statement that we're making.\nQ: So that means no Russian involvement?\nMR. SPICER: That means that the statement is very clear as far as who we believe is to blame and how we believe we're reacting to it.\nZeke.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. In the statement, you were sharply critical of the past administration with regards to Syria. I was hoping you could clarify, when does the President believe that he takes ownership of foreign policy when obviously -- every President always blames the predecessor -- the need to put that criticism in this statement, now condemning the use of chemical weapons, a war crime overseas, why take the potshot at his predecessor? And when does the President truly own his own foreign policy?\nMR. SPICER: I think it is very clear. I mean, we drew -- what's the point of red lines? America's credibility was at stake, and I think the President wants to point out that there was a red line and they did cross it. We did talk about -- we did have alternatives to regime change, and they weren't taken. And I think that's a very, very different -- it's important to acknowledge the difference in the change in our posture and how we will go out from here. So I think it is a big difference.\nQ: And what is that change in posture?\nMR. SPICER: I understand. The statement speaks for itself. I think I'm not going to get into what actions we're taking. Obviously, I get you want to do that. Those are decisions that the national security team continues to make recommendations to the President. But until we do anything, I'd rather not get ahead of it.\nQ: So the next crisis -- maybe it's not Syria -- is the President going to criticize President Obama for trade policies when he meets with President Xi later this week? Is it every foreign policy statement --\nMR. SPICER: It's going to depend -- I mean, I don't want to say yes or no. I mean, I think that's going to depend on what our posture was towards that country or regime or policy.\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nMR. SPICER: I don't -- I mean, I don't know. Did you ask that same question of President Obama when they literally spent a year or two years blaming the Bush administration for everything that was wrong?\nQ: Yes. Yes, we did. (Laughter.)\nMR. SPICER: But I mean, I think that -- look, right now we're 70-something days into it. I think there's no question what their position was with respect to Syria in terms of red lines and regime change and the lack of action that they did take. I think we want to make sure that we're very clear that there is a different posture.\nQ: Sean, is President Trump willing to draw a second red line to discourage the Assad regime from using chemical weapons on his own people?\nMR. SPICER: I think the statement is pretty clear on this, Trey. The United States stands with our allies to condemn this intolerable attack. And I think going forward we will have more on this, but I'm not -- I think we want to be very clear where we stand. I know countries throughout Europe are reaching out, making it clear what their position is. There's been some calls for action, the U.N. Security Council. I think, at this point, as things develop, I'm not ready to talk about our next step, but we'll get there soon.\nKaitlan.\nQ: Does the White House agree with Rand Paul that Susan Rice should testify?\nMR. SPICER: I think that's -- again, I'm not going to start getting into who should testify. But I do think that it is -- I know that she's about to make comments to a host of -- to minimize this. But it is interesting, she was the one who went out and said she \"had nothing to do\" with this on a program a few weeks ago, and now I continue to see more and more reports.\nSo I think it's not for me to decide who should testify or how they should do it, but I do think that there is a sharp contrast between a few weeks ago when she was very public in saying she \"didn't have any clue what Chairman Nunes was talking about,\" and yet now we're finding out that she's trying to figure out how she can go to some kind of friendly way of discussing this.\nBut all yesterday there was an opportunity -- my understanding -- of several people to reach out. I didn't hear anything except for a quote; one network described it as a \"person close to her,\" which I think is rather interesting that -- you would assume that if you stood by the comments that you made several weeks ago, that you wouldn't need someone who just was close to you to defend it.\nQ: What do you think about networks like CNN saying that it's a diversion, that the Susan Rice story is a diversion?\nMR. SPICER: I think I'll let CNN speak for themselves. I find it interesting that you -- I don't know how many reports that -- I get that at some point they have an invested angle and narrative in this, but the reality is -- and again, I'm not going to keep going into every turn and twist about this, but I think that, as I noted yesterday, the more we find out about this the more we learn that there was clearly something there and that there was a lot of activity. We've seen people both on the record and in comments talk about their activities.\nI think it's interesting, as I noted yesterday, and I read some of the comments afterwards, but the default from at least some media outlets seems to be to rush to the defense of the Obama administration and the activities there instead of so-called want to get to the bottom of this. But there is an immediate attempt to defend certain actions like that on one side of the aisle and an immediate rush to judgment on the other side, which I get that people don't like to hear that, but that is the reality.\nIf you look at the two situations that occurred, there is no question the way that some networks are handling one set of circumstances versus another. It is clearly an attempt to preserve a narrative and to defend one side of the aisle versus another.\nSteve.\nQ: Sean, generally speaking, would you like to see Assad step down or out of power somehow in Syria?\nMR. SPICER: I think it's in the best interest of the Syrian people to not have anybody who would do the kind of heinous acts -- any leader that treats their people with this kind of activity and death and destruction -- I mean, it's just -- yeah, I don't think that anybody would wish this upon anybody.\nQ: And are you confident that the United States will respond to this attack in some way?\nMR. SPICER: I would not want to get ahead of the President at this point. I do think that the statement is fairly strongly worded for a certain reason.\nQ: And lastly, has he specifically talked to any allies about this this morning?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not sure that he's spoken to any leaders specifically. I know the team has been in contact. He's spent an extensive amount of [time with] team this morning getting briefed by the intelligence community as well as his national security team.\nHallie.\nQ: Sean, I want to follow on that and then I have two other topics for you. You said -- I know you don't want to get ahead of the President and you're letting the statement speak for itself. You also said that you want to empower the people of Syria to find a different way. How will the United States help them out with that?\nMR. SPICER: I don't think -- again, we need to look at options at this point, and I'm not going to get ahead of the President and the team. I think right now our concern is for the people of Syria and the victims of this attack. We have plenty of time to chart a way forward.\nQ: Okay, so let me just ask you this. On the Susan Rice story, you said yesterday you believed that it was moving in a \"troubling direction.\" What do you find troubling about that story?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I find it troubling that someone would go out and talk about the fact that they had -- and again, I'm paraphrasing because I don't have the exact quote in front of me -- but I believe she made something to the comments, I have no idea what Chairman Nunes is talking about, and then threw a person apparently that's close to her -- continuing a narrative, but yet more and more news outlets are reporting that there was something there.\nAnd there's a question -- I've seen enough -- you saw Secretary -- I mean, former director Brennan talk about that if people were leaking this information, it's treasonous. You have questions about what was the motive behind if it didn't have intelligence value, it wasn't part of an ongoing investigation, what was the reason that somebody would have -- the extent to which it goes.\nI think those are all very -- I mean, there is a civil liberties component to this that should be very troubling in terms of the revelations that keep coming up.\nQ: But so to pick up on that, do you believe it is improper for a national security advisor to request the unmasking of names?\nMR. SPICER: It would depend on the purpose of that. Again, it depends on the purpose of why they were asking and what they were trying to accomplish.\nQ: But it sounds like you believe this purpose was politically motivated. (Inaudible.)\nMR. SPICER: No, no, I'm not -- please don't --\nQ: I'm not putting words in your mouth, I'm just trying to understand --\nMR. SPICER: Well, you are. You said \"you believe.\"\nQ: I'm asking you.\nMR. SPICER: Okay, and I think the answer is that I think why I'm saying that we're going in a troubling path is I think that what we continue to see is that there is a lot coming out that says there was no value in this intelligence. And so the question is, why was somebody unmasked if that was the case, what was the purpose of requesting it, and the extent of which it occurred.\nIf there is no intelligence or criminal value in it, why was somebody requesting it? How far did they do it? Who did they share it with? But I believe that there are more questions than answers at this point.\nQ: My last question about healthcare. There's been a lot of discussion in the last 18 hours or so on the revival, potentially, of this healthcare bill. Speaker Paul Ryan said today it's in the concept stages, if you will. Can you talk about the White House's role in this and specifics? Are community ratings now on the table? Preexisting conditions, will those be protected? Has the President made that --\nMR. SPICER: I think, yesterday, Chief of Staff Priebus and some others hosted a group -- Tuesday Group folks here in the morning. I know the Vice President and Mr. Priebus went up to Capitol Hill later in the afternoon. I know they've got some additional meetings today I believe back on Capitol Hill. They're having some folks here. The President had a discussion with a couple members in the House and the Senate over the weekend.\nI think that our goal is -- and I know Chairman Walden of the House Energy and Commerce Committee has been talking to his members in particular and members of the different caucuses and groups up there, and I think has some ideas that he thinks could be very helpful. He's talked to leadership. I think if we can -- the same narrative that we've been talking about for a while -- if we can get that group to get to 216, then I think that we'll move forward.\nI think the talks have been very productive.\nQ: So it's back live, would you say?\nMR. SPICER: I think the President -- look, the President would like to see this done. If we can get a deal and it gets to those votes -- which, again, I'm not going to raise expectations. But I think that there are more and more people coming to the table with more and more ideas about to grow that vote. And I think on both -- not just in the House, but we've had some discussions as well in the Senate. But I think both the Chief of Staff and the Vice President feel very optimistic with the tone of the conversation and the ideas that are coming out and the willingness of folks to find common ground.\nJohn.\nQ: Can you talk about this Erik Prince business -- this idea that he was trying to create a back channel between the President and Russia? I mean, his closeness to this administration -- his sister being the Education Secretary -- certainly creates an appearance, but it could also be problematic for the White House from the standpoint of, well, this is what the Obama administration might have been looking into (inaudible) intelligence reports.\nMR. SPICER: The thing that's interesting about the story is, when you look at it, it's -- respectfully, I would call it flimsy. I mean, they use -- the meeting took place around January 11th. He had no \"formal role with the campaign or transition team,\" although he apparently presented himself. He \"has ties to people\" -- that's plural. When you go through the story, the tie that they have is that he appeared on Steve Bannon's radio show. When you look at the radio show, it says that he appeared on Steve Bannon's radio show in November. Steve Bannon gave up the radio show in August.\nI think that this idea that somebody who admittedly, on both sides -- we say that he had no role in the transition, he says he has no role in the transition. But apparently, he knows somebody who knew somebody, who knew a guy in the UAE, who also knew a guy in Russia and they had to fly to the Seychelles on or around January 11th, of which the government of the Seychelles says, \"They have no record of them being there.\" Government officials in the Seychelles, \"they were not aware of any meetings.\"\nBut it is a bunch of flimsy pieces of information all tied together to create a sensational feel. But just so we're clear, there is no -- they can't identify the other individuals. They claim that Erik Prince, who went, admittedly by himself, by us, by others, has no role in the transition, and that his connection is \"ties to people\" -- is, one, he's related to what would become the Secretary of Education's sister, and two, is he appeared on someone's radio show. That doesn't seem to pass muster with a great deal of strength to me.\nQ: But would you acknowledge that this could be potentially problematic from the standpoint of --\nMR. SPICER: No.\nQ: -- this could give Susan Rice an out to say, well, this was the sort of thing that we were looking at, and this is why we were conducting to unmask --\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think if you are looking at -- I mean, you would hope that if that's what you were looking at, you would get a lot more information than that. That, to me -- I don't -- they don't know the date, who they met with, how they actually came into contact, what the exact ties were, or what supposedly happened as a consequence to this, because they can't meet. There was no, apparently -- nothing came of it.\nSo, again, I guess someone may have visited an island, but there is no proof they actually ever met with an individual, nor that they had any ties, nor that they actually know the exact date, nor any consequence of the so-called meeting. I think that it is flimsy at best.\nQ: The President said earlier at that CEO town hall, as it relates to infrastructure, that the package would be a trillion dollars and \"maybe even more.\" Given a trillion dollars is a massive number to begin with, what might \"and maybe even more\" mean?\nMR. SPICER: Again, I think that's part of what the team is working on. It's a number that's very consistent with what he has said since the beginning. So I don't know why this should be any different than -- I mean, it's consistent with the numbers that he's used.\nQ: And then let me ask you about Dodd-Frank. He also said that he wants to take a haircut to it. Dodd-Frank is a law that the President can't unilaterally change. He can't sign executive orders. So is he hoping to work with Capitol Hill for this major haircut? Is it solely through executive orders? How does that relationship --\nMR. SPICER: I think we'll have an update further on that. Obviously, there's clearly, as you know, a legislative component to this, and we'll have more on that.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. I want to follow up on Hallie's question about healthcare. The proposed changes to the essential health benefits and the community ratings -- is there a concern that that would roll back protections for preexisting conditions? That's obviously something that President Trump said he wanted to keep in place during the campaign. So wouldn't these changes that health policy experts were saying would get rid of those protections, wouldn't that violate what President Trump --\nMR. SPICER: Again, I would note, to Hallie's question, that we're not there yet. We're having discussions. As I said, the Chief of Staff hosted the Tuesday Group yesterday morning, and then he and the Vice President went up yesterday to talk to the Freedom Caucus. I think part of this is -- I get that there are disparate interests that are trying to pull this to one side or another, but I think that we understand the core principles of this and we've got to make sure that we do -- whatever we do continues to get an outcome that grows the vote, not decreases the vote. And so I don't want to start prejudging where this thing is going to head at this point.\nSo, with that, I know the President is on his way, he's going to start speaking. So I'll catch you later. Enjoy. Thank you.\nEND 12:11 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2017-04-04", "title": "Press Gaggle by Press Secretary Sean Spicer"}

We'll make some brief remarks, and then we'll open it up to Q&A.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: We're going to have the President meeting with his counterpart, President Xi Jinping of China, at Mar-a-Lago this week, starting on the 6th, in the afternoon and evening, and continuing into the 7th until after lunch. So about a 24-hour visit. This is really an opportunity for the two leaders to exchange views on each other's respective priorities and to chart a way forward for the U.S.-China bilateral relationship.\nSo they'll be talking about areas of common interest and also some of the clear areas of difference that we need to address in the relationship. And President Trump really views this meeting as a first step toward building a constructive and a results-oriented relationship that's going to deliver benefits to both countries.\nI'm going to ask my colleague to make some remarks as well, and then we can answer some questions.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: I want to make a few brief remarks about the economic relationship between the United States and China. Together, the United States and China represent 40 percent of the global economy, and as the world's two largest economies, there's no greater or more consequential economic relationship. Indeed, our economies have become increasingly interdependent through growing trade and investment.\nThe key premise of our economic relationship is that bilateral trade and investment should be mutually beneficial. However, progress on a range of bilateral economic issues has become increasingly difficult. This reflects a slowdown and, in certain cases in our view, a retreat in China's move toward giving the market a more decisive role in the Chinese economy.\nAccordingly, there will be significant trade and economic issues to discuss between our Presidents at the summit. President Trump is very concerned about how the imbalance in our economic relationship affects American workers and wants to address these issues in a candid and productive manner. President Trump will convey to President Xi the importance of establishing an economic relationship that is fair, balanced, and based on a principle of reciprocity.\nThanks.\nQ: I just have a couple questions on North Korea. The President has been talking about trying to get China's assistance on North Korea. Is he going to be trying to get any specific commitments from China on what he wants to see them do to exert more pressure on North Korea?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: So North Korea clearly is a matter of urgent interest for the President and the administration as a whole. I think the President has been pretty clear in messaging how important it is for China to coordinate with the United States and for China to begin exerting its considerable economic leverage to bring about a peaceful resolution to that problem.\nSo certainly it is going to come up in their discussions. Somewhere on the order of just shy of 90 percent of North Korea's external trade is with China, so even though we hear sometimes that China's political influence may have diminished with North Korea, clearly its economic leverage has not. It is considerable. And so that will be one of the points of discussion.\nQ: And is the President going to tell his Chinese counterpart about what he's willing to do proactively and unilaterally if China doesn't exert pressure?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: Well, we'll leave that for the President to discuss. We have been reviewing U.S. policy towards North Korea. The President, on this issue, like many others, is not someone who wants to broadcast all of the ins and outs of his strategy in advance. But I think that he'll be sending a clear signal to President Xi.\nQ: In his interview with the Financial Times, the President said that he would leave the issue of potential tariffs against Chinese imports until another meeting. This was something that he talked about often on the campaign trail. Why not bring it up in this meeting?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: As [my colleague] indicated, the primary purpose of the meeting is to set a framework for discussions on trade and investment. I can't tell you whether they're going to get into specific issues to resolve at this time or to be on the agenda for discussion and hopefully early resolution in the weeks and months ahead. But this is the introductory meeting to put a framework in place for how we're going to discuss and address these matters.\nQ: In this introductory meeting, is that too charged an issue do you think to put on the table?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: I don't want to prejudge what the parties are going to get involved in. But it's going to be the first effort of the top leadership in both countries to get together and begin to address the trade and investment issues.\nQ: Is the President going to raise his concerns about currency manipulation?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I'm going to leave any discussion of currency manipulation to the Department of Treasury, which is the place for it.\nQ: You said you'd like to see a relationship based on reciprocity. What does that mean exactly?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I said the principle of reciprocity, which means that we want to work with the Chinese in a constructive manner to reduce the systemic trade and investment barriers that they've created that lead to an uneven playing field for U.S. companies. We want the playing field to be level so that bilateral trade investment can be mutually beneficial.\nQ: President Xi reportedly wants to hear President Trump officially recognize Taiwan as a province of China. What will his message be on that and on the South China Sea?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, the President has reaffirmed our adherence to the one-China policy -- that is our one-China policy that's based on the three joint communiques with China, as well as the Taiwan Relations Act. That is longstanding policy of the United States; that is a policy that the President has reaffirmed. So I don't anticipate some kind of surprising deviation from that.\nQ: What will his message be on the South China Sea as it relates to --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I do expect that maritime issues will come up. The United States certainly will continue to fly and sail where international law allows. And I would not be surprised if that came up in conversation.\nYes.\nQ: Hi. I wanted to ask you about areas of cooperation. As you know, the last administration used climate change to offset some of the conflict in the relationship. I have yet to hear anybody from the administration talk about what you want to work on together with China. Can you enlighten us?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, I'll tell you that we would like to work on North Korea together -- that there's an opportunity. And, in some ways, it's really -- we've been left, after 20-some-odd years of trying pretty much everything, to bring about a safe and denuclearized peninsula. And so this is, in some ways, a test of the relationship, I think.\nQ: Can you go into, though -- that's not a place where there's a lot of agreement. There's a different approach by each side. Are there any areas that you foresee where these two countries may actually have a similar approach to a global issue? Because obviously the relationship and what happens with the relationship affects everybody around the world.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Sure. I think that there are still a lot of areas, of course, of cooperation on public health, transnational crime. There's a whole grab-bag of daily issues that affect both of our countries and governments -- people-to-people issues. We have strong people-to-people ties. And there are certainly parts of the economic relationship that are working right, and substantial areas of difference that are going to have to be addressed.\nQ: There hasn't been a lot of talk recently about Chinese cyberattacks on the U.S. Has China eased off some of the things that President Obama told President Xi to stop doing?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, I'd refer you really to DHS on the question of the volume and nature of cyberattacks. There's nothing that I would have to add to that right now.\nQ: But would it come up this weekend as an issue?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: This is a one-day visit, so I think that a lot of issues are going to come up. I think that the opportunity to resolve any particular -- we don't want to be unrealistic about that. I do think that there is going to be some movement toward a framework for dialogues that will be elevated from some of the previous or preexisting dialogues that have existed with prior administrations, and for those dialogues to be streamlined and for there to be clear deadlines for achieving results.\nQ: Most of the time, North Korea and China, this subject comes up, nobody gives any attention to the corridors that run from North Korea to China. And all these sanctions, which the world is imposing, go out of the window because there are no international monitors. What is going on in that area? Is there anything that you're going to do about that?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, we're certainly going to be monitoring how well partners -- including China -- implement those U.N. resolutions that they've coauthored. And coal is one very important area, given the volume of trade and what that means in terms of hard currency for the North Korean regime, and certainly we'll use whatever methods we have to monitor compliance.\nQ: Can you shed a little bit more light on how these two men will be spending these 24 hours? Will there be a series of sessions? Any leisure time -- golf, photo ops, anything like that?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah, I think it's safe to say there's not going to be any golf -- (laughter) -- and there will be -- the First Ladies are both going to be there. There will be time, particularly in the first day, for them to get to know one another in a more informal kind of interaction as well as a dinner.\nThe next day will be a series of meetings up to and including a working lunch. And it's possible that they'll walk around a bit, as the mood strikes, but nothing formal or nothing involving golf clubs.\nQ: Do you anticipate any photo ops or press availabilities?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: There will be some press availabilities. Are you able to -- okay -- we'll get back to you.\nQ: Can you talk about the atmosphere? Why Mar-a-Lago as opposed to here at the White House? If memory serves correctly, President Bush met with the then-Chinese Premier at Camp David. Do they not like the White House?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: No, I think that this was actually at the invitation of -- in fact, I'm certain it was President Trump's invitation that they meet outside of Washington, D.C. -- that this is the first time the two are ever going to be meeting, and the President -- you know, you've heard people refer to it as the \"winter White House.\" It's a place where he feels comfortable and at home, and where he can break the ice with Xi Jinping without the formality, really, of a Washington meet-up.\nMark.\nQ: Thanks. Two questions: One, on South China Sea, what you said a moment ago sounded very much like a restatement of existing American policy. On North Korea, you've been pretty clear that you want to draw a distinction between the last administration and this one. Is there any similar distinction you would draw in how you view the policy issue on the table with South China Sea? That's the first question.\nAnd the second question is: In a category of tougher measures toward North Korea, would you consider secondary sanctions -- i.e. sanctions that target Chinese entities --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Sure. So to start with the second one first, because of the amount of leverage that China has economically, the best outcome would be one in which China very thoroughly implements those U.N. sanctions and resolutions. That is really what we're working toward, and I'll just leave it at that. I'll leave it at that.\nOn South China Sea, we will -- there will be an opportunity for the two leaders to discuss that. There's nothing that I would state in addition to what I've already said, but it's no secret that the President was disturbed by activities that took place under the last administration. And he and his Cabinet members have been on the record as saying that that has got to stop.\nQ: China is economically retaliating on the THAAD deployment in South Korea. How will the United States, against this problem, and what pressure take on China?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Sure. Look, we are familiar with China's objections to THAAD. The United States will always act to defend our allies and to defend our homeland against any threat, and particularly one of the nature of the North Korean regime with the kinds of terrible weapons that they're developing. There will be no move away from protecting our South Korean allies and the United States.\nQ: Will there be discussion of China's request to be considered a market economy? And what should we read into the action of the Commerce Department review?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Again, that may well be one of the issues. The topics have not been scripted out in advance, so the leaders are going to be free to raise whatever is on their mind, obviously. One of the issues currently that we're closely involved with is whether China will continue to be a nonmarket economy at the WTO -- they've brought a case against the European Union on that -- or whether there will be an effort to make them a market economy. And for us, it's very important that they continue to be designated as a nonmarket economy.\nQ: So is the Commerce Department review just sort of preparation for that WTO case?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: The Commerce Department obviously monitors these activities, and we've also had consultations with various other countries on this matter.\nQ: I wonder if you can tell us a little bit more about the \"terrible\" weapons in North Korea. When you're doing the review, how much of a threat do you consider it to be in terms of a timeline? How urgent is the danger from North Korea when you're considering the threat in your review?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I can tell you that it is now urgent because we feel that the clock is very, very quickly running out. And again, we would have loved to see North Korea join the community of nations. They've been given that opportunity over the course of different dialogues and offers over the course of four administrations, with some of our best diplomats and statesmen doing the best they could to bring about a resolution. The clock has now run out, and all options are on the table for us.\nQ: You said that the United States would defend its allies. Do you expect the President to bring up these new Chinese sanctions in response to the THAAD deployment with President Xi?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We will see. I certainly do think that the Chinese side in conversation we've already had, including with Secretary Tillerson's visit -- I was with him on that visit just a couple of weeks ago -- at the end of the day, South Korea is a responsible, friendly, economically dynamic democracy that is seeking, together with its ally, the United States, to put in place defensive systems.\nSo it doesn't make much sense, and at some level it's even disturbing, to be punishing South Korea for wanting to do that. If THAAD is a problem to other countries in the region, they need to look to North Korea.\nQ: But do you expect the President to offer that criticism of China?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I am not going to pre-talk the President's talking points, but I wouldn't be surprised if it comes up.\nIn the back.\nQ: Thanks. Just coming back to the venue for a second, at Mar-a-Lago, can you tell me -- I've seen reporting in both directions -- who requested that the meeting be at Mar-a-Lago instead of in Washington? And then a secondary, if you can tell me who's paying for the Mar-a-Lago --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So the President invited President Xi Jinping to Mar-a-Lago. That was our President.\nQ: So it was him that --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: -- yeah, invited President Xi Jinping to Mar-a-Lago. As for payment, we'd have to talk to the White House counsel. I'm not working those issues.\nQ: Did the White House get anything in return for that? Was there any sort of -- it is a concession of any sort?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Look, at the end of the summit, I think you'll get a pretty good readout of what was discussed and what the path is forward for resolving a lot of those contentious issues that are near and dear to the President's heart and are issues that helped get him elected.\nQ: Thank you. One of the things -- two of the things actually -- I think you said the President was free to bring up any issues with President Xi. And I'd like to ask two things of concern you haven't mentioned to his supporters. One, the Asian Infrastructure Bank, which has been a subject of major concern.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank that China set up?\nQ: Yes. And the other, religious persecution in China, which many of the President's supporters in the last campaign had hoped he would bring up when he engaged the Chinese. Are you either going to be brought up?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, on AIIB --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I think to the degree that issue is brought up, it would be brought up, I would expect, by the Chinese as opposed to the United States. We're obviously aware of the issues and prepared to address it, but it's not something that that I would anticipate we're going to be raising.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: And again, I'm not going to pre-speak the President's talking points. We'll see what is concretely discussed, but human rights are integral to who we are as Americans. It is the reason that we have alliances at the end of the day, one of the reasons in addition to the fact that they serve our security and prosperity here at home. And human rights issues I would expect will continue to be brought up in the relationship.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: This will be the last question -- since we skipped you twice.\nQ: All right, no worries. Thank you. I guess since it's the last one let me just ask you, boil it down, what's the top priority here? Is it for these two to set up a relationship? Is it a certain issue? You've talked about setting up a framework. And then to your colleague, if you're not going to talk about tariffs now, I guess the question is when?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: There is time in even just a one-day summit for all of those things you mentioned to be priorities -- leaving tariffs off the table for a minute. But yes, this is an opportunity for them to meet one another, develop the beginnings of a relationship -- a working relationship -- to start putting together that framework for addressing all of the issues that we're all familiar with that carried us through the campaign and to the present day. And I'll leave it to my colleague --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I just want to clarify, I did not say that they would not be talking about tariffs. We haven't scripted out what they will be talking about. I don't anticipate there will be a resolution on those issues, but they'll be both establishing a framework for discussing the matters, and I am sure that each side will raise particular issues. But I would not anticipate we're going to be at the point of resolving those issues in this one-day set of meetings.\nQ: Could I just ask one more question before we go?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: That's it. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it. It's embargoed until 17:30. And we'll see a lot of you tomorrow.\nEND 5:00 P.M.

{"author": "Mike Pence", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=124215", "text": "THE VICE PRESIDENT: It's a great privilege to be able to welcome you to the White House. Thank you so much. I want to thank everyone involved in the Partnership for New York City -- Michael Corbat, Stephen Schwarzman. It's an honor to have the leaders that are gathered in the room here with us today. I know the President is on his way over, and it's my great privilege this morning to share a few thoughts, in the midst of this important conversation on the topics that you're covering before I introduce my friend and the 45th President of the United States.\nBut let me say first and foremost, though, the companies represented in the Partnership for New York City are all American success stories. You have our admiration. You have our appreciation. Your businesses account for more than 7 million jobs and you add over $1 trillion to our economy each and every year.\nWhat's more important is the people behind the numbers, and the topics that you've covered today are all about creating more jobs and more opportunities for Americans who are anxious to climb the ladder of success in the organizations that you represent and in companies all across this country.\nSo, first and foremost, on behalf of the President and the whole team that you've heard from this morning, and distinguished members of our Cabinet, thank you. Thank you for what you do. Thank you for your leadership.\nI think as you will hear this morning in the dialogue that is about to commence that America has elected a businessman as President of the United States, and he is committed to being the best friend business has ever had in the White House. (Applause.)\nWe've already seen the results. Since literally when the election was called at -- I think it was about 4 a.m. in the morning, wasn't it, Ivanka, that we were all together -- literally we've seen renewed energy and dynamism in the American economy. The first two jobs reports, as I'm sure you are aware, thanks in no small part to the leadership represented in businesses here in the room today, the first two jobs report show that under President Trump, nearly 500,000 new jobs have been created in the first two months of this year.\nBusinesses and consumers haven't been this optimistic in decades. In fact, we just learned from the National Association of Manufacturers that in their historic quarterly report, 93 percent of manufacturers are optimistic about the future. That represented almost a 40-point increase in optimism since the last report. (Applause.)\nWe think that is evidence of a vote of confidence in our new President and in his vision to get this economy moving again by putting common-sense principles into practice. From the very outset of this administration, the President has been energetically working to roll back excessive regulation and red tape. Leaders in Congress -- and I see Leader McCarthy, who is with us today -- have been producing under what's known as the Congressional Review Act, legislation to roll back onerous regulations that emerged in the waning days of the Obama administration. And in the coming days, President Trump will be signing even more bills into law, rolling back that avalanche of red tape.\nThe President has also taken decisive executive action on expanding American energy -- the Keystone pipeline and the Dakota pipeline. We continue to work earnestly with Congress for a new future on healthcare reform. The President and I remain confident that working with the Congress we will repeal and replace Obamacare with healthcare reform that will work for the American people and work for the American economy. And of course, in the offing before we reached the end of the year, the President is determined to roll his sleeves up, work with the Congress and pass the largest tax reform in a generation.\nBusiness -- as I said in those numbers about optimism -- business has clearly gotten the message. But today's conversation is all about learning from job creators represented in this room how we can continue to build on the momentum in this economy, particularly focusing on infrastructure, government modernization and workforce.\nI can tell you that the subject that I came in at the end of and I know was much a topic today with Ivanka and with Wilbur, having to do with improving the quality of our workforce, expanding opportunities for what is known as career and technical education -- what we back in Indiana call vocational education -- is a real passion for our new President. And we look forward to partnering with you in ways that we can continue to encourage investment and create opportunities for expanded career and vocational education.\nSo today is all about really giving you an opportunity to share your thoughts. It's part of an ongoing conversation this administration has commenced since the very first day the President took office -- listening to business leaders, listening to everyday Americans about ways that we can bring about his agenda to make America Great Again and to have our economy growing and expanding in a way that is consistent with the most powerful economy in the history of the world.\nI think the President is in the side chamber, so let me say to all of you, the opportunity you have today is to hear from a man who I have a chance to sit with every day. What you're going to see firsthand is what I see each and every day, and that is not only just a businessman made President, but you're going to see a leader, informed, focused, decisive, and absolutely committed to Make America Great Again.\nIt is my high honor and distinct privilege to introduce to all of you my friend, the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump.

Thank you, Mike. Good morning. Good morning. Hello, Ivanka.\nAssistant to the President for Intragovernmental and Technology Initiatives Reed Cordish. Sir, I know you know a few of the people in this room.\nThe President. I do. I do. All the killers from New York, I'm looking at all those competitive—[laughter]—those great, great talents, great builders.\nMr. Cordish. I have to give you a heads-up that Ivanka chaired one of the sessions before this. Tough act to follow.\nThe President. Oh, she's tough. Very tough.\nMr. Cordish. Yes. Vice President Pence listed some of the amazing accomplishments that have taken place. Since your election and your 75 days in office, the stock market has had almost unprecedented sustained growth, unprecedented confidence from our manufacturing sector and other business sectors, leading to massive private sector investment in job growth. You have gotten rid of regulations that were unnecessary and were job-stifling. You have strengthened our borders and strengthened our military. You've nominated a great Supreme—superb Supreme Court Justice, amongst many other things. How does all that feel?\nThe President. And we're getting unbelievable credit for what we've done, other than the mainstream media, which just gives us no credit whatsoever.\nMr. Cordish. Right.\nThe President. But we are getting tremendous credit. And if you look at the real estate industry, the mining industry, the farming industry—if you look at any of the major industries, you see what's going on.\nIn fact, even today I was very happy as I read this morning early that our trade deficit with others has gone down very considerably in the last short period of time. It's having a big impact.\nAnd as you know, I'm meeting with the President of China on Thursday and Friday in Palm Beach, Florida, and I think we're going to have a very interesting talk.\nMr. Cordish. Absolutely.\nThe President. We're having—have a lot of respect for him. I've spoken to him numerous times. But we have to do better, because our deficit with China, as you know, $504 billion. That's a year.\nMr. Cordish. That's incredible.\nThe President. That's enough for a lifetime. Even Steve would say that. But that's a year.\nSo we're going to have a great meeting, I'm sure we're going to have a fantastic meeting. And we're going to talk about a lot of things, including, of course, North Korea, a problem. And that's really a humanity problem. So we're going to be talking about that also. Mr. Cordish. You have made it a driving force in this administration to bring in the best minds we can from the private sector, to listen intently to them, and to take decisive action. How important is that, and how important is it to reform Government to bridge the gap between the private and public sectors?\nThe President. Well, I did, I brought you—[laughter]—I brought Gary Cohn, I brought a lot of very great people of—my friend, Steve, is helping us out. We have a superstar Committee of 22 people. And every time somebody calls me I say, \"Steve, put them on.\" \"No, we want to keep it at this level.\" The heads of the biggest companies, they all want to be on our Committee, right, Stephen? But Steve likes to keep it very small. But they will go off, and they'll disappear, and we'll put others on. But we've had some great meetings, and we've all learned a lot.\nOne thing that did come up, and it came up yesterday, was Gary Cohn—where's Gary? Is he here?\nMr. Cordish. Right there.\nThe President. Could you bring that chart, please? Do you mind? Let me see that chart. So this was just something—this is sort of incredible. [Laughter] That's so beautiful.\n[At this point, Special Assistant to the President for Infrastructure Policy David J. Gribbin IV brought a tall chart on stage and rolled it out next the President.]\nMr. Gribbin. I'm not as tall as you.\nThe President. Yes, no, you're not quite—this is to build a highway in the United States—now, this was just done yesterday. I saw it for the first time. I said, I'm speaking to some of my friends who are builders, really great builders, and they've gone through the process—we've all gone through it in New York—we call it the zoning process in New York.\nBut you start up here, and this is anywhere from a 10- to 20-year process. You have—is it 17 agencies? You have hundreds and hundreds of permits. Many of them are statutory, where you can't even apply for the second permit until 6 months go by. The process—so this is to build a highway. This is a simple highway. And these are the agencies—so it's 17 agencies. How many different steps is it?\nMr. Cordish. D.J.?\nMr. Gribbin. Sixteen different approvals.\nThe President. Sixteen.\nMr. Gribbin. Twenty-nine different statutes, five different Executive orders that all apply to this process. This is indicative, so this is not a specific project, but this is the type of process that a government—this is a State Government—would have to go through to permit a highway federally. This is just Federal, not State regulations.\nThe President. So it can take anywhere from 10—if you're really good, 10 years to 20 years. And then, they vote, and you lose. [Laughter] They don't want it. [Laughter] And it costs sometimes hundreds of millions of dollars just to go through the process.\nThank you very much. That was a great job you did. Be careful, don't fall. I don't want to have you fall. [Laughter] You'll be a big story in the paper if you go down. [Laughter] So I just saw that yesterday. Gary Cohn walked in, and he showed it to me, and—for no reason. I said, you have to do me a favor. But a lot of you, you're such pros, some of the best pros in the world sitting in this room, you understand it. It's a process.\nNow, I've always liked it because it gave people that could go through that process an advantage, like Jerry, but it gave us an advantage if you could get through the process. But getting a building approved in New York is a horrible, horrible thing. And that's nothing compared to when you get into the highways and the dams—they don't even talk about dams anymore. Hydropower is a great, great, form of power. We don't even talk about it, because to get the environmental permits are virtually impossible. It's one of the best things you can do—hydro. But we don't talk about it anymore.\nSo we've come to a halt. We have a tremendous person that we put in charge of EPA, Scott Pruitt, who is an environmental person. He wants clean air, he wants clean water, but he doesn't think it takes you 26 years to get a permit to build a building and to have jobs, at which time those companies are usually gone, out of business, et cetera.\nSo we're really speeding up the process. We're going to try and take that process from a minimum of 10 years down to 1 year. I said, can't we make it 4 months? [Laughter] Can't we do it in 4 months? And there is a certain logic to that, but we'll be satisfied with the year—but it won't be any more than a year.\nSo we have to build roads. We have to build highways. We're talking about a very major infrastructure bill of a trillion dollars, perhaps even more. And when we have to do—our jobs—I mean, if we say, we're giving to New York City hundreds of millions of dollars to build a road someplace, it doesn't help if they can't start because it's going to take 7½ years to get the permits. Even to redo a road takes years to get the permits. You have a road that's there, and you want to redo it, and you have to get new permits for the kind of asphalt you're using, the kind of concrete you may want to use.\nAnd if we're going to give all of this money—you know, there was very large infrastructure bill that was approved during the Obama administration—a trillion dollars—nobody ever saw anything being built. I mean, to this day, I haven't heard of anything that's been built. They used most of that money—it went, and they used it on social programs. And we want this to be on infrastructure.\nI'm working with Steve Roth and with Richard LeFrak, two friends of mine that are very good builders. They're great builders. And they know to get things done. They know how to cut red tape. Then, we're going to give them the advantage of having what we have. I see Elaine is here, so important, who is doing an incredible job, by the way—Secretary of Transportation. And Elaine will be working. But we're going to set up a Committee headed by Steve and Richard, and we're going to cut a lot of red tape.\nBut we don't want to say—send a billion dollars to New York and find out, 5 years later, the money was never spent, because we're going to be very strong that it has to be spent on shovels, not on other programs. And in the last case, a lot of it was spent on other programs. But we're going to say, if you don't spend the money—if you don't start—if you have a job that you can't start within 90 days, we're not going to give you the money for it. Because it doesn't help—doesn't help us. And we're going to be very strong on that. They have to be able to start within 90 days.\nMr. Cordish. Mr. President, we have some of the great business leaders in the country here. If okay with you, they have a few questions, if that's—— The President. Sure.\nMr. Cordish. Great.\nThe President. Hello, Jerry. [Laughter]\nTishman Speyer Chairman Jerry I. Speyer. Hi, Mr. President. [Laughter]\nThe President. He didn't have to say his name. He was ready to say his name—we know. We know Jerry. [Laughter] Jerry Speyer, everybody.\nMr. Speyer. Mr. President, you're doing a great job, and we're all really grateful to you for the sacrifices you're making.\n[A White House staffer exchanged microphones with Mr. Speyer.]\nMr. Speyer. Hope you heard that.\nThe President. That sounds much better. [Laughter]\nMr. Speyer. I think from New York's point of view, we send a lot of money into the economy. As a number of people have said, it's over a trillion dollars. We're worried that we're going to have a problem with Congress. And——\nThe President. With the deductions, right?\nMr. Speyer. Well, that too. That too. But we're worried about various programs that help the city. The city is doing fine right now; even the Yankees are doing fine. But what we're really concerned about is the future. Do you have any advice for us?\nThe President. Look, I love New York. And in some ways, we're all lucky that I'm from New York, because New York has unique problems. So does Los Angeles; so does Chicago. There are places that have unique problems. One of the problems that you have is debt and deductibility. That's a big one, because a lot of the States that don't have debt or have very little debt—like in the case of Mike Pence, where he did such a good job in Indiana, and it's a AAA-rated bond, one of the strongest in the country, and deductibility is not that big of a deal because they don't have that much to deduct.\nAnd over here, in New York, when you look at what's going on with us, we don't know in terms of the municipality and in terms of the State, we don't know if it can even make it if you don't have that. Are people going to buy? So it's a very big problem.\nAnd the problem I have is that there are many places throughout the country that are in the exact opposite position. And they consider that a gift to the State and a gift to the people. And we know New York does things that a lot of people don't read about. You look at what—the money they contribute to our economy, to our country, and people don't know about that. They don't maybe want to know about that. So you do have, I call it, a tale of two cities. You have different interests.\nBut I am watching over everybody, Jerry. You're in good hands, okay?\nMr. Speyer. Thank you.\nThe President. You're in good hands, believe me. You can tell the people of New York. Even though I didn't win New York State. I should have won New York State, but I didn't. [Laughter] Deloitte Chief Executive Officer Catherine Engelbert. Mr. President, Cathy Engelbert with Deloitte.\nThe President. Sure. Hi, Cathy.\nMs. Engelbert. I want to return to a conversation we just had with Ivanka, Dina, and Wilbur on jobs, the workforce of the future. And so as we think about that and we think about our skillsets, in New York City alone our high school—public high school graduation rate is at 70 percent, but the readiness of our students for college and careers is only 37—it's assessed at 37 percent.\nSo as we look at the pace of change, we look at the digital transformation we all see in business and the marketplace, and we look at the skills that we—this disconnect between what employers need and what our students coming into our workforces are prepared to deliver. And it would be great to get your thoughts on the priorities of the administration around education, around, again, what I like to call not the future of work, but the work of the future. Because the future of work sounds a little ominous, but the work of the future actually sounds pretty visionary.\nThe President. Right.\nMs. Engelbert. So if you could give us those priorities and how readiness fits in there.\nThe President. Okay, so before you sit, so you're giving me numbers from New York. You're a proud New Yorker, but you're giving me numbers—why is it doing so badly? Tell me. Why is—why are the numbers so horrific in terms of education? And what happens when somebody goes through school and then they can't read after the—they graduate from high school, and they can barely read. So what's the answer?\nMs. Engelbert. Yes. So, first, I would say that as we look at New York, New York has made enormous progress in a decade. By the way, that 70 percent was 50 percent, so a 40 percent increase. So we're making enormous progress in making an impact on——\nThe President. See how quickly she's changing? See that, Billy? [Laughter]\nMs. Engelbert. Making enormous progress, but we're not done. We have a lot of work to do. And I think—we talked earlier about public-private partnerships, apprenticeship models, which—we have a beautiful apprenticeship model that works and brings them our next generation of leaders. So I do think there's a lot we can do through relooking at funding programs. We talked earlier about consolidating the many programs that are out there. We're all trying to make our individual impact, and we can make a huge impact together.\nThe President. Sure. I know you work very hard on it, and you have made progress. Charter schools are another thing that people are talking about a lot, and some of the charter schools in New York have been amazing. They've done incredibly well. People can't get in. I mean, you can't get in. It's been—I don't call it an experiment anymore; it's far beyond an experiment.\nIf you look at so many elements of education, and it's so sad to see what's coming—what's happening in the country. Even the numbers, as good—you say we're doing better, but the numbers in New York, the numbers in Chicago, are very rough. The numbers in Los Angeles—the cities, it's a very rough situation. Common Core—I mean, we have to bring education more local. We can't be managing education from Washington. When I go out to Iowa, when I go out to the different States and I talk, they want to run their school programs locally, and they'll do a much better job than somebody—and look, these are some very good people in Washington, but you also have bureaucrats that make a lot of money and don't really care that much about what they're doing or about the community that they have never seen and they'll never meet and they never will see.\nAnd I like the fact of getting rid of—Common Core to me is—we have to end it. We have to bring education local. To me, I've always said it; I've been saying it during the campaign. And we're doing it. Betsy DeVos is—she's doing a terrific job, highly respected, tremendous track record. But she's got one of the toughest jobs of any of our Secretaries, to me. She's got one of the toughest jobs. There's some pretty tough jobs out there, but she's got one of the toughest jobs.\nWe're going to spend a lot of money and a lot of expertise. We're going to have great talent having to do with education, because there's nothing more important than education. And we've got to get those numbers in New York better, and I think they will be better. And a lot of people—a lot of the greatest people I know in New York, they're totally in love, including Ivanka and Jared, they're so much involved, and it's so important to them, the word \"education.\" And it's happening, and I see it happening in New York very much.\nBut it's happening elsewhere too. I think we're going to have a great 4 years.\nMr. Cordish. Mr. President, I know you have——\nThe President. ——prior to running again.\nMr. Cordish. ——a pressing issue to deal with. Steve and Mike I think just wanted to thank you for attending today, and maybe make a final comment on behalf of the round two.\nBlackstone Group Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and Cofounder Stephen A. Schwarzman. Well, thanks a lot for being here. And thanks for everybody for being here. It's been a really interesting day, and you've had everybody of importance at the event. I think it's terrific in terms of the stuff you're trying to do to modernize the Government, educate, and so forth. And I think we have to keep a focus on that, because the outside world doesn't always get the message that that's really what's going on. Because you're doing profound things, taking on enormous embedded issues.\nAnd I think with the kind of effort that can be marshaled, you can do amazing things. And that's on behalf of Mike Corbat and myself who chair the Partnership—it's sort of trust, and gets rotated from person to person every 2 years.\nI want to wish you really good luck with the Chinese. That's an important thing, as we all know. And I think there's a real opportunity to make progress with them. And you should have a good time in Florida. I hope the weather is good. [Laughter]\nThe President. Yes, the weather will be beautiful. Thank you, Steve.\nI just want to finish by saying that we are absolutely destroying these horrible regulations that have been placed on your heads over not 8 years, over the last 20 and 25 years. You have regulations that are horrendous. Dodd-Frank is an example of what we're working on, and we're working on it right now. We're going to be coming out with some very strong, not—far beyond recommendations—we're going to be doing things that are going to be very good for the banking industry so that the banks can loan money to people that need it. I speak to people all the time. They used to borrow money from banks to open up—there was one in Nevada—to open up a pizza shop here, he had three shops—he had a bank, and he said, you know—at that time he called me Mr. Trump because I hadn't won yet—but he said: \"Mr. Trump, I can't open up anything; I can't do anything. The banks don't even—I had a bank for 20 years; now they don't even take my phone call. And I was always a very good customer. So I haven't been able to do what I do.\" They can't do it. I mean, the banks got so restricted.\nAnd I've always said—and some people get insulted—but it's not necessarily the man that's making a lot of money that's running the bank. You look at the folks from Government that are running all over the banks, they're running the banks. And the people that are really the head people, they're petrified of the regulators. They're petrified. They can't move. The regulators are running the banks.\nSo we're going to do a very major haircut on Dodd-Frank. We want strong restrictions, we want strong regulation, but not regulation that makes it impossible for the banks to loan to people that are going to create jobs. But we're doing—that's just one example. We're doing so many cuts on regulations. And we have a book on regulations, and if you add them all up, it goes up to the ceiling three times over. It's just one after another after another. It's just like that chart. I thought that chart was so descriptive. And every industry is just like that chart, and that's to build a simple roadway or highway; that's what you have to go through. And we're going to be able to get rid of 90, 95 percent of that and still have the same kind of protection.\nAnd we want safety, and we want environmental—we want environmental protection. I mean, I've won awards on environmental protection. I'm a big believer, believe it or not. But we want that kind of protection. We want clean air, and we want clean water, but we shouldn't have to get the approvals from 16 different agencies for almost the same thing.\nSo we have a country with tremendous potential. We have the greatest people on Earth, but we have to use that potential, and we have to let those people do their thing.\nAnd with that, I just want to thank you all. I think you're going to see a very much different environment than you've been used to over the last, again, 20, 25 years. We're going to unleash the country. And I'm willing to take the heat, and that's okay. I've been taking heat my whole life. But in the end, I know it's the right thing to do.\nAnd we're going to create a lot of jobs. We have a hundred million people, if you look; the real number is not 4.6 percent. They told me I had 4.6 percent last month, I'm doing great. I said, yes, but what about the hundred million people. A lot of those people came out and voted for me. I call them the forgotten man, the forgotten woman. But a lot of those people, a good percentage of them, would like to have jobs, and they don't.\nOne of the statistics that to me is just ridiculous—so the 4.6 sounds good, but when you look for a job, you can't find it and you give up, you are now considered statistically employed. But I don't consider those people employed. If you look at what's happened with Ford and with General Motors and with Fiat Chrysler and so many other car companies, you see what they're doing back in Michigan and Ohio—they were leaving. They were going to Mexico and many other places. They're now staying here.\nNow, I did say—Reed knows this very well, because you've seen me say it many times to the big auto companies at meetings—it's okay, enjoy your new plant; please send me a picture, I'm sure it's going to be lovely. But when you make your car or when you make your air conditioner, and you think you're going to fire all of our workers and open up a new place in another country, and you're going to come through our, what will be a very strong border, which is already—you see what's happened; 61 percent down now in terms of illegal people coming in. Way, way down in terms of drugs pouring into our country and poisoning our youth. Way down. General Kelly has done a great job. But when you think you're going to sell that car or that air conditioner through our border, it's not going to happen. You're going to have a tax. And the tax may be 35 percent.\nAnd you know what, every single major company that I've had that conversation with has said, you know, we've decided to stay in the United States. It's amazing. And you would have thought they would have said this, frankly, for years. But nobody has ever said it. And we've lost close to 70,000 factories over a relatively short period of time—70,000. You wouldn't believe it's possible, Reed, to lose 70,000 factories—70,000. You know, you look at a map of the United States, how many factories can you lose? We lost almost 70,000 factories.\nAnd I will tell you, that's not happening, because now they're staying here, and they're all expanding here. Ford announced last week a massive expansion of three of its plants. That was not going to happen, believe me, if I didn't win.\nSo good luck, everybody. Enjoy yourselves. You're my friends. You're amazing people. And we're going to put you to work. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2017-04-04", "title": "Remarks at a CEO Town Hall Meeting on the United States Business Climate"}

I know them too well. They cost me a lot of money. [Laughter] I spent a lot of money, but I love them, and they're great, and their people are fantastic. And nobody does it like you people, right? Nobody. We talked about that—incredible. Incredible people.\nSo it's great to be back with America's builders. So did you ever think you'd see a President who knows how much concrete and rebar you can lay down in a single day? Believe me, I know. I know. We're a nation of builders, and it was about time we had a builder in the White House, right? We have a builder.\nI want to thank Sean McGarvey and the entire governing board of presidents for honoring me with this great invitation. And I love that it's in Washington, because I don't have to travel—very fair. Worked out pretty well, I have to tell you. Five minutes.\nSean took part in one of our very first meetings at the White House—he mentioned it—and I promise you that America's labor leaders will always find an open door with Donald Trump. Always. Just look at the amazing talent assembled here. We have ironworkers, insulators—[applause]—never changes, does it, with the ironworkers? [Laughter]\nWell, let's hear it. Laborers! [Applause] Painters! [Applause] Fitters! [Applause] Plumbers! [Applause] Operators! [Applause] They're operators, all right, I'll tell you that. [Laughter] Electricians! [Applause] Not that good. Where's my Local 3? Oh, where's Local 3? That wasn't that good, electricians. Well, they became so rich, they don't have to—[laughter]. Let's do that again. Electricians! [Applause] Oh, that's better. Bricklayers! [Applause] Boilermakers! [Applause] Elevator constructors! [Applause] Good job. Sheet-metal workers! [Applause] Roofers! [Applause] Plasterers! [Applause] Plaster, well, yes, that's—we're not using as much plaster as we used to, fellas, right? [Laughter] No matter how you cut it. I'm sorry about that. I'm not sure I can do much—we brought back the coal miners. I'm not so sure about the plasterers. [Laughter] We'll do the best we can, okay? We're going to do the best we can. How about the cement masons! [Applause] And of course, our wonderful Teamsters. [Applause] Oh, that wasn't very good, James. [Laughter] Huh?\nAudience member. Right here!\nThe President. But really, you're the backbone of America. With the talent in this room, we can build any city at any time, and we can build it better than anyone. But we're going to do even better than that. Together, we are going to rebuild our Nation.\nYou're the keepers of the great trades and traditions that built our country. From the New York skyline to the Golden Gate Bridge, you represent the workers whose hands, skills, and dreams will build the great landmarks of our future. Every day, your members live out what I call the American creed. They're on the job before dawn and after dusk, and they never quit until that job is done. And you know that. True. [Applause] True.\nWe saw this grit on display when the construction trades helped rebuild New York City after 9/11. That was a terrible time—we were all there—that was a terrible time in this country's history. Worst attack in the history of our country. Worse than Pearl Harbor. Pearl Harbor, they were attacking military. Here they were attacking civilians. Worst attack. And I saw what happened. Within a very short period of time, we were back rebuilding, and rebuild you did. And I really congratulate—that took a lot of courage and a lot of strength. And thank you.\nThe fact is, you take pride in every part of your work, every joist, bolt, and rivet. You're not only builders, but you're artisans, very talented people—a lot of people don't understand, you're very talented people—enriching our cities and landscapes with works of great beauty. And just as you take pride in your work, our Nation takes great, great pride in you, believe me. And it's time that we give you the level playing field you deserve. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you, folks.\nWashington and Wall Street have done very, very well for themselves. Now, it's your turn. And you're going to be also sharing the wealth. And you know, for many years, we've been taken advantage of by other countries. All over the world they took advantage of us. We had leaders that didn't have a clue or worse. That's not going to happen anymore, folks. That's not going to happen anymore. And you see what's going on right now. In fact, the trade deficit went way down—just announced before I got on stage. And I will tell you, we're going to have a whole different set of values when it comes to representing our country. That I can tell you right now.\nThis election was all about returning power to the people. I've spent my life working side-by-side with American builders, and now you have a builder as your President. One of my first acts as President was to stop one of the great sellouts of the American worker. I immediately withdrew the United States from the disaster—this would have been a disaster—this would have been another NAFTA, which, by the way, is a disaster. I took you out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. [Applause] Thank you. That one wasn't even close. And you know it, and I know it—everybody knows it.\nNext, I cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipelines. And it's looking like that's going to have about 42,000 jobs involved, those two jobs. That some number of great people. That's a big, big, beautiful—lot of people. And Sean, actually, and a whole group joined me in the Oval Office when we approved the Keystone permit.\nAnd I joke—and I joked that day, I said, can you imagine the head of this big Canadian company, in this case, they build pipelines—and they failed. Didn't work. They paid millions and millions and hundreds of millions of dollars to consultants and lawyers, and they failed. And it was over. And then, one day Trump wins, and a few days later they get a knock on the door—sir, the Keystone pipeline was just approved.\nCan you imagine? I want to see the expression on his face. And he's a nice guy. He actually—they came to the office. Because I did say you have to use American steel, you have to fabricate it here. Now, they had already bought 60, 70 percent of it. So you can't be too wild, right? But I was signing the order, and I said, \"Where did they buy this steel?\" I didn't like the answer. I said, \"Who fabricated the steel?\" I didn't like the answer. I said, \"From now on, we're going to put a clause—got to be made in America.\" We want American steel, made in America. Right on the bottom. Hundred percent, fellas. Right?\nAnd you'll be hearing more about this in the very near future. But as time goes by, let's say, over the next 7¾ years, meaning 8 years. [Laughter] We believe in two simple rules: Buy American and hire American. That's what it's going to be. And that's not just a slogan, it's a promise. Believe me, that's a promise.\nThe era of economic surrender has come to an end. It's come to an end. We have surrendered, as a country, to outside interests. The era of economic victory for our country has just begun. You will see. No longer will we listen to those failed consultants who've made one wrong prediction after another, delivering nothing but soaring trade deficits and a big, fat, shrinking workforce.\nFor decades now, we've watched as our factories have shuttered—almost 70,000 factories—our jobs have been stolen, and blue collar wages have declined. We've seen the economic pain inflicted on our fellow Americans in Pittsburgh and Detroit and Baltimore. We didn't just offshore our jobs, we offshored a big, big part of the American Dream.\nWe enriched foreign countries at the expense of our own country, the great United States of America. But those days are over. I'm not—and I don't want to be—the President of the world. I'm the President of the United States. And from now on, it's going to be America first.\nWe're going to bring back our jobs, and yes, we're going to bring back the American Dream. As I traveled the Nation, I heard the pleas of the forgotten men and women of our country, the people who work hard and play by the rules, but who don't have a voice. Together, we are their voice, and they will never, ever be forgotten again. That I can tell you.\nI don't know if you saw, but if you watch the Democrats now, the anger—the anger and hatred, and they're trying to figure out where did all these people came that voted for Donald Trump? Remember they said—because the electoral college is very, very hard, they say, almost impossible for a Republican to win. The odds are stacked. And they would say there's no way to 270—you need 270—there's no way to 270. Now, I heard that so much for a year. I kept saying, maybe I shouldn't be running. You know, Sean, I said, maybe I shouldn't run, because there's no way. The people are telling me—the same people that say all of the bad stuff, they're saying—there's no way to 270. Well—but there was a way to 306. [Laughter]\nBut wasn't that an exciting one? Places that nobody entered—Donald Trump has won the State of Michigan. They go, what? Donald Trump has won the State of Wisconsin. They came out of the blue, and we didn't even need them. And we love those two States—because we won the State of Pennsylvania, and we won Ohio and Iowa and North Carolina and South Carolina and Florida and so many others. We ran the coast. And if you don't run it, you can't win. Huge disadvantage, the electoral college. It's very, very tough. They say almost impossible for a Republican to win. But I had the support of, I would say, I would say almost everybody in this room.\nWe had tremendous—we had tremendous support. No, we did. We had tremendous support. We had tremendous support. And I'll tell you, we really had the support of the workers. We had tremendous support of the workers. What, would you like to make a change, folks? Would you like to make a change? Because if anybody wants to make a change, you won't be having so many jobs. That I can tell you. Your jobs will be—it will be a whole different story. Because in the last decade, you lost over 750 construction—think of this—750,000 construction jobs. Real wages in the construction sector have fallen more than 15 percent since the 1970s. We rank 39th in the world for construction permitting. And approvals for infrastructure projects can take up to 10 years. Since taking office, I've signed one action after another to eliminate job-killing regulations that stand in the way. I had a chart—is that chart around here someplace? Did you have that? I have to show this chart to you, because it's amazing, actually. [Laughter]\n[At this point, the President was handed a chart, which he then showed to the audience.]\nThis is—if you want to build a highway in the United States, these are some of the permits that you need. [Laughter] It's a process that can take way over 10 years. And it just never happens. Then, at the end of the period, they vote against it. And we're getting rid of many of these regulations. You have to go through 17 agencies, many permits in each agency.\nIn February alone, we added almost 60,000 new construction jobs in the country. I ordered expedited environmental reviews for infrastructure, environmental, and energy projects all across the country. No longer will you have to wait year after year for approvals that never come.\nI also took historic action to lift the restrictions on American energy production and to put our miners, who have been treated horribly, back to work. Consumer confidence—[applause]—they're great people. Consumer confidence is at the highest level in more than a decade. You've seen all of the charts, all of the studies. The National Association of Manufacturers just the other day reported the most optimism in the entire history of its survey—which is a old survey—93 percent of manufacturers are optimistic about the future. That's almost 27 percent lower than that just a few months ago.\nThe Home Builders Confidence Index is at its highest level in 12 years. And now, in breaking news—it was just reported today—the monthly U.S. trade deficit declined by 10 percent, for a reason. Not by accident, believe me. It was for a reason.\nWe're also going to protect your jobs by protecting our borders. My administration is—just a matter of weeks, in literally, a short period of time—has brought record reductions to illegal immigration. Record reductions. Down 61 percent since Inauguration. General Kelly is doing a fantastic job. And we'll crack down on visa abuses that undermine the American worker. And we're doing that right now.\nThese, and so many other great achievements, have defined our first 10 weeks in office. We've done so much for the worker. Done so much for the military. We've done so much for the police officers, our men in blue and women in blue, who are not treated fairly. We're fighting for workers of all backgrounds and from all walks of life.\nBut to achieve true progress, we must remember our legacy. We're the Nation that built the tallest skyscrapers on what was once the Hudson River and put neon lights of Las Vegas in the middle of the desert. But if Government continues to punish America's builders, then we will not be that Nation any longer.\nI'm calling on all Americans—Democrat, Republican, Independent—to come together and take part in the great rebuilding of our country.\nThat is why, in my address to Congress, I called on lawmakers to pass legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in the infrastructure of our country. And we need it. With your help, we can rebuild our country's bridges, airports, seaports, and water systems. We will streamline the process to get approvals quickly, so that long-delayed projects can finally move ahead. And with lower taxes on America's middle class and businesses, we will see a new surge of economic growth and development. All of you have come to the Nation's Capital to call Members of the House and Senate to action. You've also called your President to action. When you see them, you can tell Congress that America's building trades and its President are very much united. [Applause] Thank you.\nTogether, we are ready to break new ground. We will build in the spirit of one of the great projects in our Nation's history, an enduring symbol of American strength. The Empire State Building was forged in the Great Depression and provided jobs for more than 3,000 workers. We've all seen the pictures: rugged workers perched dozens and dozens of stories up in the air. Workers like these moved almost 60,000 tons of steel, installed 200,000 cubic feet of stone, and laid 10 million bricks to build that American icon. And they did the job in a record time—13 months. Hard to believe. Think of that: the Empire State Building built in 13 months, during the Depression. Nowadays, you couldn't even get a building permit—[laughter]—or approval in that amount of time.\nWhen the workers had secured the last piece of steel in that amazing and beautiful structure, they marked the moment—as we still do today—with what is called a \"topping out\" ceremony: 1,050 feet above the streets of New York City, they hoisted a beautiful and great American flag.\nAudience member. The ironworkers!\nThe President. They did a good job. They did a good, those ironworkers, you'd better believe it.\nIt was an American flag that represented American projects, the big, bold, and daring dream of one man and then one city and, then finally, one people. That banner marked our Nation's proud climb to the top of the world. Our people endured through the hardships of Depression and the battles of World War II, and they emerged from these trials stronger and more united than ever before. Now, we must again summon that same national greatness to meet the challenges of our time.\nOnly miles from the halls of Congress and the newsrooms of Washington, you will find once-thriving cities marred by empty lots and once-booming industrial towns that have become rusted and are in total disrepair. Standing before me today, in this very hall, are the men and women who, if given the chance, can transform these communities. You are the citizens who can rebuild our cities, revive our industries, and renew our beloved country. And I know you will stop at nothing to get the job done.\nFor the rest of their lives, everyone who worked on the Empire State Building knew when they looked up at that great New York skyline that they had lifted the Stars and Stripes atop the tallest flagpole on Earth and that somewhere high above the city streets, their place in history was carved into beams of steel.\nIn the future, when we become—the trials—and we are—trials of our times—we too will emerge stronger and more united than ever before. It's happening, you watch. When we rise above the cynics and critics who live only to defend the status quo and to defend themselves from failure, then we, too, will construct a lasting monument to national greatness.\nIn this future, our Nation's workers and craftsmen will look way out at the vast open landscape, and they will build new bridges and new schools and new landmarks, and they will proudly raise up for all to see our bright and beautiful American flag. And when we see that flag, we will remember that we all share one American home, one American heart, and one American destiny. May God bless our Nation's builders. May God bless our Nation's workers. And may God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2017-04-04", "title": "Remarks at the North America's Building Trades Unions 2017 Legislative Conference"}

In order to advise and assist me in executing this solemn responsibility, as well as to protect and advance the national interests of the United States at home and abroad, I hereby direct that my system for national security policy development and decision making shall be organized as follows:\nA. The National Security Council, the Homeland Security Council, and Supporting Staff\nThe National Security Act of 1947, as amended, established the National Security Council (NSC) to advise the President with respect to the integration of domestic, foreign, and military policies relating to the national security. There is also a Homeland Security Council (HSC)—established through Executive Order 13228 of October 8, 2001, and subsequently codified in the Homeland Security Act of 2002—that has the purpose of advising the President on matters pertaining to homeland security. Each Council is also responsible for the effective coordination of the security-related activities and functions of the executive departments and agencies.\nThe security threats facing the United States in the 21st century transcend international boundaries. Accordingly, the United States Government's decision-making structures and processes to address these challenges must remain equally adaptive and transformative. Both Councils are statutory bodies that the President will continue to chair. Invitations to participate in specific Council meetings shall be extended to those heads of executive departments and agencies, and other senior officials, who are needed to address the issue or issues under consideration. When the President is absent from a meeting of either Council, the Vice President may preside at the President's direction.\nThe Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs (National Security Advisor) shall be responsible, as appropriate and at the President's direction, for determining the agenda for the NSC or HSC, respectively, ensuring that the necessary papers are prepared and recording Council actions and Presidential decisions in a timely manner. The Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism (Homeland Security Advisor) may, at the sole discretion of the National Security Advisor, perform those functions. When international economic issues are on the agenda of the NSC, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy may, at the sole discretion of the National Security Advisor, perform those functions.\nThe NSC and HSC shall have as their regular attendees (both statutory and non-statutory) the President, the Vice President, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the National Security Advisor, the Homeland Security Advisor, and the Representative of the United States to the United Nations. The Director of National Intelligence and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as statutory advisors to the NSC, shall also be regular attendees, as will the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.\nWhen international economic issues are on the agenda of the NSC, the NSC's regular attendees will include the Secretary of Commerce, the United States Trade Representative, and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy.\nThe Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff (Chief of Staff to the President), the Counsel to the President, the Deputy Counsel to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget are invited as attendees to any NSC meeting.\nIn addition to the NSC and HSC, there is also a single NSC staff within the Executive Office of the President that serves both the NSC and HSC. The staff is composed of regional, issue-focused, and functional directorates and headed by a single civilian Executive Secretary, pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 3021, who is also the Chief of Staff. All policy and staff activity decisions will be transmitted to the Executive Secretary for appropriate distribution and awareness. The purpose of the staff is to advise the President, the National Security Advisor, the Homeland Security Advisor, the NSC members, the HSC members, and others in the White House; to facilitate the implementation of Administration policy; and to help coordinate the national-security-related activities of the executive departments and agencies.\nB. The Principals Committee\nThe Principals Committee (PC) shall continue to serve as the Cabinet-level senior interagency forum for considering policy issues that affect the national security interests of the United States. The PC shall be convened and chaired by the National Security Advisor. The Homeland Security Advisor may, at the sole discretion of the National Security Advisor, also convene and chair the PC. The Chair shall determine the agenda in consultation with the appropriate committee members, and the Executive Secretary shall ensure that necessary papers are prepared, and that conclusions and decisions are communicated in a timely manner. Invitations to participate in or attend a specific PC shall be extended at the discretion of the Chair, and may include those Cabinet-level heads of executive departments and agencies, and other senior officials, who are needed to address any issue under consideration.\nThe PC shall have as its regular attendees the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Chief of Staff to the President, the Director of National Intelligence, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Advisor, the Homeland Security Advisor, and the Representative of the United States to the United Nations. The Counsel to the President, the Deputy Counsel to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget may attend all PC meetings.\nThe Assistant to the President and Deputy National Security Advisor (Deputy National Security Advisor), the Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategy, the Deputy Assistant to the President and National Security Advisor to the Vice President, and the Executive Secretary (who shall serve as the Executive Secretary of the PC) shall attend all of the meetings of the PC, and the Assistant to the President for Intragovernmental and Technology Initiatives may attend as appropriate.\nWhen international economic issues are on the agenda of the PC, the Committee's regular attendees will include the Secretary of Commerce, the United States Trade Representative, and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy (who shall serve as Chair for agenda items that principally pertain to international economics).\nC. The Deputies Committee\nThe Deputies Committee (DC) shall continue to serve as the senior sub-Cabinet interagency forum for consideration of, and where appropriate, decision making on, policy issues that affect the national security interests of the United States. The DC shall be convened and chaired by the Deputy National Security Advisor. The Deputy Homeland Security Advisor may, at the sole discretion of the National Security Advisor, also convene and Chair the DC. The Chair shall determine the agenda in consultation with the regular DC attendees, and the Executive Secretary shall ensure that necessary papers are prepared and that conclusions and decisions are communicated in a timely manner. Invitations to participate in or attend a specific DC meeting shall be extended by the Chair to those at the Deputy Secretary or Under Secretary level of executive departments and agencies, and to other senior officials, who are needed to address any issue under consideration.\nThe DC shall have as its regular attendees the Deputy Secretary of State, the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, the Deputy Attorney General, the Deputy Secretary of Energy, the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security, the Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Deputy Director of National Intelligence, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, the Deputy National Security Advisor, the Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategy, the Deputy Homeland Security Advisor, the Deputy Assistant to the President and National Security Advisor to the Vice President, and the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development.\nThe Executive Secretary shall attend the DC meetings. The Deputy Counsel to the President for National Security Affairs may attend all DC meetings. Other senior officials, including the Deputy Representative of the United States to the United Nations, may be invited when appropriate.\nThe DC shall review and monitor the work of the interagency national security process, including the interagency groups established pursuant to section D below. The DC shall help to ensure that issues brought before the NSC, HSC, and PC have been properly analyzed and prepared for decision. The DC shall also focus significant attention on monitoring the implementation of policies and decisions and shall conduct periodic reviews of the Administration's major national security and foreign policy initiatives. The DC is responsible for establishing Policy Coordination Committees (PCCs) and for providing objectives and clear guidance.\nD. Policy Coordination Committees\nManagement of the development and implementation of national security policies by multiple executive departments and agencies typically shall be accomplished by the PCCs, with participation primarily occurring at the Assistant Secretary level. As the main day-to-day fora for interagency coordination of national security policies, the PCCs shall provide policy analysis for consideration by the more senior committees of the national security system and ensure timely responses to the President's decisions.\nRegional and issue-related PCCs shall be established at the direction of the DC. Members of the NSC staff (or National Economic Council staff, as appropriate) will chair the PCCs; the DC, at its discretion, may add co-chairs to any PCC. The PCCs shall review and coordinate the implementation of Presidential decisions in their respective policy areas. The Chair of each PCC, in consultation with the Executive Secretary, shall invite representatives of other executive departments and agencies to attend meetings of the PCC where appropriate. The Chair of each PCC, with the agreement of the Executive Secretary, may establish subordinate working groups to assist that PCC in the performance of its duties.\nE. General\nThe President and the Vice President may attend any and all meetings of any entity established by or under this memorandum.\nThis document is part of a series of National Security Presidential Memoranda, which have replaced both Presidential Policy Directives and Presidential Study Directives as the instrument for communicating relevant Presidential decisions. This memorandum shall supersede all other existing Presidential directives and guidance on the organization or support of the NSC and the HSC, including National Security Presidential Memorandum — 2 (January 28, 2017), which is hereby revoked. With regard to its application to economic matters, this document shall be interpreted in concert with any Executive Order governing the National Economic Council and with Presidential Memoranda signed hereafter that implement it or those Executive Orders.\nThe Secretary of Defense is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.\nDONALD J.

SPICER: Couple quick -- Marc Short, Director of Legislative Affairs, is going to go over the Congressional Review Act and what we've got for an update.\nFirst thing, Secretary Kelly was up on the Hill and talked about where we are with immigration. We should have a statement out very shortly from the White House discussing some of the highlights. If you've seen any of the numbers, there's a 35 percent, from this month to last month, in terms of immigration being down at 65 percent --\nQ: Year to year, correct?\nMR. SPICER: Year to year. And so obviously those are things that you'll see -- we'll highlight in the statement, but obviously, Secretary Tillerson -- Secretary Kelly's testimony was that. For background, I may try to have some more on Syria later today. We're working on potentially having some more. I'll give you an update on that.\nQ: Before the press conference?\nMR. SPICER: No, no, no. If we have anything -- and then obviously the presser is at 1:10 p.m.\nQ: Is it two and two?\nMR. SPICER: Two and two in the Rose Garden.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Marc Short, Director of Legislative Affairs, to talk a little about the Congressional Review Act and everything else.\nQ: Everything else? (Laughter.)\nQ: First Syria. (Laughter.)\nMR. SHORT: I'm glad Sean is staying, because I can just deflect in.\nThanks, guys. Good morning to you. We wanted to take a few minutes to talk about what the administration has been focused on in terms of regulatory burden. And that's best, I think, embodied to the Congressional Review Act and legislation. And I don't think Americans really understand what is the Congressional Review Act. And so I want to sort of frame this in the larger context of the regulatory burden that this administration inherited and what we're trying to do with that.\nI think the President is keeping his promise to Americans to roll back that regulatory burden. And as a result, I believe that we are helping to spur growth in the American economy. We inherited -- this administration did -- the biggest regulatory burden, we believe, of any President in American history. And after an onslaught of new regulations that we believe were slow on the economy and hardworking Americans, this administration has gone to work at how to pull that back.\nThe previous administration authored more than 600 major regulations according to the Federal Register, with an estimated cost to the economy of about $740 billion. President Trump, on the campaign, promised several things on this front. He promised to freeze regulations and to \"issue a temporary moratorium on new agency regulations.\" And he did that. He promised that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. That promise has been kept. He promised to lift the restrictions on American energy, and he's done that. He promised to ask each and every federal agency to prepare a list of all the regulations that they impose on the Americans, which are not necessary -- and he's done that. He promised to cut regulations massively, as he said, and he has. And I'm asking you to look at what the Congressional Review Act does.\nThe Congressional Review Act was signed into law in 1996. And what many of you may know is it allows a limited window for us to actually pull back previous regulations. So it allows Congress, the House and the Senate, to look at those regulations and to eliminate those, that they pass by a simple majority.\nWhen you change administrations, it allows you an additional 60-day legislative calendar window to look back. So there's a 60-day backward window and also, in the new administration, an additional 60 days on the legislative calendar. What all that means I think for -- what you guys need to know is that window is closing at the end of April. Previously, there had been one time in history -- President Bush in 2001 used the Congressional Review Act to sign into law legislation to pull back those regulations. This administration has already signed 11, and there are two more pending for us to sign.\nWe believe this is having a dramatic impact in pulling back the regulatory burden, as I said, and that we believe that, so far, that cost or that benefit to the economy is over $10 billion in regulations through the Congressional Review Act that are being saved by the American taxpayer so far.\nIn addition, as you know, we're using executive action to stop some of the costs of these regulations. He signed more than a dozen executive orders that, among other things, require us to review the cost of the Clean Power Plan, review EPA's Waters to the U.S. regulation, clear regulatory burdens to small businesses, lift the moratorium on onshore coal leasing, begin a plan to reorganize or eliminate wasteful government agencies, and to give the HHS Secretary the discretion to provide states with the flexibility under Obamacare. These are all efforts to, again, in different areas, pull back on the regulatory front.\nSome of the CRAs are not specific to jobs, but many of them are. We believe that major companies like Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Exxon, Lockheed, and even Carrier, have mentioned to the President and the Vice President different times that one of the reasons they're recommitting to job growth in the United States and keeping jobs here is because of the commitment to sign these pieces of legislation, to pull back on the regulations that they've been facing, and as well the commitments to tax reform.\nSo those are efforts that we believe are helping to create jobs. But we're asking you today to consider -- I know there's a lot of big stories -- tax reform, healthcare, a lot of things you're covering -- is that this window on the CRA closes. And we do think that, again, that Bush having signed one, this administration already signed 11 into law, it is a tool that we're taking advantage of and that we're actually passing this legislation, and that working with House and Senate leadership, there are several more that we hope to sign before this window closes on April 28th.\nAnd we believe it's actually having a dramatic impact for the American taxpayer. Do we have those?\nSo we also have to give you a quick handout. And this I think summarizes what those 11 are, what the two are that are pending, and then additionally a couple that have passed the House. They're waiting for action in the Senate that we hope to receive to sign into law before the end of April, as well.\nSo a quick overview on what the CRA does, which ones are pending.\nWith that, I'd be happy to take questions.\nQ: You said the impact is $10 billion with a \"B\" or million with an \"M\"?\nMR. SHORT: B, as in billion.\nQ: Over what period of time? Per year?\nMR. SHORT: Andy is the smart one -- 20 years.\nQ: That's $10 billion over 20 years.\nMR. SHORT: Yes, Major.\nQ: When you pass, and the President signs, a CRA, it essentially ends that regulatory process. And in its place Congress has to create something else or nothing happens. Like with the ISP one, the FCC can't do anything until Congress decides to do something in exchange for whatever was there before.\nIn that instance, when you have Google, Facebook, and the Internet service providers, does this administration believe there should be some privacy legislation drafted and passed to deal with those underlying issues? Or is it simply content to take away this difference between what the regulatory regime was for Google and Facebook and what it was for the ISP one?\nMR. SHORT: We're content right now in pulling back on what was previous, Major. I think when we're able to nominate and confirm our own people on the FCC, I'm sure they'll take a fresh look at that.\nQ: On the whole privacy issue and what legislation may be required?\nMR. SHORT: I'm not telling you there will be legislation required. I'm simply saying that they're going to take a fresh look at that, and there will be time for them to do that. For now, we thought it was appropriate to sign the legislation that repealed what was there.\nQ: Thank you. What do you say to critics who say you're not carefully considering the regulations enough on their own merit? For example, Congressman McGovern -- Jim McGovern -- said bringing things up without any review by committee of jurisdiction under closed rules and in a way that may have some unintended consequences is a \"stupid way to do things.\" Is there a risk of doing this too quickly?\nMR. SHORT: I think there was a huge risk to the economy what was happening before. And I think that there was -- what was happening is clearly from the executive agencies. I think impacts were not even getting reviewed by the legislative branch. So I think that what we're actually doing is allowing the legislative branch to work its will, in coordination with us, to try to pull back on things that were not done legislatively.\nQ: You commented that you're reviewing each regulation carefully enough that you're not running roughshod over some of these.\nMR. SHORT: Yes.\nQ: Given that your difficulty is getting healthcare legislation passed, do you think that your regulatory repeals are going to be the major legislative accomplishment for the foreseeable future with this administration?\nMR. SHORT: No, I think that this is a huge accomplishment in the first quarter. I think you have to keep in mind, again, that this window closes. So in concert with Speaker Ryan and Leader McConnell, there was clearly an intentional effort to say this is our window to do this, and we have to focus on it.\nI think there has no doubt been a lot of focus in the media on other issues and not this legislative track. And I confess that any one of these is not going to really drive a news story. But I think if you take in totality what we've been trying to do on the regulatory front, it is a news story. And so I do think it's an accomplishment.\nI also think that, legislatively, we certainly look forward to confirming Judge Gorsuch on Friday, and I think that that is certainly, as well, something that we will look back proudly upon at the process that was laid out there, the process of choosing that particular nominee and helping to get him confirmed I think as somebody who has proven to be a terrific jurist and will make an impact on the Supreme Court for decades to come.\nQ: Do you think that -- this has been done more times than all other Presidents combined since the CRA was passed, and it's being used to roll back exclusively regulations from the Obama administration, do you think that using the CRA so much during this review period sets a precedent where one administration will come in and just get rid of everything the previous one did? And do you worry that this could happen on the opposite side if Democrats take back Congress and the White House? And how do you have continuity if this keeps happening?\nMR. SHORT: Fair question, but I think there are several things that made this environment possible. Keep in mind, it's not something that is done unilaterally; we have to work with Congress to get it passed. So there is a process. It has to get majorities in the House and the Senate before it ever reaches us to actually pull back on these regulations.\nI think that what happened was, during the Obama administration there was a historic number of regulations put into place that afforded this administration that opportunity to pull them back. But I also think it's a promise that President Trump made on the campaign trail to the American people that he would do exactly this.\nAnd so, therefore, we believe that it's fulfilling a campaign promise. We said this is something that is crippling the American economy and we're going to address it, and this is one of the vehicles through which we're addressing it.\nQ: But say you guys get done with this review period and the Trump administration starts putting forth regulations, and the next President, say is a Democrat, and the Democrats take back Congress, and they do the same thing, do you worry that --\nMR. SHORT: Keep in mind, this tool only allows us to go back to 60 calendar days in legislative action. So we're not able to look at eight years of the Obama administration.\nQ: I realize that. But my point is, do you worry that you're setting a precedent where this could come off as sort of vengeful, we won, we're going to erase what you did, and the next guy is going to come in and do the same thing?\nMR. SHORT: I don't think it's done with a vengeful spirit. I think it's done with --\nQ: I didn't say it was. I said (inaudible) --\nMR. SHORT: Your word was \"vengeful,\" so I'm repeating your question. But I think what we said is that this is what the President campaigned on, is that he would look to peel back the regulatory burden. This is one of the vehicles to do that. And I think that's the bigger message, is that we promised that to the American taxpayer, the American job creator, and this is one of the vehicles through which we are accomplishing that end.\nYes, sir.\nQ: Once this window closes at the end of the month, what's your deregulatory effort going to look like? And can you give us a preview of what specific industries might be affected after this tool expires?\nMR. SHORT: Great question. I do think that, because of this, there's been more focus on it in the first quarter of this year. But I think that we'll continue -- what instead will happen probably is you'll see more action from the executive branch. So I think there'll be some secretaries for whom their industries, in particular, they'll be looking to pass new orders that may be addressed -- some of the regulatory burden there.\nQ: Can you spotlight any industries you have in mind at targeting?\nMR. SHORT: No, I'm going to leave that to the Cabinet secretaries to address themselves.\nYes, sir.\nQ: Two questions. One, on the regulatory stuff. A fair bit of the regulation that you've gone after has already -- never actually went into effect because it's been tied up in courts, as you said, or hadn't been fully implemented because you can only go back a certain number of days, as you said, anyway.\nSo is it fair to -- I mean, as we sort of try to judge how effective you guys have been -- I mean, some of the stuff that you're rolling back, and you've talked about the numbers of impact -- $10 billion -- is that a fair way to measure it, given that it never took -- some of the stuff never took --\nMR. SHORT: Those are estimated costs of what the impact would be. I don't know another way to sort of gauge that for you.\nQ: And second question on healthcare. Talk a little bit about these meetings that have taken place yesterday on Capitol Hill, last night with the Vice President, earlier in the day. You know, you're the guy in charge of trying to get this stuff done on healthcare. Where do you -- give us some sense, on a scale of 1 to 10, or a percentage rating, or whatever, how close -- or timing -- you know, how close are we -- a day, a week, a month, a year -- from some kind of re-do on the healthcare bill?\nMR. SHORT: Sure. What I would say is that, look, the healthcare system in America needs to be addressed. We know that patients are getting crushed by the current system. We know that insurers are fleeing the exchanges. It's a promise that Republican lawmakers have made since 2010, to repeal Obamacare. There unity in what that goal is.\nI think that what we've seen in the last couple days that encourages us is that members within the Republican conference that, frankly, previously were not engaged in the conversations, are now in engaged in them. So last night, when we had members of the Freedom Caucus, and the Tuesday Group, and the RSC in the same room talking through the same issues, we feel like that is progress. I think that there is a great sense from the members that say, we know as well that this is a promise we made to the American people, and we have to get to a better result than we did two weeks ago. And I think there is a sense of partnership with the administration reaching that.\nI can't give you a timetable as to when we think that that will happen, but I can tell you that I think there is a -- there is not people within our conference -- Republican conference -- saying no. There are people saying not yet. And I think that we are getting closer and closer to this process to hopefully making sure that we put in place a better healthcare system.\nQ: We talked a couple of days ago about a text -- some legislative text that people said was going to be coming out of this building. Then we never saw it.\nMR. SHORT: I think some of those reports were erroneous. I think that there's been some discussions about conceptually what are the new ideas that would help bridge some of the impasse and bring groups together. As to what timetable we will have text available to review, I'm not committed to that yet.\nQ: To follow up on that, if you say that there are members who were not engaged but now are engaged -- not saying no, but saying not yet -- what are the issues that are on the table that are being discussed that are bringing them in? Like what concessions has -- or compromise options has the White House put out, specific policy points?\nMR. SHORT: I think that when I say that there are groups not engaged, to be clear, what I'm saying is they're not engaged in the same room. So they were engaged, but it was sort of this -- as some people around here call it -- the shuttle diplomacy. Whereas now we're all in the same room having the same conversation together.\nAs far as the issues that we're discussing, I think they've been well circulated. I think that we want to make sure that whatever reforms are done are making sure that premiums are brought down. I think that that is one of the primary concerns, yet you're still providing access to patients.\nYes, sir.\nQ: I know when the AHCA was first rolled out, there was this talk of a phase two where there would be a bunch of regulatory changes on healthcare. Does the administration plan to go forward with those changes regardless of what happens with the legislation in Congress?\nMR. SHORT: I don't want to speak for Secretary Price, but I believe that -- look, we are committed to making sure that reforms are done, that he can handle in ways that benefit the patient. So I don't think we're looking to slow that down.\nMR. KOENIG: Before you go on, if there are any more questions on the CRA, keep your hands up. And then Marc, I'm sure, will be happy to answer a couple more questions on healthcare, but we're really here on the CRA. So we could go that direction first, and then a couple more on healthcare, and then we're going to be done.\nQ: I'm wondering if you can tell us a little bit about how this fits into the conservative philosophy, like what you're hoping to achieve and whether or not there's discussions about the direction that conservative philosophy is going?\nMR. SHORT: Sure. Well, thanks. I think that there's a lot of members in the House and the Senate and this administration believe that a more limited role of government is beneficial to our economy and provides consumers with more freedom. And I think that that's the overarching way that we look at a lot of the regulatory burden. We want to make sure that the government has the right role in ensuring that industries are safe, but we don't want to go beyond that in ways that we are losing jobs. And I think the President made clear that what we need to do is to create jobs for Americans.\nAnd so we want to make sure that the agencies in charge of providing safety are doing that, yet at the same time not providing undue burdens that crush job creators. And I think that that is part of the conservative philosophy.\nQ: Just to follow up, how do you reconcile the goals that you have with the (inaudible) government, like the Midwestern conservative who wants that, as opposed to like the infrastructure program that the President has talked about? How does that work?\nMR. SHORT: I think there will be a lot more to come on the infrastructure at a later time, but I think one thing the administration has said is they're looking for public-private partnerships that I think will provide opportunities where it's not simply on the taxpayer's shoulders. But I think, as well, there is clearly a need -- even whether you're conservative, liberal -- we're finding the interest from legislators across the spectrum to say, we want to work with you on infrastructure because we recognize the infrastructure is crumbling in America.\nYes, sir.\nQ: Can you talk briefly about the CRA and the decisions that are being made by the administration, and how this intersects with the President's larger tax plan for the American people? You talked about saving the taxpayers money. Can you talk a little bit about that relationship briefly?\nMR. SHORT: I wouldn't want to exaggerate the relationship with tax reform. I think that we have been in contact with the Speaker and the Leader about prioritizing which CRAs are brought up and when. So there is a concerted and coordinated strategy on that. I think tax reform is simply going to be a separate vehicle in which we're trying to prioritize tax breaks to the middle class that we feel are getting crushed.\nQ: On tax reform, the President -- like most politicians, but maybe more so -- has not spoken much in the language of trade-offs, which obviously tax reform will require. How are you planning on selling this? Because the healthcare -- that was one of the difficulties. How are you going to sell tax reform and make sure that the trade-offs don't become an impediment and helping the President adjust his language?\nMR. SHORT: I think that healthcare -- conversations that we've had have shown that in many cases Democrats recognize the challenge to the current healthcare system, and they're uncomfortable with the increases that they face for -- the constituents have faced. But I think the effort of repealing Obamacare would be something that would complicate their base. And so there's probably less partnership in that.\nTax reform, though, I think we find that there will be, actually, interest. In many cases, many Democrats have reached out to say that they want to help on this process too. They recognize it's been 30 years since significant tax reform was done. So I don't necessarily say that one is conditional upon the other. I think there will be bipartisan interest to work on tax reform.\nYes, sir.\nQ: On the CRA, there is a legal theory percolating around out there that the CRA applies not just to regulations but sort of guidance, documents, other sort of soft regulations. And if those were never submitted to Congress or their GAO, that 60-day clock never started. Is the administration doing anything on that issue to do a retrospective look at whether there may be additional regulatory dark matter that could be submitted through the CRA process?\nMR. SHORT: You can answer him.\nMR. KOENIG: As far as we know, counterparts in the Senate are taking a look at that. There's some guidance that we need from folks on the Hill, from congressional researchers. So they're looking at it. We haven't weighed in one way or the other on that. We're focused on the ones that are clearly within the statute.\nQ: Who at the White House has been spearheading sort of identifying the regulations that could be rolled back, which ones you wanted to roll back? Has this been a Hill-driven process mostly? And who has been -- sort of who are the different players here?\nMR. SHORT: It's no doubt a process that is driven by the Hill, but it's one in which we've been in coordination with them. So that's partly my job. I lean on Andy to be the brains of our leg affairs team, so he helps me understand, from a policy perspective, which ones are most important. But no doubt that the way legislation is drafted is for Congress to take the lead in repealing executive branch regulations.\nQ: So if the point of all this is to create jobs and stimulate the economy, how does repealing Internet privacy rules do that?\nMR. SHORT: It's fair -- as I said in the beginning -- that not each one of these can you look at and say it is necessarily a job creator. There are some that I think are addressing other regulations.\nSo I accept your premise, but I would ask you to look back and say that many of these do, in fact, have significant job impact. And as I opened, what we're trying to say is, there's been an enormous effort, not just in CRAs but also in executive orders, to try to address the regulatory burden. And this is one way that we're hoping you'll take a fresh look in saying, this window closes at the end of April, so therefore it's worth us taking a look and saying, okay, what has been the collective effort between the administration and Congress to address this. I accept your point that not every single one --\nQ: What was the point of repealing it, though? What was the point of repealing that one? Or what is your justification for that, is my question.\nMR. SHORT: Do you want to address what Senator Flake's initiative?\nMR. KOENIG: It's duplicative of FTC regulations that are already in place, as another layer of compliance for ISPs that were already, as I said, regulated under FTC, and was now adding a FCC requirement that was treating them as if they were outside of the sphere of other Internet providers.\nThis wasn't something that was being applied to search engines. This wasn't something that was being applied to social media providers. So this was something that was duplicative of regulations that were already on the books and not necessary in our opinion.\nQ: I wanted to follow up on how this is -- in totality, this is a real news story. Is there a concern that the President is going to get through his first 100 days without any significant legislation? Is that one of the reasons you're here?\nMR. SHORT: I think there is a concern that this is an important story that has not been told. I'll leave for others to shape the first hundred days. I think that, when you look back and you say, in the hundred days we will confirm a Supreme Court Justice, I consider that a pretty significant achievement.\nSo I'm not here from a position of saying we need to justify the first hundred days. I do think that this is a story that has not been told, and I think that there are other stories that -- obviously, you have your own jobs to do that are easier to explain to the American people. And certainly healthcare, the Supreme Court, others are out there. But this, I think, is an untold one, which is why we wanted to be here and share it with you today.\nMR. KOENIG: Mark, thank you very much. And I guess I would just add to this, part of -- to follow up on your question here, we're also trying to make administration officials available to talk through a lot of -- on background -- a lot of these issues to help explain them. So hopefully, if these aren't helpful to you all, let us know and we'll stop doing them. But, I mean, to your point --\nQ: No, they are. (Laughter.)\nMR. KOENIG: So we're trying to create more of a dialogue and make stars out of our administration officials. So I do have the paperwork that Marc referenced, so I can hand these out.\nAnd actually, before we all go, I want one other thing clear about this. This was on the record. You can use this. We also are going to try -- we will let you know when these are on background, but we've heard the requests that many have made that we need to do more of these on record, and this was on the record, and we'll try to do more.\nEND 11:01 A.M.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "note": "The President's news conference began at 1:10 p.m. in the Rose Garden at the White House. In his remarks, the President referred to President Bashar al-Asad of Syria; and President Xi Jinping of China. He also referred to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) terrorist organization. King Abdullah referred to Secretary of Defense John N. Mattis; and Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123687", "text": "President Trump. Thank you very much. Your Majesty, thank you for being with us today. Very much appreciate it. This is our second meeting since my Inauguration, but our first at the White House. A very special place, I can tell you that. I've gotten to know it well. Long hours. Very special.\nIt's really an honor to welcome you here today. But before we begin, let me say a few words about recent events.\nChemical Weapons Attack in Khan Sheikhoun, Syria\nYesterday chemical attack—a chemical attack that was so horrific, in Syria, against innocent people, including women, small children, and even beautiful little babies. Their deaths was an affront to humanity. These heinous actions by the Asad regime cannot be tolerated. The United States stands with our allies across the globe to condemn this horrific attack and all other horrific attacks, for that matter.\nJordan-U.S. Relations\nYour Majesty, Jordanians are known for their legendary hospitality, and we will do our very best to be equally gracious hosts. They're also known, however—I have to say this—for their fighting ability. And you are a great warrior, and we appreciate it. Thank you.\nThe historical ties and close friendship between our two countries dates back three-quarters of a century. In that time, the Middle East has faced many periods of crisis and unrest, perhaps never like it is today, however. Through them all, America has looked to Jordan as a valued partner, an advocate for the values of civilization, and a source of stability and hope.\nI am deeply committed to preserving our strong relationship—which I will—and to strengthening America's longstanding support for Jordan. And you do have tremendous support within our country, I can tell you that.\nAs we know, the Middle East—and the entire world—is faced with one of its gravest threats in many, many years. Since the earliest days of the campaign against ISIS, Jordan has been a staunch ally and partner, and we thank you for that. Jordanian servicemembers have made tremendous sacrifices in this battle against the enemies of civilization, and I want to thank all of them for their, really, just incredible courage. So many have been lost, and we pay homage. So many.\nIn King Abdullah, America is blessed with a thoughtful and determined partner. He is a man who has spent years commanding his country's special forces. He really knows what being a soldier is, that I can tell you. And he knows how to fight. The King has been a leader in calling for a plan to defeat ISIS once and for all. And I'm with you on that. We're both leaders on that, believe me. That's what we speak about today, and that is what we are going to do. And it will be a shorter fight than a lot of people are thinking about, believe me. We've made tremendous strides, as we discussed. As you know, we had a very, very fine delegation come over from Egypt and also from Iraq, and they said more has been done in the last 6 weeks than has been done in years with the previous administration. And believe me, we're going to keep it that way.\nWe will destroy ISIS, and we will protect civilization. We have no choice. We will protect civilization. King Abdullah and I also discussed measures to combat the evil and ideology that inspires ISIS and plagues our planet. In addition, we also acknowledged the vital role that Jordan has played in hosting refugees from the conflict in Syria. We have just announced that the United States will contribute additional funds to Jordan for humanitarian assistance. This aid will help countries like Jordan host refugees until it is safe for them to return home. The refugees want to return home. I know that from so many other instances. They want to return back to their home. And that's a goal of any responsible refugee policy.\nFinally, as we discussed, to advance the cause of peace in the Middle East, including peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. And I'm working very, very hard on trying to finally create peace between the Palestinians and Israel, and I think we'll be successful. I hope to be successful, I can tell you that.\nThe King has been an entire—a really tireless advocate for a solution, and he's going to help me with that and help me at the highest level. And we will be consulting with him very closely in the days ahead.\nKing Abdullah, I want to take this opportunity to thank you for your partnership. Working together, the United States and Jordan can help bring peace and stability to the Middle East and, in fact, the entire world. And we will do that.\nThank you very, very much for being with us. Thank you. Thank you.\nKing Abdullah. Mr. President, thank you for such a kind and warm welcome to the White House. I fondly remember the meetings we've had many years ago and, more recently, several months ago. You've always been a generous host and have always looked after us. We are very delighted with the way the discussions have gone so far, and we're delighted to be here in such a wonderful setting on such a beautiful day, which I think is a tremendous mark of how we are going to move into the future.\nWe've had a very good round of talks today, and I'm looking forward to continuing these discussions later on in our meetings after the press conference. What I do want to say is how much we deeply appreciate the close relations we have with United States, with you, Mr. President, and with the American people. This is a strategic partnership that we call and keep very close to our hearts, and it is a partnership on so many levels that we will continue, I think, with the frank discussions that we had today to improve on as we face the challenges of the future. And I am very delighted for your vision, your holistic approach to all the challenges in our region, and to the dedication of your team in being able to translate your policies into actions, successfully, hopefully, as we move forward.\nThe challenges we face today are many and are not exclusive to my region, as I've just mentioned. They are global, and particularly the threats to global security. Terrorism has no borders, no nationality, no religion, and therefore, joint action with a holistic approach, as I had just mentioned, Mr. President, is crucial. I am very delighted that you have the vision to be able to move in that direction, and I think that the world will be in a very good place as we move with all these challenges ahead.\nNo doubt, with all the challenges that we face in the world, the role of the U.S. is key to all the issues that we have around the world, but it's not just the fact that we should expect United States to do all the heavy lifting. The heavy lifting has to be done by all of us in the international community to support the United States in being able to translate that vision into the right direction. So there's a lot of responsibility for all of us in the international community to support the President, the administration, and the American people to bring brighter days to all of us.\nWe are very encouraged with the President's determination to support Arab and Muslim states in their fight against terrorism. But it is not only the fight of terrorism inside of our societies, but we, as Arab-Muslim states, standing behind the international community in being able to defeat this international scourge.\nIn Syria, we need a political solution that ends the conflict in the country and preserve its unity and territorial integrity.\nAs the President mentioned, the issue we discussed was the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which is essentially the core conflict in our region. And the President's early engagement is beginning in bringing the Palestinians and Israelis together has been a very encouraging sign for all of us. And I think, sir, it was that initiative that allowed us at the Arab Summit last week to extend through the Arab Peace Initiative the message of peace to Israel, which we all, hopefully, will work together to make that come about.\nAll Arab countries relaunched the Arab Peace Initiative, as I said, last week. It offers a historic reconciliation between Israel and the Palestinians, as well as all member states of the Arab League. It is the most comprehensive framework for lasting peace, and it ensures statehood for the Palestinians, but also security, acceptance, and normal ties for Israel with all Arab countries and, hopefully, all Islamic countries.\nSo we appreciate your commitment in all these issues, where others have failed. You will find a strong ally in Jordan in supporting you in all your policies. And if I may just say, as you have, on Syria and the gas attack, unfortunately, as you and I both agree, this is another testament to the failure of the international diplomacy to find the solutions to this crisis. But I believe under your leadership we will be able to unravel this very complicated situation.\nThis has been going on—ongoing for 7 years now, has descended into proxy wars from different parties with dubious agendas. But at the end of the day, as you pointed out, Mr. President, it's the civilians—women and children—that are paying the heaviest price. This is happening on our watch, on our conscience, as well as the global community. And I know the passion and the emotion that the President has expressed and how this should not be tolerated whatsoever. And this stressful—sorry, this threshold of inhumanity and savagery that are being crossed every day is something that I know the President will not allow to happen, wherever it may be. And I fully support and endorse the President in this issue.\nSo I want to thank you, sir, because you have the outlook of looking not just at the Syrian challenges, but that of Iraq, Israel, Palestine, Libya, and everything that is in our region. So I think your message to all of us is a message of hope, and that's what I take away from this conference.\nPresident Trump. Thank you very much.\nKing Abdullah. And I thank you for all that you have done so far and all that you will do, sir. President Trump. All right. We'll take a few questions. Julie Pace [Associated Press].\nChemical Weapons Attack in Khan Sheikhoun, Syria/North Korea\nQ. Thank you, sir. I have questions on Syria for both leaders. But if I could start with you, Mr. President. You've condemned the chemical attacks in Syria, but you also appeared in your statement yesterday to pin some of the blame on the Obama administration. You are the President now. Do you feel like you bear responsibility for responding to the chemical attacks? And does the chemical attack cross a red line for you?\nPresident Trump. Well, I think the Obama administration had a great opportunity to solve this crisis a long time ago when he said the red line in the sand. And when he didn't cross that line after making the threat, I think that set us back a long ways, not only in Syria, but in many other parts of the world, because it was a blank threat. I think it was something that was not one of our better days as a country.\nSo I do feel that, Julie. I feel it very strongly.\nQ. So you feel like you now have the responsibility to respond to the chemical attack?\nPresident Trump. I now have responsibility, and I will have that responsibility and carry it very proudly, I will tell you that. It is now my responsibility. It was a great opportunity missed. As you know, I'll be meeting with the President of China very soon, in Florida. And that's another responsibility we have, and that's called the country of North Korea. We have a big problem. We have somebody that is not doing the right thing. And that's going to be my responsibility. But I'll tell you, that responsibility could have made—been made a lot easier if it was handled years ago.\nQ. Before I move on to the King, could I just quickly ask you if the chemical attack crosses a red line for you?\nPresident Trump. It crossed a lot of lines for me. When you kill innocent children, innocent babies—babies, little babies—with a chemical gas that is so lethal—people were shocked to hear what gas it was—that crosses many, many lines, beyond a red line. Many, many lines.\nThank you very much.\nQ. And, Your Majesty, if I could ask about refugees. Your country has really borne the brunt of the refugee crisis in Syria. The President has signed travel bans that would block Syrians from coming to the U.S. If that goes into effect, what would the impact on your country and across the region be?\nKing Abdullah. Well, I think as the President pointed out, most, if not all, Syrian refugees actually want to go back to Syria. And that what we're working with the United States and the international community is to be able to stabilize the refugees in our country, give them the tools so that, as we're working with the solutions in Syria, we have the ability to be able to send them back as a positive influence into their economies.\nAnd again, the President and the Europeans are being very forward-leaning in being able look after our host community—tremendous burden on our country, but again, tremendous appreciation to the United States and the Western countries for being able to help us in dealing with that.\nTarik, please. Q. Your Majesty, how does the outcome of the recent Arab Summit help the U.S. in its policy to advance Palestinian-Israeli negotiations?\nKing Abdullah. Well, as I said, the Arab Peace Initiative came out with a resounding resolution to offer peace to the Israelis, to make them feel that they're accepted into the neighborhood, and to be able to support the President as he brings both parties together.\nAnd again, I have to remind people that very early on there was an early engagement by the President and his team to the Israelis and the Palestinians to be able to see what he can do to bring them together. It is the core conflict for a lot of us in the region. The President knows this. He has his instincts in the right place. And working with his team, our job, as I said, is to do the heavy lifting. The Arabs are prepared to do whatever they can to bring Israelis and Palestinians together under the leadership of the President.\nPresident Trump. Thank you. John Yang [PBS NewsHour].\nSyria/The President's Views on the Use of Military Force\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President. I'd like to follow up on Julie's question and press you a little more on Syria. You—how will you distinguish your policy and your actions on Syria from the inaction that you criticized of the previous administration? You say it's now your responsibility. What should we see or what should we look for that will be different?\nAnd, Your Majesty, I'd like to ask you, what gives you—this is now your second meeting with the President—what gives you the optimism that Mr. Trump will succeed in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict where so many and others have failed before him to be a broker for peace?\nPresident Trump. I like to think of myself as a very flexible person. I don't have to have one specific way, and if the world changes, I go the same way, I don't change. Well, I do change, and I am flexible, and I'm proud of that flexibility. And I will tell you, that attack on children yesterday had a big impact on me—big impact. That was a horrible, horrible thing. And I've been watching it and seeing it, and it doesn't get any worse than that.\nAnd I have that flexibility, and it's very, very possible—and I will tell you, it's already happened—that my attitude toward Syria and Asad has changed very much. And if you look back over the last few weeks, there were other attacks using gas. You're now talking about a whole different level.\nSo, as you know, I would love to have never been in the Middle East. I would love to have never seen that whole big situation start. But once it started, we got out the wrong way, and ISIS formed in the vacuum, and lots of bad things happened. I will tell you, what happened yesterday is unacceptable to me.\nQ. Can I follow up, sir? You, yesterday—last year, you seemed to be reluctant to get involved or to intervene in Syria directly. Is that one thing that's changed after yesterday?\nPresident Trump. Well, one of the things I think you've noticed about me is, militarily, I don't like to say where I'm going and what I'm doing. And I watched past administrations say, we will attack at such and such a day at such and such an hour. And you, being a warrior—you would say, why are they saying that? And I'm sure you sat back in Jordan, and you said, why are they saying that?\nI watched Mosul, where the past administration was saying, we will be attacking in 4 months. And I said, why are they doing that? Then, a month goes by, and they say, we will be attacking in 3 months, and then 2 months, and then we will be attacking next week. And I'm\nsaying, why are they doing that? And as you know, Mosul turned out to be a much harder fight than anyone thought, and a lot of people have been lost in that fight.\nI'm not saying I'm doing anything one way or the other, but I'm certainly not going to be telling you, as much as I respect you, John. [Laughter] Thank you.\nKing Abdullah. Sir, I think, on behalf of the President, what I saw was an early engagement by the President and his team, with all of us in the region, about the challenges between the Israelis and Palestinians. I had the honor of seeing the President and his team again in January where this was discussed. The President understands the nuances and the challenges. I think he has the courage and the dedication to be able to do this. Like I said before, all of us have a responsibility to help the President push us over the finish line.\nAnd so, his team has been in the region, they've been talking to all the partners, and it is our job to facilitate the atmospherics between Israelis and Palestinians to move together, and give the support to the President to be able to smooth the edges over between Israelis and Palestinians to achieve this. And the President understands that if we don't solve this problem, how are we going to win the global fight against terrorism, which is his number-one priority? So this is a core issue that he understands, and I think he has the commitment, and he has my full support for this, as he does from many, many countries in our region.\nPresident Trump. And I have to just say that the world is a mess. I inherited a mess. Whether it's the Middle East, whether it's North Korea, whether it's so many other things, whether it's in our country—horrible trade deals—I inherited a mess. We're going to fix it. We're going to fix it.\nOkay.\nKing Abdullah. Thank you. Nadiya.\nIran/Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) Terrorist Organization/Syria\nQ. Thank you, Your Majesty. You touched upon the subject now, but if I ask you to look forward, how do you see the future of fighting terrorism post-Raqqa and Mosul, especially the role that Jordan will play in the eastern part of Iraq? And do you believe the real battle will start then?\nAnd if I may, Mr. President, you know very well that the Iranian militias and Hizballah has been propping the Syrian regime for a while, over a few years now. Will you go after them? What message will you give them today? And will you work with the Russians to stop—to ground the Syrian air force and to establish safe zones? Thank you.\nKing Abdullah. Well, the first part is that we are seeing, very recently, tremendous gains on the ground in Raqqa and Mosul. Again, I think, as the President alluded to, it's very difficult to put timelines on this issue because the battle space is always very fluid. But I think that the war is being won on the ground.\nHaving said that, terrorists are on the move. They'll be on the move inside of Iraq and inside of Syria, so that we have to make sure that we adapt our plans accordingly. And they move beyond borders, beyond our region and elsewhere. So as we and the administration have discussed, it's this holistic approach: How do we fight them wherever they are? And I think that is the understanding.\nTerrorists have no respect for borders and religions and people. So it's the seriousness of how we do this holistic approach that I've mentioned several times. And what I am really delighted is that the understanding by the President and the administration in how to deal with this globally.\nAnd I think you're seeing a move in the right direction because the policy now is being charted out, and my discussions with the Defense Secretary and the Foreign Secretary allows us to be then able to decide how we adapt ourselves in the region to be able to come in line with international diplomacy.\nPresident Trump. The Iran deal made by the previous administration is one of the worst deals I have ever witnessed, and I've witnessed some beauties. It's one of the worst deals I've ever witnessed. It should never have been made. It was totally one-sided against the United States and, frankly, against much of the Middle East.\nI will do whatever I have to do. They have a deal. It was, some people say, not done properly even in the form of its finalization. There was no vote from Congress. There was no real ratification. But I will do what I have to do with respect to the Iran deal.\nAs far as ISIS is concerned, the United States will work with whoever it's appropriate to work with to totally eradicate ISIS and other terrorists. And by the way, ISIS is one group, but others have formed. Frankly, they're all over the place. We will do what we have to do to eradicate terrorism.\nQ. But, sir, I'm talking about the Iranian militias in Syria supporting the Syrian regime separate of the nuclear deal.\nPresident Trump. Yes.\nQ. What message do you have for them today?\nPresident Trump. You will see. They will have a message. You will see what the message will be. Okay? Thank you.\nThank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2017-04-05", "title": "The President's News Conference With King Abdullah II of Jordan"}

EDT\nQ: Can you go over the schedule?\nMR. SPICER: Yeah, let me walk you guys through it. So, obviously, just to recap, I think we had a great visit yesterday with King Abdullah and the Queen. Obviously, one quick note for this morning -- I think we put it out yesterday -- but the President ordered flags flown at half-mast today in recognition of Senator John Glenn of Ohio.\nThis morning, as many of you saw, the President continued a bipartisan tradition that started out of President Bush welcoming the Wounded Warrior Project Soldier Ride to the White House, and I think it was a really cool event. Ironically, as much as the weather dampened our ability to have it outside, I think spirits were high inside. We had 50 folks up there. A great way to start the day.\nObviously, right now, we're in flight to Mar-a-Lago. Quickly, to Steve's point, let me walk you through the schedule. I don't know how much you saw on TV, but the President of China, President Xi, arrived a few minutes ago. He was greeted by Secretary Tillerson at the airport. He will be, obviously, heading for the airport to where he'll be staying.\nI've been asked a couple times, so I just want to get it out in front. No one from the Chinese delegation is staying at Mar-a-Lago. They were invited, but it was a room-size issue in terms of the size of their delegation, so they're staying just down the road. But the invitation was extended to them.\nThe delegation will arrive at Mar-a-Lago at 5:00 p.m. They will be greeted by the President and the First Lady. Following the welcome, the group will share some private time ahead of their dinner at 6:30 p.m. in the formal dining room. There will be a pool spray at the top of the dinner.\nTomorrow will be mostly spent in meetings. The First Lady and Madame Peng will also visit a local school. There will be a working lunch. And then the Chinese delegation --\n(Interruption due to turbulence.)\nThere will be a working lunch. The President's weekly address will be released tomorrow, focusing on the President's pledge to reverse decades of dangerous open-border policies that have left the country open, unsafe. As you may have noted this week, U.S. Customs and Border Protection released a report on the decline of individuals that have been apprehended at the southwest border. I mentioned this the other day, but we had some really good numbers -- declining 35 percent in March, from February of 2017, and down 61 percent from January 2017, and a 64 percent decrease from March 2017. All this will be mentioned in the brief tomorrow -- or in the weekly address.\nThe Vice President's office announced that the Vice President will travel to the Republic of Korea, Japan, Indonesia, Australia and Hawaii from April 15th to the 25th. This will serve as the Vice President's first official travel to the Asia Pacific region. The Vice President will emphasize the President's continued commitment to U.S. alliance and partnerships in the Asia Pacific region, highlighting the administration's economic trade agenda, and underscoring America's unwavering support for our troops here and abroad.\nNext week, I mentioned previously the President will host the Secretary General of NATO on Wednesday. We'll have a press event at that.\nWith that, I'll take a few questions before we buckle back.\nQ: Sean, following up on Syria yesterday, there's a lot of people who see a contradiction between the sympathy expressed for the victims of the gas attack and the policy of basically not allowing, for humanitarian reasons, these sort of people to come into the United States now.\nMR. SPICER: I'm sorry, what are you --\nQ: Syria.\nMR. SPICER: Right. I think one of the things that you've seen the President talk to several of the folks in the region about is the setting up of safe zones and supporting them -- something that he's talked to several of the leaders in the region about. And I think we got to make sure, number one, while obviously our hearts break for the people of Syria who were innocently attacked the other day, especially these young children who we watched, we've got to make sure that we're always doing what we can to protect our nation. But that doesn't mean that we can't support efforts like safe zones through Syria; that we'll make sure that we do what we can for their people.\nQ: But there's no contradiction about not allowing people like this to come to the U.S. --\nMR. SPICER: Every country's number-one priority is to its own people and the protection of them. We've got to do what we can to make sure that as we seek to root out ISIS and terrorism throughout the country -- throughout the world, rather, that we don't, at the same time, do things that would bring those same threats to our country.\nSo we can do what we can to provide humanitarian relief, to support the building and maintenance of safe zones throughout, and that's something that the President I think has found a lot of common ground with other heads of state, especially in the region.\nQ: Sean, what will the President's response be if President Xi urges more action on climate change and asking the U.S. to fulfill its commitments and go further on it?\nMR. SPICER: I think it's a great question. I think we'll have an opportunity to talk to you guys at some point tomorrow, and I think we can get through what was discussed on the agenda. But I'm not going to get ahead of the leaders discussing issues, whether it's that or economic stuff or North Korea. There's going to be a very robust discussion on a lot of these issues, and to start to hypothetically guess what we're going to say if someone brings up something ahead of the talks is not a place that I want to --\nQ: And on the second question. You mentioned the border security issue. Yesterday, Secretary Kelly said that it would not be a contiguous border, it would not be a physical border throughout, it would be a combination --\nMR. SPICER: I don't think he said it wasn't going to be a physical border. I think there's a question of whether there will be some fencing and some other stuff.\nQ: He said in response to a question from Senator McCain, would you consider all these other things, including electronic surveillance on the border, and he said, yes, I would, and that's a good definition.\nMR. SPICER: I will let Secretary Kelly be the expert on that.\nQ: But is that a backing-down of the President's commitment on a physical wall?\nQ: No, I think -- no, because, again, I think it's a physical barrier. I think he's informed the President of what's feasible throughout the extent of our southern border. And the President's number-one goal is to do what we can to deter illegal immigration and keep our country safe. That's the primary focus.\nJim.\nQ: Chairman Nunes decide to step aside, at least in the House Intel investigation on Russia. Does the White House believe that it could have handled things better in terms of the invitation for him a couple weeks ago? Now you have the second administration official, starting with Jeff Sessions recusing himself, Chairman Nunes recusing himself. Does the White House believe that it could have handled this better? And how did you find out about Chairman Nunes's decision?\nMR. SPICER: I found out about it by watching Fox News. It was on the television. So -- but I don't know --\nQ: Did he notify the White House, though?\nQ: I'm told he alerted the White House.\nMR. SPICER: I saw it live. But I don't know how -- in terms of us handling with respect to Chairman Nunes, as you know, Jeff, he was the one who requested to come see some things and then said he wanted an appointment with the President. We were informed of his desire to talk to the President through media reports; he held a press conference and announced it. So I'm not sure what -- our job is not to --\nQ: But he was invited to the White House the day before that.\nMR. SPICER: He was no invited to the White House the day --\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nMR. SPICER: I know, but with respect, you're making -- stating a fact that isn't true. He wasn't invited. And not that he wouldn't be; he's more than welcome to come, as is any member of Congress. But by his own statement, he requested to come to look at something. So we have continued to say that we want the House and the Senate to look into it, and we continue to support that effort in both chambers.\nQ: If I could follow, going forward, will this change how anyone in the administration from the National Security Council and anyone talks to or deals with matters involving the Russia investigation?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know that there's been any change in how we -- no. I mean, I'm not aware of anything that we've done that would change how we handle requests for information. But the answer to the question is, there's been no change in our policy.\nQ: Sean, have you been asked about Steve Bannon yet?\nMR. SPICER: Have I been asked about him?\nQ: Do you have full confidence in him? Does he still have a seat at the table? Do you want to talk about him a little bit?\nMR. SPICER: I mean, tell me what the question is and I'll answer it.\nQ: Well, does his removal from the NSC show that you're getting more of the professional people, less of the political people involved in national security?\nMR. SPICER: The President respects Chairman McMaster's willingness to form the National Security Council in the way he did. It's something that we said when we announced Chairman McMaster back at Mar-a-Lago, ironically. We had talked about the fact that he would have full authority to oversee the National Security Council in terms of personnel and structure, and he has.\nQ: Are you saying that it was his decision to ask Bannon to leave then?\nMR. SPICER: Well, obviously, he's the National Security Advisor, he runs all of these major decisions in restructuring by the President. But at the end of the day, he is the National Security Advisor.\nQ: Just on logistics for the next two days, should we expect to hear from the President and President Xi at all?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I know that there will be pool sprays. I think, as you know, I wouldn't rule anything out. We're not -- there's nothing beyond that on the thing, and I think we may have some folks come by the filing center and such.\nQ: One last thing. Does the President plan to raise human rights with the Chinese President?\nMR. SPICER: Julie, I'd go back to what Noah said. I don't -- we will have a readout of what they discussed after they discuss it. But I don't want to get ahead of what they're going to discuss or not discuss until they've had a chance to meet.\nQ: But does he feel like it's important, as the American President, to raise human rights?\nMR. SPICER: (Inaudible) human rights, trade. There's a lot of areas of both economic and national security, human rights being one of them. There's things that we will discuss in private. And we will have a readout of those discussions.\nQ: What about climate change? Is that an issue? Oh, asked already? Sorry.\nMR. SPICER: Again, I mentioned this to -- Noah brought that up. Once we have an update on what they discussed we'll make sure that we read it out, but I'm not going to -- part of this opportunity is for them to develop a relationship and start the discussion on some key issues.\nBut there's a lot of folks that are traveling down and having discussions as well. Secretary Ross is on the plane, Secretary Mnuchin. Secretary Tillerson, as I've mentioned, is already down there. Secretary Mattis is coming down. So there's going to be a lot of opportunity for our folks to interact. And again, I probably left some -- Gary Cohn is on the plane, General McMaster. There's going to be a lot of interaction that occurs during this bilateral with our senior officials and their counterparts.\nQ: Is Steve Bannon on the plane?\nMR. SPICER: He is.\nQ: Can you give us a sense of -- we wanted to square in Judge Gorsuch.\nMR. SPICER: We'll have an update. I would imagine there's some -- I don't want to get ahead of this but I know we are looking at dates for next week.\nQ: But you wouldn't fly back to Washington, or you wouldn't have the judge down here for a swearing-in?\nMR. SPICER: No. The earliest that it would be would be Monday. There are some -- we're looking at some times. There's some other logistical things that we're just trying to figure out, whether it would be Monday. It could potentially be Tuesday. I know Wednesday we've got the NATO Secretary General. But once we lock in that, we'll have something out. But it would not be over the weekend, no.\nQ: The President said that he was flexible in his thinking maybe evolving on Syria. Can you give us a lens into where that is and kind of what he's doing behind the scenes?\nMR. SPICER: The President has held several discussions with his national security team regarding the situation in Syria. Obviously he is being presented with a lot of options. But I would go back and echo the comments the President made yesterday in the Rose Garden where he is not one to telegraph those decisions or options until he's ready to make them, and that's where I think he continues to bring that sense of being a shrewd negotiator to the table and not revealing his hand until it's time.\nQ: And what's the timeline on the healthcare bill, renewing that or deciding whether to abandon a second attempt?\nMR. SPICER: Well, first of all, I would just -- with respect to -- it's not a second attempt. It's been an ongoing discussion. You saw Chief of Staff Priebus and the Vice President were up on the Hill last night. We've had a continuation of discussions over the last several days, and I think they've been very productive.\nYou saw I think Freedom Caucus Chair Meadows made some comments earlier today that they've seen some very constructive proposals and ideas put forward. I think the amendment that Speaker Ryan was talking about putting forward to the rules committee is something that shows tremendous progress by the team.\nAnd look, honestly, as soon as we get to 216, we'll let you know.\nQ: Sean, did the White House ask for the House to go forward with the vote that they're planning this week? Was that driven by the White House?\nMR. SPICER: (Inaudible) that, as I mentioned, Chief of Staff Priebus and the Vice President and some others were up on the Hill last night working with Speaker Ryan and Leader McCarthy, Greg Walden, Kevin Brady, and others. I think the idea is that we feel very good about where the discussions are going and some of the language that is being updated, moving this in a very positive direction towards getting that 216.\nQ: Does the President maintain full confidence in Speaker Ryan and his abilities to get this done?\nMR. SPICER: Yes. Thank you, guys.\nEND 2:47 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2017-04-06", "title": "Press Gaggle by Press Secretary Sean Spicer"}

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123863", "text": "Tideline Ocean Resort & Spa\nPalm Beach, Florida\n10:18 P.M. EDT\nMR. SPICER: Tonight, Secretary Tillerson and NSA Director, Lieutenant General McMaster, will both give comments regarding the President's order tonight, and then afterwards we'll take a few questions and then let you get to some sleep.\nWith that, Secretary Tillerson.\nSECRETARY TILLERSON: Good evening, all. I think what we want to try to do is give you a little bit of background on how we got to the statements by the President and the actions that were taken tonight.\nAs you're well aware, Bashar al-Assad has carried out chemical attacks this past week on civilians, including women and children, and carried out attacks earlier -- last month, March 25th and 30th in Homs Province, as well. We have a very high level of confidence that the attacks were carried out by aircraft under the direction of Bashar al-Assad's regime. And we also have very high confidence that the attacks involved the use of sarin nerve gas. At least the past three attacks were fairly high -- we have high confidence on that.\nI think it's also clear that previous agreements that had been entered into pursuant to U.N. Security Council Resolution 2118, as well as Annex A agreements that the Syrian government themselves accepted back in 2013, whereby they would surrender their chemical weapons under the supervision of the Russian government. Now, the U.S. and the Russian government entered into agreements whereby Russia would locate these weapons, they would secure the weapons, they would destroy the weapons, and that they would act as the guarantor that these weapons would no longer be present in Syria.\nClearly, Russia has failed in its responsibility to deliver on that commitment from 2013. So either Russia has been complicit, or Russia has been simply incompetent in its ability to deliver on its end of that agreement.\nI think the other thing that's important to recognize -- that as Assad has continued to use chemical weapons in these attacks with no response -- no response from the international community -- that he, in effect, is normalizing the use of chemical weapons, which then may be adopted by others. So it's important that some action be taken on behalf of the international community to make clear that these chemical weapons continue to be a violation of international norms.\nI think it's also important to recognize, as I think everyone does, the chaotic circumstances that exist on the ground in Syria, with the presence of a battle underway to defeat ISIS, the presence of al Qaeda elements inside of Syria, and a civil war that is underway. So, clearly, one of the existential threats we see on the ground in Syria is if there are weapons of this nature available in Syria, the ability to secure those weapons and not have them fall into the hands of those who would bring those weapons to our shores to harm American citizens.\nSo there are a number of elements that, in our view, called for this action and which we feel was appropriate. We feel the strike itself was proportional because it was targeted at the facility that delivered this most recent chemical weapons attack. And in carrying this out, we coordinated very carefully with our international partners in terms of communicating with them around the world. And I will tell you that the response from our allies in Europe, as well as the region in the Middle East, has been overwhelmingly supportive of the action we've taken.\nSo I'll leave it there. And let me turn it to NSA Director McMaster.\nGENERAL McMASTER: I really have very little to add except to say that it was important during the President's deliberations and its deliberations with his leadership that we weighed, of course, the risk associated with any military action, and we weighed that against the risk of inaction, which Secretary Tillerson has already really summarized, which is the risk of this continued egregious, inhumane attacks on innocent civilians with chemical weapons.\nAnd so, really, nothing else to add to the Secretary's summary. And we're happy to take any questions that you have.\nQ: Could you go through just the timeline of how the President's thinking changed? And when did you present him with options and so forth?\nGENERAL McMASTER: Okay. So the President was immediately notified upon news of the chemical attack, and he was very interested in understanding better the circumstances of the attack and who was responsible. Our intelligence community, in cooperation with our friends and partners and allies around the world, collaborated to determine with a very high degree of confidence precisely where the location originated, and then, of course, the sort of chemicals that were used in the attack.\nThat confidence level has just continued to grow in the hours and days since the attack, associated with additional evidence that's available, especially -- so sad -- sadly, from the victims that are being treated and the confirmation of the type of agent that was used, which was a nerve agent.\nSo that was -- the initial interactions with the President were about the attack and responding to his questions about the nature of the attack, the scope of the attack, and who was responsible in particular.\nAnd then we convened a meeting of the National Security Council principals -- a small group; it wasn't the full -- it was almost the full National Security Council -- to deliberate on options. There were three options; you can imagine which those were. There were three options that we discussed with the President, and the President asked us to focus on two options in particular, to mature those options. And then he had a series of questions for us that we endeavored to answer.\nWe were able to answer those questions and come back to him in a decision -- briefing today, again, with virtually all of the principals on the National Security Council here in Florida and then by video-telephone conference back in Washington. And after a meeting of considerable length and a far-reaching discussion, the President decided to act. And that's the general sequence of events. So rather two large and formal meetings, but really a whole series of discussions since the time of the attack.\nSecretary, do you have anything to add to that?\nSECRETARY TILLERSON: No, I think just as I said, as I think H.R. has said, this was a very deliberative process. There was a thorough examination of a wide range of options. And I think the President made the correct choice and made the correct decision, first to be decisive in acting -- acting against this heinous act on the part of Bashar al-Assad -- but acting in a way that was clearly directed at the source of this particular attack, to send that strong message.\nOther things were considered. Those were rejected for any number of reasons. And in my view, the President made the exact, correct decision.\nQ: Mr. Secretary --\nQ: Mr. Secretary, can you talk a little bit about your discussions in the last hour? Secretary, did you speak to the President --\nSECRETARY TILLERSON: I'll let Sean referee here.\nMR. SPICER: (Laughter.) I'm good at it. Hallie.\nQ: Did you or did the President speak with President Putin prior to the attack? Can you talk about the discussions that you had with Moscow and what the expectation is from them?\nAnd then, General McMaster, I have a question for you as well, please.\nSECRETARY TILLERSON: There were no discussions or prior contacts, nor have there been any since the attack, with Moscow.\nQ: And can you tell us about your expectations for what you think you will hear from President Putin or Foreign Minister Lavrov?\nSECRETARY TILLERSON: I'll let them speak for themselves.\nQ: General, McMaster, I'd like to ask you -- the President -- you talked a little bit in response to Steve's question about the President's evolution of his thinking. Just a couple of years ago his encouragement was to stay out of Syria. You talked about the images that sort of moved him into this direction -- as he put it tonight, \"beautiful babies cruelly murdered.\" Has his thinking then changed on allowing Syrian refugees into the United States, to your knowledge?\nGENERAL McMASTER: No, that wasn't discussed as any part of the deliberations.\nQ: And on the target, anything else on specifically what you believe was destroyed in the strike?\nGENERAL McMASTER: I'll defer to the Pentagon on that. But there were a number of targets that were associated with the ability of that airfield to operate and to continue mass-murder attacks against the Syrian civilians. And the one thing that I will tell you, though, there was an effort to minimize risk to third-country nationals at that airport -- I think you read Russians from that -- and we took great pains to try to avoid that. Of course, in any kind of military operation, there are no guarantees. And then there were also measures put in place to avoid hitting what we believe is a storage of sarin gas there so that that would not be ignited and cause a hazard to civilians or anyone else.\nMR. SPICER: Margaret.\nQ: Can I ask H.R. -- sorry -- both the Secretary and H.R. McMaster -- what is the overriding message here? Is it that -- this is not clearly a declaration of war, but is it that for President Trump and this administration the credible threat of military force is back on the table? Was this articulated or explained in any way to President Xi prior to the President's remarks? And do you see this as in any way sending a message more broadly on your policy towards North Korea that the President is willing to take decisive action? If both of you would weigh in.\nSECRETARY TILLERSON: Well, I think as you just stated, this clearly indicates the President is willing to take decisive action when called for. And I think in this particular case, the use of prohibited chemical weapons, which violates a number of international norms and violates existing agreements, called for this type of a response, which is a kinetic military response.\nI would not in any way attempt to extrapolate that to a change in our policy or our posture relative to our military activities in Syria today. There's been no change in that status. But I think it does demonstrate that President Trump is willing to act when governments and actors cross the line, and cross the line on violating commitments they have made and cross the line in the most heinous of ways. I think it is clear that President Trump has made that statement to the world tonight.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, can I --\nMR. SPICER: Hold on, hold on --\nGENERAL McMASTER: I really have no further comment on that question. I think the Secretary covered it comprehensively.\nSean.\nQ: Did you tell China in advance?\nMR. SPICER: Hold on one second.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, if I could ask you to clarify Russia again -- you said no contacts were made with Russia before the strikes today.\nSECRETARY TILLERSON: No contacts were made with Moscow, with President Putin. There are military de-confliction agreements in place with the Russian military, and our military did operate under and in accordance with those de-confliction agreements in coordinating this particular attack.\nQ: On the ground in Syria?\nSECRETARY TILLERSON: In Syria.\nQ: Can you explain, Mr. Secretary, that process? How was Russia notified?\nSECRETARY TILLERSON: Let me let H.R. --\nGENERAL McMASTER: There are normal channels open for de-confliction. And I'll just defer that to the Pentagon just for accuracy. But the Pentagon, I know, is going to be talking to the press here soon, and I think it would be better if they give you a more precise answer if you're looking for details.\nQ: And, Mr. Secretary, if I could, obviously the diplomatic considerations here are of a magnitude that didn't exist a number of years ago. When you went into this, unlike President Obama, who was dealing simply with Bashar al-Assad, you're dealing with Russia, you're dealing with the Kurds, you're dealing with Turkey. Can you give us a little bit of the diplomatic calculation in undertaking this attack?\nSECRETARY TILLERSON: Well, my expectation is that all of those parties, with the exception of Bashar al-Assad and perhaps Russia, I think are going to applaud this particular action or effort.\nOverall, the situation in Syria is one where our approach today and our policy today is, first, to defeat ISIS. By defeating ISIS we remove one of the disruptive elements in Syria that exists today. That begins to clarify for us opposition forces and regime forces. In working with the coalition -- as you know, there is a large coalition of international players and allies who are involved in the future resolution in Syria.\nSo it's to defeat ISIS; it's to begin to stabilize areas of Syria, stabilize areas in the south of Syria, stabilize areas around Raqqa through ceasefire agreements between the Syrian regime forces and opposition forces. Stabilize those areas; begin to restore some normalcy to them. Restore them to local governance -- and there are local leaders who are ready to return, some who have left as refugees -- they're ready to return to govern these areas. Use local forces that will be part of the liberation effort to develop the local security forces -- law enforcement, police force. And then use other forces to create outer perimeters of security so that areas like Raqqa, areas in the south can begin to provide a secure environment so refugees can begin to go home and begin the rebuilding process.\nIn the midst of that, through the Geneva Process, we will start a political process to resolve Syria's future in terms of its governance structure, and that ultimately, in our view, will lead to a resolution of Bashar al-Assad's departure.\nMR. SPICER: Jonathan.\nQ: Mr. Secretary and General McMaster, does this strike significantly change Assad's military capability to carry out an attack like this? Or was it really about sending a message that this kind of attack is not acceptable?\nSECRETARY TILLERSON: Well, I'll answer the last part of that. This was clearly a very decisive action taken on the part of President Trump, who I think you heard yesterday said this particular heinous attack changed his view of how horrible these types of use of these weapons are. That clearly changed President Trump's view that something has to be done in response.\nI'll let H.R. McMaster respond to the second question of the military -- whether it's changed our military posture.\nGENERAL McMASTER: Obviously, the regime will maintain the certain capacity to commit mass murder with chemical weapons we think beyond this particular airfield. But it was aimed at this particular airfield for a reason, because we could trace this murderous attack back to that facility. And this was not a small strike. It was not a small strike. And I think what it does communicate is a big shift, right, a big shift in Assad's calculus -- it should be, anyway -- because this is the first time that the United States has taken direct military action against that regime or the regime of his father.\nSo I think what is critical is the President's decision in response to this mass murder attack, but also in the context of all the previous attacks that have occurred -- I think over 50 -- I think it's over 50 chemical attacks previously, post-2013, when the U.N. resolution went into effect. And so I think that it's both. It was aimed at the capacity to commit mass murder with chemical weapons, but it was not of a scope or a scale that it would go after all such related facilities.\nQ: Were military personnel with any other nations, any of our allies, take part in this? Or was this 100 percent a U.S. operation?\nSECRETARY TILLERSON: This was entirely a U.S. operation.\nMR. SPICER: Jen.\nQ: Can you talk a little bit about whether there might have been just an emotional reaction to this from President Trump? Assad cannot gas Americans, so do you think some emotional response to the sight and images of what happened in Syria played into this? And secondly, can you talk about the reaction from President Xi?\nSECRETARY TILLERSON: No, I don't think it was -- I do not view it as an emotional reaction at all. I think as President Trump evaluated this first attack, these attacks that occurred on his watch, and reflected upon the prior responses, or lack of responses, he came to the conclusion that we could not, yet again, turn away and turn an eye -- turn a blind eye to what's happened.\nThe use of these weapons, as I indicated earlier, one of the concerns we have is the more we fail to respond to use of these weapons, the more we begin to normalize their use. And when we begin to normalize their use, we are opening up wider-spread use by others who would use such weapons.\nAnd I don't think we should in any way diminish the risk of the situation in Syria where there is a lot of chaos on the ground. There are elements on the ground in Syria, elements that are plotting to reach our shore, and these type of weapons falling into their hands and being brought to our shore is a direct threat on the American people.\nQ: Sorry, I wanted to ask you to clarify something, Secretary Tillerson, first, and then I also have a military question. You were saying that there was no coordination with Moscow for this, but then you said that you followed the rules of de-confliction. So that kind of suggests that you did talk to Russia in some capacity. Can you just clarify that?\nSECRETARY TILLERSON: Well, I think Director McMaster answered it. And again, I would direct you to the Pentagon to give you the precise procedures that are followed. But these are battlefield agreements, because we're operating in Syria, the Russians are operating in Syria. As we have begun the march to defeat ISIS, many of our forces are becoming more approximate to one another, and so we have a de-confliction agreement in place with the Russian military.\nAnd so there are command contacts that exist 24/7 for any type of operation that could bring us into conflict. That's the level of contact that we're talking about.\nQ: So is it more accurate to say that you didn't seek approval from Moscow or anything like that for them to kind of give you the green light, but you followed protocol in terms of the military --\nSECRETARY TILLERSON: We sought no approval from Moscow or at any other level within the Russian infrastructure. This was strictly following the rules that we have put in place, an agreement with the Russian military to de-conflict. Because our target in this attack was not Russia, it was not the Russians, it was not their forces, nor any Russian individuals. Our target was this airfield and the Syrian regime.\nGENERAL McMASTER: I would just add one thing. The purpose was not to receive permission, the purpose was to reduce the chances of Russian casualties and to follow the procedures, as you mentioned. But we wanted to take every possible measure we could to reduce the chance of Russian casualties.\nMR. SPICER: Thank you guys very much. Appreciate it. We're going to have a great night.\nEND 10:39 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2017-04-06", "title": "Press Briefing by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and National Security Advisor General H.R. McMaster"}

But on behalf of the President and the First Family, a special thank you to Lieutenant General Michael Linnington and Deven Schei. The Wounded Warrior Project is a source of great comfort to our veterans across the country, and it is an inspiration to the nation. (Applause.)\nSince 2003, the Wounded Warrior Project has faithfully served men and women who have been injured in the defense of freedom and paid a small debt of gratitude that this nation will never be able to fully repay.\nThe White House has hosted the Wounded Warrior Project's Soldier Ride every year since 2008, and the President and the First Family, and Karen and I, are so proud to be a part of continuing this important tradition. In fact, we're bikers, and Karen and I hope someday to join the Wounded Warrior bikers ride on a sunny day in the future. (Laughter.)\nFrom the bottom of my heart, let me just say thank you for your service. And also, let me say as the proud parents of a United States Marine, it is the greatest privilege of my life to serve as Vice President to a President who cares so deeply about the men and women of our armed forces and the veterans of this country.

I want to thank you, Vice President Pence, for your wonderful introduction, but maybe more importantly for your incredible service to our country. You have done an incredible job. Thank you very much. Melania and I are deeply honored to join you all today, and to stand here among real heroes. These are real heroes.\nSecretary Shulkin and Secretary Zinke, right in front of us, working so hard. I want to thank you for joining us as we pay tribute to America's warriors—and I call them America's winners, because they are winners—and mark this year's Soldiers Ride.\nThe Soldier Ride has been very, very unique. Lieutenant General Linnington, Deven Schei, and all of the dedicated people at the Wounded Warrior Project, thank you for organizing this event. Really great job. An amazing event. And thank you for serving those who have so bravely served our Nation.\nOn behalf of the country, let me extend to all of the riders and your families the warmest possible welcome into, I call it, the people's house. This is the people's house. It's the White House, but it's the people's house. And I thank you all very much, especially all of the folks that are on stage with me. You are something very, very amazing and special. Thank you. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you.\nYou've risked all that you have, all that you possess, to keep our people safe and our democracy secure. And we're going to keep it going, folks, for a long time. That I can tell you. In your honor, we're going to keep it going.\nYou've earned our freedom with your sweat and your blood and your incredible sacrifice. We salute you, we salute your service, and we salute the flag you have so courageously protected. We love our flag. Thank you.\nThe story of today's event is a story about America and the strength of her citizens. In 2004, a young man working in a tavern in the East End of Long Island—I know that end of Long Island very well—was moved by a desire to help his fellow Americans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. So Chris Carney had an idea. With the support of friends, Chris rode a bike across the country to raise funds and awareness for the Wounded Warrior Project. Great people. He biked 4,000 miles—wow—so where's Chris? Where is Chris? Chris, stand up. Four thousand—man. [Applause] Wow. And raised, at the time, 1 million dollars.\nThis act of devotion to our heroes inspired others. And since that first year, the Soldier Ride—it's why we're here today—has become an annual event that unites and uplifts our Nation. President Bush hosted the first Soldiers Ride at the White House in 2008. And I am proud to continue this incredible tradition, and we're going to keep it going for a long time. I should have it for about 7 more years. [Laughter]\nMost of all, I'm proud to stand here today, before all of you, and to share with the Nation the depth of our gratitude and the height of our total admiration for these folks, for our veterans, for anybody in uniform. And that includes our great men and women in blue. And I want to thank all of them, because they are just incredible people. Each of you has forged in battle the sacred bonds of loyalty that link our people together. Our country, our values, our very way of life, endures because of you, and it endures because brave Americans raise up in every generation—and they really do; they rise to the occasion like nobody can rise to an occasion—to fight for this country and to defend its citizens with every ounce of blood, sweat, and tears in their bodies.\nOur way of life continues because of men and women who are willing to sacrifice anything and everything to protect their fellow warriors, and to protect all of us. You've not only poured out the blood—and all of your blood, in some cases—for this country, but you have poured out the love from your souls and from your hearts. Each of you has carved your place into the history of this incredible Nation and, I can tell you, into our hearts.\nIt is that love which brings us here today, which binds us together as one people, and which offers us the hope and promise of a future that is safe and secure and free. With one grateful heart and one mighty spirit, the people of our Nation thank you—they really thank you—and embrace you as you carry on this magnificent Soldier Ride. Good job. Good job.\nMay God bless you, may God bless our incredible country, may God bless our warriors. And let's have a great ride. Because I'll tell you what, I couldn't do it. [Laughter] Thank you.

North Korea and trade.\nQ. And on North Korea, you had said in the—interview that you're willing to act alone if China doesn't step up. What are you going to try to get from the Chinese?\nThe President. Certainly, I would be. But I think China will want to be stepping up.\nQ. What do you want them to do specifically?\nThe President. You're going to see. We'll be talking about it.\nPresident Xi Jinping of China\nQ. Have you told Members of Congress——\nThe President. The President just arrived. He just landed in Palm Beach, so I just saw that.\nSyria\nQ. Mr. President, have you told Members of Congress that you're considering using military action in Syria?\nThe President. I don't want to mention that, but the answer is no, I haven't.\nThe President's Accomplishments\nQ. So what should we make now, going—I think we're ending the 13th week or so—how your staff is doing? Are you shaking things up and rebooting a little bit?\nThe President. I've shaken them up, and I think we've had one of the most successful 13 weeks in the history of Presidents. If you look at all that we've done and all of the jobs we've created, if you look at the kind of cost-cutting we've been able to achieve with the military and at the same time ordering vast amounts of equipment—saved hundreds of millions of dollars on airplanes, and really billions, because if you take that out over a period of years, it's many billions of dollars—I think we've had a tremendous success. And we've just begun. And we're going to have a very interesting couple of days.\nQ. In terms of your staff, though, are you realigning your staff?\nThe President. I heard somebody tapping on my hand. It was Steve [Steve Holland, Reuters].\nSyria\nQ. Are you committed to doing something in Syria?\nThe President. I don't want to say what I'm going to be doing with respect to Syria. China/Trade/North Korea\nQ. What would you like the Chinese President to do regarding North Korea?\nThe President. We have been treated unfairly and have made terrible deals—trade deals—with China for many, many years. So that's one of the things we're going to be talking about. The other thing, of course, is going to be North Korea, and somehow, they will mix. They really do mix. So we're going to be talking about both trade, North Korea, and many other things.\nSupreme Court Nominee Neil M. Gorsuch/Supreme Court Nomination Process\nQ. Will going to the nuclear option change how you consider which nominees to put before the Senate?\nThe President. No, no, no. We have a great person right now in Judge Gorsuch, I mean a great person. And hopefully, if there is a second one for me during my administration—and there could be as many as four—in fact, under a certain scenario there could even be more than that—but no, I don't think the nuclear option has any impact with that at all.\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin G. Nunes/Rep. K. Michael Conaway\nQ. What do you make of Devin Nunes recusing himself this morning? And were you briefed on that? Was that a good decision?\nThe President. Well, I think he's a very good person. I just heard that he did. I think he's a very good person; he's a very honorable guy. And I think he did that maybe for his own reason. He's a high-quality person. And the gentleman replacing him, who I don't know, I hear is a very, very highly respected man, high quality.\nQ. [Inaudible]—for him sharing classified information? Did he share classified information?\nThe President. With who? What?\nQ. For the ethics investigation now undergoing for him sharing classified information. Do you think he's guilty of sharing classified information?\nThe President. No. Nobody shared it with me, that I can tell you——\nQ. Mr. President——\nThe President. ——because I haven't looked.\nPresident Bashar al-Asad of Syria/Chemical Weapons Attack in Khan Sheikhoun, Syria/President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia\nQ. Mr. President, two questions. Do you think Asad should leave power? And will you discuss the Syrians——\nThe President. What Asad did is terrible. I think what happened in Syria is one of the truly egregious crimes, and it shouldn't have happened and it shouldn't be allowed to happen.\nQ. Have you talked to Putin about this? Will you talk to the Russian President about what happened?\nThe President. At some point, I may. I haven't, but at some point, I may.\nQ. Just to follow on that, though, do you think that Asad should leave power in Syria? The President. I think what happened in Syria is a disgrace to humanity.

On Education and Sharing Day, we acknowledge the critical role of families, schools, and religious and other civic institutions in nurturing in our children the values that enable them to realize the full scope of their ambitions.\nEducation and Sharing Day recognizes the remarkable efforts of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, to use values-based education to drive our Nation's children toward the American Dream. As an educator, Rabbi Schneerson understood that education is incomplete if it is devoid of moral development. Working through a spirit of optimism, he strived to teach children to be honest, civil, respectful of differences, and self-disciplined, in addition to being intellectually rigorous.\nOn April 18, 1978, our Nation's first Education Day, U.S.A., Rabbi Schneerson wrote that \"we can neither be satisfied nor slacken our efforts\" so long as \"there is still one child that does not receive an adequate education.\" These words inspire us today, as they did then, to empower our children and share with each of them the opportunity and promise of America. It is up to us to support our children in realizing their hopes and to encourage them to reach their fullest potential.\nNow, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 7, 2017, as \"Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A.\" I call upon government officials, educators, volunteers, and all the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nDONALD J.

There can be no dispute that Syria used banned chemical weapons, violated its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention, and ignored the urging of the U.N.

SPICER: It's off. Off. Everything is off.\nQ: Turn it off.\nMR. SPICER: I've got a Michael Anton here from the National Security Committee. I think with respect to President X's visit, we intend to have a readout later. Hopefully we can -- we'll gather with the pool at the very least. We'll see what the rest of the day looks like -- trying to get back over here as well. But we'll continue to update that.\nI just wanted to provide a little bit of a tick-tock on the President's action. I know there's been a lot of interest in this. And then we can take a few questions. But with respect to the actions the President took in Syria and the questions regarding the timeline, let me just kind of walk you through it.\nOn Tuesday, at about 10:30 a.m. in the morning, the President was informed during the course of his Daily Presidential Briefing about the actions in Syria. He, at that time, asked the team for additional information and updates. The interagency team spent the day developing an initial range of options for the President. At about 8:00 p.m. on Tuesday night, there was a restricted deputy committee meeting on the situation. Preliminary options were presented and refined.\nQ: Sean, can you talk louder, please?\nMR. SPICER: I'm sorry. On Tuesday night, there was additional -- there was a deputies meeting at the White House where options were presented and refined and interagency guidance was developed.\nWednesday morning, a restricted principals meeting was conducted with interagency options and gave further guidance to refine. Around 3:00 p.m. on Wednesday, a National Security meeting was convened where the President was briefed on options. He reviewed the options in detail, asked a series of questions to his team, requested further information, and the decision to reconvene on Thursday was made.\nAt about 1:30 p.m. on Thursday, en route to Florida, the President convened the national security team that was aboard Air Force One, and others via secure videoconference on Air Force One. Later that day, at approximately 4:00 p.m., the President, the Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, National Security Advisor and other members of the national security team met in a secure room down here where they were piped in with the rest of the team via secure video-teleconference. The President gave the okay to move ahead.\nAt approximately 7:40:59 p.m., Tomahawk missiles were launched from Navy destroyers in the Eastern Mediterranean --\nQ: What time was that?\nMR. SPICER: 7:40 p.m. -- 1940 Eastern, from Navy destroyers in the Eastern Mediterranean. All 59 hit their target. At 8:30 p.m., notification of foreign leaders and congressional leadership began. The Vice President called several congressional leaders and began calling some foreign leaders. The Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, National Security Advisor and others were also involved in making some of those phone calls to both heads of government, defense ministers, and congressional leaders.\nAround 8:30-8:40 p.m., the first impacts began on the ground. The President informed President Xi that strikes were occurring as their dinner concluded. All along, the national security team continued to monitor the event and the situations.\nAfter dinner, the President went back down to the secure room where he was briefed by the Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and others were present via secure video-teleconference. In the Situation Room, the Secretary of Defense was on a secure line, video-teleconference, as well as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs -- several other members were convened in the Situation Room in Washington, D.C.\nThe President was updated on the effectiveness, was informed that battle damage assessment would take a few hours, but that initial results were extremely positive. He asked about reaction from the world community as well as congressional leaders and was informed that there was fairly unanimous praise for the decision and the actions the President took.\nThat's pretty much the tick-tock. Pentagon and National Security team continue to provide the President with updates this morning, and as soon as his visit with President Xi -- I expect a further update to the President.\nHallie.\nQ: Sean, (inaudible) in Syria -- is this a one-off? Is it a change from the administration's policy moving forward? What happens --\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to get -- you've heard the President talk -- he spoke -- he said something in the Rose Garden the other day with King Abdullah there that he's not going to telegraph his next move. But I think that this action was very decisive, justified and proportional to the actions that he felt needed taken. I think it sends a very strong signal not just to Syria but throughout the world.\nQ: How does this fit with America First foreign policy? Is that still his stated position?\nMR. SPICER: Absolutely. I think that his actions were very clear under Article 2 in our nation's national security --there's very important national security interests in the region, stability, and obviously there's a huge humanitarian component to this.\nJulie.\nQ: General McMaster was briefing last night that the President -- the three options. Can you give us --\nMR. SPICER: No.\nQ: -- what the three options were?\nMR. SPICER: I can't.\nQ: Can you talk about the process that the President went through when he got the three options, who he consulted with, and then what his recommendation to go forward --\nMR. SPICER: Again, I'm not going to get into specifics. There's obviously both in terms of what could have been done, but obviously that would telegraph potential future action that I don't want to get into. And a lot of that remains classified. I will say, however, that as I mentioned, both Secretary of Defense Mattis, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Director McMaster and the rest of the National Security team -- the Vice President and others -- were consulted. And that occurred over -- starting on Tuesday at 10:30 a.m. when the President was made aware of this. He continued to ask questions and ask for options. So this was a very evolving process in which the President was given updates, asked additional questions, given additional options, refined those options, until an ultimate decision was made yesterday.\nMargaret.\nQ: Can you just clarify -- I think you said that the President informed Xi after the strikes had concluded. Is that accurate?\nMR. SPICER: The exact timeline -- the President, as you know, yesterday was having dinner. I think after the dinner concluded, I believe that the impact had been made. I'd have to check the exact timeline. But the impact occurred at around 8:30 p.m. last night, Eastern Time. The President informed President Xi as dinner concluded and he was on his way back to his temporary quarters. So where the exact timeline is, I don't know, but my understanding is, is that everything had made impact by the time he was informed -- he informed President Xi.\nQ: -- because clearly, the President has said that North Korea is of deep concern.\nMR. SPICER: That's right.\nQ: This is a military action that was taken unilaterally. How did he explain this to Xi Jinping? Was it put that in that context? Was there any broader message that, look, if you don't help us crack down on North Korea, we are willing to go ahead with similar action?\nMR. SPICER: I'm going to let -- there will be a readout later today about all the areas and issues that were discussed. And I think we'll try to get some further -- some individuals to actually talk about specifics on the topics that were talked -- I believe that what the President stated last night was just simply that action had been taken, what he was doing, what had happened, and that he was going to be briefed. I don't think there was any immediate nexus. But I was not present for that conversation.\nQ: Sean, just to clarify and follow up. H.R. McMaster said last night, I believe, that there were two NSC meetings. I believe you described more meetings than that. How many meetings was the President personally involved in throughout this process?\nMR. SPICER: Four that we're -- four.\nQ: Four, okay.\nMR. SPICER: Well, again, you remember it started with the PDB. I mean, it depends --\nQ: So five.\nMR. SPICER: Then five, yeah, if you count the initial PDB, that was at 10:30 a.m. on Tuesday.\nQ: Okay. And secondly, I know you say the President says he's not going to outline what he's going to do next, he wants to remain flexible. But members on the Hill say that they want to be brought into the process. So how does that match the President keeping his desire of not announcing things, but folks on the Hill saying, hey, we need to be brought in?\nMR. SPICER: I would just say, Blake -- I mean, as I mentioned, the key congressional leaders and committee heads and ranking members were all informed of the decision. I think now that action has been taken, I believe that they'll be -- they've started to have those conversations. Both the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, National Security Advisor, the Vice President, the Chief of Staff, others, have been in constant with contact with congressional leaders.\nAnd I understand your desire to understand what's going on, but I think those are conversations that are going to be held fairly privately in terms of preserving any future action.\nJim.\nQ: There's some reports out there that there are concerns among U.S. officials that the Russians were involved in the chemical weapons attack that occurred in Syria. What's the latest on that? What can you tell us about that?\nMR. SPICER: The actions that were taken were clearly against the Assad regime, and I'm not going to say anything further than that. As I mentioned -- I know Secretary Tillerson noted last night with respect to Russia that there was a military de-confliction with respect to the area of operation to make sure that -- because we're both operating. But beyond that, there was no political contact made with Moscow. But I think last night sent a very clear signal.\nQ: Sean, you talk about this as evolution over these last 72 hours. Can you give a little bit of insight into the President's thinking and how that evolved? We saw publicly the statements that he made where he sort of seemed to become more taken aback by the imagery or what have you by the time he gave that press conference. Did you talk to him privately about what his reaction was in the beginning and then how that evolved and how he got from point A to point B, to launch the strike?\nMR. SPICER: Well, only to say -- I mean, number one, I think the President's comments that he made in the Rose Garden with King Abdullah pretty much speak for themselves with respect to the disgust that he had for the imagery that he was seeing, and the assessments that his team was providing with respect to the innocent lives, especially the children and babies, that have been killed.\nObviously, chemicals have been used by Assad in the past. In his first 70 days, the President was very taken by this. But also, I think this was -- as you mentioned correctly, this was a 72-hour evolution of receiving updates and options and refinement through additional questions that the President made to come to a final decision.\nBut once he was presented with these at 10:30 a.m. on Tuesday, he began to ask a series of questions, began to get additional updates and assessment as far as what happened, why it happened, and then obviously options that were available and to act.\nQ: But the question is, was there a sense of the skepticism at the beginning, where he said, look, are you sure that --\nMR. SPICER: No. No. I spoke with him. I had an opportunity to see him initially, right after that PDB, and he was very moved and found the event extremely tragic. So I think, from the get-go, it was very, very disturbing and tragic and moving to him.\nQ: So you had a sense that he was there in terms of military strength --\nMR. SPICER: No, I wouldn't say -- no, again, I wouldn't -- just before we get too far, the answer is that he had a very deliberative process of asking his national security team to develop options. And as you may know, I mean, those options usually start with zero and go all the way to 100. And so there was a level of assessment, further probing and questions that the President had, and then, ultimately, after days of refinement, a decision was made. But that -- I wouldn't want to suggest that there was any sense of immediate decision. That's why it evolved over time and he took the length of time that he did. It was through a series of updates, questions, and further information.\nQ: How did he seem, Sean?\nMR. SPICER: I'm sorry?\nQ: What did he see? What did he seem in that PDB? Did he see printed-out images, did he see video?\nMR. SPICER: Obviously, I can't go into what he sees in a PBD.\nQ: Okay, but how did he take in --\nMR. SPICER: Obviously, there's -- beyond the information that he gets in his PBD, there were very clear images that were available online, in newspapers, and on television that everyone in the world could see.\nQ: And was he seeing those pictures?\nMR. SPICER: I'm sorry?\nQ: He was seeing those, too, the public images that were out there?\nMR. SPICER: Oh, absolutely.\nQ: As far as this 72-hour evolution, does the President now believe Assad needs to leave power?\nMR. SPICER: I think that the President's actions were very decisive last night and I think are very clear about what he thinks needs to get done. I think, first and foremost, the President believes that the Syrian government, the Assad regime should, at the minimum, agree to abide by the agreements that they made not to use chemical weapons. I think that should be a minimum standard throughout the world.\nSo I think that's where we start. I think a very, very clear message was sent last night, one that was backed up and echoed by not only our own leaders here in this country but throughout the world.\nQ: Sean, the President, during the campaign, warned that action against the Assad regime could result or devolve into World War III. He talked about the risks of drawing in Russia and Iran into a broader conflict. Is the President at all concerned about that happening, or the fact that as U.S. planes fly over the Syrian skies that they could run into interference from either Russian or Syrian defense systems?\nMR. SPICER: I think if you've seen the response from the world community, including some of the countries that you've mentioned, I think that they understand that the U.S. acted appropriately and, in most cases, there is widespread praise from around the globe for the President's actions.\nQ: But is that not something that he's concerned about anymore?\nMR. SPICER: I think the President -- as I said, the team last night -- Secretary of Defense Mattis, Secretary of State Tillerson, the Vice President, the Chief of Staff, National Security Advisor was on the phone not just with members of Congress but with foreign heads of government as well as defense ministers, and almost universally were praised for the President's decisive action.\nQ: To follow on that, Sean, also on the campaign trail the President expressed a desire to work with Russia to defeat ISIS. But this clearly puts a setback on that.\nMR. SPICER: I don't know that I agree with that. I think that there can be a shared commitment to defeat ISIS and also agree that you can't gas your own people. I don't think that -- there is a mutual level of human decency that I think we can expect out of everybody, and I don't think that that goes hand in hand with also augmenting that with our national security interests.\nQ: Sean, can you give us a sense of what foreign ministers and defense ministers were spoken to last night? And will the President -- (inaudible.)\nMR. SPICER: The President has been continuing in meetings with President Xi. I'll see on both of those whether or not --\nQ: One more thing. The Russian foreign ministry statement this morning called this a \"clear act of aggression,\" suggested that the United States had been planning this strike even before the chemical attack. Can you respond specifically?\nMR. SPICER: I think I just gave you a very clear tick-tock of what -- the President's notification, how he arrived at the action he did. So that pretty much speaks for itself. And I'm sorry, the other --\nQ: That this is a \"clear act of aggression.\"\nMR. SPICER: I think this was a clear response on humanitarian purposes that has been widely praised throughout the globe.\nQ: Are there any specific outcomes that you see from President Xi visit?\nMR. SPICER: As I mentioned at the outset, we'll have a readout of that visit. I just wanted to give you guys a quick update. We'll have further information throughout the day. Stay in touch with us. I want to get back. Obviously our focus is continuing to have a phenomenal -- a great -- I'm sorry, Politico -- (laughter) -- I think we're in the midst of a very terrific visit, and I want to make sure that we conclude that.\nThank you guys very much.\nEND 1:26 P.M.

So this is being streamed back to both the Tideline, as well as the White House.\nObviously, today the President was very pleased with the outcomes of today's meeting. I wanted to give you guys a quick readout, so today I've brought three of the top participants in this: Secretary of State Tillerson, Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin, and Secretary Commerce Wilbur Ross.\nThey'll go in that order, and then we'll take a few questions.\nWith that, Secretary of State Tillerson.\nSECRETARY TILLERSON: Well, thank you, Sean.\nI would open by saying the President was very happy to host President Xi at Mar-a-Lago these last two days. As those of you that have been here know, it was obviously a perfect weather day today, and it was a great opportunity for both the Presidents and their wives to really get to know one another and enjoy, share meals together, and work on important issues.\nEach side did bring along senior delegations of officials\n-- so, of course, we're represented here -- who also were able to build important relationships for a lot of work that's still ahead of us.\nI think what I would really want you to get a grasp of is that both the atmosphere, the chemistry between the two leaders was positive. The posture between the two really set the tone for our subsequent meetings between our high-level delegations. And I would tell you the exchanges were very frank. They were candid, they were open, and they were very positive. So I think all of us are feeling very good about the results of this summit in terms of what it did for setting a very constructive tone going forward.\nThe two leaders had positive, productive meetings. President Trump and President Xi agreed to work in concert to expand areas of cooperation while managing differences based on mutual respect.\nThe two Presidents reviewed the current state of the bilateral relationship and noted the importance of working together to generate positive outcomes that would benefit the citizens of both of our countries. President Trump noted the challenges caused by Chinese government intervention in its economy and raised serious concerns about the impact of China's industrial, agricultural, technology, and cyber policies on U.S. jobs and exports. The President underscored the need for China to take concrete steps to level the playing field for American workers, stressing repeatedly the need for reciprocal market access.\nThe two sides noted the urgency of the threat of North Korea's weapons program, reaffirmed their commitment to a denuclearized Korean Peninsula, and committed to fully implement U.N. Security Council resolutions. They agreed to increase cooperation and work with the international community to convince the DPRK to peacefully resolve the issue and abandon its illicit weapons programs.\nThe two sides had candid discussions on regional and maritime security. President Trump noted the importance of adherence to international norms in the East and South China Seas and to previous statements on non-militarization. He also noted the importance of protecting human rights and other values deeply held by Americans.\nThe two Presidents agreed to elevate existing bilateral talks to reflect the importance of making progress on issues. They established a new high-level framework for negotiations. The U.S.-China Comprehensive Dialogue will be overseen by the two Presidents, and it will have four pillars: the diplomatic and security dialogue; the comprehensive economic dialogue; the law enforcement and cybersecurity dialogue; and the social and cultures issues dialogue.\nThe two sides agreed to undertake an ambitious agenda and schedule to show progress and achieve meaningful results. President Trump welcomed President Xi's invitation to visit China for a state visit at a future date. They agreed to work together in the interim to ensure successful and results-focused visits.\nWith that, I'd like to turn it to Treasury Secretary Mnuchin.\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Thank you. I would just like to reiterate that we had a very productive two days with our counterparts. And specifically we had a meeting this morning that was a breakout of the first comprehensive economic dialogue. We had very direct and frank conversations about how we would work together. Secretary Ross and I will be leading that jointly, and we will be focused on trade, investment, and other economic opportunities between both companies -- countries.\nWe focused specifically on a more balanced economic relationship, specifically on trade. And we focused on the desire to have very specific action items both in the short term for the next time we get together, as well as what the goals are over the year. So I think we think the restructuring of the dialogue and having specifically a breakout that will address comprehensive economic opportunities across our different agencies both here and within China I think we felt was very productive, very good start in how we're going to structure it, and again, very specific things that we talked about to look forward on making progress in the short term on.\nSecretary Ross?\nSECRETARY ROSS: Thank you, Steven. I think in many ways, the most significant thing was a 100-day plan. Normally, trade discussions, especially between China and ourselves, are denominated in multiple years. This was denominated in the first instance in 100 days with hopefully way stations of accomplishment along the way. Given the range of issues and the magnitude, that may be ambitious, but it's a very big sea change in the pace of discussions. And I think that's a very very important symbolization of the growing rapport between the two countries.\nMR. SPICER: We'll take a few questions. Steve.\nQ: Secretary of State Tillerson, can I ask you about North Korea? Did the President say that he might use trade against China if they do not rein in North Korea? And did you get any specific commitments from China to do something about the North Korea problem?\nSECRETARY TILLERSON: The Presidents' discussions -- President Trump and President Xi -- on North Korea were very wide-ranging, very comprehensive, and more focused entirely on both countries' previous commitments to denuclearize the peninsula. There was no kind of a package arrangement discussed to resolve this.\nI think President Xi, from their part, shared the view that this has reached a very serious stage in terms of the advancement of North Korea's nuclear capabilities. They discussed the challenges that introduces for both countries, but there's a real commitment that we work together to see if this cannot be resolved in a peaceful way. But in order for that to happen, North Korea's posture has to change before there's any basis for dialogue or discussions.\nPresident Trump indicated to President Xi that he welcomed any ideas that President Xi and China might have as to other actions we could take and that we would be happy to work with them, but we understand it creates unique problems for them and challenges and that we would, and are, prepared to chart our own course if this is something China is just unable to coordinate with us.\nQ: Two quick questions for Secretary Tillerson, and one for Secretary Ross. Previous administrations have been very tough on North Korea -- sorry -- tough on China in terms of human rights violations. And I was wondering if that came up and if this administration plans to pressure the Chinese on human rights violations. And the second question, if I may have the opportunity to ask since you're here on Syria -- a lot of the American people are concerned that yesterday's actions mean we're going to war. And I was hoping if you could just clarify -- is this just a one-fit situation, or is this going to be part of a -- campaign to try to the Assad government?\nSECRETARY TILLERSON: As to the discussions around human rights in China, I think America's values are quite clear and they really occupied a core of all of our discussions. I don't think you have to have a separate conversation, somehow separate our core values around human rights from our economic discussions, our military-to-military discussions, or our foreign policy discussions. They're really embedded in every discussion, that that is really what guides much of our view around how we're going to work together.\nAs to Syria, I think as was indicated in our statements last night, this particular strike that was carried out on the airbase from which the chemical weapons attack was launched was very deliberately considered by the President. It is a response that we believe is both proportional and appropriate. And as we said last night, we will monitor Syria's response to that strike in terms of whether they attack our own forces or coalition forces, or whether we detect that they are considering mobilizing to take additional chemical weapons attacks. And I'd say at this point the future will be guided by how we see their reaction.\nQ: Thank you. And for you, Secretary Roth, I was wondering if talked to the Chinese about cracking down on any banks or companies that may be working with North Korea.\nSECRETARY ROSS: As you know, Commerce fined ZTE, the second largest telecom company for making equipment in China, $1.170 billion recently. So they recognize that that shows our clear determination to crack down on that sort of activity.\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: And I would just also emphasize Treasury obviously manages multiple sanctions programs, some specifically towards North Korea, and we have had direct conversations with our counterparts in China about working with us on those.\nQ: Did the Chinese agree to do anything that will make it easier for American companies to export to China?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: I think there was definitely an acknowledgement by them on the trade issue that we do need to get to a more balanced trade environment. We did begin those discussions today, but I would just emphasize there was a lot going on in two days. And although we had some specific conversations, as Secretary Ross, mentioned, the plan is for us to develop a 100-day plan, and we would expect to see some very specific items on that.\nQ: Will you move forward with a plan to label China a currency manipulator?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: I would just comment on, I think as you know, the currency report is going to come out in the near future, and we will address that when it comes out.\nSECRETARY ROSS: As other trade issues, you would not have expected us to reach agreement in a few hours of meetings. The issues are far more complex and far more deep rooted. But 100-days is a very, very short time for trade.\nQ: Did you discuss the environment and environmental commitments? And what was your response if China asked for more commitments from the United States on that issue?\nSECRETARY ROSS: That was not a major part of the discussion, nor do I recall the Chinese specifically raising it.\nQ: There was anticipation that President Xi would come with some sort of gift for President Trump -- infrastructure investment, something that would demonstrate a Chinese commitment to having more jobs in the U.S. Was there anything like that?\nSECRETARY ROSS: The best gift was his presence and the relationship what was built up between our President and President Xi.\nQ: Secretary Tillerson, Chinese media is reporting that President Trump was invited to visit China in 2017. Can you clarify just if that was the year that you've agreed to do this?\nSECRETARY TILLERSON: The President did accept the invitation of President Xi to visit China. Now, the invitation was for a 2107 visit. The President said that he would look at the dates, and we would work with them to see when that visit might occur.\nQ: Secretary Ross, could you give a couple of examples of the kind of way stations that people might see in the 100-day time?\nSECRETARY ROSS: The exact way stations are a matter of negotiation itself. But, directionally, the objective is to increase our exports to China and to reduce the trade deficit that we have with them.\nQ: When you say that there was a recognition by the Chinese and acknowledgement of the trade issue that it needs to be a more balanced environment, what did they say exactly? That seems like that's sort of off message for them.\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: I don't think it was off message at all. Again, I think they look at -- we have very similar economic interests, and I think there are areas that they clearly want to work with us. And as Secretary Ross said the objective is for us to increase our exports to them. It's a very big market, and there will be more opportunities for both exports as well as investments.\nQ: We were told -- sorry, did you want to say something, Secretary Ross?\nSECRETARY ROSS: What I was going to say was simply that it was a very wide range of products that we discussed, not a particularly limited one. And the most interesting thing to me was they expressed an interest in reducing their net trade balance because of the impact it's having on money supply and inflation. That's the first time I've heard them say that in a bilateral context.\nQ: We were informed that President Xi was informed of the Syria strikes during dinner yesterday, and so I was wondering if you could maybe explain what the reaction was from the Chinese as to this. They've usually been very opposed -- in the U.N. at least -- on acts against Syria.\nAnd so since the three of you are here, we saw that all three of you were in the photo in the Situation Room, as this was playing out. So I'd be very interested to hear -- especially it's not common to see maybe the Treasury Secretary or the Commerce Secretary in those situations. So if you can say what role you were playing and maybe what your thoughts were while this was unfolding.\nSECRETARY TILLERSON: The President did directly inform President Xi near the end of the dinner yesterday evening as the missiles that are launched were impacting, which was about 8:40 p.m. last night. The President told President Xi that we had launched a strike against Syria as a result of Assad's violation -- multiple violations of the use of chemical weapons against his own citizens, including the killing of women, children, and babies. The President provided President Xi the number of missiles that were launched and explained the rationale behind it.\nPresident Xi I think expressed an appreciation for the President letting him know and providing the rationale and said, as it was told to me, indicated that he understood that such a response is necessary when people are killing children.\nNow, China has issued its own statements. I'm sure those are available to you. I have read them on them on the wire service, as well.\nAs to the Situation Room, before I turn it to the two Secretaries to give you kind of their color on what was going on, I think it is important for everyone to recognize a couple of things on the Syrian attack. First, it was an overwhelming success. I think the performance our military and the expertise and the power of what the U.S. military is able to execute on a fairly short planning window was extraordinary. And I think all Americans, and, indeed, I think all our allies in the free world should take great comfort in what occurred with that strike last night. And Americans should be very proud of their men and women in uniform.\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: I would just not only echo what Secretary Tillerson said, but I think, as you know, the Treasury Department has very important functions in terms of sanctions and other intelligence -- financial intelligence functions that I have been participating in. So on the National Security Council, the Treasury Department does participate in that.\nWe will be announcing additional sanctions on Syria as part of our ongoing effort to stop this type of activity and emphasize how significant we view this. And we expect that those will continue to have an important effect on preventing people from doing business with them.\nQ: Can you elaborate on the sanctions a little bit?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Again, they will be coming out in the near future. But I would just say we view sanctions as being a very important tool, whether it's North Korea or whether it's Syria. These sanctions are very important and we will use them to the maximum effect.\nSECRETARY ROSS: To me, the most dramatic thing about being in the Situation Room as he was making the decision was the thoroughness of the support and information that went into it, the consultation he did with a wide range of military and diplomatic and economic advisors, and the utter seriousness and thoughtfulness with which he made this very grave decision.\nIn terms of the strikes themselves, it's my understanding that they took out something like 20 percent of the entire Syrian air force. So it was huge not just in terms of number of planes but relative to the scale of their air force.\nQ: Secretary Tillerson, you talked about the great success. The AFP is reporting that the runway is still operational and is actually being used. Is that accurate? And can you comment on whether that was your intent, and if that puts a damper on the success of the operation?\nSECRETARY TILLERSON: The runways were not the target due to the nature of the construction of those runways. Our military estimate was that we could not do serious damage to the runways. They are very thick and they're constructed in a way that the ordnance that were used, while would have damaged them -- the damage would have been easily repaired in a matter of hours.\nSo the targeting was selected very deliberately to render the airbase essentially inoperable as an operating base, and that means taking out all the infrastructure, the fueling capability, all the support infrastructure, hangars. And, indeed, there were a number of Syrian aircraft that were destroyed on the ground. Those were the targets that were selected for that very specific reason.\nSo the fact that planes may be landing in and out of there, they're not refueling and they're not able to certainly initiate any activity from that airfield today.\nQ: Can I also ask you a follow-up on reports that the United States is investigating Russia's role in the gas attacks themselves? How far are you in this investigation, and what's your confidence level and the direction on that, please?\nSECRETARY TILLERSON: I don't have any particular information I think that it would be appropriate to share with you at this point. Obviously we continue to gather the information that we can through our intelligence sources, as well as shared sources from other countries as well. And so I don't think it would be appropriate for me to comment on that at this time.\nQ: Russia has come out very strongly against the attack, calling it an \"act of aggression.\" Do you have a message for the Russians or a response to that?\nSECRETARY TILLERSON: I'm disappointed in that response from the Russians because it indicates their continued support for the Assad regime and, in particular, their continued support for a regime that carries out these type of horrendous attacks on their own people. So I find it very disappointing, but, sadly, I have to tell you, not all that surprising.\nQ: There were reports prior to today that President Trump was planning to sign an executive order that would target countries that dump steel into the United States. Was that correct, and is he still planning to do so, if so?\nSECRETARY ROSS: The practice is to announce executive orders and executive memoranda when they're issued, not in response to rumors.\nQ: Can you just if Westinghouse was talked about at all, and the scale of the bankruptcy of Westinghouse -- was that even a topic?\nSECRETARY ROSS: That was not a topic in today's session, but we have been looking very carefully at that and the alternatives, both from an economic, from an energy generation and from a national security point of view.\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: And I would just comment that it -- obviously, any such transaction that involved foreign investment would go through the normal CFIUS process.\nThank you.\nMR.

The two presidents reviewed the state of the bilateral relationship and noted the importance of working together to generate positive outcomes that would benefit the citizens of both countries.\nPresident Trump noted the challenges caused by Chinese government intervention in its economy and raised serious concerns about the impact of China's industrial, agricultural, technology, and cyber policies on United States jobs and exports. The President underscored the need for China to take concrete steps to level the playing field for American workers, stressing repeatedly the need for reciprocal market access.\nThe two sides noted the urgency of the threat of North Korea's weapons programs, reaffirmed their commitment to a denuclearized Korean peninsula?, and committed to fully implement UN Security Council resolutions.

In fact, 93 percent of our domestic manufacturers have expressed optimism in the future—a record. The confidence we are seeing in our Nation is about jobs and opportunity, but it's also about safety and security.\nSecurity begins at the border. As a candidate, I pledged to take swift and decisive action to secure the border, and that is exactly what I have done. We inherited a full-fledged border crisis; it was a disaster. Yet, with quick and bold steps, we have so far exceeded even the most bullish predictions for the progress we could make in so short a period of time. Last month, we saw a 64-percent reduction in illegal immigration on our southern border.\nAt the same time, we are conducting enforcement actions across the country to remove dangerous criminal aliens from our society, and they'll be gone. In just the last few days, our Nation's ICE officers have arrested 153 criminal aliens in South Texas, 84 criminal aliens in the Pacific Northwest, and 31 criminal aliens in Long Island, New York. These arrests include aliens convicted of robbery, burglary, aggravated assault, sexual assault against a child, smuggling, drug dealing, and many more.\nMuch work needs to be done to reverse decades of harm caused by open border policies from Washington, but with time, dedication, and effort, we will get the job done and save countless lives in the process.\nProviding security for the American people also means restoring America's standing in the world. From the very start of my Presidency, I've worked to strengthen our alliances and improve our relationships all around the globe.\nThis week, I was honored to welcome the President of Egypt and the King of Jordan to the White House. Now, I am hosting a summit with President Xi of China at the southern White House to address the many critical issues affecting our two peoples.\nIn our dealings with other nations, our conversations have been candid, open, and grounded in mutual respect. I have been clear about advocating for the national interests of the United States, something so important to me and so important to our people, one of the reasons, certainly, that I got elected. And I want to ensure that the decisions we make truly serve the safety and security of our citizens.\nIn matters both economic and military, we understand that a strong America is in the best interests of the world. That is why it is so important that as we strengthen international partnerships, we ensure these partnerships deliver real results for Americans and the American people. Our decisions will be guided by our values and our goals, and we will reject the path of inflexible ideology that too often leads to unintended consequences.\nA future of peace, safety, and prosperity—that is our guiding light and always will be. Together, we will bring about this future for the land we love and for the people who call it home. We love our country, and we love the American people.

These patriots have moved and inspired our Nation through their unyielding sacrifices and devout allegiance. We honor the strength through adversity of all of these heroes from our Nation's wars and conflicts, from the American Revolution to the World Wars, from Korea to Vietnam, from Desert Storm to the War on Terror.\nAmerican service members serve and fight selflessly each day to secure the freedoms we often take for granted. They bear the full weight of their oath to \"support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic,\" in which there is no safety clause. None know this so well as our former prisoners of war (POWs). According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, more than half a million Americans have been captured and interned as POWs since the American Revolution.\nThis year marks the 75th anniversary of the Bataan Death March. After the surrender of the Bataan peninsula in the Philippines on April 9, 1942, Filipino and American soldiers were rounded up and forced to march 60 miles from Mariveles to San Fernando. An estimated 500 Americans died during the march, as they were starved, beaten, and tortured to death. Those who reached San Fernando were taken in cramped boxcars to POW camps, where thousands more Americans died of disease and starvation.\nThese stories remind us of the great sacrifice and bravery of our men and women in the Armed Forces. Throughout our history, they have risked everything to defend our country. They have been stripped of liberty, and regained it. They have faced the darkness of captivity, and emerged to the warm light of freedom. These victories have no match. These triumphs ignite the flame of liberty deep within their hearts, and in ours, and make America the great Nation it is today.\nBut in celebrating those POWs who returned from captivity, we also solemnly remember and honor those who died in captivity. They paid the ultimate price for their love of country.\nAs President, I am committed to providing our veterans, and especially our former POWs, with the support, care, and resources they deserve. Our country owes a debt to our heroes that we can never adequately repay, but which we will always honor each day.\nNow, Therefore, I, Donald J.

{"author": "Sean Spicer", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123853", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:45 P.M. EDT\nMR. SPICER: Welcome back, everyone. Good to see you all after a few days -- for those of you who didn't get a chance to go down to Florida.\nThis morning, in the Rose Garden, the President was honored to host the swearing-in of Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch. His confirmation was the culmination of a thoughtful and deliberative process that the President started almost a year ago when he released his initial list of potential nominees for the Supreme Court.\nIn September, he released a final, definitive list, promising to select only from those individuals who would continue the legacy of the great Justice Scalia on the bench. And today, the President celebrated our new associate justice who will protect our Constitution for generations. It was definitely a great day to kick off the week, and another productive week that we will see here at the White House.\nBefore I get into the upcoming week, just a couple updates from over the weekend. First, the President spoke with Prime Minister Lofven of Sweden to express our condolences for the loved ones who were killed in Friday's terrorist attack in central Stockholm, Sweden, and to wish a speedy recovery for those who were wounded.\nThe President also called President Sisi yesterday to convey his deepest condolences to Egypt and the families who lost loved ones in the heinous attack that occurred there. Dozens of innocent people were killed and many more were injured on holy Palm Sunday. The United States condemns in the strongest terms these barbaric attacks on Christian places of worship in Tanta and in Alexandria.\nThe President also spoke with the King of Saudi Arabia, the Prime Minister of Japan, the Acting President of South Korea, all about the United States' military strike on the airfield in Syria. All of the leaders expressed support for the United States' necessary action in response to the horrible chemical and bomb attack on innocent civilians.\nAnd yesterday, he spoke with Commander Andria Slough, the commanding officer of the USS Porter, and Commander Russell Caldwell, the commanding officer of the USS Ross, to thank them and their teams for successfully carrying out that strike. During these calls, the President communicated that he could not be more proud of the crews of these two ships and their flawless execution of these operations.\nAs you know, these ships, between the two of them, sent 59 Tomahawk missiles and each of them hit all of their targets, showing America's power and the military's accuracy, which is just a small representation of our military's overall capability and a fraction of what this President will continue to build up the military to be throughout his administration. The sight of people being gassed and blown away by barrel bombs ensures that if we see this kind of action again, we hold open the possibility of future action.\nThe resulting action of what happened ensured that their fueling operation is gone from this air facility, 20 percent of their fixed-wing aircraft were destroyed and knocked out, and I think by all measures, the world and domestic reaction was highly laudable for the President's action.\nAdditionally, obviously, we're all aware that the President had a very successful visit with the Chinese President, and it concluded on Friday. As you've read, one of the most significant developments from these discussions was the agreement to create a 100-day initial plan -- hopefully with some tangible near-term deliverables -- to lead to a more balanced economic relationship between our two countries. As that develops, we'll make sure that we provide you with additional details.\nAnd this morning, the President was glad to see Toyota announce that it will be spending $1.33 billion in its Kentucky plant as part of its plan to invest $10 billion in America over the next five years, a continued signal of the confidence that businesses have in the American economy under President Trump.\nNow, in terms of the week ahead. Tomorrow, the President will have a discussion on strategy and policy with several members of his Cabinet and a group of CEOs. This is a follow-up from his meeting with 20 CEOs from the Strategic and Policy Forum just this past February, with some of the same business leaders and some new ones.\nFirst, they'll meet in small interactive groups, each led by a Cabinet member, to discuss the priorities for those Cabinet Secretaries and their agencies. The President will then oversee a report that will be presented to the group -- by the group, rather. The Cabinet-level participants will be Secretary of Commerce Ross, Secretary of Education DeVos, EPA Administrator Pruitt, OMB Director Mulvaney, and Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao. We'll have the full list of additional participants for you later.\nAs part of the effort to deescalate the conflict in Syria and press for a political process that can resolve the conflict and eventually result in a transition of a new, legitimate Syrian leadership, U.S.* [U.N.] Special Envoy for Syria will be coming to Washington tomorrow for consultations with the State Department and with National Security Advisor McMaster here at the White House, among others. He has been overseeing the political talks among Syrian parties in Geneva.\nOn Wednesday, we will welcome the Secretary General of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, to the White House. The President and Secretary General will have a joint press conference later in the afternoon.\nAnd then the President plans to spend the Easter holiday in Florida, and he'll return to the White House on Sunday.\nAs the President noted today, as we hit day 81 in the President's administration, we have done so many great things, including nominate and confirm a Supreme Court justice; roll back more regulations than any President in modern times; roll back the Obama-era war on coal, oil and natural gas; restore confidence in the economy. We're now seeing historic levels of consumer, CEO, homebuilder, manufacture confidence. There's been a 12 percent gain in the stock market. We've even seen a real resurgence in the mining industry. We've reduced illegal boarding* [border] crossings by over 60 percent to the lowest level in nearly two decades, and implemented historic ethics reforms, including a five-year lobbying ban and a lifetime foreign ban.\nSo with that, I'd be glad to take your questions.\nQ: Why is it okay to bomb Syria but not okay to assist the refugees? One. And number two, what is the reaction -- this administration's reaction to Russia saying we are running a danger of a real war within the Middle East?\nMR. SPICER: Well, with respect to number one, the reason that we took action was multifold -- number one, to stop the proliferation and deterrence of chemical weapons. When you see mass weapons of destruction being used it should be a concern to every nation, especially our own people. The proliferation of those weapons pose a grave threat to our national security. So, number one, we have to stop that.\nNumber two, we have to stop ISIS. But with respect to the people of Syria, by us taking action and deescalating what's going on in Syria, that's the greatest thing you can do to support those people. Deescalating the conflict there, containing ISIS is the greatest aspect of humanitarian relief that we can provide, first and foremost.\nSecondly, creating areas in which we can work with allies, including Russia, in committing to ensuring that there are places that are free from violence and are places free for people to gather safely is another. Because I think everyone would agree that the last thing people want to do there is leave. They want to stay there. They want to be in Syria. They want to have a safe place to remain with their families and not be separated.\nSo our number-one priority is to defeat ISIS, but we're also, I think from a humanitarian standpoint and a refugee standpoint, ensuring that we create an environment that provides a safe place for them to ultimately remain.\nAnd then on Russia, in particular, look, I think that if you look at the countries that are with us, it speaks pretty loudly the number of countries that have stood shoulder-to-shoulder with this President. Russia, on the other hand, stands with Syria, North Korea and Iran. I think when you contrast the two groups of country sets, it's pretty clear that we're on the right side of this issue.\nQ: Right. So does that mean we're going to commit troops? I mean, there's talking about a war.\nMR. SPICER: No, no, what it means is that I think the action that we took last week has been widely praised, domestically and internationally, as a great step to ensure the deterrence and proliferation of chemical weapons and of action against innocent people. When you watch babies and children being gassed and suffer under barrel bombs, you are instantaneously moved to action. I think this President has made it very clear that if those actions were to continue, further action will definitely be considered by the United States.\nWe continue to urge further the world community to join us in this, in both stopping -- the deterrence -- and proliferation of use of those weapons, but then further, trying to create a political environment that will result in new leadership. Those are very important. They go hand in hand.\nQ: Are we building a coalition or --\nMR. SPICER: I think we have a -- I mean, again, I think if you look at who's not with us, it's a pretty small group and not a group that too many people are looking to bring on board. I mean, you got Iran, Syria, North Korea, and Russia on one side of this. That's a pretty small group.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. President Trump has spoken out extensively about the crimes of Bashar al-Assad in Syria. Does the President consider Assad a war criminal? And does he believe Assad should eventually appear before the ICC?\nMR. SPICER: I think right now the focus is twofold. One is defeating ISIS, and the second is creating the political environment necessary for the Syrian people to have new leadership there. I don't think that there's -- I can't imagine a stable and peaceful Syria where Bashar al-Assad is in power. I think we all recognize that that happens -- and there can be a multipronged approach; we are ensuring that ISIS is contained and that there's a de-escalation of the proliferation of chemical weapons, at the same time, creating the environment for a change of leadership.\nQ: Does the President believe Assad has committed a war crime?\nMR. SPICER: I think that there is a court that decides those things. And obviously, there's a reason that -- well, I clearly -- the actions -- when you take an action against the people that he has, and I think we feel unbelievably confident in the intelligence that we have. But again, that would be something for a court to decide.\nCharlie.\nQ: A lot of people are talking about what the Trump doctrine is on foreign policy, what it may or may not include, and the President even stated that he was very flexible. Do you know what the Trump doctrine is on foreign policy, and can you explain it to us?\nMR. SPICER: Yeah, I think the Trump doctrine is something that he articulated throughout the campaign, which is that's America is first. We're going to make sure that our national interests are protected; that we do what we can to make sure that our interests, both economically and national security, are at the forefront; and we're not just going to become the world's policeman running around the world, but that we have to find a clear and defined national interest wherever we act and that it's our national security, first and foremost, that has to deal with how we act.\nQ: The action in Syria fits in that doctrine?\nMR. SPICER: Absolutely. I think if you recognize the threat that our country and our people face if there is a growth of use or spread of chemical weapons of mass destruction, those -- the proliferation of those, the spread to other groups is a clear danger to our country and to our people\nKristin.\nQ: Sean, thank you. I was just going to follow up on what you were saying about Bashar al-Assad. Are you saying that defeating ISIS and getting Bashar al-Assad out of power through a political process should happen at the same time?\nMR. SPICER: I think -- I'm not trying to -- how you sequence them, but I don't think they're mutually exclusive. I don't think that you have to do one and another. But I think they kind of go hand in hand. As you reduce ISIS's strength, as you deescalate the conflict in Syria, the political environment to remove him becomes stronger and stronger.\nQ: And just to be clear, Secretary Tillerson, over the weekend, said we can navigate a political outcome in which the Syrian people will determine Bashar al-Assad's fate and his legitimacy. Nikki Haley seemed to align more with what you were saying. She said, no way do we see peace in that area with Assad as the head of the Syrian government. So who better reflects the --\nMR. SPICER: I don't think that's -- I don't think those are mutually exclusive statements.\nQ: How so?\nMR. SPICER: Because I don't think -- I think that you can -- one of them is saying, we don't see peace with him in charge. The other one is saying, we need to have him gone. I think that's the point of both. The goal for both of them -- the goal for the United States is twofold, as I've stated. It's, one, to make sure that we destabilize Syria -- destabilize the conflict there, reduce the threat of ISIS.\nBut then, secondly, is create the political environment not just within the Syrian people, but I think you can have -- work with Russia, in particular, to make sure that they understand that Syria, backed up by Russia's own accounting, should be held accountable for the agreements that it's made with respect to its international agreements on chemical weapons alone.\nQ: And can you defeat ISIS with Assad still in power?\nMR. SPICER: Yes. Sure. But I think that -- I think you can defeat ISIS with him in power. I think that obviously, to your point, it's not like there's a single track that says you have to do it. I mean, if we can get both at the same time, or one happens after another, that's fine as well. But I think that we obviously -- the number-one threat that America faces is ISIS in that region, and we've got to make sure that we do everything we can to do that.\nQ: And just finally, when Secretary Tillerson meets with his Russian counterpart, what is his specific message going to be? Is he going to threaten, potentially, more sanctions if Russia doesn't get --\nMR. SPICER: Look, I think he is on his way there tomorrow, and I'll let Secretary Tillerson talk about his meeting with Foreign Minister Lavrov. I think there's a lot of things to obviously discuss -- the overall fight on ISIS. But I think with respect to Syria, in particular, I think we need to remind them of the commitments that they've made, and the commitments that Syria has made. And I think that --\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nMR. SPICER: I think that, first and foremost, we need to make sure that we all understand what the situation is on the ground. There is no question who acted in this case and what Syria did. And I think that we need to make sure that Russia fully understands the actions that Assad took, the commitments that Syria has made, and Russia has equally agreed to the same understanding. So that getting them back on the same page, first and foremost, would seem the logical step.\nBut secondly, and I guess equally as important, is to make sure that the areas where we can find a commitment to defeat ISIS is something that we share.\nMajor.\nQ: So would the President want the Secretary of State to put the threat of sanctions on the table to get Russia's attention in this matter? Because the Secretary of State said Russia is either complicit or incompetent. What does the President believe Russia actually is in this --\nMR. SPICER: Well, look, we'll have plenty of time to discuss how those talks go. I don't want to -- the one thing the President has been very clear on from the get-go is that he doesn't like to telegraph all the cards that he has. I think he wants to see how that conversation goes with Secretary Tillerson. If we can get them to agree to commit to action on defeating ISIS, get --\nQ: What kind of action?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think that's what they're going to have a discussion about. I think that we need to see what goes beyond rhetoric and what goes -- where that talk start, and what they're willing to commit to in action. I think that's important. I think to get ahead of this right now, before they meet, is not something I want to do. I'd like to let Secretary Tillerson meet with Lavrov, have that conversation, and then report back.\nQ: Two more, quickly, about the White House itself. What is the President's perspective on the ability -- the current ability of his senior advisors to resolve their ideological differences, resolve their personality differences, and work as a team?\nMR. SPICER: He's very confident in that.\nQ: Why?\nMR. SPICER: Because this is the same group, with the same ideologies, the same strengths, that came together for a common purpose to win a campaign. There is an unbelievably talented team at the senior level, and at the mid-level, and, frankly, all the way down to the bottom level of this administration that is committed to the President's agenda.\nI said this multiple times throughout the transition, that everybody that came into this administration, while they might have a personal view or an action on an issue, they understand\n-- understood and understand the President's vision and agenda. And their goal of coming into this was to understand, first and foremost, that it is the President who made pledges and promises to the American people about the direction he'd take this country and the actions he has taken.\nAnd he is doing that. And I just read off a series of them in terms of the judges that he's appointed, the Congressional Review Act pieces of legislation that the signed, the executive orders. When you look at the actions that he's taken and the results that he's getting -- 60 percent down on the border. Nobody would dispute the fact that immigration was a hot topic during this campaign, and the President's actions are seeing results. And I think you're seeing it both on the market and on a national security front.\nSo he understands that we have some pretty smart, talented individuals who are opinionated on a lot of subjects, but that our battles and our policy differences need to be behind closed doors; we need to focus, and ultimately all come out committed to advancing the President's agenda.\nBut he is completely aware of the talent that he has, and that's part of the reason that he's brought this team together, is because of the talent and successes and accomplishments they've had on a variety of backgrounds. And he fully believes that they are going to continue to push forward to advance his agenda.\nQ: -- led him to have or order this meeting on Friday where the two principals, Bannon and Jared Kushner, were essentially told by the President, cool this and get along and get on the same page?\nMR. SPICER: Well, look, I think there's a lot of stuff that was overblown about this that makes it out into the media sometimes and gets a little bit more sensational than it truly is. But I think the President is obviously very pleased with the last week that he's had and the accomplishments, especially on the foreign policy front. I think we had an unbelievably helpful and productive meeting with the Chinese. His meeting with King Abdullah was unbelievable, and he's continued to have very strong foreign policy wins in terms of the relationships that we're making with other heads of state. The attack on Syria won not just bipartisan praise here at home, but world praise.\nAnd I think that he recognizes that sometimes some of this spills over in these policy differences and discussions, and he's made sure that the focus stays on advancing the agenda.\nQ: Sean, thanks. If you're saying one of the priorities is to see a regime change in Syria, how far is the President willing to go to see Bashar al-Assad out of power there?\nMR. SPICER: So, just to be clear, I can't -- I don't think it's -- you can't imagine a stable and peaceful Syria with Assad in charge. I just -- I don't think that's a scenario that's possible. But I think that the first step in that has to be to make sure that the region -- and Syria, in particular -- are stable. You can't have ISIS marching through Syria and then worry mostly about who's in charge right now.\nWe've got to make sure that, first and foremost, in terms of our national security -- I think it was Brian's question at the beginning -- our national security is the first and foremost reason that we have to act. And as ISIS is proliferating and chemicals of mass destruction are on the rise there, we've got to contain that. Then once that's done, I think we can apply political, economic, and diplomatic pressure for a regime change.\nNow, they can work in tandem. I'm not trying to -- but the bottom line is the first priority is still the containment of ISIS and the conflicts that's occurring.\nQ: And is the red line -- just to clarify -- the red line for this White House -- chemical warfare -- is conventional warfare enough to get the President to go further there than this White House has gone before?\nMR. SPICER: Look, I think the President has been very clear that there were a number of lines that were crossed last week. He's not going to sit down -- we saw that in the last administration. They drew these red lines, and then the red lines were run over. I don't think you're going to see the same play.\nI think what not just Syria but the world saw last week is a President that is going to act decisively and proportionally and with justification when it comes to actions like that. And I will tell you, the answer is, is that if you gas a baby, if you put a barrel bomb in to innocent people, I think you can -- you will see a response from this President. That is unacceptable. And I think the rest of the --\nQ: -- bomb?\nMR. SPICER: I think -- look, again, one of the things that I don't want to start doing, Cecelia, is say, if you do this, this is the reaction that you're going to get. The President has made very clear throughout his time in the campaign, through the transition, and now, as President, that he's not going to telegraph a response to every corresponding action, because that just tells the opposition or the enemy what you're going to do and whether or not that response is worth taking. The President is going to be very clear that he's going to keep his cards close to the vest. But make no mistake, he will act.\nJohn.\nQ: Thanks a lot, Sean. I wanted to ask you about the reaction that the President took in terms of military involvement last week. You said in your statement that all 59 of those cruise missiles hit their intended target, and yet we're seeing reports that that military airbase in Syria continues to be used by the Syrian military. Given that, how can you consider that particular -- a success?\nMR. SPICER: Well, because I think, from what you're hearing, you've taken two pre-fueled planes and taken them off. It's a PR stunt. The bottom line is their fueling capability has been taken out, their radar capability was taken out, and over 20 percent of their fixed-wing aircraft from their entire air force was taken out. Their ability to operate successfully out of that airbase is gone.\nLike I said, they -- as a PR stunt, they took some pre-fueled planes, pushed them over to make it look like nothing is -- but make no mistake about it, their radar capability is gone, their fueling capability is gone, and a good chunk of their aircraft is gone. That's a huge success.\nQ: I just want to ask you one other question following up on what Major Garrett asked, sort of about these reports of a shake-up at the White House. There have been various reports that the Deputy National Security Advisor K.T. MacFarland is stepping down from that post. She'll take on the post of U.S. ambassador to Singapore. Can you confirm that? And what's behind that particular move if, indeed, that's the case?\nMR. SPICER: I appreciate -- look, I've said many times before that we're not going to get into personnel announcements until they're ready to announce. I would say two points on that. One, when General McMaster was announced, it was pretty clear -- we said it at the time -- you all asked the question, whether or not he would have the ability to shape the National Security Council in his liking, with the President's concurrence -- I think you've pretty much seen that that was an accurate statement at the time and it continues to be now. And General McMaster has the President's confidence to ensure that our National Security Council is shaped in a manner that best serves the President of the United States in every way, shape, or form.\nSecondly, to your point -- I think the staff said it over the weekend, I'll reiterate it -- the only thing that's being shaken up in Washington right now is -- or is being shaken up is Washington. I think this President continues to show that he is going to be a disrupter and do things differently and bring real change to Washington.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Two questions. First, the previous administration was in touch with the Assad opposition and gathered conclaves of different groups, including the Free Syrian Army. Is this administration in touch with the same anti-Assad forces, political and military?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to go into details on what we're doing and who we're talking to. I think that obviously didn't prove too successful the last cycle, the last administration, in terms of regime change. So I'm going to not get into telegraphing what we're doing and how we're doing it.\nQ: And on the domestic front, Congressman Ron DeSantis wrote the President just last week to call, in very strong language, for him, by executive order, to end what he calls the OPM rule of 2013. That was an executive order, of course, that undercut the Affordable Care Act's amendment, saying that members of Congress and their staff could not get healthcare and special subsidies unlike any other American. And he said, as soon as that is eliminated, Congress will move faster because they and their staff will not have special treatment. Is the President going to use his pen and get rid of the OPM order?\nMR. SPICER: I'll have to look at that. I know Secretary Price has been dealing with a lot of it. I know that's an OPM order. Secretary Price has been reviewing all of the necessary implementation, documents, and orders with respect to Obamacare. I know that he's working with Director Mulvaney. Director Mulvaney, I anticipate, will be here with you guys at some point, probably tomorrow, to talk about some reorganizing of government. That might be an appropriate time to talk to him specifically about that.\nDave.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. The list of judges that the President put out last year, saying these are the people I would consider nominating -- and you referred to earlier -- in the end, Democrats still tried to filibuster Judge Gorsuch. So what difference, from that perspective, did putting out that list make in the end?\nMR. SPICER: That's a great question. I think what it showed, first and foremost, is the President kept his word. The President put out a list of people and campaigned on it, and said, if you elect me, these are the type of justices that I will choose from. And they are originalists. They are going to read and interpret the Constitution as it was written and meant to be. And I think the American people, in a lot of cases -- if you look at exit polling -- voted for him in a lot of cases because of that.\nI think it shows that, again, whether or not you disagree or agree with the President, sometimes philosophically, he gets high marks for keeping his word. I think that means a lot, that he went out on a number of topics, including the type of justice that he would appoint, put it before the American people, allowed them to vote up or down at the ballot box. And it's an affirmation of the kind of justice that he wants, but it's also a continuation to know that the President is going to be someone who makes a pledge to the American people and keeps it.\nQ: He's going to obviously have other federal judges to nominate.\nMR. SPICER: I hope so.\nQ: What else did this process teach him? Anything?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think, from a political side, it was pretty obvious that you can disagree with Judge Gorsuch's judicial philosophy, but I think by every standard he was a very highly qualified justice. The American Bar Association rated him their highest. The people who have worked with him in the past, his judicial record in terms of the number of cases where he was in the mainstream and Democratic appointees sided with him. And I think it basically showed the President that trying to work Senate Democrats wasn't really -- was somewhat of a futile task; that these were people who made up their mind, by and large, regardless of who the person was, they were going to vote it down.\nSo that was probably the biggest lesson. But it also shows that when you've got the right individual, you've got someone who's eminently qualified, we're going to succeed in getting it done.\nBlake.\nQ: Sean, let me turn your attention to tax reform real quick. And I got a few others. There's a report out there that says the President has basically gone back to the drawing board as it relates to taxes. Is that accurate?\nMR. SPICER: No.\nQ: Or does he still -- what he put out there on the campaign trail, is that still the backbone of what he wants to see get done?\nMR. SPICER: Yeah, I mean, that's the backbone. But I think that what you're seeing is us going through this process of his economic team -- everyone from Secretary Mnuchin to Secretary Ross to Gary Cohn and others sitting down internally and beginning that process of meeting with groups that have been advocating for tax reform since 1986 -- kind of the ink of that one dried -- and starting to meet with outside groups, industry groups, individuals, members of Congress, to get their input. This is going to be a major undertaking, and I think we want to make sure that we listen, have their ideas and their input as we move forward. But this is the beginning phases of that process.\nQ: You mentioned Gary Cohn. He said on Friday that there's been this August deadline that Steve Mnuchin and others have talked about. On Friday, Gary Cohn suggested that August might not be the deadline. Is this timeline getting pushed at this point?\nMR. SPICER: Well, it's not getting pushed. I think it's getting -- obviously that still would be a great opportunity before they leave for August recess. But we're going to make sure that we do this right and we do it with the input of all of the individual groups and members of Congress that have had a longtime interest in doing this.\nAnd it is a big deal, right? You've got the ability for our businesses and industries to be more competitive in the global market, and then you want to make sure that you're providing middle-income tax relief that creates economic growth throughout the country.\nQ: Americans are filling out their tax forms right now for 2016. This time, next year, they're going to fill it out for 2017. Will they have a 2017 tax cut this time next year?\nMR. SPICER: I think middle-income Americans I hope have a tax cut by then.\nJeff.\nQ: Sean, during the campaign --\nMR. SPICER: Sorry, it's --\nQ: Sorry. You can go next. (Laughter.)\nMR. SPICER: Be careful with that. (Laughter.)\nQ: The President, then-candidate Trump, was pretty critical -- or, excuse me -- was pretty complimentary of President Putin. Now, after seeing how Russia has reacted in Syria, what's his view of President Putin now?\nMR. SPICER: I think it's always been the same, respectfully, which is that if we can get a deal -- we have a shared interest in, particularly in the area of ISIS, and if we can defeat them and if we can work with them on a plan to defeat them, then we're going to do it. But he's also said -- and I think sometimes people cut off part of the quote, which is if we can't work with them, then, okay.\nBut the President came into office to really focus on two fronts -- keeping our country safe, and growing our economy and putting people back to work. And I think if Russia or any other country can help us achieve those two goals either through market access or additional products and services from the United States into a major marketplace, but more importantly, how to keep our country safe through a combined effort to defeat something like ISIS, especially in a place like Syria where their planes are (inaudible) -- then I think we want to work with them.\nBut if we can't get a deal with them, then the President is not going to be disappointed. But he would like to do what he can to work with these individuals to make it happen.\nQ: Would he still describe him in the same way that he did several months ago as a leader who he (inaudible) than President Obama?\nMR. SPICER: I think we'll wait and see. We're 81 days in. I think Secretary Tillerson will have a lot of information after he meets with Foreign Secretary Lavrov.\nQ: Can I ask you one other question on trade?\nMR. SPICER: Yes.\nQ: You mentioned the 100 days that President and President of China agreed on. Did China offer to give U.S. concessions on beef exports and financial investments as part of that?\nMR. SPICER: Look, this is an initial working plan that they're going to try to hammer out what that 100 days looks like. And then they call them way stations -- like what are those stops between a 100 days and now that would be things that both sides would be looking at. And I think obviously beef exports and additional market access in China, intellectual property, the ability to have foreign ownership, especially in the services industry, is something that has been of a prize of U.S. exporters and industry for a long time. But it is something that is being hammered out as we go forward.\nSo the plan was to put together a plan, and there's a lot of pieces that both sides would like to see in there and these benchmarks between now and those 100 days. But that plan is something that they talked about putting together during the -- just over the day that they met together. And it is something that the counterparts are now going to continue to flesh out.\nSo there's a lot of topics that got put on the table. We're going to see how that works.\nJim.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. What is the status of the renegotiation of NAFTA? And what is the White House doing to treat NAFTA in U.S. interests? And is there a concern about getting it done before the Mexican elections heat up at the end of the year?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think the first thing with respect to trade is we need to have the Senate to approve Robert Lighthizer as the next U.S. Trade Representative. That's obviously -- USTR drives that. And so our focus is getting that done, and then we'll be ready to go. We still have an official 90-day notification that we have to give Congress, and so once we get Ambassador Lighthizer confirmed we'll be ready to probably announce a better work plan on that. But as of right now, that's not there.\nJeff.\nQ: I just wonder -- when Mr. Trump as a private citizen had a lot to say about Syria. One of the things he said that the President -- then President Obama -- needs to seek congressional approval. Some members of Congress believe he should as well. What is his plan to explain his strategy in a broader sense? And why does he not need congressional approval in this deal?\nMR. SPICER: I think Article 2 of the Constitution is pretty clear that when it's in the national interest of the country, the President has the full authority to act. He did that. He and his team spoke extensively to congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle that night to describe the action that was being taken forward. So I think we have fully fulfilled every obligation. But the power vested in Article 2 is very clear with the President's ability to act.\nQ: In terms of things happening here at the White House behind the scenes with his staff members, obviously there was some ideological and policy differences on this particular military action last week. Does the President believe, or do you believe, that this has been smoothed over in the short term, or there has been a long-term solution to the fighting between Steve Bannon, Jared Kushner and others?\nMR. SPICER: Are you talking specifically of Syria, or are you talking --\nQ: Specifically with Syria, there was a disagreement. But is this a short term fix to this problem, or do you believe, does the President believe, that there is a longer-team fix to this infighting that has really plagued the administration?\nMR. SPICER: Well, again, I'd say a couple things, Jeff. One is that a lot of this is, frankly, overblown. But number two is, the reason the President has brought this team together is all for a diverse set of opinions. He doesn't want a monolithical kind of thought process going through the White House. He wants a diverse set of opinions. He is the decider. He has people come in and give him a variety of options and plans. He went back and forth over that 72-hour period where he wanted additional options, additional explanations and questions answered. That's how he's going to deal.\nAnd so whether it's this, healthcare, tax reform, trade, he's got a divergent set of opinions here of experts. The idea isn't to have one set of thought and policy flowing through, it's to give the President the best advice as possible, but that once the President makes a decision, that the team is on board a hundred percent to make sure that we do what's in the best interest of the country and fulfill the agenda he's laid out.\nSo I don't -- I think the President wants to have a series of ideas and thoughts put forward to him. That's how he's going to make the best opinion -- best decision possible for this country.\nQ: It must have crossed a line if he said to work it out.\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think sometimes -- again, I'm not going to get into what happens internally, but I think sometime some things might spill out in the public more than other things. But there is always going to be a healthy debate internally on a variety of policy issues among the Cabinet, among the staff, to make sure that the President sees every option that's available, every opinion that he should weigh and counter before he makes a final decision.\n`It's just sometimes I think sometimes those discussions may come out a little bit more publicly than they do. But I think -- as I noted in the beginning, I thought there was a lot of overblown coverage of how it actually happened and what went down.\nQ: And on sticking with Steve Bannon --\nMR. SPICER: He's very confident in the team that he has, that they have an unbelievable amount of knowledge, and he believes the counsel that they all bring to the table.\nThank you guys very much. I'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 2:23 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2017-04-10", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer"}
{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "note": "The President spoke at 11:04 a.m. in the Rose Garden at the White House. In his remarks, Associate Justice Gorsuch referred to Vice President Michael R. Pence; and former Sen. Kelly A. Ayotte, in her advisory capacity leading the White House team that supervised Associate Justice Gorsuch's Senate confirmation process.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123726", "text": "The President. Thank you very much. Friends and distinguished guests, welcome to the White House. We are gathered here today for a truly momentous occasion in our democracy: the swearing-in of a United States Supreme Court justice.\nIn particular, I'm greatly honored to welcome to these grounds every sitting Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Welcome. Thank you.\nMr. Chief Justice and fellow Justices, it's a privilege to have you here, to join in this historic moment on this very beautiful spring day in the Rose Garden. Spring is really the perfect backdrop for this joyful gathering of friends, because, together, we are in a process of reviewing and renewing—and also rebuilding—our country. A new optimism is sweeping across our land, and a new faith in America is filling our hearts and lifting our sights.\nI'd also like to recognize Senator Cory Gardner—where's Cory? Cory Gardner. Mike Lee—where's Mike? He's around here someplace—thank you. And Mike Crapo. Good. Hi, Mike. Thank you very much and for all your work. Thank you. And although he could not be here today, I especially want to express our gratitude to Senator Mitch McConnell for all that he did to make this achievement possible. So thank you, Mitch.\nI'd also like to give my appreciation to Chairman Grassley for conducting such a fair and professional confirmation. Senator Grassley. Where is Senator Grassley? Thank you. Thank you, Senator. Finally, a profound thank you to Louise Gorsuch and to all of the Gorsuch family. Thank you. And, Louise, I've heard it firsthand, I know what a total inspiration you are to your husband and to your entire family. So thank you very much. Fantastic. Thank you very much.\nWe are here to celebrate history: the taking of the judicial oath by the newest member of the United States Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch. Justice Gorsuch, I just want to congratulate you and your entire family. It's something so special. In fact, I've always heard that the most important thing that a President of the United States does is appoint people—hopefully, great people like this appointment—to the United States Supreme Court. And I can say this is a great honor. And I got it done in the first 100 days—[laughter]—that's even nice. [Laughter] You think that's easy?\nThis ceremony has special meaning as Justice Gorsuch is filling the seat of one of the greatest Supreme Court judges in American history, and that's Antonin Scalia, who is a terrific—was a terrific judge and a terrific person. Justice Scalia was a patriot who revered our Constitution. He was beloved by many, very many, who are here today, and he is deeply missed by all of us.\nI want to, at this time, recognize his incredible wife Maureen, who I got to know very well over the last short period of time. And, Maureen, please stand up. Thank you very much. Thank you and your family. Thank you. Thank you, Maureen.\nAmericans are blessed to have in Neil Gorsuch a man who will, likewise, be a devoted servant of the law. Over the past 2 months, the American people have gotten to know, respect and truly admire our newest member of the United States Supreme Court. In Justice Gorsuch, they see a man of great and unquestioned integrity. They see a man of unmatched qualifications. And most of all—and most importantly—they see a man who is deeply faithful to the Constitution of the United States. He will decide cases based not on his personal preferences, but based on a fair and objective reading of the law.\nToday we have all three branches of Government represented at this event. It is a very special thing and a very special happening. And it's worth taking just a minute to remember what it all means.\nIn our Founders' incredible wisdom, they gave each branch of Government a different role in our great Republic. We have a Congress to write the laws on behalf of the people. We have a President to enforce those laws and defend our Nation. And we have a Supreme Court to apply and interpret the law in a fair and impartial manner when disagreements arise. The Founders separated power because they knew it was the best way to protect our citizens and keep our Constitution secure.\nJustice Gorsuch, you are now entrusted with the sacred duty of defending our Constitution. Our country is counting on you to be wise, impartial, and fair; to serve under our laws, not over them; and to safeguard the right of the people to govern their own affairs. I have no doubt you will rise to the occasion and that the decisions you will make will not only protect our Constitution today, but for many generations of Americans to come.\nIn just a moment, Justice Gorsuch will be sworn in by Justice Kennedy, a great man of outstanding accomplishment. Throughout his nearly 30 years on the Supreme Court, Justice Kennedy has been praised by all for his dedicated and dignified service. We owe him an enormous debt of gratitude, and I am honored that he is with us today.\nThis is a very, very special moment, because many years ago, a young Neil Gorsuch started his legal career as a law clerk to Justice Kennedy. You remember that, right? [Laughter] It is a fitting testament to Justice Kennedy's impact that, upon giving the oath to Justice Gorsuch, he will become the first-ever Supreme Court justice to serve with one of his former law clerks. That's sort of a big deal, isn't it? I sort of like that. That's sort of good. It has never happened before. That's pretty good. It also shows you have a lot of respect for this man. That's very good.\nWe're thrilled to share this historic moment with Justice Kennedy, with all of you here today, and with all Americans watching us at home.\nJustice Gorsuch, I again congratulate you and your entire family, and I wish God's blessings on your amazing journey ahead. I have no doubt you will go down as one of the truly great justices in the history of the United States Supreme Court.\nI now invite Justice Kennedy to say a few words. Thank you very much.\nSupreme Court Associate Justice Anthony M. Kennedy. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. Chief Justice, Justice Gorsuch, and my fellow adherents to the idea and the reality of the rule of law: As many of you know, there are two oaths that a member of the Federal judiciary must take. The first is the constitutional oath that so many of you are familiar with that applies to all three branches of the Government. The second oath is one that applies just to Federal judges.\nBoth of the oaths date from the founding of the Republican—of the Republic; the judicial oath dates from 1789. And both of these oaths remind us that we as a people are bound together, we as a people find our self-definition, our respect, our heritage, and our destiny in the Constitution. And so, Justice Gorsuch, there is one oath remaining for you to take—the judicial oath—before you may receive and accept your commission from the President of the United States.\nAre you ready, Justice Gorsuch, to take the oath?\nAssociate Justice Gorsuch. I am.\n[At this point, Associate Justice Kennedy administered the oath of office. Following the administration of the oath, Associate Justice Gorsuch made remarks, as follows.]\nAssociate Justice Gorsuch. I see before me so many to whom I owe so much. I know I would not be here today without your friendship and support. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart.\nI want to thank the President for nominating me and for the great confidence and trust he's reposed in me. I want to thank the Vice President for his constant encouragement and friendship throughout this process.\nIt's not possible to mention here everyone I should mention, but I'd be remiss if I didn't thank the President's Counsel, Don McGahn, and Mark Paoletta, the Vice President's Counsel, and every single person in the White House Counsel's Office for their tremendous and tireless support.\nI want thank Kelly Ayotte and my day-to-day team—[laughter]—for their humor, for their sage advice, for their faith, as we spent months and so many miles trooping together through the Senate complex. I want to thank every single person—and there are so many—in the White House and the Department of Justice who worked through so many late nights and long weeks on my behalf.\nI want to thank, too, Senator McConnell and Senator Grassley and their excellent teams for their support and leadership. And I must thank my former law clerks and my dear friends who gave so much of themselves so selflessly through these last 3 months. You are dear to me. This is truly your doing, and this is your day.\nI wish I could mention each of you by name, but you know who you are, and you know your names are etched in my heart forever.\nThis process has reminded me just how outrageously blessed I am in my law clerks, and my family, and my friends. And I hope that I may continue to rely on each of you as I face this new challenge.\nTo my former colleagues and the wonderful staff of the 10th Circuit, I thank you for your faithful service and your friendship over so many years. To my new colleagues and the staff of the Supreme Court, thank you for the very warm welcome. I look forward to many happy years together.\nAnd I cannot tell you how honored I am to have here today my mentor, Justice Kennedy, administer the judicial oath, a beautiful oath, as he did for me 11 years ago when I became a Circuit judge. To the Scalia family, I won't ever forget that the seat I inherit today is that of a very, very great man. To my wife Louise and my daughters Emma and Bindi, thank you for your perseverance and your patience, your courage and your love. I simply could not have attempted this without you. And to the American people, I am humbled by the trust placed in me today. I will never forget that to whom much is given, much will be expected. And I promise you that I will do all my powers permit to be a faithful servant of the Constitution and laws of this great nation.\nThank you.", "timestamp": "2017-04-10", "title": "Remarks at a Swearing-In Ceremony for Neil M.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123854", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n12:10 P.M. EDT\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: This briefing today is about a declassified -- or it's a summary based on declassified information about the attacks on the 4th of April. So this is on background only. Attribution is senior White House official, and it will be embargoed until the end of the brief. And I'll have each of my colleagues come up here and introduce themselves.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: My understanding is you'd just like to ask some questions. So I'm happy to go through some details of the narrative, or just take questions incoming, if you have them.\nQ: Do you mind walking through some of the narrative related to the chemical weapons attack -- what Russia knew perhaps beforehand, or during, or after, and some of the reporting that has come out about a Russian drone, et cetera?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So let me start with the narrative of what we think happened in the attack. And let me tell you, to start with -- what we've done here is we've declassified a lot of intelligence with great thanks to our colleagues in the intelligence community so that we can be very forthcoming with you about the amount that we know about this attack and why we believe the Russian and Syrian narratives are false. And we think it's really important for you to understand the depth of information that we have that supports this narrative.\nI would say that since we started coming forward, in the immediate wake of the attack, all of the way through to today, we continued to get additional information. And the information we get about this attack continues to be clear and consistent with our understanding of the attack, starting on the day of the attack, April 4th, and working all the way through today.\nAnd I would say we, even as recently as last night, for today, declassified additional information that, again, lends additional weight and credibility to the narrative I want to share with you today.\nThe information we have downgraded and declassified includes a wide body of open-source material, both social media accounts. It include open-source videos, reporting, open-source imagery, et cetera, as well as our own geospatial intelligence, our signals intelligence, and it include physiological samples of victims of the attack. And again, all of that tells a very clear and consistent story about what we think happened.\nSo to be clear, based on the pro-opposition social media reporting, those reports indicate that the chemical attack began in Khan Sheikhun at about 6:55 local time on April 4th. Our information makes quite clear that the attack came from SU-22 fixed-wing aircraft out of the Shayrat airfield, which is regime-controlled. These aircraft were in the vicinity of Khan Sheikhun for about 20 minutes before reports of the chemical attack came out, and they vacated the area shortly after the attack. And I think some of you have seen the information that we shared previously about the tracks of those aircraft that came out of the Khan Sheikhun airfield -- or out of the Shayrat airfield, lingered over Khan Sheikhun, and came back to that airfield.\nIn addition, we have information that suggests that personnel historically associated with the chemical weapons program were at Shayrat airfield in late March preparing for this attack. On the dates surrounding the attack, and the day of the attack, they were again present at that airfield. Hours after the attack, there were hundreds of accounts of victims of the particular chemical weapons attack.\nThe victimology, the symptomology of those victims is very consistent with nerve agent and sarin exposure. And now, as I will note, we do have physiological samples from a number of victims that confirm sarin exposure. The symptomology was quite consistent. We saw miosis, or pin-point pupils. We see frothing at the noise and mouth, twitching. All of those are consistent with nerve agent. They are not consistent with chlorine.\nAlso, the victimology shows that those people don't have other wounds or injuries that would be consistent with a conventional attack.\nI would note, as well, that another clear symptom of sarin or nerve agent exposure is that the secondary responders also started to have symptoms consistent with sarin exposure. And those were the people that were there that took in the victims, that were touching them, that were removing their clothing. Some of those also passed out and had other symptoms of sarin exposure.\nSo by about 12:15 local time, the open source was very clear: It showed images of dead children of varying ages. And then we started to get accounts of the hospital, where some of those victims were being taken, being bombed at about 1:10 p.m. local. It showed, again, victims flooding to that particular hospital before there was a conventional attack against that hospital.\nThe impact craters that we have in imagery and open source show conventional weapons being used around that hospital, not chemical weapons there. The other information we have shows that leakage around the actual weapon that we think the sarin came from, not explosive debris that we would expect if it had been an explosive munition that it hit chemicals or something that would be consistent with a Russian attack. And again, we think that is not true.\nQ: Sorry, can you just go over that one --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah, I'll come back through it. Let me hit the Russian narrative all the way through, and I'll help you there.\nWe also think -- some people have alleged that videos had been fabricated, that a lot of this information had been fabricated. The absolute massive data we have, and all the different vehicles we've gotten it from -- open-source videos, to victim accounts, to imagery, to signals intelligence -- it's just too massive for really any intelligence organization to fabricate in that short a period of time. We just think that's not a feasible explanation.\nAnd then we did confirm that some of the videos that were shot of the account, we did go to independently confirm that the times at which those videos were taken were consistent with the times of the attack and not from prior footage of other attacks, other places.\nSo let me walk through a little bit -- and, I would also note the World Health Organization came up with similar analysis on April 5th. It, too, felt that the victims had been exposed to nerve agent based on the same kind of symptomology along the board. And we do expect that as others continue -- and we would expect we are looking forward to the OPCW's fact-finding mission, looking into this event itself, and we think it's really important for them to get out there, for them to have access to the site of the attack, to the airfield, to other places that might be affiliated. And we expect that any samples they find will again be consistent with what we've found so far.\nIn terms of the Russian narrative -- and I'll get back to your question about them and the inconsistency -- across the board, starting in 2013 and then since, we've seen both the Russians and the Syrians have a very clear campaign to try to obfuscate the nature of attacks, the attackers, and what has happened in any particular incident.\nThey've thrown out a bunch of potential agents, a bunch of potential responsible or accountable parties. And, often, their own information is inconsistent with their own narrative.\nThey certainly have dismissed the allegations of a chemical weapons attacking Khan Sheikun. They called it a \"prank of a provocative nature.\" But again, we don't think it's remotely possible for the Syrians or the Russians to have fabricated this much information so fast and so consistently on this attack.\nI'd also note that we've, of course, got extensive media observers and we have our own intelligence information. And the intelligence information and the accounts we've gotten from our partners, again, suggest very similar outcomes in this attack.\nThey noted, as I said -- the Russians did -- that this was a regime attack against a munitions depot, and that perhaps that terrorists had been holding chemical munitions that were attacked and then exploded from there. As I noted, we think that the information is inconsistent with that narrative. There is, as I said, leakage, and not in this hospital or this area where they said a building was attacked, but in a separate place where we can see the leakage from that munition. It is inconsistent with where the Russians would say that this attack happens and where the gas came from. And similarly, again, it's leakage; it does not show explosive dissemination of the chemicals. And we don't see a building, again, with that chemical residue we would expect if the Russian narrative was true.\nQ: When you say leakage, that's how a chemical weapon is supposed to work. It's deliberate leakage?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Right. Yeah, absolutely.\nQ: It's dispersed.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: It's dispersed. But there's always leakage around the outside, or almost always leakage around the outside that shows that the material inside has leaked out as it disseminates.\nQ: Rather than it was bombed and then exploded.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Exactly. Exactly.\nQ: Do you believe it was only one munition that was dropped on the 4th?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So I don't have details on the number of munitions here for you, but I think it's fair to say we think it's at least one munition. And we have one particular munition that we've seen via overhead that we think is a munition that contains sarin.\nQ: How do you explain the Russian drone at the hospital?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So I don't think we have information for you today to talk about the Russian drone or any other information on the Russians, per se. We just want to walk right through the narrative here. We're still looking into what we think the intelligence community assessment or other is about Russian knowledge of involvement, et cetera. And I'm sure we'll come forward with more information on that, if we have it.\nQ: (Inaudible) on the question foreknowledge of Russia.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We don't have information on that, per se. I think it's clear that the Russians are trying to cover up what happened there.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I'll say we're still looking into that, into the particulars of that question. And there's not a consensus on our side about the extent or how to interpret the information that we have and continue to get.\nHowever, what we do know from looking at a history of the Russian military and the Syrian military operating together for the better part of two years now closely, since the Russian advisory mission and assistance mission began in earnest in 2015. And in addition, two militaries that have a decades-long support relationship. Based on that historical pattern, we've seen that these two militaries operate very closely, even down to an operational and tactical level.\nAnd so considering the fact that there were Russian forces co-located with Syrian forces at the Shayrat airfield, in addition to many other installations -- many other Syrian regime installations around the country -- we do think that it is a question worth asking the Russians about how is it possible that their forces were co-located with the Syrian forces that planned, prepared, and carried out this chemical weapons attack at the same installation, and did not have foreknowledge.\nQ: So just to be clear, the attack that you mentioned against the hospital, which you said was aimed at covering up the initial chemical weapons attack, was that carried out by munitions that are linked to Russia?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: No, we don't have information on that today.\nQ: Is it the assessment at this point, though -- can you say the least that -- and you spoke to this a little, and, [senior administration official], I want to get your take -- that the Russians tried to cover up the chemical weapons attack? Do you believe that that is the case?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: No, we don't know the tactical intentions of the Russians on that day on any operations that they may have been involved in.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So what I would say, in terms of cover-up -- just in terms of cover-up to follow there, I'm talking about the absolute -- coming out afterwards to say it was terrorists, to say that they're --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: The cover-up is the --\nQ: (Inaudible) stockpile --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: No, I would say --\nQ: -- you would say is absolutely an attempt to cover up a --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: To cover up Syrian regime culpability in a chemical weapons attack.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: The cover-up is the disinformation that has happened from the day of the attack to today.\nQ: In your estimation, does this action show an increase in Russian involvement? Or is it has always been with Russia?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: What I'd like to do right now is get back to going through the narrative, and then we'll take more of the questions. If you can just finish going through the --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah, if I can just finish why we think the Russian narrative is false.\nSo getting back to why we think the Russian narrative is false -- Moscow, as I noted, said that the release of chemicals was caused by the terrorist -- a strike on a terrorist ammunition depot, but a Syrian military source told Russian state media on April 4th that regime forces had not carried out any strike in Khan Sheikhun, which contradicted Russia's claim directly.\nAn open-source video shows where we believe the chemical munition landed -- again, not on a facility with weapons, but in the middle of a street in the northern section of Khan Sheikhun. The imagery of that site from April 6th, after the allegation, shows a crater in the road that corresponds to the open-source video, so we can track to where we think that particular munition was.\nThe Russians also allege that the terrorists -- this was a bombing on a terrorist ammunition depot. We do not assess and have not assessed that ISIS or other terrorists in the area have sarin. So while ISIS is using sulfur mustard -- and we've documented that quite well, and certainly oppose chemical weapons use by any actor, state or non-state, and are working, of course, to be able to push back ISIS chemical use as well -- it is quite clear to us that in this case this is not a terrorist holding of sarin or terrorist use of sarin. But we do know that the Syrian regime has sarin, that it used it in the 2013 attack, and there are outstanding questions from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons that make quite clear that Syria has not fully come clean on the locations, facilities, types of agents, or personnel involved with its chemical weapons program, causing us additional questions on what's there.\nIn terms -- is there more you want me to hit from the Russian piece?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Go ahead.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I think it's a clear pattern of deflecting blame. We've seen this in multiple accounts, including when the OPCW-U.N. joint investigative mechanism came out with reports in August and October of last year identifying Syria as culpable in three chemical weapons attacks. In these three cases these were chlorine attacks. They were from a different airfield here. The United States did come out with designations on personnel affiliated with that attack on that airfield to condemn that use, as well.\nThis is quite concerning, given that the Russians were part of setting up the deal by which Syria was supposed to give up its chemical weapons. It was party to the deal to create the Joint Investigative Mechanism to investigate these attacks. The JIM did come forward with clear attribution calls, and Russia has refused to accept those along the way.\nAnd I think I would leave it there on the narrative.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Okay. So stepping back to some of your earlier questions, we're going to open this up again to questions. But to be clear, you're going to receive a 3.5-page background document at the end of this that's going to run you through this narrative that will be very detailed.\nOne thing I want to address is the questions come up before. We had a lot of questions about a hospital, about munitions use on that hospital, about who was responsible for bombing that hospital. So, at this time, what you'll see in this document is a discussion of the Russian use of information and disinformation for obfuscatory purposes in an attempt to shift blame or to transfer blame away from the Assad regime, to prevent counter-narratives about U.S. actions. That's what we're addressing and discussing today.\nWe don't have any comment right now on who may have been involved in bombing that hospital and why and how. So that piece, just to be clear -- because there was some confusion about that -- we're talking -- when we talked about the Russian role, we talked about the obfuscatory information campaign, not the other thing that you asked on. We don't have a comment on that at this time.\nAnd I'll open it up to questions.\nQ: Have you exchanged any information with the Russians? Because it's easy -- they say one thing, you say another thing. Why don't exchange the information, compare it?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, so we've come forward with a lot of the information we have publicly already. This is another attempt to come forward publicly with that information.\nWe have had conversations at a variety of levels with the Russians, as well, to explain to them what we understand about the attack, and ask them to be helpful to our efforts to get the Syrians to come clean. We have not done a full intelligence exchange, and I'm not sure that's particularly likely at this point.\nQ: I think I heard you mention signals intelligence. Do you have any SIGINT that actually indicates any level of collusion between Russia and Syria, or any indication that Assad himself ordered this strike?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So we don't have any comment on that right now.\nQ: On the question of the delivery mechanism for the sarin, are you sure that the (inaudible) was Syrian air force?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We are confident, as I noted, that the SU-22 took off from the Shayrat airfield, which is regime-controlled, and dropped the strike, and we believe the Syrian regime is culpable.\nQ: Do you have any details about the origin of the sarin?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We don't have additional details on the origin of the sarin. It's well-documented that the Syrians produce sarin as part of their chemical weapons program. They were supposed to, of course, have destroyed -- declared and destroyed all of that agent.\nQ: You had talked about the movement, in late March, indicating that personnel were moved to this base to prepare these weapons. Do you have any intelligence that indicates these types of personnel were moved to other airbases within Syria, that they may be preparing more chemical weapons attacks in the future?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So I can tell you that we take very seriously the possibility that Syria may have additional agents elsewhere. We are working with our intelligence community to understand every piece of information they have about where such munitions might be located, who might be ahold of them, and I can tell you that that's going to be part of what we try to figure out and where we go from here.\nQ: Do you believe that the Assad regime still owns a large stock of chemical weapons, especially sarin and the nerve gas, or is it the small (inaudible) amount that they use, like we saw in (inaudible)?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So I don't think we have any comment on how much we think is left. As I noted, we're working with our intelligence community to figure out what it is. But our clear goal right now, and the goal of this strike, was, in large part, to deter further chemical weapons uses by the Syria regime.\nQ: In the end, is there any indication that this action is an increase in Russian involvement?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: No, I don't think it's -- I don't think it indicates an increase. I mean, in the whole -- let's say, in the whole environment of operational cooperation between the Russian military and Syrian military, the level of cooperation is quite high, so we've seen. We haven't seen that peak or drop. It's been steady.\nQ: So following, then this isn't a provocative action aimed at the U.S., per se?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Don't see any indication of that. There were clear operational reasons, we think, probably, why they employed the weapons.\nQ: My question is about what President Putin said this morning, suggesting, according to him, the rebels were preparing other attacks around -- outside Damascus. Can you give us any insight on that, and your view of those statements?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Of chemical attacks?\nQ: Yes. Yeah, well, I don't think it was -- I don't think there was a specification.\nQ: He specifically said that there will be other provocations like this one that -- and then the General Staff of the Russian Forces -- armed forces -- already said that the rebels, whom you call rebels, are already bringing in the substances.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I would just say -- so to be clear, we are very confident that terrorists, or non-state actors, did not commit this particular attack. We are confident as well that these terrorists or rebels don't have sarin, so they would not be able to conduct a follow-on attack of this sort, given especially that they didn't conduct the first one.\nQ: Given the fact that chemical weapons were used in this attack, do you have a sense of whether Syria got rid of any of its chemical weapons -- where that stockpile stands at this point? And have you thought about next steps in terms of trying to get rid of it?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So we do know that Syria gave up a huge amount of its chemical weapons -- over 1,000 tons of chemical weapons. They declared them. And we had, through and incredible international effort with our partners, removed those chemical weapons and destroyed them.\nNevertheless, Syria -- it is clear that Syria's declaration was not complete. The OPCW has additional questions, and we look to the OPCW and the entire international community to support the OPCW's effort to press Syria for answers to the outstanding questions, to get them to declare any agent, facilities, personnel, or others involved in the chemical weapons program, and most certainly get rid of anything that's left.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Okay, we're going to hold for a second. [Senior administration official] is going to make a quick point here, and then we'll jump back into Q&A.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah, I think it's important to understand the context in which these weapons were employed, what motivated the regime -- the fact that they were losing in a particularly important area, and that's what drove it.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah, so in the middle of March, opposition forces launched an offensive from Southern Idlib province toward the major city of Hama, which is a strategic city in Syria. It's Syria's third city, and it's also the location of a key Syrian regime airbase that has been crucial for the regime and the forces that support it for projecting power from central Syria, both along the western spine, from Aleppo down to the south, and also further to the east to support operations in Palmyra. So that is an airbase that the regime had to calculate that it could not lose.\nThe opposition offensive approach was able to penetrate to within just a couple of miles of that strategic airbase and also threatened the Hama population center within just a few miles.\nAt that point, the regime we think calculated that with its manpower spread quite thin, trying to support both defensive operations and consolidation operations in Aleppo and along that north-south spine of western Syria, and also trying to support operations which required it to send manpower and resources east toward Palmyra, we believe that the regime probably calculated at that point that chemical weapons were necessary in order to try to make up for the manpower deficiency.\nThat's why we saw, we believe, multiple attacks of this nature against locations that the regime probably determined were support areas for the opposition forces that were near Hama -- for example, in the town of Al-Tamanah and then in the town of Khan Sheikhun, both of which are in what would be, in military terms, the rear area for the opposition forces that were on the front line.\nSo we believe certainly that there was an operational calculus that the regime and perhaps its Russian advisors went through in terms of the decision-making.\nQ: You said there was an operational reason for this attack.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Correct.\nQ: So just to clarify what you just said, this was an attack on civilians, but your understanding is that these civilian areas were seen as providing some sort of operational support for the opposition forces, which is what they're --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes. Now, I don't mean -- I don't mean that that means that the munitions were aimed at some sort of military capability. What I --\nQ: They were aimed at civilians.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: They were clearly aimed at areas that were most likely civilian areas. However, what I mean is that they were most likely intended to create pressure in what was deemed a rear area for those opposition forces that were fighting.\nQ: So understanding that, just a quick follow-up on that, is there anything about the timing, why this took place now -- or when it did?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: In terms of the timing?\nQ: So you explained to us why you think they chose to attack where they did. Why did they do it then?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, if you look at sort of the punch-counterpunch of opposition and regime forces that are fighting in the vicinity of Hama, yes, you can see that -- in that context, you can see that the chemical weapons attacks seem -- could fit within the flow of a punch-counterpunch -- operational punch-counterpunch.\nQ: You said just a second ago, multiple attacks of this nature. So multiple sarin attacks, not just (inaudible)?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So it's a multiple chemical weapons attacks. So we think that the regime has consistently used chemical weapons over time, not necessarily all sarin, to be able to fill conventional voids in its ability to reach the opposition.\nQ: -- the context of your colleague's conversation with us about this particular one, so I'm just trying to clarify if they're all sarin attacks, or just the one in Khan Sheikhun, which you have established with your high degree of confidence.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So we would say that there are more than 200 allegations of regime chemical use since 2013, when Syria promised to give up its chemical weapons. We assess that many of those are credible. In terms of what we've been able to say right now, at least one of those is sarin, and we're continuing to look into --\nQ: Khan Sheikhun, correct?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: It's Khan Sheikhun, right.\nQ: With all of this confirmation that you have today, how are you employing the world community, to include the U.N., as it relates to what's happening with the punch-counterpunch? And also with the collusion with Russia and Syria together, how are you employing them? And also is this clarification and confirmation ramping up efforts against Syria?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So I'll start, and then I'm going to let these guys follow on.\nIn terms of the chemical weapons piece of this, it's incredibly important that we speak with one voice at the United Nations and at the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. We need to speak with a clear message: That chemical weapons use of any kind, by any actor, is absolutely intolerable. That is our goal, and we need to do everything we can, collectively, to make sure that comes across clearly.\nWe're working with all of our partners, and we've made this message clear to the Russians as well, and will continue to do so, that we believe it's in no state's interest that any actor uses chemical weapons.\nQ: Support of additional forces, especially now that you believe to think that they have more agents left, be it sarin or what have you --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So we're still working through our partners. We have to get through U.N. and OPCW this week. We're continuing engagement there, and then we'll work with the international community. Really important is going to be for the fact-finding mission at the OPCW to do its job, to turn over any information that it has to the Joint Investigative Mechanism so that we have an outside body confirm, I think, is what they will do, what we already very strongly believe -- that the Syrian regime is behind this attack.\nAnd again, I don't think there's evidence to the contrary at all, but we need to let the international community -- and empower those mechanisms of the international community to do their jobs. And our hope is that that will lend additional weight to what we've already talked here about.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We're going to let my colleague set up there. And do you want to follow on with that?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: No, no, that's fine.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Quickly, we're going to end here. But what I'd like to say on this is it's also -- you guys have asked about this several times. Speaking with one voice is what we just said. This is an opportunity. We have a clear, concise and definitive analysis here. We understand what happened there with a very high degree of confidence. And this is an opportunity, going back to an earlier question, for the Russians to choose to stop the disinformation campaign and make the commitment to accept what happens and work forward to eliminate WMDs from Syria together.\nAnd that's it, we're going to leave it there. Thank you. The document will be handed out. Thank you for being here. And this is on background. I'm going to finish off -- on background, senior White House officials, embargoed until we walk out of the room. Document is coming to you.\nEND 12:40 P.M.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123855", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n4:04 P.M. EDT\nMR. SPICER: As I mentioned earlier today, we're going to do a briefing on the record, off camera. OMB Director Mulvaney is going to walk you through the guidance that has been issued to departments and agencies throughout the government following up on the President's executive order with respect to reorganizing government.\nHe will walk through that, take your questions at the end. There's sort of a memo that he has provided to the different departments and agencies that we'll give you guys a copy of at the end. And then let us know if you have any further questions.\nSo without further ado, Director Mulvaney.\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Thanks, Sean. Thank you all for coming out. Here's what's getting ready to happen. Tomorrow, in the morning, we will be releasing our guidance related to the executive order on the government restructuring. Why should anybody care about that? This marks a couple of different things.\nFirst of all, it's a major accomplishment for the administration in the first 100 days. It's something we said we were going to do on day one, and we're following through well within the end of the 100-day period. More immediately, perhaps, the government hiring freeze will end with the release of this guidance. That does not mean -- and I've made this very clear to all of the agency heads, the deputy chiefs, et cetera, for the last couple of days -- that does not mean that the agencies will be free to hire willy-nilly.\nWhat we're doing tomorrow is replacing the across-the-board hiring freeze that we put into place on day one in office, and replacing it with a smarter plan, a more strategic plan, a more surgical plan. And what that means specifically is that, consistent with the President's priorities in the budget, certain agencies will end up hiring more people. Other agencies will end up paring their FTEs even greater than they would have had during the hiring freeze.\nSo we're going from this sort of across-the-board hiring freeze. That's not unusual for any new management team to come in -- to put into place when they come into an organization, whether it's the private sector or a government. Not unusual for a new management team to come in and say, look, stop hiring, let us figure out what's going on, we'll get acclimated and then we'll put into place something that's more practicable and smarter. And that's what this is. So you'll see this across-the-board ban tomorrow, and replaced with a smarter approach.\nTo the larger issue, the government reorg is probably the biggest story that nobody is talking about. Yes, we talk about healthcare; yes, we talk about taxes; yes, we talk about infrastructure -- and all of those are extraordinarily critical to rebuilding the country, making America great again, as the President has said. This is something that goes much deeper and to the very structure of government.\nThis is trying to do something that has never been done before. The executive branch of government has never been rebuilt. It has grown organically over the course of the last 240 years, and the President of the United States has asked all of us in the executive branch to start from scratch, a literal blank piece of paper and say, if you're going to rebuild the executive branch, what would it look like.\nOne of the things we're doing for the first time ever, we think, is soliciting a lot of input from outside. You go to the website, the WhiteHouse.gov website and see a -- what I'm told is not a completely terrible -- I thought it was awful -- video that I made on there, soliciting input from individuals -- like to say, look, if you've had a contact with a federal government that you think could go better, tell us about it. If you're an academic and you've got an idea on how to fix the government, tell us how to do it, give us the ideas. So we've got a website set up for that.\nWe met this morning with CEOs from all across the nation and said, look, we're trying to do something that's never been done, we're trying to rebuild the executive branch of government, give us some ideas. By the way, they did. And one of the ideas I took away from that meeting this morning was a suggestion from the group of business leaders that says, look, why don't you restructure the government in terms of the functions that it performs. Instead of following some organically created guidelines over the course of the last two centuries or instead of following the 12 appropriations committees on the Hill, go and look at the functions.\nDoes the government want to be in the business of trade? Okay, then let's go find all of the functions of government that deal with trade and put it in one place. The best example I can think of is workforce training, and the number I have -- always stuck in my head -- is we have 43 different workforce training programs spread across at least 13 different agencies.\nNow, there's a rule in the private sector which is that if everybody is responsible, nobody is responsible. And that's what we face right now all too often in the executive branch. If the President, for example, wants to know why the federal government workforce training programs aren't functioning as best as they possibly can, there's no one person he can turn to and say, why is that, and shouldn't we be able to fix that. And that's one of the things that we'll be looking for.\nWe think at the end of the day this leads to a government that is dramatically more accountable, dramatically more efficient, and dramatically more effective, following through on the very promises the President made during the campaign and that he put into place on day one.\nThe schedule, by the way, is that the agencies now have I think until -- is it September? June?\nAIDE: June preliminary, September final.\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: So June they'll come back with -- we've gone out to the agencies with this and say, why don't you, by the way, you give you your ideas on how you can improve your agency. If you've always had an idea why NASA should be in the Department of Agriculture, now is your time to speak up. Okay, this is a blank piece of paper, and we ask all the agencies to come back to us. So between June and September, we'll be collecting that data from the agencies. And then, in September, we'll be starting to go back to the President and say, look, here are some of the ideas with a goal towards putting these things into place roughly 11 months from today.\nAnd with that, I'd be happy to take any questions. Yes.\nAIDE: I just want to remind everyone that this is embargoed until 11 p.m. Folks that are on the phone and in the other room, this is on the record, of course, but --\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Embargoed until 11:00 tonight, right? Thank you. Yes, ma'am.\nQ: You made some comments yourself -- you mentioned the jurisdictional challenges. What is the President hoping to propose in the way of legislative changes to Congress? Because the statutory constrictions are considerable for any President, whether it's this one or his predecessors, to make these change.\nAnd then the second thing is, is any of this going to be built into the budget? Would you make a proposal based on the budget description of what the President would envision?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Yeah, to the second question first -- yes, this will -- what grows out of this will be hardwired into the 2019 budget, which begins in September. One of the reasons those dates need to sync up is that when the agencies come back to us, when we're sort of halfway through this process, we have the first ideas, you will start to see those filter through to our 2019 budget. Believe it or not, the fiscal year 2019 budget really begins in earnest September of 2017. So \"yes\" is the second answer to your question.\nRegarding statutory versus executive authority, it's an excellent question, and one of the reasons that this is so difficult to do is that you just can't wave a magic wand in the Oval Office and do these things. There will be certain things for which we will need the legislative authority. We don't know what those are yet because we don't know what the final plan looks like, but certainly we're hopeful to be able to have congressional buy-in to try and get some of this accomplished.\nQ: And can I just add: What makes you optimistic that lawmakers, who obviously are used to and proceed in their jurisdictions, get with their constituents?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Yeah, well, a couple different things. I think they probably are as interested -- they're frustrated as everybody else is, as every other citizen is, as to how poorly the federal government can function, how inefficient it is. They probably have as much interest in finding the savings that may come from some of this as any other citizen is.\nAnd at the end of the day, we're really not taking away any of their jurisdictional authority. We may be restructuring it. We may be saying, look, there's certain things we don't think the federal executive branch needs to do. But we're not going to them and saying, Congress can't do this anymore. So I don't think we'll be stepping on any toes.\nAnd I also think it's important to note that this is really the first administration that has made this a priority in a really, really long time. I know that President Clinton may have tried, and President Reagan may have tried, but this is -- again, as evidenced by the fact that we did this on day one -- clearly a priority of this administration, and we hope Congress will get that message as well.\nYes, ma'am.\nQ: Just three quick questions for you. Can you get specific on -- you talk about agencies affected with the hiring freeze getting un-instated as you put in this more surgical plan. What agencies do you foresee having the most job cuts now or job additions, as you discussed, sort of how that is restructured?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Sure. And again, you could just sort of go line by line in the budget. So I'll give you one of each, which is I think everybody acknowledges, given the proposed reductions to the Environmental Protection Agency in the budget, they would have to reduce the size of their workforce, and it's up to them to sort of come up with ideas on how to do that and effectively put the President's priorities into play. At the other end of spectrum, clearly you would expect the DOD and probably the Veterans Administration to get larger.\nQ: I want to follow up on Alexis's question. Who are your partners in Congress? Who have you identified that you're working with right now on the other side?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Everybody, at this point.\nQ: Is there anybody specifically that you are in discussions with now?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: We have been talking to appropriators, but that's been part of the 2017 -- so they know this is coming. But we have not sat down and said, look, this is what we want to do because we don't know what we want to do yet. So it's sort of hard to go to Congress and say, do this, we need to restructure -- we want you to consider restructuring this piece of legislation, this piece of authorizing legislation that says -- there's probably statute.\nI'll give an example. Please -- and this is an example. This is not a pre-cooked notion, all right? But we're fairly certain there's a statute that requires the NNSA, which deals with the nuclear weapons, to put that in the Department of Energy, okay? We may decide -- and emphasis on \"may\" -- decide, look, does that really make sense anymore? We know why it happened in the '40s and the '50s, but today, would it make sense, maybe, to have that in the Department of Defense? That would take some type of congressional authority to do that. We're not trying to ram it down their throats. We try and sell it to them just like we're trying to sell it to everybody else.\nQ: You've mentioned President Reagan, President Clinton -- they tried and failed to do what you are trying to do. Why should this administration think they're going to have a different outcome?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Let me try and give a serious answer to that question. This is really important to the President. And I wasn't around the Clinton administration, I don't remember the Reagan administration, but I can tell you that this is a big part of draining the swamp. We focus on things like getting lobbyists out of the process, and the five-year ban, and all that. And that's certainly part of the draining the swamp. But really what you're talking about doing is restructuring Washington, D.C., and that is how you drain the swamp.\nSo the President uses different words. He doesn't use the words \"restructuring government,\" \"reorganizing government.\" He uses the words \"drain the swamp.\" But that's what this is. So this is a centerpiece of his campaign and a centerpiece of his administration.\nYes, ma'am.\nQ: Thank you so much. Could you tell me your views on this part of this government reorganization, if you think we need fewer regional offices across the United States? And could you comment -- and I believe there is actually a plan being discussed in the background to reduce the number of EPA offices around the country. So maybe this is part of a bigger process to reduce all the regions? Or is this just for the EPA?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: I'm not dodging your question, but I'm going to tell you that it depends. There may be certain agencies that come back to us and say, you know what, we need fewer regional offices because we think our services can be provided more effectively by having fewer but larger offices. At the same time, there may be more -- there may be other agencies that come back to us and say, look, we'll really be more efficient if we have smaller offices spread -- because the way we provide services, we need to be closer to those places, so we need more but smaller offices. So it's hard to pain with a broad brush.\nQ: So can we just focus maybe on the EPA since that's the one going -- to undergo probably the biggest reduction in personnel? I have been informed that there actually is discussion on this point. If you could comment on it --\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: I can't because I --\nQ: -- that that is one place where the reductions --\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: I can't because I don't have that information. So again, it will be up to Mr. Pruitt to come up -- Secretary Pruitt -- administrator? Administrator Pruitt to come back with certain ideas and so forth.\nQ: Do you have a ballpark, at least, on total number of jobs that will be cut, total number of jobs that will be added? And then whether there will be a net reduction or a net increase in the federal workforce?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: I don't know the answer to the first two questions in terms of the total up and the total down. But I think it probably goes without saying that, net, we think we can run the government more efficiently than the previous administration can, and we think we can run the government with fewer people than the previous administration had.\nQ: Can you give me any sense of the scale of net?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: No.\nQ: Okay.\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Sorry.\nYes, ma'am.\nQ: Okay, and then just to follow up on Hallie's question. Is there anything that's in tomorrow -- aside from the budget blueprint with specific agencies, specifically saying, we want you to hire X many people or reduce this many people?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Yes, what kicks in tomorrow is what we call the smart hiring plan, okay? Right now if you are the Department of Energy, you haven't been able to hire anybody because of the freeze that we put in place on day one. As soon as the guidance goes out -- stop me if I'm wrong on this -- but as soon as the guidance goes out, what we expect the Department of Energy to do -- along with all the other agencies -- is look at that guidance and say, okay, here are the President's priorities as contained in the budget; it seems like the President wants us to beef up this particular operation at the Department of Energy and reduce our emphasis on this particular department -- or organization within the Department of Energy. So they would hire more over here and fewer over here.\nSo what the guidance really does is tell them, look to the budget blueprint and fashion your hiring and the paring down of your workforce consistent with the budget.\nQ: Does the guidance include specific numbers, though, saying, we don't want X many or --\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: No.\nQ: Hi, thank you very much. Two quick things. Could you talk a little bit about the mechanism to do this? In others words, are you talking -- it seems like the budget cuts that have been outlined -- the President and many agencies, not just the EPA -- would involve reduction in forces. This is a long, drawn-out process. There's also buyouts, there's also early retirement. Could you talk a little more in depth than you have about how you expect that to happen? Because you can't just get rid of federal employees all that easily.\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Right. And I think it's going to -- again, I don't want to look like I'm dodging the question, but you've asked a very broad question across a very large organization. So the answer is going to be, really, it varies. There are going to be some places where they have the ability to reduce size immediately and they may be called upon to do that in order to line up with the President's priorities. There may be other places where they don't have that flexibility, and they'll have to figure out a way over the course of time to, through ordinary attrition, to get to where they need to be.\nThere may be places where it's harder for them to ramp up. One of the things we don't talk about very often is it's fairly hard for some parts of the federal government to hire a bunch of people in a short period of time. You can't wave a magic wand and add a thousand people, for example.\nSo again, I'm not trying to dodge your question, but there is no one answer to that question because you're dealing with such a large agency. Do you have a follow-up on that? Yes, ma'am.\nQ: I did. The follow-up was this: So Congress has indicated that it is very likely to restore a lot of the cuts, particularly at the State Department, that the President's \"skinny budget\" has outlined. So if that happens, does the administration intend to continue to pursue these reductions in both the workforce and programs? And would the administration decide that it wanted to take reductions to certain programs and certain agencies that Congress had actually restored?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: That's an excellent question. And the President's priorities are the President's priorities. Congress' priorities may be a little different. Any of you who follow the appropriations process understand there are certain things that Congress can actually make us do. And we'll follow the law when it comes to that. To the extent we have discretion under the law, then the discretion will be exercised in the method best possible to effectuate the President's policies.\nQ: Two questions. So will agencies need to get approval from OMB or someone when they're hiring? Or will they just be trusted to just follow the guidance?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: The latter. What happens is -- essentially what we're doing is saying, look, here is the rules, we expect all -- and they know this. The agencies -- every administration does this. They'll give guidance -- OMB gives guidance on a bunch of different things.\nSo this is not like we're plowing new ground here or making up stuff as we go along. We'll give them guidance and say, here's the guidance on how to do your hiring and where the priorities lie consistent with the budget. And over the course of the year and so forth we'll check up with them to make sure they're doing that.\nIf, for example, six months you get into it and an agency that we wanted to plus up hasn't, that we want to know why that is. Because it would look, at least on its face, like they're not prioritizing the President's policies. So we would do that on an ongoing basis.\nBut no, it would be absurd to think that they all have to call OMB before they hire somebody, and that's not how it's going to work.\nQ: And another question -- just one more question. Do you ultimately envision that maybe a whole department may, under this reorganization, may need to be closed? There's been talk over the years of, like, shutting down Commerce, moving their facets other places. I mean, is there any vision in this action --\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: I got asked that question this morning by the CEOs and I'll give you the same answer I gave them, which is -- it's sort of a knee-jerk, conservative Republican answer to say there will be fewer agencies. But you could probably make the argument that there might be efficiencies in having more but smaller. And that's what this is really all about.\nWe are not going into this with some ideological preconception about what this is going to look like. This is really a blank sheet of paper, and we are not just asking conservative, right-wing think-tanks to give us ideas on how to fix this. We're asking the general public -- intellectuals, academia, and the private sector -- to give us ideas. And it may well be that they come in and make a very good case for the exact opposite of what might be the preconceived notion of a former right-wing member of Congress.\nYes, sir, there. And then in the middle.\nQ: Thank you very much. The President's key strategist has used the term the \"deconstruction of the administrative state\" as a major goal of the administration, and you just used the phrase \"draining the swamp\" that the President famously used during the campaign. But it sounds like you're drawing a distinction between -- based on your answer just now -- between that which seems to be an overarching goal of the administration, and this reorganization. So is this a reorganization with the goal of making the executive branch function better? Or is this executing the larger goal of deconstructing the administrative state and returning government to what some would say is a pre-New Deal, laissez faire --\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Let me answer it this way, because I don't see the equivalence between those two things. But let me put it to you this way: This is about good government. It's not about big government, it's not about small government -- it's about good government. And that is what I think the President talks about when he talks about \"draining the swamp.\"\nPeople back home look at Washington, D.C. and if you're on the left, the right, the middle, they don't know where they are philosophically, they know that Washington doesn't function well. And what the businessman-in-chief has essentially come to us and said, look, make sure this government functions properly. That means it's going to more efficient, more accountable, more effective at providing the services that we need.\nThis is not talking about shrinking the government down to the very smallest denominator. It's not talking about growing the government. This is something that we would hope would unite Republicans and Democrats.\nI remember talking to Peter Welch, a friend of mine who is sort of left-of-center -- that's being very courteous to my friend, for those of you who know him -- a Democrat from Vermont, when we worked on a bill together, about saving money in federal buildings. And I just met Peter -- this is going back five or six years -- and I said, Peter, why are you doing this? He says, we'll I'm a left-wing tree-hugger; I can't stand when we waste money on energy. And I'm like, well, I'm a right-wing fiscal conservative, I can't stand when we waste money on anything at all. And that's when we realized that we might think differently about the role of government, but everybody dislikes bad government, and that's in large part the government we have now. And that's what we're trying to fix.\nQ: So reorganization, not deconstruction.\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: I'm sorry?\nQ: So reorganization, not deconstruction.\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: The executive order -- is it reorganizing government or restructuring government?\nAIDE: Restructuring.\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Restructuring government.\nYes, sir.\nQ: Having been in Congress, did you study the Obama proposals put forward in 2012 and '14 to reorganize the government, particularly around the department of business or trade?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: I did not, I'm sorry.\nIn the back -- yes, sir.\nQ: Thank you, Director. Can you talk about what happens in September --\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Little slow on the pickup. You could have had that one. (Laughter.)\nQ: I wanted to make sure it was me, not --\nQ: I get a lot of practice with Sean. (Laughter.) Can you talk about September and what happens there? Are you looking to prepare a report? When can the American people expect to see the results of the findings over the summer actually come to --\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Two answers to the question. You'll see hints of it in the 2019 budget. Now, of course, we won't be talking about that until probably the first of next year. But as I mentioned before, the ideas that we collect between now and September will start to filter their way into the 2019 budget. The deadline in the executive order, I believe, is March 13th of 2018. It's a year from whenever he signed. We're about a month -- so it's 11 months from now. So by the 1st of next year, so before the President's first anniversary, you'll start to see real tangible ideas that have grown out of this executive order.\nNow, the gentleman. Yes, sir.\nQ: Thank you. Employee morale is a big issue when you start talking about moving people and changing jobs. How are you addressing that? Because I think what's going to happen is employees are going to get depressed. They're going to get --\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: They shouldn't be. And it's an excellent question. And here's one of the things we've found so far, which is that one of the frustrations that government workers have is that we don't reward those who do a really good job, and we don't punish those who do a lousy job.\nAnd so here you've got -- imagine, would you like working in an organization where you do a really nice job and you don't get rewarded for it? You don't even get acknowledged for that? What kind of moral would that create within that particular organization?\nThat is one of the things we've asked the agencies to look at: How do you restructure your personnel policies in order to point out people who are doing a great job and figuring out a way to get folks who are not delivering money for the taxpayer, get them on board with whatever it is -- whatever policy you're trying to achieve. So that is a big part of what we're doing because we recognize exactly what you said.\nI think it's wrong to sort of paint with a broad brush and say, because we are going to be reducing the overall size of government as part of this, as consistent with our budget, that that means that everybody should just focus on who is getting fired. That's the wrong message to take from this. The right message is we're trying to figure out a way to make the government more responsive and more accountable, and that means taking care of the people who are doing a good job.\nAnd I hope that folks recognize the message that the President tried to send when he instructed through OMB that all the agencies give the full -- what is it 1.9 percent increase this year? I'm looking on -- is it 1.9 percent or 2.1 percent? The 1.9 percent increase.\nThe President wants to reward good employees. He's famous for doing that. Go down to the Trump Hotel and ask the people who used to work for him when he was in the private sector. He's a great boss to work for, and he wants to reward people who do a good job. And you will see that reflected in this document.\nQ: You said something earlier about -- this a story that's gone unreported, the story -- (inaudible) -- in Montgomery County and Prince George's County that's all they're talking about. They're afraid your budget and these plans are going to destroy the economy in the two counties that are adjacent to the capital. Can you at least speak to the fact that there are millions of people that work in the government there and are scared to death their economy is going to be destroyed by your plans?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: A couple different things. I got asked that question before, and I didn't mean for it to -- in the press conference we did on the budget. We didn't write the budget -- or excuse me, we didn't come up with this guidance with an eye towards taking care of any particular special interest group.\nAnd to a certain extent, folks who live here and are worried about the value of their condominiums or their homes need to recognize that there's bigger issues at play. Fixing the government is more important than any particular sub-group's interest.\nThat's not to be heartless about those folks. These are people's jobs. We get that, and we recognize the fact there will be people here looking at this going, oh, my goodness, I work at an agency that may be downsized. That is real.\nBy the way, that's the same thing that every one of you has been through in the last couple of years. You all are the last remaining people who actually work in journalism, right? So your entities have gone through this. It shouldn't be anything new, and it's nothing to be afraid of. It's part of what working in a free economy entails.\nThat being said to the folks who do work here, recognize the response I just gave to the gentleman in the back. If you're a really good federal worker, you should welcome this because now you're finally going to get a chance to be rewarded for your contributions.\nQ: But follow-up, if I could? If you could clarify something you said when you were out here before about your budget and the afterschool programs. Some of them -- I know -- but it's come back. The chickens have come home to roost saying that you basically don't care about poor people, that you're like the Soup Nazi. You didn't do good in school, so no soup for you. Can you address that?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Let me address it this way. Is The Washington Post here, by the way? Thank you. You all actually did a correction, which is the first time they've ever done that about -- yes, I know. I was stunned too when I saw it.\nQ: You know what the story was --\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: That was your stunned face. (Laughter.) But I didn't say we were cutting Meals on Wheels or that we thought Meals on Wheels --\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: I understand that. But I want to speak to the larger topic, which is that we are looking at the effectiveness of programs. That's our responsibility. We have a responsibility to the people who are receiving government services to give them the best possible services that we can. We also have a responsibility to the people who are paying for those government services -- the taxpayers, okay? And whoever you voted for, we care about the fact that if you get services, you pay services. We care about everybody. We're the only people elected nationwide. Everybody else has their constituencies back home. The President represents everybody, including folks who don't vote for him. And what we have to do is look at those programs and say, is this a good value for the taxpayer?\nI won't speak to the specifics of the afterschool lunch because there's more than one, and we could talk more about that as we get into the full budget in May. But the answer is still the same, which is that this administration is looking at all sides of the equation as we try to deliver a better value for everybody involved.\nQ: You talked about good government and bad government. But what you think is bad government, Pete Welch probably disagrees with you on. So what Democrats have you worked with in Congress about the restructuring? I mean, have you worked with Democrats? And which ones?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Well, go back to use Peter Welch as an example, which is that Peter Welch would agree that leaving the lights on at a federal building overnight with nobody there is bad government. So why spend our --\nQ: But --\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: You asked the question, let me answer it. So why spend our time talking about things we disagree on, when we can actually spend time on things we agree on? And we hope that, as we go through this process, some of these ideas might actually resonate with some of our Democrat friends.\nWe have not started specific reach-out yet to members of either party in the House or the Senate because we don't know what to take them. We're not saying, look, this is our new idea for the Department of Commerce -- can you get behind this? What we'll start to do now, with the guidance that goes out tomorrow, is go to our friends on the Hill and say, look, what are your ideas, Peter, on how to fix this? Because he's going to have some, there's no question.\nI remember doing -- oh, was it Cheri Bustos? I think I started -- I finished with Cheri Bustos and we started with Patrick Murphy in Florida on the improper payments. All right? Improper payments -- bad government. All right? Wasting money -- giving money to people who don't deserve it, is something that Republicans and Democrats alike don't care for and want to fix. That lies at the very heart of what we're trying to do. We're trying to get good government through this. And so we do hope to have Democrat support for many of these ideas.\nQ: Just to follow up on that, are you concerned, without actual legislation that changes the scope and size of government, that this can just be written over when the next Democratic President comes in?\nDIRECTOR MULVANEY: Sure. To the extent that we only do stuff within the executive branch -- as with any executive orders -- they can be overturned by the next administration if they see things differently. That's the way the executive order system works. And that if we wanted real permanent change, the best way to go about that would be to do legislative change.\nBut I'll close with this: Don't discount the power of inertia because what we're battling against right now, which is the inertia of 240 years of federal government weighing down on this ability to try and change government, starts to work to your advantage once you change it, because then it becomes very hard to change again. So even if there are things we can't get done legislatively, there are things we might be able to get done in an executive fashion that could have long-lasting impacts.\nThank you all very much.\nEND 4:34 P.M.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123933", "text": "The President. For them, at some point very soon, I think we're doing very well on health care. It's been very much miss reported that we failed with health care. We haven't failed, we're negotiating and we continue to negotiate and we will save perhaps nine hundred billion dollars. You know if you look at, if you look at the kind of numbers that we're talking about, that's all going back into the taxes. We have to do healthcare first to pick up additional money so that we get great tax reform. So, we're going to have a phenomenal tax reform. But, I have to do healthcare first. I want to do it first, to really do it right. Health care has been going along you know it's a negotiation so I do. And it's just a negotiation. And it's going to take a little while longer but as you probably hear in Congress is coming along with some great people at congress. They want it to happen. We will have no Democrats. Zero. That means we have to get close to a hundred percent of the Republicans. Not an easy way to run a government. You saw that with Justice Gossage which is we're very proud of but he had no almost no democrat support even though he was central casting like the perfect Supreme Court Judge. So, we'll see what happens. I think we're doing very well with health care which surprises us like breaking news but they all know it they just don't tend to write it and after that we're going to start on tax reform and infrastructure.\nBartiromo. But do you have to do a health care before tax return? When I speak with business managers they say tax reform is so much more impactful to moving the needle on economic worlds\nThe President. They're all right but because I'm saving a tremendous amount hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars we're saving on health care so we're going to have a much better plan than Obamacare, which is failing. Even now, as I came in here, they're saying payments have to be made that weren't scheduled to be made on Obamacare. If you don't make them, it fails. I mean you know it's just a mess. Obamacare is a total mess so we're saving tremendous amounts of money on health care when we get this done, number one. And most importantly actually, we're going to have great health care. And all of that saving goes into the tax. If you don't do that, you can't put any of these savings into the tax cuts and the tax reform\nBartiromo. How do you know you're not going to have a similar battle and on the tax reform to be because you've got a border adjustment act the deductions? So who's to say that tax reform doesn't fail the way the bill the House bill\nThe President. I think tax reform will be easier but it's going to be tough. You have a lot of people out there that what you know they have their own agendas including a lot of supporters of different people that are in Congress. They have their own agendas. They want certain things. Tax reform is going to be tough but it won't be as tough as healthcare. Healthcare is very very difficult. You look at that. Look at Hilary Clinton, that failed. And you look at so many of the others. Obamacare failed. Obamacare was just, you know, they just in the end just gave up just to get the vote. You look at what they had to do in Nebraska where they essentially gave it away for Nebraska to get that final vote\nBartiromo. And we know the premiums up 169 in Arizona and across the country\nThe President. Many many of the and this is going to be much worse year than last year for Obamacare. So Obamacare is a disaster. It's really gone, essentially it's gone. If Obamacare isn't bailed out almost on a monthly basis, it fails. It immediately fails. We have a great health care plan that I think will happen and if it happens then I go immediately to tax reform and that will happen. That will be easier than healthcare.\nBartiromo. How are you on the border adjustment tax? Have you decided?\nThe President. I haven't really wanted to talk about it. I have my own feelings. I don't like the word adjustment because our country gets taken advantage of, to use a nice term, by every other country in the world. So when I hear border adjustment, adjustment means we lose, we lose so I don't like to turn border adjustment.\nBartiromo. Any tax at the border?\nThe President. Let's call it an import tax let's call it a reciprocal tax you know we have\nBartiromo. [crosstalk] So it's in there? You want it?\nThe President. [crosstalk] Countries, where they charge our companies a hundred percent tax. If they sell a motorcycle or if they sell they make it in America. They make it in the United States. They sell it to various countries. They sell very little because the tax is a hundred percent in some countries. The tax is fifty percent thirty percent forty percent. But if they make a motorcycle and they sell it back into the United States, they have no tax. Now do you think that's fair? And you think that's smart? So I love the idea of reciprocal. You can call it a reciprocal or a matching tax or a mere tax or numerous terms but the reciprocal tax is very important. And you know, the funny thing is that nobody gets angry when you say reciprocal tax. When you say we're going to charge your border tax. We'd be a rich nation if we did it by the way. But you know but when you say reciprocal nobody fights you. When you say I'm going to charge a ten percent or a 20-percent border tax everyone goes crazy because they like free trade. Well they don't say that the other countries are charging you much more than that. But when you say a reciprocal tax, and I'm not saying that's what I'm doing, but there has to be a certain reciprocal nature to it. But when you say reciprocal tax nobody can get angry. Even the other countries if like they're charging you a fifty percent tax you say okay whatever you charge we will charge\nBartiromo. Like China and India?\nThe President. Then they may not like it but they can't get angry because they can't win that battle\nBartiromo. What if you have a debate you can't get to an agreement on that. Do you prefer just cutting taxes? If you have to do one, can you do just one?\nThe President. Yeah, we can keep trade and we can keep certain things separate. We may put it in the tax bill or we may make it separate. We have a lot of different things. Don't forget, we're going to be bringing back as part of this I think the number is closer to five trillion dollars. You know you've been hearing, you've been using, and you keep using two and a half trillion right? But the money the corporate inversions and the money over there is two and a half trillion dollars. So I think that money because we've been saying that number for what five years\nnow, would you say? So I know it's much more. It's probably five trillion dollars or four trillion dollars. That money is coming back. We're going to charge a very small tax on that money and the companies are going to bring that money back into the United States and do lots of good things with it. Right now they can't bring it back and it's not only the high-techs it's also because the bureaucracy is so horrible. I have friends that want to bring money back, even if they were willing to pay the tax which very few people are willing, the bureaucracy the paperwork the the work to get it in it's not worth it\nBartiromo. Which is why you're rolling back to go through your executive orders? You're rolling back regulations. So if you have to do one, corporate tax or individual tax, what's more important? If you had to do one this year\nThe President. Both. Both. I almost think individual from my standpoint because you know the middle class has just been taken advantage of in this country for so many years. But in terms of jobs I mean, I think, both. But I think probably corporate. But they gonna both go hand in hand. It's not going to matter.\nBartiromo. Have you moved off of this soft deadline that your team put in place of August to get this done? Are you looking at the later in the year?\nThe President. Well you know, I put a deadline on health care and the fake news immediately went crazy because when I didn't make the deadline don't forget I said withdraw I didn't even say take a vote I say withdraw. Well that same thing is being negotiated and great points are being won and lost. The great points are being won that are going to lower premiums and make our health care incredible. But by putting a deadline they say \"Trump didn't make it he didn't make it.\" So I don't want to put deadlines. Health care is going to happen at some point. Now, if it doesn't happen fast enough I'll start the taxes. But the tax reform and the tax cuts are better if I can do healthcare first\nBartiromo. What about infrastructure? How do you see it? When do you see it?\nThe President. Very soon. I see it as part perhaps of the health care plan because phase two of the health care plan, in order to get the votes, I need sixty percent for that and if I put that in the Democrats are actually going to love the infrastructure plan. So we're going to actually, I believe, despite their tremendous hostility for years this isn't just for Trump this is for years. It's been so hostile. You know, when I used to come to Washington, because I've been a very political person all my life even though I'm not on this side of the equation. But I've been very very political. I used to see Democrats and Republicans, they were best friends and they'd fight a little bit during the day and then they'd have dinner with their families at night you'd see them at restaurants. They used to joke look at this look at this and you know a Republican\nBartiromo. They would have a coffee together\nThe President. Yeah, they'd be together. Have breakfast together, then they go and fight and then they have lunch. Today you don't see that. The level of hatred is incredible and I'm not just saying in the last 90 days, I'm saying this has been for the last few years. It's incredibly divisive\nBartiromo. Has it gotten in the way of getting things done?\nThe President. Well, an example on health care, I won't get one Democrat vote even though many of them think it's an incredible plan. Take a look at Justice Gorsuch. You can't get better. Top of the line in every aspect and he got three votes from the Democrats. Should have gotten all of them. Got three votes and those three people, you know, are to be respected for doing it. But it's there's a great level of hostility and they're putting their putting their hatred way way above way above the country and the benefit to the country. You know, things that they do can have such benefit so I probably I always assume no Democrat votes. Now, the good thing is we have the house, we have the Senate, and we have the White House. So, we're all set. But within there, you have certain factions. You have the conservative Republicans. You have the modern Republican. Soon you have to get them together, but we need close to a hundred percent. That's a pretty hard thing to get but we get it.\n[broadcast break]\nThe President. I'm going to build the wall one hundred percent. In fact, we had hundreds of bidders. We have many many designs. I've seen 10 of the top but I want to see more. And what I'm doing is I said to very great secretaries who are doing a great job General Kelly because you see the numbers where they're down sixty-eight percent. Nobody's ever seen numbers it's like on a record in fact people aren't even trying to get through anymore because they know they can't. It's incredible what's happened but on the wall we're looking at designs and we're going to be making a decision very shortly.\n[broadcast break]\nThe President. We've done an amazing job on regulations. We've freed it up, we freed up this country so much. The miners and energy and the banking system is now coming to with dodd-frank which is a disaster.\nWe freed up so much and we're getting great great credit for we have done so much for so many people. I don't think that there is a presidential period of time in the first 100 days where anyone's done merely what we've been able to do.\nOn top of it, we just had during the first 100 days a Supreme Court justice approved. Not just nominated, but approved to a very very hostile environment. I am waiting right now for so many people.\nBartiromo. You Understand\nThe President. Hundreds and hundreds of people, and then they'll say why isn't Trump doing this faster? You can't do it faster because they are obstructing their obstructionists.\nSo I have people, hundreds of people, that we're trying to get through. I mean you have to see the backlog okay. Get them through and then the newspapers will say \"Trump doesn't get them through.\" Well, nothing to do with me statutorily.\nYou have to go through this process. So it's been a lousy process. It has taken a long time to get my cabinet done and as you know it's not even done now.\nThis is record stuff. You know we're talking about records in terms of time and it's it's very sad. Well, you see, even again with the Supreme Court judge that everybody agrees is outstanding and you see what that process is.\nBartiromo. Absolutely and the American people know what I think\nThe President. I think they know. I think they get it. I wish it would be explained better. The obstruction is nature though because a lot of times I'll say why doesn't so and so have people under him or her. The reason is because we can't get them approved.\nBartiromo. Well, people are still wondering though. They're scratching their heads why so\nmany Obama era staffers are still here. For example, was it a mistake not to ask Jim Comey to step down from the eye of the FBI at the outside of your presidency? Is it too late now to ask him\nto step down?\nThe President. No, it's not too late. But you know I have confidence and we'll see what happen. You know it's, it's going to be interesting. But you know we have to just look. I have so many people that want to come into this administration. They're so excited about this administration and what's happening. Bankers, law enforcement, everybody wants to come into this administration. Don't forget when Jim Comey came out, he saved Hillary Clinton. People don't realize that he saved her life because I call it Comey one, and I joke about it a little bit.\nWhen he was reading those charges, she was guilty on every charge and then he said she was essentially okay. Well,\nBartiromo. That's why I'm asking\nThe President. No, I'm just saying well because I want to give everybody a good fair chance. Director Comey was very very good to Hillary Clinton that I can tell you. If he weren't, she would be right now going to trial\nBartiromo. Are you going to push that? Are you going to\nThe President. I don't want to talk about that right now. All I want to talk about, I want to talk about positive\nBartiromo. In the last weeks of the Obama presidency, he changed all the rules in terms of the intelligence agencies allowing them to sheer raw data\nThe President. Terrible\nBartiromo. Why do you think he did this?\nThe President. Well, I'm going to let you figure that one out but it's so obvious, when you look at Susan Rice, of what's going on. And so many people are coming up to me and apologizing. Now they say, \"you know you were right when you said that.\" Perhaps I didn't know how right I was because nobody knew the extent of it\nBartiromo. When you sent that tweet, was that what you were referring to?\nThe President. Well, sure we're talking about surveillance. It was wiretapped. In quotes New York Times had the word wiretapped in the headline of the first edition. Then, they took it out of there fast when they realized I put wiretapped in quotes. Meaning, because look wiretapping is old fashioned. Again, that's too many wires. Any room will have a lot of wires. Look at this room. This room, you just have a lot of wires. Now it doesn't have to have so many wires but we talked about surveillance or whatever, and you look at the extent of the surveillance me and so many other people it's, it's terrible\nBartiromo. She said she didn't do it for political reasons. Susan Rice told Anna Mae\nThe President. Does anybody really believe that? Nobody believes that. Even the people that try to protect her in the news media. It's such a big story and I'm sure it will continue forward, but what they did is horrible.\n[broadcast break]\nBartiromo. The Syria strike, has damaged our relationship with Russia?\nThe President. That I don't know. I can't tell you. But I can tell you that I think aligning yourself with the Sun is a big mistake because he's a butcher. And I think it's very bad for Russia and I think they ought to get peace fast.\n[broadcast break]\nThe President. We're not going into Syria because you know there were some questions Nikki Haley's doing a great job Rex is doing a fantastic job our Secretary of State a general McMaster fantastic but if you add it all up and if they take every little word they'll say oh they were different. Just so you understand. We're not going into Syria. But when I see people using horrible horrible chemical weapons which they agreed not to use under the Obama administration but they violated it.\nBartiromo. They said they got rid of them\nThe President. Look, what I did should have been done by the Obama administration a long time before I did it and you would have had a much better I think Syria would be a lot better off right now than it has been\nBartiromo. Obama pushed he resisted to it\nThe President. When I looked he we didn't do it. I don't know what happened, but he didn't do it. In fact, they had a big attack right after he drew the red line in the sand. Had a very big attack and everybody waited. What's going on and nothing happened. And even the Obama people admitted he was wrong for not doing it. I will tell you that when I looked at the pictures on any show or any newspaper but especially when you see them on television and you see these beautiful kids that are dead in their father's arms or you see kids gasping for life, you know, it's over it's over for them. They're hosing them down. Hundreds of them. When you see that, I immediately called General Mattis. I said \"what can we do\" and they came back with a number of different alternatives and we hit them very hard. Now, are we going to get involved with Syria? No. But if I see them using gas and using things that I mean even some of the worst tyrants in the world didn't use the kind of gases that they use and some of the gases are unbelievably potent. So, when I saw that, I said we have to do something. You should have peace in Syria. It's enough and frankly you know we talked the chemicals because you know people just don't see this the level of brutality. The level of viciousness. But when they drop barrel bombs and bombs of any kind, right on top of a civilian population, that's the worst thing. I've never seen anything like it. And frankly Putin is back in a person that's truly an evil person and I think it's very bad for Russia. I think it's very bad for mankind. It's very bad for this world, but when you drop gas or bombs or barrel bombs. They have these massive barrels with dynamite and they drop it right in the middle of a group of people. And in all fairness, you see the same kids no arms, no legs, no face. This is an animal and I really think that there's going to be a lot of pressure on Russia to make sure that piece happens. Because, frankly, if Russia didn't go in and back this animal you wouldn't have a problem right now. He was going to be overthrown. I thought he was gone. He had another week. I mean he was finished. He had nothing nothing and then Russia came in and saved him and then Obama made one of the worst deals in history with the Iran deal. So you really have Iran and you have Russia and you have Assad.\nBartiromo. You redirected Navy ships to go toward the Korean Peninsula. What are we doing right now in terms of North Korea?\nThe President. You never know do you, you never know\nBartiromo. That's all you're going to say?\nThe President. You know I don't talk about the military. I'm not like Obama where they talk about in four months we're rating, we're going to hit Mosel and in the meantime they get ready. And like you never saw look but they're still fighting Mosel was supposed to last for a week. Now they've been fighting it for many months and so many more people died. I don't want to talk about it. We are sending an armada, very powerful. We have submarines, very powerful. Far more powerful than the aircraft carrier that I can tell you. We have the best military people on earth and I will say this he is doing the wrong thing\nBartiromo. Do you think he's mentally fit?\nThe President. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know him, but he's doing the wrong thing. I had a very very good meeting with President Xi of China. Really liked him. We had a great chemistry. I think, I mean at least I had a great chemistry maybe he didn't like me but I think he liked me. We were going to have a 10 or 15 minutes sit down. It lasted for three hours. Then, the next day, it was another schedule because everything's very orderly with the Chinese frankly and we had meetings scheduled. Well, the 15 minutes on the first day lasted for three hours. The 15 minutes on the second day lasted for two hours just one-on-one the two of us with interpreters. And I mean we understand each other. I think he's, you know, a person that I got along with really. Where we had a good chemistry.\nBartiromo. Did he give you any suggestion that would help with North Korea? Did you get into trade and currency?\nThe President. First thing I brought up was North Korea. Can he help us with North Korea? Because we can't allow it and it's no good for you and you have a tremendous power because of train. He then explains thousands of years of history with Korea. Not that easy. In other words, it's not as simple as people would think. They've had tremendous conflict with Korea over the years. Now his father was in China four times. He was never in China. So I said look you have a tremendous power because of trading through the border. They don't get food. They don't get you know; they can't sell their coal. In fact, I hear today two massive coal ships from North Korea we sent back to North Korea heading to China. They were sent back which is a very good sign. But I think China can help us. I hope China can help us. We talked about trade and I can tell you china will do much better on trade if they help us\nBartiromo. And you think he knows that?\nThe President. I think he knows that. I told him that, yeah\nBartiromo. When you were with the president of China you're launching these military strikes. Was that planned? How did that come about that it's happening right then? Because right there you're saying a reminder here's who the superpower in the world is\nThe President. You have no idea how many people want to hear the answer to this. I have had, I have watched speculation for three days now on what that was like.\nBartiromo. When did you tell him? Before dessert?\nThe President. I will tell you only because you've treated me so good for so long I have to tell you, right? I was sitting at the table. We had finished dinner, we're now having dessert and we had the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake that you've ever seen. and President Xi was enjoying it and I was given the message from the generals that the ships are locked and loaded.\nWhat do you do? And we made a determination to do it. So the missiles were on the way and I said \"Mr. President, let me explain something to you.\" This is during dessert. \"We've just fired 59 missiles\", all of which hit by the way. Unbelievable from you know hundreds of miles away all of which hit. Amazing. Really it's so incredible, it's brilliant, it's genius. Our technology, our equipment is better than anybody body by a factor of five. I mean what we have in terms of technology nobody can even come close to competing. Now, we're going to start getting it because you know the military has been cut back and depleted so badly by the past administration and by the war in Iraq. Which, was another disaster. So what happens as I said \"we've just launched 59 missiles heading to Iraq.\"\nBartiromo. Well you headed to Syria?\nThe President. Yes, heading toward Syria and I want you to know that because I didn't want him to go home. We're almost finished. Was a full day in Palm Beach, we're almost finished and I what does he do finishes dessert and go home and then they say you know the guy who just had dinner with just attacked.\nBartiromo. How did he react?\nThe President. So, he paused for 10 seconds and then he asked the interpreter to please say it again. I didn't think that was a good sign. And he said to me \"anybody that uses gases, you could almost say or anything else, but anybody that was so brutal and uses gases to do that to young children and babies it's okay\"\nBartiromo. He agreed?\nThe President. He was okay with it. He was ok, but we get along. There was a great feeling I think between the both of us. Now, we have two very different countries, two very different peoples but I think he understood the message and I understood what he was saying to me.", "timestamp": "2017-04-11", "title": "Interview with Maria Bartiromo on Fox Business Network"}
{"author": "Sean Spicer", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123733", "text": "James Brady S. Briefing Room\n1:42 P.M. EDT\nMR. SPICER: I want to start off this afternoon by a quick comment on the tragic and heartbreaking events that unfolded at a San Bernardino school yesterday. The events occurred after the briefing, so I just want to make sure I acknowledge that our thoughts and prayers go out to all the families of the three victims. We hope for a speedy and full recovery of those who were wounded in the events that occurred.\nMoving on to today, the President this morning led a discussion with some of the world's top job creators on how private sector thinking could help the government modernize and provide a better, more efficient services to the American people.\nTogether, the companies that were represented in the room this morning employ nearly 4 million people worldwide and at least 1.78 million Americans here in our nation.\nStarting in small, interactive groups, the Cabinet members shared their strategic visions for their departments and listened as business leaders offered their unique perspectives on how they might achieve those goals. The groups then came together and shared their discussions and outcomes with the President.\nThe meeting was hosted by the American office -- the Office of American Innovation and was another opportunity for the administration to engage with the private sector and harness its knowledge to develop innovative solutions to some of our country's biggest problems, like the crumbling infrastructure and broken system at the Veterans Administration.\nAlso this morning, the President completed several procedural steps to ratify the protocol for Montenegro's accession to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization following the Senate's overwhelming and bipartisan vote of advice and consent in support of this ratification. The United States looks forward to formally welcoming Montenegro as the 29th member of the NATO Alliance.\nAnd later today, the President will have a series of meetings with his national and economic security team. Later, the Attorney General is also at the southwest border to announce specific new actions the Trump administration is taking to secure our borders and keep the country safe.\nThe administration is committed to ending the practice of smuggling gangs and cartels across the border that flood our country with drugs and violence. These actions, which include a strengthening of the laws applying to those who are caught attempting to illegally return to the United States after prior removal and those who profit off smuggling people across the border will once again make it clear to the brave men and women of law enforcement that the Trump administration has their back.\nAnd Secretary Tillerson finished the G7 foreign ministers meeting today and is now in Moscow for meetings with his Russian counterpart. The visit is part of our effort to maintain direct lines of communication with senior Russian officials and to ensure that the United States' views on the situation in Syria, counterterrorism efforts, North Korea, and other matters are clearly conveyed. We're open to strategic cooperation with Russia when we can achieve a shared goal such as defeating ISIS. But we'll stand up for interests and values when we do not see eye to eye.\nRussia must fully honor the commitments it made on Syria, Ukraine, and the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty and other topics of international concern. And Secretary Tillerson is going to make that clear during his visit.\nI also want to make it known that Secretary Mattis and General Votel, who is the COCOM* [SOCOM] commander of Central Command, will be giving a full briefing on the strike in Syria that occurred today, at the Department of Defense at 3:30 p.m. Then at 4 o'clock, I'll be back up here for an off-camera briefing with Director Mulvaney of the Office of Management and Budget and OMB Senior Advisor Linda Springer regarding the President's executive order on reorganizing the executive branch.\nSo that gives us three briefings, plus this today. Not to get you real excited, but we'll have another one tomorrow morning in advance of the NATO meeting with the Secretary General. This afternoon's briefing will be discussing the plan on reforming the federal government and reducing the size of the federal civilian workforce that OMB was directed to produce by executive order. So we'll be spending a lot of quality time together over the next 48, 24 hours.\nAnd with that, I'd be glad to take a few questions.\nKen.\nQ: Sean, on Russia to start. Does the administration believe that Russia had any advance knowledge of this chemical attack in Syria? And does the administration believe that Russia may have been complicit in this attack?\nMR. SPICER: I believe there was a background briefing earlier today where that was discussed. At this time, there is no consensus in the intelligence community that that's the case.\nQ: Is there any thought within the intelligence community, or are there some strands of the international community that --\nMR. SPICER: Again, at this point, the only thing I'm going to say is that there's no consensus within the intelligence community that there was involvement.\nQ: Today, in the background briefing, top officials accused Russia of helping Syria cover up Assad's use of chemical weapons. In the past, Trump had praised Putin, calling him very smart and expressing general admiration. Does he still think Putin is very smart? And does this change the relationship between the two leaders?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think a couple of things. Number one, I think the President has made it clear from the beginning that he entered office thinking that if he can get a deal with Russia in our national interest, which we discussed during the opening remarks as part of Secretary Tillerson's conversation with Foreign Minister Lavrov then we're going to do it. But if we can't get a deal and if we can't find an area of national interest, then we won't.\nAnd in this particular case, it's no question that Russia is isolated. They have aligned themselves with North Korea, Syria, Iran. That's not exactly a group of countries that you're looking to hang out with. With the exception of Russia, they are all failed states.\nThere is clearly a -- Russia is on an island when it comes to its support of Syria or its lack of, frankly, acknowledgment of what happened. The facts are on our side. The actions of Syria are reprehensible. And I think that Russia has been party to several international agreements that Syria is not holding up to -- in fact, that Russia needs to hold themselves up to.\nSo I think the President has been very clear with his stance on Russia. And in this particular case we're going to be very forceful, as will Secretary Tillerson during his visit, to make sure that we let Russia know that they need to live up to the obligations that it has made.\nKaitlan.\nQ: The administration has said sanctions against Syria are forthcoming. What will those look like, and when can we expect them?\nMR. SPICER: Great question. I think you know well enough at this point that we're not going to announce any of that kind of action until it's ready to go. I think the President has made it clear that additional action with respect to Syria in terms of its failure to stop engaging in actions that harm its people will result in action.\nAnd so I'm not going to get ahead of what he's planning to announce or when, but as he has made clear on a variety of circumstances, he's not one to telegraph his actions until he's ready to make those announcements.\nQ: Secondly, has the administration identified an opposition party that could come to power in Syria if there is a regime change?\nMR. SPICER: I think first and foremost -- and I stated this yesterday and will state it again -- that our number-one goal is to defeat ISIS. That is unequivocally the number-one thing.\nI think, secondly, the political conditions that exist in Syria right now are such that what we need Russia and others to do is to help create a political environment in which the Syrian people can choose a leader that is more suited to them. I think getting into who that should be -- I think what we're trying to do right now is shape the environment to allow the Syrian people to determine their outcome.\nBlake.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. I'm going to change the topic. Mark Meadows said earlier this morning that he thinks \"we're very close\" as it relates to healthcare, and that two options were given to the House Speaker. Does the White House believe that you're \"very close\" on healthcare? And have you signed off on those two options?\nMR. SPICER: Well, two things. One, I think we're getting closer and closer every day. This has been a process that, as you know, the Chief of Staff, the Vice President and others have been extremely engaged in behind the scenes. We clearly are getting closer. More votes are moving in our direction. And these ideas I think are very helpful and the conversations are getting closer.\nI don't want to prejudge the outcome at this point, but I would say that we feel very buoyed by the direction that this is going and some of the outcomes. I know that with respect to a couple of the proposals that Congressman Meadows is suggesting -- part of those has to be, again, figuring out whether or not those attract additional votes and gain additional support and don't detract. And I know it sounds very simple, but that's what this entire process has been about.\nSo he is reviewing a couple of the provisions that he wants to make in amendment -- or to the ongoing amendment.\nQ: Have you signed off to those?\nMR. SPICER: It's not a question of us signing off. I think we're good with the direction that this is going as long as it continues to grow the vote. A lot of these provisions that are being discussed give states the flexibility to enact certain provisions, which is consistent with our general philosophy of giving more competition and more choice to the people in the states.\nQ: And secondly, a video that's being played across television -- United Airlines. Do you think the government should investigate them, the industry as a whole, as it relates to passenger treatment?\nMR. SPICER: I would just say that I think there have been clearly -- law enforcement is reviewing that situation. I think there's plenty of law enforcement to review a situation like that, and I know United Airlines has stated that they are currently reviewing their own policies.\nLet's not get ahead of where that review goes. It was an unfortunate incident, clearly, when you watch the video. It is troubling to see how that was handled. But I'm not going to -- they have clearly stated their desire to review the situation. Law enforcement is reviewing it. And I think for us to start to get in front of what should be a local matter, not necessarily needing a federal response.\nHallie.\nQ: Sean, two questions. Just to follow up on Blake, just very briefly. Has the President seen that video?\nMR. SPICER: I'm sure he has.\nQ: And what's his reaction?\nMR. SPICER: I don't think anyone looks at that video and isn't a little disturbed that another human being is treated that way. But again, I think one of the things that people have to understand is that when there is a potential law enforcement matter, for the President to weigh in pro or con would prejudice a potential outcome.\nSo I don't want to get in -- but I think clearly, watching another human being dragged down an aisle, watching blood come from their face after hitting an armrest and whatever, I don't think there's a circumstance that you can sit back and say, this probably could have been handled a little bit better when you're talking about another human being.\nBut again, I don't think that it is my place to get in the middle of judging how a company dealt with this. I think there's clearly going to be enough review, both on a corporate side and then on a law enforcement side, on how this was handled. But I think from a human-to-human standpoint, to watch a human being get dragged down an aisle with their head banging off armrests and not think that it could have been handled better, I would assume that we could probably all agree on that.\nJohn.\nQ: I have two questions, though. That was actually just the clarification. First, on -- both foreign policy. One on Syria. This administration is continuing to fight for its travel ban that would in part limit refugees coming in from Syria. The President spoke very starkly about how affected he was by some of the images that he's seen of these youngest victims. There have also been images of refugees like, for example, Alan Kurdi, that have also been heart-wrenching for people. Is the President giving any thought to reconsidering that aspect of his travel ban?\nMR. SPICER: In terms of letting them in?\nQ: Correct.\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think you've heard a lot of these refugees in particular talk about the fact they're not looking to flee. They want --\nQ: (Inaudible) changing the ban.\nMR. SPICER: Right. And I think the number-one goal of this President is to make sure that we protect our people, our country, and to keep those people from having to flee. They have family there. And so that's our number-one goal, is creating a safer environment, deescalating the conflict there. It is not to figure out how many people we can fly out.\nI think the U.S. has been extremely supportive when it comes to the financial piece to this, and looking for ways to work in a diplomatic fashion. But the goal isn't to figure out how many people we can just import to this country. I think there's clearly a security concern that we have to be --\nQ: But don't the images touch him also?\nMR. SPICER: They have touched him, and I think that's what he made very clear. That's why, with the consent and guidance of his national security team, it was very extreme -- it was moving. I don't think -- going back, I don't mean to make two examples of this, but I don't think you can watch those things. Not that you should have -- any human being -- but when you see in particular young children and babies being gassed, it should move any human being that has a heart.\nSo I think -- but that partially dealt with why he acted so decisively, is to see an individual, in Assad, in that regime, act in a way that reacted to -- we can't condemn every act, but I think to literally see someone use gas. And it was pointed out -- you think about that, it is in the same category as nuclear weapons for a reason. It is that lethal. It is that deadly. It is that horrific that -- when you recognize the use of chemical weapons is put in the same category of weapons of mass destruction as so many other things because of what it does to an individual and the nature of an attack like that, that even first responders -- if you saw some of the tape we're getting -- grossly affected by this. It moved him tremendously. And that's part of the reason he acted the way he did.\nQ: On North Korea, Sean, I also know that you've seen the latest provocations from Pyongyang. The President tweeted this morning that if China will help, the U.S. will solve the problem.\nMR. SPICER: That's right.\nQ: What does he mean by that, \"solve the problem\"?\nMR. SPICER: I think he has been very clear that he will not tolerate some of this action by North Korea. But to answer your question, I think I've said this before on a variety of topics, the President is not one who is going to out there and telegraph his response. I think he keeps all options on the table. He keeps his cards close to the vest. And as he showed last week with respect to Syria, when the President is willing to act, it's going to be decisive and proportional to make it very clear what the position of the United States is.\nQ: So there will be airstrikes?\nMR. SPICER: That's not what I said. I just said that, as you know, when the President is ready to act, he makes it very clear. And I think there is no question that when the President is ready to make a statement, he will do that.\nBut I think he has made it clear with respect to North Korea that their behavior and their actions with respect to the missile launches is not tolerable. The last thing we want to see is a nuclear North Korea that threatens the coast of the United States, or, for that matter, any other country and any other set of human beings. So we need stability in that region, and I think he has put them clearly on notice.\nJohn.\nQ: Thanks a lot, Sean. The alliance between Russia and Syria is a strong one; it goes back decades. President Putin has supplied personnel, he's supplied military equipment to the Assad government. What makes you think that at this point he's going to pull back in his support for President Assad and for the Syrian government right now?\nMR. SPICER: I think a couple things. You look -- we didn't use chemical weapons in World War II. You had someone as despicable as Hitler who didn't even sink to using chemical weapons. So you have to, if you're Russia, ask yourself is this a country that you and a regime that you want to align yourself with? You have previously signed on to international agreements rightfully acknowledging that the use of chemical weapons should be out of bounds by every country. To not stand up to not only Assad, but your own word, should be troubling.\nRussia put their name on the line. So it's not a question of how long that alliance has lasted, but at what point do they recognize that they are now getting on the wrong side of history in a really bad way really quickly.\nAnd again, look at the countries that are standing with them: Iran, Syria, North Korea. This is not a team you want to be on. And I think that Russia has to recognize that while they may have had an alliance with them, that the lines that have been crossed are ones that no country should ever want to see another country cross.\nYes.\nQ: First one, coming up on Tax Day, when does the White House plan on releasing President Trump's 2016 returns? And are there any concerns about possible conflicts of interest reflecting on the tax debate that could be cleared up with this release?\nSecond, how many people are you expecting at the Easter Egg Roll? And will you practicing your previous role as the bunny?\nMR. SPICER: Those are two tough ones. (Laughter.) So on the first one, I think we've asked and answered that several times, and the President has been under audit. I think when you look at -- we filed our financial disclosure forms the other day in a way that allows everyone to understand. And for those listening at home, a tax return clearly lists how much money you made, how much tax you paid. When you look at a financial disclosure form, it lists every asset, every debt you owe, where you're getting your money from, where your income is derived from. It is a much more comprehensive understanding.\nI think the President -- this question has been asked and answered over and over again. I think the American people are -- frankly, the middle class, in particular, and companies that are trying to grow here in the United States are much more concerned about tax reform and allowing our economy to grow and their bottom line to grow.\nWith respect to the Easter Egg Roll, it's a huge topic. I appreciate that. (Laughter.) I think we're going to have an egg-cellent time. (Laughter.) Oh, come on. You can't ask the question and not get the answer. (Laughter.)\nBut we have worked really well. I think we're going to have a very, very enjoyable day on Monday. Tickets have been sent out to all the schools in the area. There will be a large military contingent that will be participating, as well. And I think there's five waves over two-hour periods in which children and their families will be able to come to the White House. We've done extensive community outreach to really bring a lot of the school children and from the area in, and it's going to be a great day.\nQ: How many are you expecting?\nMR. SPICER: I don't have the number. I think the East Wing could probably get you an answer, and I'll make sure I put out that number. I think they're working on the final numbers. They're starting ticket distribution, so I should be able to get you a number on that.\nFrancesca.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. You said last month that the White House was reviewing the policy on visitor logs.\nMR. SPICER: Right.\nQ: Will the White House voluntarily release those visitor logs?\nMR. SPICER: I think we should have an answer on our policy very shortly on that.\nQ: Okay. And then a question on Syria. Secretary Tillerson said this morning that it was the United States' hope that Bashar al-Assad will not be a part of Syria's future but it's up to the people of Syria to make that determination.\nAt the same time, the question is now whether it's the White House's position that Assad is a bad actor and it would be ideal if he would go, or whether the White House thinks that the atrocities that he's committed are absolutely unacceptable and he must go, period.\nMR. SPICER: As I mentioned yesterday, I don't see a peaceful, stable Syria in the future that has Assad in charge.\nQ: So he absolutely has to go?\nMR. SPICER: There's no question that you can't have a peaceful Syria with Assad in charge. I don't see how that ever works. So, no, I don't see a future Syria that has Bashar al-Assad as the leader of that government.\nKristen.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. I want to ask you about some comments that Eric Trump said, speaking of Ivanka Trump: \"Ivanka is a mother of three kids and she has influence. I'm sure she said, 'listen, this is horrible stuff. My father will act in times like that.'\" Did Ivanka Trump play a role in President Trump deciding to strike Syria? And if so, what was that role?\nMR. SPICER: Well, the President -- I think we released last Friday a very comprehensive tick-tock of when the President was informed by his national security team and how his thinking evolved. At 10:30 a.m. last Tuesday, his national security team was giving him his presidential daily briefing. They went over what had gone on in Syria in detail. He began to ask a series of questions. They came back to him later that day. There was a deputy principals meeting later on Tuesday. On Wednesday, there was a principals meeting. They continued to bring with him a series of questions and responses to his thing.\nAnd his evolving -- his decision-making process continued aboard Air Force One on the way down to Florida. At 4 o'clock when he arrived at Mar-a-Lago, he had a national security team meeting both in Mar-a-Lago and secure VTC back to different elements that were gathered in secure locations. That's when he gave the order.\nThat being said, there's no question that Ivanka and others weighed into him as -- it was asked earlier, Hallie asked it -- that when he himself saw images, he was very, very moved. And I think Ivanka and others, frankly, I don't think that there's many humans that came into contact with the President during that window of time that said, \"did you see those images on television?\" So I don't -- I think there was a widespread acknowledgement that the images and the actions that had been taken were horrific and required action.\nQ: And just to be clear, she was among those who supported taking action?\nMR. SPICER: I have not asked her. But I think -- and again, I saw the reports that Eric gave. But again, I don't think Ivanka stands any different than anyone else when it comes to the response that we got.\nQ: Do you know if they discussed the attack, or if she responded and gave her personal reaction to it?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know. But again, I don't think it's that dissimilar to what any human being probably would have asked.\nQ: And just a couple of others. He also said if there was anything that the strike on Syria did, it was to validate the fact that that there is no Russia tie, which raises the question that there was some type of political component to this. Can you respond to that?\nMR. SPICER: Well, in the sense that -- well, I guess my point -- or I think his point would be, after 80-plus days of constantly being asked what the involvement is, I think clearly with us acting, not having a conversation with Moscow in the political sense, prior to that I think for all of the discussion about how many ties and back channels and this and that, it was a pretty clear show of resolve and force that the United States was acting and not with anyone else's --\nQ: He wasn't suggesting that was a factor in the decision --\nMR. SPICER: No, I think he -- no, but I think that, respectfully, almost every single day we've been asked about these so-called ties and back channels and whatever. And I think there is an acknowledgement at some point that if that was true, you would have seen some kind of action that clearly didn't happen.\nQ: And just to follow up on the North Korea question -- Hallie read the President's tweet -- North Korea seemed to threaten the possibility of taking some type of nuclear action if the U.S. launches what they see as another provocation. What is the specific reaction to that? Is the President considering --\nMR. SPICER: I don't think -- I think that there's no evidence that North Korea has that capability at this time, so I don't know that that could happen.\nQ: What's your reaction to them making that threat?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I don't think that threatening something that you don't have the capability of -- isn't really a threat.\nKevin.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. I want to sort of follow up on that. The President in his tweet noted that China could certainly help on the North Korean issue. And when you unpack it through that lens and the fact that the USS Carl Vinson is sort of steaming out toward the Sea of Japan, that may be an additional pressure to maybe get China to come to the table. Is that an accurate read of what the President would like to see them to do to really apply the pressure on Pyongyang?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think the President and President Xi discussed this last week in Florida. China has had a very economic and political influence on North Korea over the years, and I think that when it comes to a shared national interest of ensuring that Korea doesn't obtain the nuclear capabilities to threaten any people, that is something that we should all agree upon and is something that he talked about with President Xi as an area shared national interest.\nAnd I think that North Korea clearly understands where the United States stands on this, and I think he would welcome President Xi weighing on this a little bit more. So I think that's -- obviously wants to make it very clear to them and the rest of the country and the rest of the world what our position is.\nQ: Putting that strike carrier group in the Sea of Japan, in that region, is that also a messaging circumstance? Or is that simply protective for our allies in Japan and Korea?\nMR. SPICER: A carrier group is several things. The forward deployment is deterrence, presence. It's prudent. But it does a lot of things. It ensures our -- we have the strategic capabilities, and it gives the President options in the region.\nBut I think when you see a carrier group steaming into an area like that, the forward presence of that is clearly, through almost every instance, a huge deterrence. So I think it serves multiple capabilities.\nQ: Last point, if I might, on infrastructure and taxes. The CBO is obviously very interested in trying to get something done as quickly as possible -- A, shovel-ready opportunities for people to get to work, and obviously a lowering of the taxes to enhance business expansion and perhaps even lower for middle-class Americans. But I'm wondering if there isn't a healthcare component that needs to happen before you can move forward on that.\nMR. SPICER: So there's a few things. Obviously, getting healthcare, the repeal and replace done, would open the amount of money that we can use through the reconciliation process to have available tax reform. That's why we made it very clear from the beginning that we thought healthcare should go first. It gives us a greater amount of resources to dedicate to tax reform.\nThat being said, under every circumstance you're talking months of getting tax reform done. That's one area that they discussed today. But one of the more important areas, and where I think you're seeing the President act continuously and decisively, is on the regulatory front. And that's one of the largest burdens that manufacturers, unions, entrepreneurs talk to the President about over and over again, is these stifling regulations of a variety of sort that prevent them -- the coal industry, the manufacturing sector, the auto sector over and over again are talking about the regulatory. And the President's ability to take immediate action -- I've mentioned it here before, but, I mean, so far, under the Congressional Review Act, this President signed 12 pieces of legislation that caters to one that was signed in every administration prior to this year, total.\nAnd I think that that shows the President's commitment to creating not just a better tax climate, which is going to take a few months, but an immediate regulatory impact that can help businesses break down the barriers, compete more, bring more jobs back to the United States.\nCecilia.\nQ: Sean, thanks. I just want to give you an opportunity to clarify something you said that seems to be gaining some traction right now. \"Hitler didn't even sink to the level of using chemical weapons.\" What did you mean by that?\nMR. SPICER: I think when you come to sarin gas, there was no -- he was not using the gas on his own people the same way that Assad is doing, I mean, there was clearly -- I understand your point, thank you.\nQ: I'm just getting --\nMR. SPICER: Thank you, I appreciate that. There was not -- he brought them into the Holocaust center, I understand that. But I'm saying in the way that Assad used them, where he went into towns, dropped them down to innocent -- into the middle of towns. It was brought -- so the use of it -- I appreciate the clarification there. That was not the intent.\nQ: Okay. Did the President speak with Secretary Tillerson before he went on this trip to Russia? And is this stern message that the Secretary delivered today a direct message from the President to Vladimir Putin?\nMR. SPICER: Yeah. I mean, they spoke -- he was in Florida with him before he left, and they met -- Tillerson and the President -- after his meeting with President Xi concluded. And they've talked I think since then as well.\nQ: So this message that these -- it's pretty stark, harsh words from Secretary Tillerson this morning about Russia. Is that -- can that be interpreted as a message from the President to Russia?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know the nature of their final conversation. I know there's been some evolution of the intelligence that we have and the actions that have been taken since Friday. So I don't know where the conversations have laid off, but I think Secretary Tillerson clearly speaks on behalf of the United States and the President's position.\nJohn.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Two foreign policy-related questions. You're speaking about Secretary Tillerson's trip, and I'd like to do a follow-up on the question I asked two weeks ago. Is he scheduled to meet with Mr. Navalny or Mr. Khodorkovsky or any of the civil society representatives outside of government?\nMR. SPICER: I'll refer you back to the State Department the same way I did two weeks ago. I think they are in charge of his schedule, so I think it's best to look at the State Department.\nQ: And has the President or anyone in the administration been in touch with President Erdogan on all of the actions in Syria?\nMR. SPICER: I do believe that someone -- either the Vice President or the Secretary of Defense spoke with him last week, but I'd have to check. I know there was a series of foreign leader and head-of-government calls to both defense minister and heads of state, but I'd have to check. I thought he was on that list, but off the top of my head I cannot recall.\nMajor.\nQ: You said at the top that you hope that Secretary Tillerson will be able to clearly convey to the Russians the sentiments of the U.S. government. Is that enhanced by a meeting directly with the Secretary and President Putin? And if there is no meeting like that, would the President of the United States consider his Secretary of State snubbed by the Russian President?\nMR. SPICER: Well, obviously, he's going to meet with Foreign Minister Lavrov; that's his counterpart. I think that's the job of a foreign minister and a Secretary of State, to meet with each other. They're the counterparts. And I think that if he didn't meet with President Putin, that he can convey his sentiments and thoughts of the United States to the foreign minister.\nQ: Would the history of Putin meeting with Kerry and with previous secretaries of state influence the President's judgment on that?\nMR. SPICER: We'll have to see. I'm not going to -- I mean, we're not there yet. So I think to prejudge the outcome of the visit --\nQ: (Inaudible) the President -- in other words, for Tillerson to see Putin on this visit even though there are very specific things you want to convey to the Russian government.\nMR. SPICER: No, but I would say that there's a bit of irony that for all of these talks that have been perpetuated about back channels and direct links, that now it's, well, they won't meet with you, and does that undermine the relationship that I've heard time and time again.\nQ: I'm just asking if the President considers it important.\nMR. SPICER: No, I understand that. But I think it's interesting that we went from all of these direct links to Russia, to now, are we disappointed that we can't even get a meeting with them. There's a bit of irony in your question.\nQ: I don't even understand your point. I'm asking you, at a time after the United States has called out Russia for a disinformation campaign in Syria for collusion with a government it regards as carrying out a war crime, meeting with the Russian President, is it or is it not a priority for this President to have his Secretary of State convey that directly with the head of the Russian government?\nMR. SPICER: He is conveying that message, and that's what he doing.\nQ: The head of the Russian government -- that's all I'm asking.\nMR. SPICER: But if the head of the Russian government won't meet with him, then he's going to convey it to his counterpart.\nQ: And I'm asking you if that --\nMR. SPICER: And I just said we're not there yet, but I think right now --\nQ: You would not consider that a snub?\nMR. SPICER: No, I think the answer is, is that he's meeting with his counterpart and that's the appropriate person for him to convey that with, and we'll have to wait and see how the meeting goes.\nSteve.\nQ: The Russian President today said that all this talk in the White House about weapons of mass destruction reminds him of what he heard from the White House in 2003. This White House is expressing confidence that sarin gas was used. What do you say to skeptics in Moscow and maybe in other countries, perhaps here at home, who doubt that level of confidence?\nMR. SPICER: I think you had a -- there was a 45-minute briefing with members of the national security team prior to this which they walked through all of that level of confidence that they have. I think that anybody who doubts that in terms of the pictures that were shown and the media that was there wouldn't just be doubting the intelligence but it would be doubting the entire international reporting crew that was there to document all of this.\nThere have been doctors, intelligence communities, media. I mean, I don't think it takes mere eyeballs to recognize what's happening and happened throughout there. So it's not a question of doubting us, it's doubting everybody but Iran, Syria, North Korea, Russia.\nQ: And one other historical villain who used chemical weapons against his own people was Saddam Hussein. It was the policy of the United States government that there should be regime change in Iraq as a result of that and other things. Why shouldn't it be the same policy towards Bashar al-Assad?\nMR. SPICER: I think that you're -- you're trying to act as if -- or the premise of the question suggests that we don't want a new leader. I think I've stated now, two days in a row, that we don't see a peaceful or stable Syria in the future that has Assad as the head of it. Their number-one priority right now for us as a government is to make sure that we stop the threat of ISIS and bring stability to that region.\nBut make no question about it, there is no peaceful and stable Syria in the future that Assad is the head of. That's it, point blank.\nQ: So I just want to clarify, is the U.S. position as far as cooperation with Russia that Russia must admit or agree that Syria was behind the chemical attack, and then also that Russia must disown Assad? Like, can cooperation happen if Russia maintains its position that Syria was not behind that chemical attack?\nMR. SPICER: It's not just behind it. I think that Russia has joined an international agreement regarding not just the use, but possession of. It was Susan Rice who went out and said that Syria no longer had access to chemical weapons. We know that's not true.\nI think that the United States, Russia, and others signed an international agreement that Syria was part of that said that they would not, not only use, but possess chemical weapons. The first thing that we need to do is make sure that we enforce the existing agreement that Russia is a partner to. That's first and foremost.\nAnd I think we need to make sure that we do that because it is in the national interests of the United States to make sure that the proliferation of chemical weapons spreads no further. And that is something that we've got to be very careful of. It's not just the deterrence of future use within those -- but also the proliferation of them throughout the world.\nQ: But at this point, Russia is not even agreeing with the U.S. contention that the Syrian government carried out the attacks.\nMR. SPICER: I understand that, and I think that Secretary Tillerson has just landed a few hours ago, and I think we'll have an opportunity to talk to them.\nBut again, this is not -- I don't -- you know, as I just mentioned to Steve a second ago, I mean, you realize that Russia isn't an island on this. They are not -- this is not some big split as to how this actually happened. The only countries that aren't supporting the U.S.'s position are Syria, North Korea, Iran, and Russia. This is not exactly a happy-time cocktail party of people that you want to be associated with. They are failed states with the exception of Russia.\nSo these individual states -- when Russia is saying that they don't agree with us, they are not siding with other nations of stature. They're agreeing with failed states, and a small number of those as it stands. I think they are staring in the defiance -- or they are defiant in the worldview that doctors, intelligence agencies, reporters, civilians, international experts have all looked at and come to the same conclusion except for them. I don't think there's any other outcome than that.\nWith that, guys, I'll see you back in a little bit. I know we're going to have one more out of our three. Thank you.\nEND 2:19 P.M.

In his remarks, he referred to Secretary of Education Elisabeth P. DeVos; Secretary of Commerce Wilbur L. Ross, Jr.; and Secretary of Transportation Elaine L. Chao.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123815", "text": "The President. Thank you all for being here. Very much appreciate it. I want to thank Steve Schwarzman for putting together this very incredible group of world-class business leaders. That's what you are. Also joining us are Secretary Betsy DeVos, Secretary Wilbur Ross, Secretary Elaine Chao, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, and my Budget Director, Mick Mulvaney. That's an easy job. Where's Mick? [Laughter] Such an easy job. It's the easiest job of anybody in the Government, right, Mick?\nAt the top of our agenda is the creation of great high-paying jobs for American workers. And we've made a lot of process. You see what's going on; you see the numbers. We've created over 600,000 jobs already in a very short period of time, and it's going to really start catching on now, because some of the things that we've done are big league and they are catching on.\nAlready, we've created more than almost 600,000 jobs. And yesterday Toyota just announced that it will invest more than $1.3 billion—it's probably going to be $1.9 billion—into its Georgetown, Kentucky, plant, an investment that would not have been made if we didn't win the election.\nWe have a lot of work to do. In the last two decades, our Nation has lost a third of its manufacturing jobs, and our business tax is one of the highest in the world. It actually is, of developed countries, the single highest tax anywhere in the world.\nFor too long, we've punished production in America and rewarded companies for leaving our country. And we're going to reverse that. We would reward companies, give them incentives to leave. NAFTA is a disaster. It's been a disaster from the day it was devised. And we're going to have some very pleasant surprises for you on NAFTA, that I can tell you.\nMy administration has already taken historic action to unleash job creation. We've signed dozens of bills and executive actions to reduce Federal overreach and expand domestic production.\nOn the environment, we're going to be very, very careful on the environment. It's very important to me and the administration. But we've allowed a lot of companies to go back to work. They were being restricted; their jobs were being restricted. We've unleashed a lot of companies, especially right now in the energy sector; you see what's going on there. It was impossible for people to do what they had to do, and now they can do it. It's all done.\nWe're also working to modernize our economy and harness the full potential of women in the workforce, which is crucial to our economic success. Economic confidence is sweeping the Nation. You saw the new survey that came out. It's at 93, which is the highest it's ever been—93 percent of manufacturers are optimistic about the future. It was a 27 percent increase over 2 months ago when it was also high because of the administration and much higher than it's ever been—93 percent, highest it's ever been.\nThis is just the beginning. We're going to reduce taxes. We're going to eliminate wasteful regulations, which we've already done, probably 25 percent. You can take a look at Dodd-Frank. For the bankers in the room, they'll be very happy, because we're really doing a major streamlining and, perhaps, elimination, and replacing it with something else. But that will be the minimum. But we're doing a major elimination of the horrendous Dodd-Frank regulations, keeping some, obviously, but getting rid of many.\nAnd we're going to put many millions of people back to work. The banks will be able to lend again. So many people come to see me—I see them all the time, small businesses—they're unable to borrow from banks. They never had a problem 5, 6, 7, 10 years ago. They had great bankers. They had great relationships. Now they can't borrow. And we're going to let the banks loan them money, and they can build their businesses.\nSo with your help and insights, we will use the private sector innovation to drive job creation and reform Government. A lot of reform. We have a computer system in this country that's 40 years old. So when you hear we're hacked and we're this, that—we're like easy targets. And one of the things we're doing, in fact—we're working with a very, very wonderful woman from IBM, and others—and others, okay? [Laughter] Many others. It's like when I said to Lockheed, I like the F-35 fighter jet, but then I said, but I also like the Boeing F-18. [Laughter] Okay? [Laughter] So I love your computers, but we're also looking at others, all right?\nBut we are. We're going to have a massive program to modernize our equipment, ideally get brandnew equipment. The cost of maintaining our computers is a number that is so high that it's not even a believable number. Now, I've heard anywhere—is this possible?—from $39 billion to $89 billion a year. Is that even possible? [Laughter] That's for keeping our computers updated and running. And I think we can buy a whole new system for less money than that, wouldn't you say? I mean, I hope so. We'll give you $10 billion right now—modernize it. [Laughter]\nSo I want to thank everybody for being here. I know most of you. You really are the top. And I want to thank my friend, Jack Welch, for being with us too. I've known Jack so long. We did deals together, right? Trump International—a big success—and the other one on Park Avenue. We did—we had great success together with your real estate group who are terrific people. Dale Frey and everybody—right? Terrific. And John. So I just want to thank you. You've been a special guy for a long time.\nAnd we'll get down to business. Maybe before the media leaves, we can go around the room, and we'll just introduce. We all know Steve, and I want to thank you, Steve, for putting the group together.\nForum Chairman and Blackstone Group Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and Cofounder Stephen A. Schwarzman. Thank you.\nThe President. Would you like to say something while all those cameras are running?\nMr. Schwarzman. I think we should say that we've had a really interesting day so far. What we did is we divided into five groups, meeting with each of the five Secretaries that the President mentioned. It's an open discussion. The Secretaries presented what they were trying to achieve, and we had several people from the Forum meeting with them and making comments on what they were doing to, hopefully, make their jobs better.\nWe've been looking at trade, education and workforce development, energy and the environment, regulatory reform, and infrastructure. All these things are really important, and we're focused. The people in the administration are also focused. And working together, hopefully we'll have a bunch of really good outcomes.\nThe President. We will. Chris. White House Director of Strategic Initiatives Christopher Liddell.

EDT\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So I'm here today to provide some context on the President's meeting this afternoon with NATO Secretary General Jens Soltenberg. We expect the two leaders will exchange views on a wide range of topics in preparation for the meeting of NATO heads of state and government in Brussels on May 25th, the President's first foreign trip since taking office.\nIn his meeting with the Secretary General, we expect the President will reaffirm the strong commitment of the United States to NATO, and the value he places on the transatlantic bond in general. He will emphasize the ironclad U.S. commitment to the collective defense of NATO allies under Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty.\nThe President will also highlight the importance of NATO allies taking on their fair share of the burden of the collective defense of the North Atlantic region. In that connection, we expect the President and Secretary General to discuss how they can work with other NATO allies to increase defense budgets in line with the 2014 Wales pledge on defense investment. As a reminder, the Wales pledge commits all allies to \"aim to move toward spending 2 percent of GDP on defense, and of that 2 percent, to dedicate at least 20 percent to equipment procurement, and research and development.\"\nThe President and the Secretary General will also discuss NATO's role in supporting international efforts to fight terrorism globally. On Afghanistan, the President and Secretary General will discuss the ongoing review of our policy in order to ensure our efforts are fully coordinated with NATO allies and partners.\nOn Iraq, the two will discuss NATO's ongoing training and capacity-building mission in Iraq, as well as potential additional contributions we could make to the international effort to support Iraq in countering ISIS.\nFinally, we expect the President and the Secretary General to talk about NATO's approach to Russia and to emphasize that Russia must uphold all of its commitments under the Minsk agreements to peacefully resolve the conflict in Eastern Ukraine.\nAnd before I get to questions, of course, I would just remind everyone that on Monday, President Trump signed the United States instrument of ratification of the protocol for Montenegro's accession to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and this followed, of course, the Senate's March 28th overwhelming and bipartisan vote of advice and consent in support of ratification.\nSo with that, I will take your questions.\nQ: To what extent will they discuss Russia's violation of the IMF treaty and options of how to respond? What are some of those options?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Sure. I can't get into any specific options that they will discuss, but I imagine that will come up in the context of the broader Russia discussion that they'll have today.\nQ: Is this going to be an awkward discussion, given that President Trump had called NATO \"obsolete\" during the campaign?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I don't anticipate it will be an awkward discussion. I think that the Secretary General has made clear that he also views it as a priority to get allies to shoulder a greater burden of defense investment. And so the President and Secretary General are likely to see eye-to-eye on that issue and talk about ways that they can cooperate together to work with allies to get defense spending up.\nQ: Do you think that the President's view of NATO has evolved since the campaign?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, I can't comment on any comments that were made during the campaign or the transition, and of course, I don't know exactly -- I can't speak for what's in the President's mind right now, but the President has made it very clear repeatedly that he's 100 percent committed to NATO. He has met already with several leader of NATO-allied countries -- the UK, Germany, the Prime Minister of Denmark last week. He's made over a dozen calls to leaders of NATO-allied countries and emphasized to all of them that he's 100 percent committed to the Alliance.\nQ: You talked a lot about the 2 percent goal that was agreed in Wales. For Germany, that represents something like, what $60 billion additional spending per year on the military. What exactly do you want them to spend it on?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Say the last part again.\nQ: What exactly would you like Germany to spend $60 billion a year on?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, of course, the Germans have signed up to the Wales pledge, as have the other allies. And in the President's meeting with Chancellor Merkel in March, Chancellor Merkel expressed very clearly that she and the German government continue to support the Wales pledge commitment to aim to move towards 2 percent of GDP by 2024. So it was not an area of disagreement between the President and the Chancellor. The Chancellor is firmly committed, as is her ruling coalition.\nQ: So what's the -- sorry to monopolize this -- so what's the goal? Everybody in Europe increase their spending so that your U.S. forces can scale down in Europe? I mean, what's the end goal?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: It's about doing more, having the Alliance be able to do more. And so, again, we have been shouldering a disproportionate share of defense expenditures and, of course, those are not contributions to NATO, those are all national budgets. But we want the Alliance to be able to do more to confront the security challenges of the 21st century. And that means having all allies invest seriously in their defense. And that's why this agreement was made during the Wales Summit, to aim to move towards 2 percent, which, of course, was set as the benchmark at that time.\nQ: The 2 percent goal, though -- President Trump, when he met with Merkel last month, suggested that that was retroactive, and then he also said that that is money owed directly to the United States, not for the common defense. Is that a negotiating position of the President? Is that new U.S. policy? What did he mean by that?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, of course, national defense budgets we know are not owed to NATO. There is a NATO common fund, and allies pay into that in a cost-sharing formula that's calculated based on their gross national income. And that's set. The United States' contribution is capped at 22 percent.\nBut separate from that are the national defense budgets and, of course, those are not owed to NATO. This commitment was not retroactive. But the President was probably making a broader point here that, for many, many years, Germany -- not only Germany, but many other allies have been chronically underinvesting in their defense. And so, again, we need to start to right this curve. And in 2015 and 2016, we saw, for the first time, the collective decline in NATO allies' national defense budgets was arrested, and it started to peak back up.\nSo again, we're on the right trajectory. And we refer back to the Wales pledge from 2014, of course, which gets allies to aim to move towards 2 percent by 2024.\nQ: Two specific questions about two different parts of the world. First, the Balkans -- Montenegro's membership, that's been greenlighted by the White House. Can you give us some idea of the thinking there and the timing of that? Because it seems rather odd to announce that just before the difficult meetings with Secretary Tillerson in Moscow.\nAnd the second question on a very different part of the world -- Afghanistan. As you know, General Nicholson is asking for new troops there. He heads a NATO command -- Resolute Support. What is -- that, I assume, will come up in the discussions today. What's the current thinking on the extra troops in Afghanistan?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So I'll answer the Montenegro question, and then I'll turn to my colleague on Afghanistan.\nSo Montenegro's accession will strengthen NATO and U.S. security by bringing a capable and committed partner in the alliance. Montenegrin troops have stood shoulder-to-shoulder in Afghanistan with U.S. and allied troops for a decade already. Montenegro now spends 1.7 percent of its GDP in defense -- a higher proportion than all but six other NATO allies. They've demonstrated political will and courage in implementing important military and rule of law reforms, setting an example for other NATO aspirants.\nMontenegro's accession will also increase stability and security in the Western Balkans. After meeting rigorous standards to join the Alliance, Montenegro's accession will make clear that no third country has a veto over a country's sovereign decision to join NATO. So the door to membership in the Euro-Atlantic community of nations remains open.\nAnd I would also just like to say that we are very concerned about Russian interference in the October elections in Montenegro, including credible reports of Russian support for an attempted election day attack on the government. The United States supports the efforts of the Montenegrin authorities to investigate this case in accordance with Montenegrin law. And we refer you to the government of Montenegro for any further commentary on that.\nQ: If I could follow up on that before you move on the Afghanistan. You could have read that statement after this difficult meeting underway right now in Moscow. It clearly was a decision to announce this just before the Secretary of State went there. Why?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I'm not going to comment on the specific timing of that. Of course, the Senate's vote was on March 28th, and there was a certain procedure for the protocols to get here to the White House, et cetera. And we need to take certain steps to make sure that the instrument of ratification is deposited at the State Department in time for the leaders meeting in May. But I'm not going to comment on any specific timing.\nSo, on Afghanistan.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So on Afghanistan, we are undergoing a strategy review for our plans in Afghanistan in the future. We'll be obviously consulting with General Nicholson, both in his role as commander of Resolute Support, but also as commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan. And we'll definitely be working with NATO allies in advance of any decisions being made on troop levels in Afghanistan to make sure that those decisions are fully consulted and that allies are on board with our strategy going forward.\nQ: And a quick follow-up: What's the time frame of this review? Do you have an idea of when --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We're hoping to get it done as soon as we can. Obviously there are processes within NATO in terms of force generation that need a quicker answer rather than later, but we're not going to comment on a specific timeline. It's based on when the President makes a decision.\nQ: Has Russia's behavior in Syria changed the President's thinking about the importance of NATO? The events of the last couple of weeks -- has that shifted the President's calculation on how important NATO is?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, so I can't comment on what specifically is in the President's mind right now, but he has been very firm that he is 100 percent committed to NATO. Again, I think that position remains unchanged, and probably was reinforced by, again, everything that Russia is doing. But I can't speak specifically to his current thinking.\nQ: Thank you. You said the door to membership in the Euro-Atlantic community remains open. Does that mean that the President would be open to more countries joining NATO? And is that something that will be discussed, further expansion of the Alliance?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So, again, I won't comment on whether that topic will be discussed. And there's no current plans for further enlargement, so I can't speculate on that discussion in the future. But again, the bringing in of Montenegro into the Alliance reaffirms the principle that the door is open.\nQ: Despite Syria not being a member of NATO, do you anticipate at the joint press conference there's going to be extensive conversation about some things NATO members could do to help civilians in Syria? Obviously, there's been conversations of no-fly zones and also assisting around the borders of Syria.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I can't comment on that.\nQ: Obviously, Montenegro is a sore spot for Russia. And given all the other things, to what extent is the administration concerned that this move will just exacerbate or increase the tensions with Russia?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: The specific move of taking in Montenegro?\nQ: Yes.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I don't know that I have a specific response on that. Again, we saw what Russia did -- and I mentioned previously our concern about the reports of Russian interference in the election in Montenegro in October and credible reports of Russian support for an attempted election day attack. But again, I can't comment on that.\nQ: And just a follow-up, a broader question. NATO, the United States, and Russia -- is there a concern that we're moving to a posture that's closer to the Cold War than we've been in the last 30 years or so?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, I would refer you to Secretary Mattis's comments yesterday, again, that we don't want escalation. And, of course, Secretary Tillerson is in Moscow today, and obviously we understand that we need dialogue with Russia -- that's very important. But we need to explore with them what areas we could concretely cooperate on, and it's important for Russia to show its seriousness about cooperating with us, and again, reintegrating into the rules-based order.\nQ: Thank you. On what you just mentioned, the Russian support for an election day attack on the government of Montenegro -- what exactly does that mean, an election day attack on the government? And from what you know, is it similar in its tactics and means to what the Russian government might have done here?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So I would refer you back to the Montenegrin government for the up-to-date commentary on their investigation, which, of course, we completely support. But in regards to Montenegro, the credible reports we had were in reference to a violent election day attack, obviously very different than what we were looking at here and of much greater concern.\nQ: Because the Wales pledge is a percentage of GDP, a contraction in the economies of any of the NATO countries would also get them closer to the 2 percent level. So what is the President going to ask for in terms of net new dollars that these countries would be contributing?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, obviously, we don't want any economies of NATO members to contract. That would be bad. We saw that happen in Greece, and that's how they got to 2 percent. We obviously don't wish that on anyone. But I'll let my colleague just comment on the net dollars.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: NATO has a regular five-year cycle called the NATO Defense Planning Process, which takes a look at all the things that the collective governments want NATO to do in terms of operations and other activities. And it looks at very mathematically and very formulaically what capabilities are needed to reach NATO's level of ambition; then looks at all the military inventories of the NATO allies to determine what allies already have; and then looks at a gap analysis of what allies don't have that's needed and then apportions that out amongst the 28 allies.\nSo every ally will be assigned a certain number of capability targets that they need to invest in moving forward. We would encourage allies to focus on investing in those capabilities, first and foremost.\nQ: The Secretary General is on record saying that while defense spending is important, development spending is also important. Are you all expecting any sort of pushback from Stoltenberg on the President's budget in terms of foreign aid?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, I can't comment on what specifically the Secretary General will say. But, again, I expect there to be a discussion certainly of defense spending, and this is probably going to be an element of it, as well -- how we think about security.\nQ: How will the President defend his proposed cuts in foreign --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I can't comment on that.\nQ: To follow up, a kind of overarching question, the President wants to ask for all of these countries to meet their targets, but the question about what happens if they don't is sort of still lingering out there. Is the President going to make clear what's going to happen from the U.S. perspective if these countries don't meet their targets? Is there any consequence for not meeting the targets?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So I can't comment on any future actions or potential consequences or anything like that. But Secretary Mattis made clear when he was at the NATO defense ministerial in February that we're hoping to have all allies draft and deliver a plan by the end of the year on how they plan to meet the Wales investment pledge. And again, as he said, if we're in the same place by the end of the year that we are now, that's not going to be a great thing. So, again, we're hoping to work with NATO allies in a constructive manner within the terms and the confines of reality to really make progress on this defense investment pledge.\nQ: So just a quick follow-up. The credible report of plans for a violent attack, that comes from the Montenegran government? Or is that intelligence that -- without getting into details, is that something that we have, that the U.S. government has?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So I would refer you back to the Montenegran government for more information on that.\nQ: Okay.\nQ: So last month, General Scaparrotti talked about a disinformation campaign in the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, and it seemed like that was something that he was looking to coordinate better with European allies. Is that something that would fall under NATO's cyber command, and is there any plan to allocate more resources to that?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So I would say, first and foremost, NATO doesn't have a cyber command. At the Warsaw Summit in 2016, they recognized cyber as an operational domain, and so they're continuing to look at how cyber can integrate into NATO's activities across the board.\nOn General Scaparrotti's comments to the Senate Armed Services Committee, we are concerned about Russian malign influences across Europe, and we're taking steps both bilaterally with our allies and partners in Europe, and also talking about this in NATO, as well.\nQ: Will that be part of the discussion of the delegation today?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: It might come up. It's not something that we're planning on coming up. I don't think so, no.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I'd like to thank everyone for being here. Thank you for your time. And you will receive the one-pager after this. Remember, it's embargoed until 10:30 a.m. Thanks.\nEND 9:48 A.M.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123857", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n5:16 P.M. EDT\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: Okay, so it's been an eventful week, I think. And I think by any standards, you should characterize it or could characterize it as an extremely successful week for the United States of America and American citizens.\nIf you think about it, really, just last Tuesday, there was a chemical weapons strike against innocents in Syria, and it was then that the national security team assembled to assess the situation and provide options to the President. And then, by Thursday -- Thursday or Friday?\nAIDE: Thursday.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thursday, the President was able to make a decision to respond to that chemical weapons strike with -- an attack, a brutal attack -- with a strike against the Syrian regime's ability to conduct that strike on the actual airfield where that strike initiated.\nAnd as all of you know, this happened in the context of a major and national summit with Premier Xi -- a summit that was conducted simultaneous with that whole decision-making process and that resulted in tremendous success, a success because the two leaders were able to establish a close relationship. They had a lot of one-on-one time during that summit. And while it was never the expectation of anyone to resolve any issues or big problems that we're facing, there was broad and deep agreement on what the greatest problems and opportunities were that bear on the relationship, the U.S. and Chinese relationship. And, of course, no surprise to any of you, that is North Korea, first and foremost, in the security area, and then trade in the economic area.\nSo based on that agreement and based on that relationship, there was a strong basis for those two leaders going forward as we confront some of the biggest difficulties and opportunities that our nations are going to confront in the days and months and years ahead.\nVery soon after that summit, it became clear that Russia was not playing a constructive role in the wake of the Syrian regime's murderous attack, and, in fact, was engaged in a very sophisticated propaganda and disinformation campaign designed to allow the Assad regime to escape responsibility for these heinous acts. And, of course, what we did is responded, along with all of our friends and allies across the world, in a way that made it quite clear that Russia was extremely isolated on this issue and on the issue of Syria broadly, and the behavior of the Assad regime broadly.\nOf course, this is all happening in the context of our campaign against ISIS and al Qaeda-related groups such as al Nusra in Syria and in Iraq, but broadly across the globe. And those efforts continue apace during this time, especially operations alongside Iraqi forces, inside of Iraq, and operations along the Euphrates River Valley inside of Syria.\nSo sort of summarizing this, just to give you a sense for a very high degree of concurrent activity. Also at this period of time is in the midst of a review on a number of policy reviews, including a policy review involving the increasing threat of North Korea. And as I mentioned, this was the primary topic in a security dialogue down at Mar-a-Lago. And so what occurred in the last 24 hours is the President giving very strong guidance to our national security team, including our great Secretary of State, Secretary Tillerson, who traveled to Russia in the wake of the murderous attack in Syria. And our response and now, of course, the international community's response has been a resounding combination of the Assad regime's behavior to engage in talks with Foreign Minister Lavrov and with Mr. Putin.\nYou saw the press conference on the back end of this, and what that does is it indicates, really, that when you're able to frame a problem set and a set of opportunities, and able to establish your objectives, and then to build common understanding with allies and partners, you can accomplish very positive things. And while it was very important for us, very important for us to call out Russia for their sponsorship, along with Iran, of this murderous regime, we also thought it important at this stage to highlight the tremendous opportunity that's available to Russia to begin to play a productive role in this humanitarian and political catastrophe across the greater Middle East, and to help us, along with our partners, to move toward a resolution of that Syrian civil war, the defeat of ISIS and al Qaeda-related groups, such as al Nusra and so forth -- these (inaudible) or jihadist group across the region -- and to do so in a way that also limits Iran's destabilizing influence, which we know has continued to throw fuel on the fire of this extraordinarily destructive civil war that's going on across the region.\nSo the press conference I think speaks for itself and the tremendous job our Secretary did, but I'd like to also highlight the role that President Xi played -- maybe not a readily (inaudible) role -- in China's abstention for the vote in the United Nations today, which is another, I think, significant victory for all civilized peoples, because it really showed how isolated that regime, the Assad regime, and its sponsors are from any degree of international support. And it was the relationship, the relationship that was solidified at Mar-a-Lago, that helped make that possible, and helped these two leaders work together based on common interest and a common recognition that was a very -- and egregious situation to cut against not only the interests of the United States and China, but against the interests of all civilized peoples.\nSo if you just think about that range of concurrent activity across the past week -- I think a week or so -- from, really, an egregious attack in Syria that highlighted all the complexities of that problem, involving the regime, involving terrorist organizations, involving very complex regional and political dynamics, as you're all aware, involving the role of Iran and Russia in supporting this force -- or this regime, the Assad regime, to working on the relationship between the leaders of the United States, our President and Premier Xi, and then applying that newly formed relationship to complex problem sets from the Middle East to Northeast Asia, and then a result in the United Nations -- it helps advance our mutual interests and the interests of all civilized people.\nSo I think it's difficult to portray this as anything but a really great week for our citizens and the United States.\nQ: Thanks so much. Japanese media is reporting that the USS Carl Vinson is in operations with the Japanese naval forces. As you know, they have a (inaudible) coming up. North Korea often likes missile into the Sea of Japan. What happens if there is an altercation this week between North Korean forces and Japanese and U.S. forces? And how will you prevent this from spiraling into a broader military conflict?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: Well, as you heard from the President many times, we're not in the business of trying to predict with a high degree of certainty precisely what our response is going to be. I think what we demonstrated last week was the ability of the President's national security team to come together, convened by the National Security Council, to look at events such as those that might occur on the Korean Peninsula, quickly analyze those events, place them in context with U.S. vital interests, establish objectives that protect American citizens and advance our interests, and then develop and present the President with options.\nSo we have a team that is, I think, particularly adept at doing that. And if there were to be continued destabilizing and aggressive behavior by the North Korean regime, that's how the national security team would respond.\nQ: Did the President personally ask President Xi and China to abstain from the U.N. resolution? And I have a second question on Russia. The President said relations are at an all-time low. What will it take for them to improve relations there?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: On the conversation with President Xi, I don't think the President would want me to go into the specifics of the conversation. I would just say that it was a very warm conversation based on not only the two leaders meeting, but their spouses meeting, and President Xi's ability to meet the President's extended family, and especially his grandchildren, which had, I think, a big effect on the relationship.\nI think what I can say about the conversation is that it was a very frank and open conversation about two very complicated problems -- one in the Middle East involving Syria, and one in Northeast Asia involving the North Korean regime and its behavior and the unacceptable threat posed by a regime such as that that has nuclear weapons.\nSo it was a great conversation, and I think that President Xi's decision speaks for itself in terms of his leadership and his determination to not obstruct the U.N.'s ability to sanction the Assad regime for its behavior.\nAnd in terms of the exercises with Japan, I just think it is obviously prudent for us to maintain our high level of vigilance in Northeast Asia, and it's also prudent for us to maintain the close relationships and high-level training that we have with our allies in the region.\nQ: And what about Russia -- how to improve -- what should they do to improve relations?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, I'll defer to my colleague on that because he's the one who just had the conversations. But it sounds like, from the press conference that they did, that there is a way ahead. And you mentioned the working groups and so forth. You have probably as good a knowledge as I do on that right now based on the press conference.\nQ: A couple questions. One, why do we hold Syria accountable for its use of chemical weapons but not Russia for its support of Syria using its chemical weapons? What's the policy thought behind that?\nTwo, is there any movement in terms of our Special Forces in Syria? Are you taking any precautions to ensure that there isn't any retaliation against them? And lastly, how are we doing in Raqqa? Has this operation impacted our resources in terms of our ability to go into Raqqa and recapture the city?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Okay, for the last one first, it has not impacted in any way the offensive in Raqqa. I defer any specifics for you to follow back to the Defense Department.\nI think it wasn't just us, but I think it was the entire international community that is holding not only the Assad regime but its sponsors responsible for this reprehensible and inhumane behavior of the regime that involves the chemical attack but also involves indiscriminate mass murder attacks against its citizens and through a number of other means as well.\nQ: I have two questions for you. You've cited the abstention by China in today's U.N. Security Council vote as a positive step for our national security. There has also been news today that the President is no longer labeling China a \"currency manipulator.\" Circumstantially, it seems as perhaps those two events could be related. Is that accurate? Was there some sort of, perhaps, deal worked out at the summit or negotiations that the President undertook?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I'll defer to my colleague on that. But I will just say in general that both decisions were made on the merits of those decisions separately. There was no explicit linkage that I'm aware of between the two of those.\nQ: And then my second question on Russia. You said that there's a tremendous opportunity available to the Kremlin to play a role here while, at the same time, obviously having very harsh language against the Assad regime. What gives you personally -- you've seen this -- what gives you hope that Russia is just going to change its mind?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, I think that maybe with the very strong international condemnation of their support for the Assad regime that this could change. And also I think what you have seen in the last week is a United States that is committed to leading in the region. And that creates opportunities for all kinds of people -- even Russia. And so I think that it's time for a recalculation of how they can best protect their interests there.\nQ: After the strike?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: And for us, you know, maybe it's not as rational as it should be. But based on what Russian interests are in Syria, there is no reason that we can see that they can't pursue their interests in a way that would allow them to be more productive and helpful in ending that civil war and moving toward a sustainable political outcome.\nThere also, as you know, have been some very dedicated diplomats working on this from an international perspective for many years. And even they who have been working on it for many years are encouraged -- skeptically so, maybe -- but encouraged by recent developments. And we owe it to humanity, we owe it to the Syrian people to do everything we can to allow Russia an avenue to play a productive role.\nSo I was going to go to all the way in the back.\nQ: What is the difference between Syrian civilians getting killed by chlorine bombs versus by sarin gas? Would the use of chlorine bombs, which the regime has used several times in the past, be a new red line for this administration?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, it wasn't a new red line, the use of chemical weapons. The weapons -- the nerve agent in particular. But the President, as you know, in every question he's asked about this, doesn't think it's really helpful to speculate about what a reaction will be in a specific case. What he's determined to do is do what's best for the American people in every one of these instances.\nWhat we have been able to do across the national security team -- and by that I mean all the departments and agencies and their heads coming together -- is I think we've been able to impart a much higher degree of clarity to our policy by framing these problem sets. Whether it's the approach to China and that relationship, or the very serious problem associated with North Korea and the Korean regime and its nuclear capabilities; the very complicated and difficult situation in Syria and across into Iraq involving ISIS, but also the sectarian civil war and the civil war broadly, and the multi-party conflict in Syria; the role of Iran; the relationship with Russia and how to deter Russia's destabilizing behavior, but also the ability to look for areas of cooperation.\nSo these are really strategic problems and opportunities. And what we've been able to do in just a few short weeks is frame those problems and opportunities to understand the situations in each of these areas, to view those situations through the lens of our vital interests and the vital interests of the American people, the security of the American people and the nation's interest, and then to establish objectives.\nSo what's happening now is -- when events happen, we are able then to understand better how to sort of torque that even or to regard that event in a way that allows us to respond to it and move toward an objective. And so what this also allows for is a much higher degree of common understanding with our allies and partners and across our government as well.\nSo what you're seeing is a team now I think that's able to achieve a much higher degree of agility in the area of foreign relations and the area of national security. And I think it's going to continue to pay off in the weeks and months ahead as well.\nQ: Thank you. You said we owe it to humanity to give Russia -- to play a role. Would the U.S. consider joining, getting involved somehow in the Astana talks already going on?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, I would ask Secretary Tillerson that question. I know that we're fully supportive of the Geneva process. I know that, of course, the dynamics have changed now, and we'll see how they've changed.\nWhat we would like to do is to use this opportunity for a reevaluation for all the parties to understand better how to use this new situation to move more rapidly toward a sustainable, political outcome in Syria that resolves that civil war and results, obviously, in the defeat of ISIS, al Qaeda and related groups -- denies them the ability to control population centers and territory in Syria and Iraq -- and then allows the consolidation of those military gains politically such that reconstruction can begin, the return of refugees and the long-suffering Syrian people in particular can return.\nSo to answer your question indirectly, we know that there has to be a political process. We're very supportive of the Geneva process, and obviously I think the President will rely on Secretary Tillerson to determine whether or not there's a role for Astana in the days and weeks ahead.\nQ: You used the word \"events.\" It reminds us of Prime Minister -- British Prime Minister Macmillan: Events, events, events, needless to say. When will events -- this is a question of urgency -- can events actually spiral out of control? And might it be time for the two most powerful men in the world -- President Trump and President Putin -- to meet together for their own special summit to try to resolve all of these issues?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, obviously, that's up to the President and President Putin. I think what you see is an extremely positive and appropriate step taken already with Secretary Tillerson's visit, during which he had extensive talks with Foreign Minister Lavrov and President Putin. And so it really remains to be seen based on the work that Secretary Tillerson has done there what an appropriate path ahead is.\nSo again, as you know, from the President's many interactions with you, he is not doctrinaire about very many things, and he will look at this opportunistically. I think what you've seen with the President in the last couple -- at least I have as a member of the team here -- is someone who sees possibilities where many others would see only difficulties.\nQ: So you're saying that that possibility is off the table?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: No, no, I'm not. I didn't say that. Come on. (Laughter.)\nQ: Thank you.\nQ: Thank you. The President described relations possibly at an all-time low. Secretary Tillerson echoed those comments as well. Vladimir Putin said that they appear \"deteriorated.\" Yet you just described today as a positive step, and you also said that there appears to be a way ahead. So I'm trying to grasp both of those. My first question to you I guess is, is today viewed as a good day? It didn't apparently seem that way.\nThen my second question, if you don't mind, on the call last night, can you say if currency manipulation was discussed with President Xi?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, I'm not going to talk about the content of those phone calls because I think having a privileged channel of communication between Premier Xi and the President is really important to have. So I just want both leaders to be confident that the discussions they have can be held in confidence, and that's really best for everybody.\nIn terms of the Russian threat, it really gets to the previous question on recognizing that there is always a risk, right? That there could be unintended consequences of any action, and it is much better to talk than to not talk.\nAnd when I was alluding to a way ahead I was really alluding to a way ahead procedurally that Secretary Tillerson had laid out in his press conference with Foreign Minister Lavrov. Whether or not anything positive substantively happens, that remains to be seen obviously.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Okay, so I'll do one more.\nQ: One option that the President himself has mentioned several times is safe zones. Where is that option now? Is that under active consideration? And how exactly would that work? Could Raqqa, for example, become a safe zone if it's liberated?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, as you know, in the areas in the far south and some of the areas in the east and areas in the -- I'm sorry, in the west -- and the northeast, those areas where as these brutal, murderous criminals, terrorists are defeated become a safe zone. And for those of you who have been in these areas, you know that it's almost astonishing how quickly life can return to these areas and to people who have suffered almost unspeakable brutality.\nSo there already some safe zones, right? And while really what is important is how can the security gains be translated into sustainable, political outcomes consistent with the kind of security that we'd like to see -- enduring security for the Syrian people and a political settlement and a resolution that's in our mutual interest, right?\nAnd so that's the work that has to be done. And you know that there are some key people at the U.N. working on this, and we're working in partnership with many others, and we hope maybe with even more partners in the future to be able to move to that political outcome.\nThanks a lot, everybody.\nQ: Thank you.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Just a reminder, we were on background, senior administration official. Thanks.\nQ: No embargo, right?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: No, embargoed till it's over, so now it's over.\nEND 5:40 P.M.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "note": "The President's news conference began at 4:03 p.m. in the East Room at the White House. In his remarks, the President referred to President Bashar al-Asad of Syria; National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster; President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia; and Secretary of Defense James N. Mattis. He also referred to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) terrorist organization.

Mark De Alencar, USA, who was killed conducting counterterrorism operations in Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan, on April 8.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123739", "text": "President Trump. Thank you. Secretary General Stoltenberg, it's a pleasure to welcome you to the White House, especially at such an important moment in our great alliance.\nI also want to acknowledge the great work being done by our Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, to strengthen the NATO alliance, as well as the Secretary's trip to Moscow to promote the security interest of the United States and its allies. He did a terrific job—just watched parts of it—did an absolutely terrific job.\nSixty-eight years ago this month, not far from where we are gathered today, President Harry Truman spoke at the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty. In the nearly seven decades since Harry Truman spoke those words, the NATO alliance has been the bulwark of international peace and security.\nNATO allies defeated communism and liberated the captive nations of the cold war. They secured the longest period of unbroken peace that Europe has ever known. This enduring partnership is rooted out of so many different things, but our common security is always number one, and our common devotion to human dignity and freedom.\nSince 1949, the NATO member states have more than doubled, increasing from 12 to 28. On Monday, I signed the protocol to approve the 29th, the country of Montenegro. In the coming months and years, I'll work closely with all of our NATO allies to enhance this partnership and to adapt to the challenges of the future, of which there will be many. This includes upgrading NATO to focus on today's most pressing security and all of its challenges, including migration and terrorism.\nWe must also work together to resolve the disaster currently taking place in Syria. We are grateful for the support of NATO members and partners in their condemnation of Asad's murderous attack, using the most horrible weapons. The vicious slaughter of innocent civilians with chemical weapons, including the barbaric killing of small and helpless children and babies, must be forcefully rejected by any nation that values human life. It is time to end this brutal civil war, defeat terrorists, and allow refugees to return home.\nIn facing our common challenges, we must also ensure that NATO members meet their financial obligations and pay what they owe. Many have not been doing that. The Secretary General and I agree that other member nations must satisfy their responsibility to contribute 2 percent of GDP to defense. If other countries pay their fair share, instead of relying on the United States to make up the difference, we will all be much more secure and our partnership will be made that much stronger.\nThe Secretary General and I had a productive discussion about what more NATO can do in the fight against terrorism. I complained about that a long time ago and they made a change, and now they do fight terrorism. I said it was obsolete; it's no longer obsolete. It's my hope that NATO will take on an increased role in supporting our Iraqi partners in their battle against ISIS. I'm also sending General McMaster to Afghanistan to find out how we can make progress alongside our Afghan partners and NATO allies. Every generation has strived to adapt the NATO alliance to meet the challenges of their times, and on my visit to Brussels this spring, which I look very much forward to, we will work together to do the same. We must not be trapped by the tired thinking that so many have, but apply new solutions to face new circumstances. And that's all throughout the world. We're not here to stand on ceremony, but to develop real strategies to achieve safety, security, and peace. We're here to protect the freedom and prosperity of our citizens and to give them the future they so richly deserve.\nSecretary General, I'm honored to have you here today and to reaffirm our commitment to this alliance and to the enduring values that we proudly—and I mean, very proudly—share. Thank you very much. Thank you for being here. Thank you.\nSecretary General Stoltenberg. Thank you, sir. Thank you so much, sir, Mr. President.\nWe just had an excellent and very productive meeting, and it's really an honor to meet you for the first time here in the White House.\nWe agree that NATO is a bedrock of security, both for Europe and for the United States. Two world wars and a cold war have taught us all that peace in Europe is not only important for Europeans, but is also important for the prosperity and the security of North America. So a strong NATO is good for Europe, but a strong NATO is also good for the United States.\nAnd therefore, I welcome the very strong commitment of the United States to the security of Europe. We see this commitment not only in words, but also in deeds. Over the past months, thousands of U.S. troops have been deploying to Europe, a clear demonstration that America stands with allies to protect peace and defend our freedom. And yesterday you announced the completion of the ratification of Montenegro's membership in NATO, another expression of your strong commitment to Europe and to the transatlantic bond. And we thank you for that.\nIn a more dangerous and more unpredictable world, it is important to have friends and allies. And in NATO, America has the best friends and the best allies in the world. Together, we represent half of the world's economic and military power. No other superpower has ever had such a strategic advantage. This makes the United States stronger and safer.\nWe saw that after the 9/11 attacks on the United States. That was the first time NATO invoked our article 5, the collective defense clause. Allies sent AWACS surveillance planes to help patrol American skies, and we launched NATO's biggest military operation ever in Afghanistan. Hundreds of thousands of Europeans and Canadian soldiers have served shoulder-to-shoulder with American troops. More than a thousand have paid the ultimate price.\nEarlier today I laid a wreath at Arlington National Cemetery in tribute to the fallen. It was a deeply moving experience. We owe it to our service men and women to preserve the hard-earned gains we have made together in Afghanistan. We were reminded of their sacrifice just this week when a U.S. soldier was killed there fighting ISIL. Our mission in Afghanistan is a major contribution to the fight against international terrorism.\nNATO plays a key role in many other ways also. All NATO allies are part of the global coalition to counter ISIL, and NATO provides direct support to the coalition with training for Iraqi forces in their fight against terrorists and more intelligence sharing. And you are right: We have established a new division for intelligence, which enhances our ability to fight terrorism and working together in the alliance to fight terrorism in an even more effective way. But we agreed today, you and I, that NATO can, and must, do more in the global fight against terrorism. In the fight against terrorism, training local forces is one of the best weapons we have. NATO has the experience, the expertise, and the staying power to make a real difference, and fighting terrorism will be an important topic when NATO leaders meet in Brussels in May.\nThe other major topic will be fairer burden sharing in our alliance. And we had a total discussion on this issue today. And, Mr. President, I thank you for your attention to this issue. We are already seeing the effect of your strong focus on the importance of burden sharing in the alliance. We agree that allies need to redouble their efforts to meet the pledge we all made in 2014 to invest more in our alliance.\nIt is about spending more on defense. It is about delivering the capabilities we need. And it is about contributing forces to NATO missions and operations. This means cash, capabilities, and contributions.\nFair burden sharing has been my top priority since taking office. We have now turned a corner. In 2016, for the first time in many years, we saw an increase in defense spending across European allies and Canada, a real increase of 3.8 percent or $10 billion more for our defense. We are now working to keep up the momentum, including by developing national plans outlining how to make good on what we agreed in 2014. We know that we all need to contribute our fair share because we need to keep our nations safe in a more dangerous world.\nWe discussed many different topics during our meeting today, including the horrendous use of chemical weapons in Syria. Any use of chemical weapons is unacceptable, cannot go unanswered, and those responsible must be held accountable.\nSo, Mr. President, thank you once again. I look forward to working with you to keeping the alliance strong, and I look forward to welcoming you to Brussels in May when heads of state and government in the alliance meet there to address the challenges and the need to continue to adapt the alliance to a more challenging security environment and to respond both to the need for fairer burden sharing and stepping up our efforts to fight international terrorism. So thank you, once again.\nThe President. Thank you very much. Great. Thank you.\nSo we'll have a couple of questions.\nJeff Mason [Reuters].\nRussia-U.S. Relations/China-U.S. Relations\nQ. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. I'd like to ask you about two topics, if I may. First, has your view of Vladimir Putin changed after what's happened in Syria? And what are you prepared—what is the United States prepared to do if he continues to support Asad?\nAnd on a separate question, have you made a deal after your chat last night with the President of China, about China helping to reign in North Korea? And is that one reason you've decided not to label Beijing a currency manipulator? For the——\nThe President. Well, I'll be speaking to—do you want to go ahead? Go ahead.\nQ. May I? For the Secretary General, do you believe NATO should continue to bolster its presence along the alliance's eastern border? And do you have—are you confident that you have President Trump and the United States' support for that? Thank you. The President. I'll be speaking with Rex Tillerson in a little while—he's calling in. I think he had a very successful meeting in Russia. We'll see. We'll see the end result, which will be in a long period of time, perhaps. But the end result is what's most important, not just talk. And I think that, based on everything I'm hearing, things went pretty well, maybe better than anticipated.\nIt would be wonderful, as we were discussing just a little while ago, if NATO and our country could get along with Russia. Right now we're not getting along with Russia at all. We may be at an all-time low in terms of a relationship with Russia. This has built for a long period of time. But we're going to see what happens. Putin is the leader of Russia. Russia is a strong country. We're a very, very strong country. We're going to see how that all works out.\nLast night, separately, I spoke with a man that I've gotten to know. I don't know Putin, but I do know this gentleman; I've spent a lot of time with him over the last 2 days, and he is the President of China. You were there—most of you were there—and it was quite an interesting period of time.\nPresident Xi wants to do the right thing. We had a very good bonding. I think we had a very good chemistry together. I think he wants to help us with North Korea. We talked trade. We talked a lot of things. And I said, the way you're going to make a good trade deal is to help us with North Korea; otherwise, we're just going to go it alone. That will be all right too. But going it alone means going it with lots of other nations.\nBut I was very impressed with President Xi, and I think he means well and I think he wants to help. We'll see whether or not he does.\nQ. Do you feel like you have a deal with him? And if I could just——\nThe President. Excuse me?\nQ. Do you feel like you have a deal with him in terms of the currency manipulation designation? And have your views changed on Putin?\nThe President. Well, we'll see. We're going to see, we're going to see about that. And I'll also see about Putin over a period of time. It would be a fantastic thing if we got along with Putin and if we got along with Russia. And that could happen, and it may not happen; it may be just the opposite.\nI can only tell you what I would like to do. I would love to be able to get along with everybody. Right now the world is a mess. But I think by the time we finish, I think it's going to be a lot better place to live. And I can tell you that, speaking for myself, by the time I'm finished, it's going to be a lot better place to live in, because right now it's nasty.\nSecretary General Stoltenberg. NATO is in the process of implementing the biggest reinforcement of our collective defense since the end of the cold war. And one element of that is to increase our military presence in the eastern part of the alliance. And we are now deploying four battle groups to the three Baltic countries and Poland, and there have also been more U.S. forces in that part of Europe.\nAnd this is the first time in many, many years that we see an increase in the military presence of the United States in Europe. So we are increasing our presence, and we're also increasing the readiness and the preparedness of our forces so we can quickly reinforce if needed. We consider the presence we will have when the four battle groups are in place as sufficient given the current security situation in Europe. But of course, we will assess the situation and follow the developments very closely.\nThe message from NATO is that what we do is proportionate; it is defensive. And we don't want a new cold war. We don't want a new arms race. And actually, we strongly believe that there is no contradiction between a strong NATO, a credible deterrence on defense, and political dialogue with Russia. Actually, we believe that a precondition for the political dialogue with Russia is that we are strong and that we are united. But based on that, we can talk to Russia, because Russia is our neighbor, Russia is here to stay, so we have to find ways to manage our relationship with Russia.\nAnd I am absolutely certain that the United States supports this approach, partly because the United States is contributing with forces to our enhanced presence in the eastern part of the alliance and also in the southeast of the alliance in Romania, and the United States and the President has clearly expressed that they want dialogue with Russia, but based on unity and strength in the alliance.\nThen, the next question is from Jon Sopel [BBC].\nChemical Weapons Attack in Syria/Russia\nQ. And thank you very much. Secretary General, how long do you think it will take you to persuade the other European countries to burden share? And what are you going to do to persuade them?\nMr. President, could I ask you——\nPresident Trump. I like that question. [Laughter]\nQ. I'm here to help. [Laughter]\nAnd, Mr. President, do you think it's conceivable, what's your instinct—was it possible that Syrian forces could have launched that attack in Idlib last week without the Russians knowing? And have you been disappointed, surprised by Vladimir Putin's reaction since then?\nThank you very much.\nPresident Trump. I think it's certainly possible; I think it's probably unlikely. And I know they're doing investigations into that right now. I would like to think that they didn't know, but certainly, they could have. They were there. So we'll find out. General Mattis is looking into it with the entire Pentagon group that does that kind of work.\nSo I—it was very disappointing to see. It's disappointing no matter who does it, but when you get into the gases—especially that form—it's vicious and violent. And everybody in this room saw it all too many times over the last 3 or 4 days: young children dying, babies dying, fathers holding children in their arms that were dead. Dead children—there can't be a worse sight, and it shouldn't be allowed. That's a butcher. That's a butcher.\nSo I felt we had to do something about it. I have absolutely no doubt we did the right thing, and it was very, very successfully done, as you well know. Thank you.\nSecretary General Stoltenberg. On defense spending and burden sharing, that has been my top priority. I have raised it in all my meetings, in all capitals I have visited, with Prime Ministers, Presidents, Ministers of Finance, and of course, also Defense and Foreign Ministers. And I expect, of course, all allies to make good on what they decided back in 2014. And the very strong and clear message from President Trump has been very helpful. So now we see that things are starting to move in the right direction. For the first time after many, many years of decline in defense spending, we now see an increase in defense spending across Europe and Canada. So they have started to move in the right direction; 3.8 percent real increase in defense spending across Europe and Canada is a significant step in the right direction. It's not enough. We still have a long way to go, but at least they have turned a corner—the European allies have turned a corner. Instead of reducing defense spending, they have started to increase defense spending.\nThen I think it is important to remember that this something the Europeans do because they know that this is in their own security interest. It is in their interest to invest more in Europe defense because the world has become more dangerous.\nMany European allies, of course, reduced—or all European allies reduced defense spending after the end of the cold war because then tensions went down. But if you are decreasing defense spending when tensions are going down, then you have to be able to increase the defense spending when tensions are going up. And now they are going up.\nSo we have still a long way to go, but I'm encouraged by the fact that we have started to move in the right direction. And last year, there were five allies spending 2 percent. This year Romania has declared that they will reach 2 percent. Next year, Latvia and Lithuania will also reach 2 percent, so we go from five to eight—which is at least going in the right direction. But still we have some work to do.\nPresident Trump. And I did ask about all the money that hasn't been paid over the years, will that money be coming back. We'll be talking about that, right? [Laughter] We want to talk about that too.\nAnita Kumar, where are you? Hi. McClatchy. Hi.\nChina/United Nations Security Council Resolution on Syrian Chemical Weapons Attack\nQ. Mr. President, what's your reaction to the U.N.'s vote condemning the chemical attack in Syria overall? And can you talk a little bit about your reaction to China abstaining? Were you aware that was going to happen? Did President Xi talk to you about that, give you a heads up? And how does that affect your relationship?\nPresident Trump. We did talk last night. I think it's wonderful that they abstained. As you know, very few people expected that. And no, I was not surprised that China did abstain. Very, very few people thought that that was going to happen. So we're honored by the vote. That's the vote that should have taken place.\nQ. Mr. Secretary General, you talked a little bit about Moscow, about Russia. How do you counter the impression in general—they've been interfering in recent democratic elections. How do you counter Moscow's power?\nSecretary General Stoltenberg. The most important thing is to have a strong alliance, to stay united, and be firm and predictable in our approach to Russia. And that means that we have to invest in our collective defense. That's exactly what we are doing. Deploy more troops in the eastern part of the alliance, increase the readiness of our forces, and increase defense spending. And I welcome the very strong message from President Trump on the importance of increased defense spending. We have started to do this, so we are implementing the biggest reinforcement of our collective defense since the end of the cold war, providing credible deterrence. But at the same time, we have to find ways to engage with Russia, to talk with Russia. Because Russia is not—will not go away; Russia will be our biggest neighbor, and we have to find ways to live with them and to try to avoid a new cold war, a new arms race.\nAnd that's exactly why I am very much in favor of what we call the dual-track approach to Russia. And as a former Norwegian politician, I have the experience to work with the Russians, because Norway is bordering Russia. And Norway was able, even during the cold war, to develop, I would call it, a pragmatic working relationship with Russia, cooperating with them on energy, on border issues, on environment, on fishery, and also in military affairs. And that was not despite our membership in NATO, but it was because of our membership in NATO. Because NATO provided the strength, the predictability, the platform for a small country to have a political dialogue with Russia.\nSo I strongly believe that the only way to deter Russia is to be strong. But the only way to avoid a new cold war, avoid a new arms race, and avoid increasing tensions is to continue to engage Russia in a political dialogue, and to make sure that what we do is defensive and proportionate in response to a more assertive Russia.\nPresident Trump. Okay.\nSecretary General Stoltenberg. Then, I give the floor to—[inaudible].\nEurope-Russia Relations/Global Instability/North Korea\nQ. Thank you. Mr. President, I'm from Norway. Russia is our neighboring country. What do you think Europe has to fear from Russia if this tension continues?\nPresident Trump. Say it——\nQ. What do you think that European countries have to fear from Russia if this tension continues?\nPresident Trump. I cannot hear. I cannot understand——\nSecretary General Stoltenberg. She asked——\nQ. What—I'll do it again. What do you think European countries have to fear from Russia if this tension continues to escalate?\nAnd for you, Mr. Secretary General, the President has said that the attack in Syria last week was warranted and was also an attack on U.S. allies. Do you think that this attack was warranted? And do you see NATO playing any supporting role in future actions in Syria?\nPresident Trump. Well, I want to just start by saying, hopefully, they're going to have to fear nothing, ultimately. Right now there is a fear, and there are problems—there are certainly problems. But ultimately, I hope that there won't be a fear and there won't be problems and the world can get along. That would be the ideal situation.\nIt's crazy what's going on—whether it's the Middle East or you look at—no matter where—the Ukraine—you look at—whatever you look at, it's got problems, so many problems. And ultimately, I believe that we are going to get rid of most of those problems, and there won't be fear of anybody. That's the way it should be. We have a very big problem in North Korea. And as I said, I really think that China is going to try very hard, and has already started. A lot of the coal boats have already been turned back—you saw that yesterday and today—they've been turned back. The vast amount of coal that comes out of North Korea going to China, they've turned back the boats. That's a big step, and they have many other steps that I know about.\nSo we'll see what happens. It may be effective, it may not be effective. If it's not effective, we will be effective, I can promise you that. Thank you.\nSecretary General Stoltenberg. NATO has constantly condemned the use of chemical weapons in Syria. And the use of chemical weapons is horrendous, and it's a clear violation of international law. And any use of chemical weapons is unacceptable and cannot go unanswered, so those responsible must be held accountable.\nThe strike against the airbase in Syria was a U.S. operation based on U.S. intelligence. But you have seen that within the alliance, this has been something which has been met with a lot of understanding because NATO allies do not accept that chemical weapons are used. And therefore, we also strongly support the efforts of the fact-finding commission to try to find out actually what happened and to make sure that we don't see any use of chemical weapons in the future.\nPresident Trump. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2017-04-12", "title": "The President's News Conference With Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization"}

{"author": "Sean Spicer", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123744", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:24 P.M. EDT\nMR. SPICER: Good afternoon. As many of you are aware, there's currently some news breaking out of Afghanistan, so I just want to give you a quick update.\nAt around 7:00 p.m. local time in Afghanistan last night, the United States military used a GBU-43 weapon in Afghanistan. The GBU-43 is a large, powerful and accurately delivered weapon. We targeted a system of tunnels and caves that ISIS fighters used to move around freely, making it easier for them to target U.S. military advisors and Afghan forces in the area.\nThe United States takes the fight against ISIS very seriously. And in order to defeat the group, we must deny them operational space, which we did. The United States took all precautions necessary to prevent civilian casualties and collateral damage as a result of the operation. Any further details, I would refer you to the Department of Defense on that.\nMoving on, as you may know from the schedule, the President has a 2:00 p.m. event, so I'm going to try to keep this rather tight so the pool has an opportunity to get in and set up appropriately.\nEarlier today, the President signed H.J. Res. 43, bringing the total number of Congressional Review Act legislation pieces that he has signed now to 13. This resolution that he signed today overturns a regulation that was put in place by the previous administration on their way out the door that would have taken away the right of states to set their own policies and priorities for Title 10 family-planning programs.\nOur federal system was set up to allow states to address the unique needs of their own populations when possible, especially\n-- comes to programs as important and sensitive as family planning. With the bill signing, the President has restored respect to states' rights on this particular issue.\nAs I mentioned at the top, there's an event at 2:00 p.m. where the President will be meeting with the brave first responders who were involved in the I-85 Bridge collapse and thank them -- that occurred in Atlanta to thank them for their work and dedication in addressing this horrible situation. The bridge collapse during rush hour on March 30th -- but due to the heroic efforts of Atlanta's first responders, some of whom will be here today, no lives were lost. The President is proud to hose these brave individuals and honor their commitment to protecting their community.\nLater this afternoon, the President will head to Florida for the Easter holiday. He will be departing Joint Base Andrews via motorcade, as the preparations for the Easter Egg Roll are well underway on the South Lawn, preventing a Marine One departure.\nAnd while we're on the topic -- I know it was brought up the other day, so just to give you quick notes on what to expect this coming Monday. We expect more than 21,000 people to attend the Easter Egg Roll. The allocations of tickets have been given to schools, children's hospitals, and military and law enforcement families. Commemorative eggs will be handed out to the children who attend. Nearly 18,000 eggs were ordered, which is in line with past years. The event will start at 7:30 a.m., with different groups of guests arriving every two hours to ensure that all the children have an opportunity to participate in more than a dozen activities that will be available. Further logistics and guidance will be provided over the weekend.\nAlso today, the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control, OFAC, designed -- designated one entity and one individual connected to human rights abuses against Iranian political prisoners in Iran's prisons. The individual who was designated for his role in abuses in Iran's prison is the brother of Qasem Soleimani, the commander of Iran's IRGC Quds Force, who was himself previously designated under terrorism, counter-proliferation, and human rights authorities.\nThe sanctions against human rights abusers in Iran's prisons come at a time when Iran continues to unjustly detain in its prison various foreigners, including U.S. citizens Siamuk Namazi and Baquer Namazi. We join recent calls by international organizations and U.N. human rights experts for the immediate release of all U.S. citizens unjustly detained or missing in Iran so that they can return to their families.\nOFAC also designated two ISIS financial facilitators and ISIS supporter in North Africa, continuing our ongoing effort to disrupt key leadership nodes for the group.\nMoving on, over the past few days, the President and members of the Cabinet have held many meetings and discussions with their international counterparts about the significant foreign policy challenges facing our world. Yesterday you heard from the President himself, alongside NATO Secretary General, about the need for a strong-funded Alliance to combat terrorism, the humanitarian crisis ongoing in Syria, and many other serious threats to our collective safety and security.\nAlso yesterday, Ambassador Nikki Haley, along with her counterparts from nine other nations, voted in favor of a draft resolution to denounce the heinous chemical attack carried out by the Assad regime last week. Unfortunately, but not surprising, Russia stood in the way of this resolution. However, I'd like to point out the abstention of China, on the heels of President Xi's recent successful visit, and Kazakhstan, a longtime Russian ally and former member of the Soviet Union. Both of these abstentions are notable and signify that the United States is persuading the world that the use of weapons of mass destruction cannot go unanswered.\nSecretary Tillerson, as you know, was in Russia yesterday to meet with his counterpart and ensure that they are made fully aware of the United States' position in both areas of practical cooperation, such as defeating ISIS, and areas where Russia does not share our interest and values.\nAs you know, the Vice President will be departing for his 10-day trip to South Korea, Japan, Indonesia and Australia on Saturday morning. His office will be providing more information later today.\nFinally, I'm glad to announce the President will host the Prime Minister of Italy for an official working visit to the White House next Thursday, April 20th. The leaders will discuss the upcoming G7, which will be hosted in Italy and Sicily, and a range of issues of mutual concern.\nWith that, I'd be glad to take some of your questions.\nQ: Sean, where is the administration on cost-sharing subsidies for insurance companies?\nMR. SPICER: That is an area that is being internally discussed at this time.\nQ: So, undecided?\nMR. SPICER: It's not -- there is an ongoing discussion on that matter.\nMatt.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. The last few days we've seen a number of policy shifts by the President on China is a currency manipulator, the Ex-Im Bank, the order (inaudible) healthcare taxes. There's more, but I won't belabor the point. What should the American people make of these shifts? And are there any policy areas that are nonnegotiable?\nMR. SPICER: I think -- respectfully, I think you can look at what you're referring to as a shift in a lot of ways. By that I mean I saw a couple instances with respect to NATO being one of those shifts yesterday, and if you look at what's happened, those entities, or individuals in some cases, are issues evolving towards the President's position. And NATO, in particular, he talked about the need of countries to pay their fair share, to live up to their commitments of 2 percent of GDP. He talked about the need for NATO to focus more on terrorism. NATO has done just that.\nAnd it's something that he pointed out in the debate -- the first debate in September of last year. He talked about the fact that NATO is moving towards what he has been calling for. And I think in some cases, the issues evolve -- that it's not just a clear and fast statement that this is -- the entity itself is moving towards his -- or the issue is evolving towards the position that he articulated. And that can't be proven more true in the case of NATO, where he laid out two very clear positions that he had an issue with NATO, and as far back as September of last year, started to recognize that that institution was moving much more towards his position. The Secretary General noted that as well yesterday.\nQ: A quick follow-up, if I may. The Ex-Im Bank is another one. That's an institution that hasn't changed at all. So I'm wondering, on some of these other policy shifts where you haven't seen the type of change you're talking about with NATO, what should we make of those kinds of shifts? And again, are there any policy areas that are nonnegotiable, that are off limits?\nMR. SPICER: Well, there's always going to be -- I think that there's going to be areas where I think, again, it depends on the outcome. In the case of NATO, in particular, as I pointed out, it's the most illustrative. I think you look at the President's position, where he wanted to see NATO, in particular, evolve to, and it's moving exactly in the direction that he said it was in terms of its goals of increasing the amount of participation from other member countries, and, two, as having a greater focus on terrorism -- something that was reinforced by the Secretary General himself when he was here.\nI think when you look at these issues and you recognize the direction in which they're moving, they're moving in a direction that the President stated very clearly.\nJohn.\nMR. SPICER: Thank you, Sean. On the GBU-43 bomb -- the first time it's ever been used. Why did you choose this particular location? And would you say that this bomb won't be used again in another flashpoint around the world, like Syria? Like North Korea, for instance?\nMR. SPICER: As I noted at the beginning, John, I would refer you to the Department of Defense on the specifics.\nQ: On a separate matter -- you mentioned what you see as a win at the U.N. Security Council. I'm curious as to why you believe this is a win. After all, this particular resolution did not pass -- what happened at the U.N. Security Council in the past, for instance, a Security Council resolution which gave the green light for the Persian Gulf War, you actually had all five permanent members in the U.N. Security Council voted yes. So why are you saying this is a win when not all five permanent members of the Security Council actually voted yes? You had one -- Russia -- blocking it.\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think it's very significant, China's abstention, in particular. I think Kazakhstan is another one, in terms of that one -- in terms of its proximate location in history with Russia -- you see a breakaway of Russia, aligning itself with a position that is not only shared with the U.S. but the rest of the world. So that would be a natural position that they might have taken in the past.\nBut secondly, I think China's abstention is a significant win for the President, who went down and had discussions with President Xi -- many of you all saw that, heard his remarks about how he walked through that. And I think it really shows the success of the trip, first and foremost, but secondly, it continues to show how Russia is isolated on this particular matter. That's important.\nSo I think on a variety of fronts it really was a huge win for the United States and for the persuasiveness of the President.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. In his remarks to us off-camera, OMB Director Mulvaney talked about the vision of the federal government being reorganized as, in some cases, more agencies. And he said also that the final plan will come not just from right-wing think tanks -- I believe that was his phrase. Coupled with the President's statement on the Ex-Im Bank, is he already receiving any criticism or voices of disappointment from small government conservatives who backed him strongly? I refer to groups such as Americans for Tax Reform, or the Cato Institute.\nMR. SPICER: Well, I can't say that I've scanned every group's statements about this particular subject, but I can tell you that he's gotten a lot of very positive feedback, as well as Director Mulvaney, for their effort.\nAs the Director noted, you have a government that, in large part, has never been reorganized, it's just been added to. And when you look at the different number of agencies and programs that flow throughout the government to do, in some cases, the very same thing, and are housed in a variety of agencies throughout the government, the question that you have to ask yourself is not only is the taxpayer getting the best bang for their buck, but are the people that those services are intended to be providing for getting the best services.\nSo Director Mulvaney's effort, at the President's direction, to really look at how government is organized and operating I think is a very significant step. And I think one of the points that he noted is that this is something that should unite conservatives and liberals, and Republicans and Democrats -- good government and effective, efficient government is something that really doesn't have an ideological home. I think it's something that we all can agree on, that the more that we can effectively deliver for the American citizen and deliver for the American taxpayer effective and efficient government is something that we should all probably be in line with.\nRichard.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. The U.S. ambassador at the Europe Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons says that Syria, he says, uses chemical weapons, embedded -- Syria uses the weapon embedded by Russia's continuing efforts to bury the truth. Was the President offered proof of such truth-burying efforts by Russia?\nMR. SPICER: Was he offered --\nQ: Truths of this -- evidence that this is happening by Russia?\nMR. SPICER: No.\nQ: I would like to know also -- you've been putting in the same sentence Syria, Iraq and North Korea as failed states, Russia being not a failed state but part of this. Has it become the -- to use an old expression -- the axis of evil of this administration?\nMR. SPICER: I think it's important to know who Russia is on the side with right now and where they stand. I think it draws a huge contrast to show who's on what side of this argument and this crisis. And I think it's important to note the difference, that -- who they're with. And that's I think a very notable thing. I'm not going to go any further than to say that.\nQ: Very quick, last question. With the National Hockey League playoffs just started, will the President cheer for the Rangers or the Caps? (Laughter.)\nMR. SPICER: Respectfully, that's really not been a subject that's come up too often in the White House. (Laughter.)\nSo I'm going to keep with our Richards and go to Richard Elliot from WSB TV in Atlanta, Georgia.\nQ: Obviously, our concern is the reconstruction of 85. We understand that the President is meeting with the first responders this afternoon -- in just a few minutes, actually. We wanted to ask about the federal commitment to getting I-85 rebuilt as far as federal dollars and easing some federal regulations to get the job done quickly.\nMR. SPICER: So a couple things on that front. Immediately following the tragedy that ensued in Atlanta, the President directed the Federal Highway Administration to release $10 million, and then we have begun to work with the appropriate agencies to expedite that process.\nI know that there are critical repairs that have to get made, and I think that -- not only that the initial funding will help with that for the roads and the bridges and the emergency access that needs to get handled. But under emergency relief efforts, there are ways to expedite some of that funding. And I would -- the Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration are probably the best way to get a better answer on that. But there are ways that some of that funding can be expedited beyond the initial commitment that the federal government has made.\nMary.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Back on some of these shifts. On China, in particular, the President did not mince words during the campaign. Now he says he and President Xi have been bonding, Xi means well. He says China is not a currency manipulator. What message does this send to the President's supporters who sent him to the White House thinking he'd be following through on his tough talk against China?\nMR. SPICER: I think the President's tough talk was on a variety of subjects -- was to gets results for the American people. That's what he has pledged to do, to get more jobs here, to grow more manufacturing, to keep our country safe.\nThe President and President Xi had a great meeting. The President likes President Xi and got to know him really well in Mar-a-Lago and I think has established a really good relationship moving forward. But at the end of the day, this is always about developing a better situation for the American people, and I think he's done that.\nQ: And a follow-up, if I may. The President told the Wall Street Journal that President Xi helped him realize that North Korea is not so easy. Did the President underestimate the complexities of this? Did he underestimate how difficult this was going to be?\nMR. SPICER: No, I don't think so at all. And I think if China is able to help get a deal with China* [North Korea] the President would appreciate that. I think this would be great for China as well. And as the President noted this morning, if China can help us do that, it will be great. And if not, we'll go and handle that ourselves with our allies.\nQ: Sean, on currency manipulation, why specifically did he decide to abandon this? And what other tools does he have in his toolbox to try to modify China's trade --\nMR. SPICER: I think that's a very, very complex issue and I think the President -- I'm going to leave it to the President to specifically answer that.\nQ: Has he given up on trying to modify China's trade behavior?\nMR. SPICER: I think the President is going to continue to make significant progress when it comes to that issue and to how our relationship is with China. He showed already what a great relationship he has with President Xi, and the results are starting to pour in. And I think that that is an issue in particular that the President is best to address.\nQ: Two questions, Sean. You were very forthcoming about the tick-tock leading up to the missile launch into Syria, so can you give us any background on the MOAB in Afghanistan? Was there a Situation Room scenario? Was the President -- was this several days in the making?\nAnd my second question is, the President has been very critical of the intelligence community leading up to his inauguration. He's obviously been working very closely with the intel community on these -- at least on these situations in Syria and Afghanistan. Has his opinion changed toward the IC?\nMR. SPICER: In the first question, again, I think General Nicholson at United States Forces Afghanistan is best to address the tick-tock on the situation over there.\nQ: But as far as the President's consultation.\nMR. SPICER: I understand. I think that the U.S. Forces Afghanistan as well as the Department of Defense are best to walk through the military operations that are ongoing there.\nI think with respect to the intelligence community and the national security team, as you know, the President has put together a world-class Cabinet of top-notch national security experts, from General Mattis to General Kelly, General McMaster and others, that continue to provide him the best advice to make the best decisions for this country. And he continues to rely on them -- and Director Pompeo, Director Coats at the DNI. They continue to give him sage advice about how to best position the United States.\nZeke.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Following up on that question, did the President specifically order -- authorize the use of this piece of ordnance?\nMR. SPICER: Again, I'm not going to get into details right now. As I mentioned, I'll let the Department of Defense handle the lead on this one.\nQ: And to follow up on a question earlier, you didn't answer specifically what has changed about the Ex-Im Bank that has led the President to re-evaluate his previous --\nMR. SPICER: Let me get back to you on the Ex-Im Bank specifically. I think it's a very complex issue and I would like to get back.\nAnita.\nQ: Two questions about the budget. Are you all prepared to hold things up? We've got a couple weeks left here. How serious are you about getting money for the wall? Would you hold up the spending plan for that? And I have one other question.\nQ: So the government is currently funded through April 28th under a continuing resolution. We've made very clear to Congress that the President's priorities are increasing military spending and security of our border. We're going to continue to have conversations with Congress, and we feel confident that they'll do their job. But those conversations are ongoing.\nQ: So you can't say whether you would have to have money in this budget or --\nMR. SPICER: I will leave it to our team to continue the negotiations that they're having.\nQ: Okay. And then the second question on the budget was, there's a proposal now to punish members of Congress who do not pass this spending plan, in a variety of ways -- withhold salary, even arrest. Do you support that Congress should be punished --\nMR. SPICER: Let's see. I think we're making significant progress. I feel very good about the momentum and so I don't want to start getting into whether -- who's going to be naughty and nice.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Historically, sitting Presidents have refrained from stating preferences on -- free-market economy goes. Yesterday President Trump said he wants low interest rates and he wants a weaker dollar, and then the market followed his preferences. So given his criticism of other economies and their intervention, how do you characterize that response?\nMR. SPICER: I think the President has made it very clear from the beginning that he's going to do what he can to fight on behalf of American consumers and American businesses to make sure that we can help create a environment here in America where businesses grow and industries continue to hire, jobs can come back and middle-income Americans can get some tax relief and keep more of their money and their hard-earned dollars.\nQ: But, traditionally, you have low interest rates when the economy is weak and needs help, and then they recover when the economy strengthens. So what was he trying to get --\nMR. SPICER: I understand. I think what he is trying to do, as you know, through a lot of the coverage and a lot of the meetings that you guys have covered and seen here at the White House, the President is continuing to meet with business leaders and people who are creating jobs, union leaders, to find out what we can do. And the President has heard a lot -- gotten a lot of feedback and already taken great steps to make sure that we can create a regulatory and tax environment that's going to help grow America's economy and put people back to work. That's plain and simple. And I think what he'll continue to do is fight on behalf of the American people.\nI hate to cut this short but we literally have 10 minutes before the President is supposed to speak. Thank you very much.\nEND 1:48 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2017-04-13", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer"}

Thank you, everybody. Sit down, please. Oh, wow, I like that even better. Come on. Get up here with me, everybody. That's—I like that, I heard about this. Wow.\nAtlanta Fire Rescue Dept. Chief Joel G. Baker. Sir, I want to bring you greetings on behalf of our honorable mayor, Mayor Kasim Reed.\nThe President. Thank you, yes.\nChief Baker. And all of the men and women of the Atlanta Fire Rescue Department, we'd like to present you with this token of our appreciation.\nThe President. That is beautiful. I think I should leave it right here—[laughter]—right? It fits so well. Thank you.\nChief Baker. Thank you, sir.\nThe President. Thank you very much. That's thoughtful of you. Man, come here.\nAtlanta Police Dept. Assistant Chief Rodney N. Bryant. All right.\nThe President. Man, come here. I didn't know I was going to get such a nice—[laughter].\nSecretary of Transportation Elaine L. Chao. I had to sit down, I—[inaudible].\nThe President. That's—hi, Elaine. Yes, that's okay.\nThat is fantastic. Thank you, how are you?\nChief Baker. I'm fine, sir.\nThe President. We're going to go around, introduce ourselves, okay? We'll do this first. You know, these folks back here, they're very famous—most of them—it's called the media. [Laughter] They're very honorable people. But you are more honorable, I can tell you that.\nChief Baker. Well, thank you, sir.\nThe President. So I'm honored to be here with you today and welcome you to the White House: the heroes who responded to the terrible bridge collapse on I-85 2 weeks ago in Atlanta. That was something. It was—the whole world was watching that one. Today we're joined by members of the Georgia State Patrol, the Atlanta Fire Rescue Department, and the Atlanta Police Department—great people. On that day, Georgia State police and Atlanta police took fast action to get motorists away from danger. Then, our brave firefighters battled 40-foot flames, which was incredible. What was the reason for those flames? It was something underneath that just was very combustible?\nChief Baker. That's right.\nThe President. Yes, those flames were amazing. They pulled back, by battalion chiefs, and just minutes before the bridge itself collapsed, and everybody was safe. That was an amazing thing, and everybody was watching. Your skill and courage saved many lives and represented true strength and the true strength of America. Really great job, fellas. I'm proud of you. Assistant Chief Bryant. Thank you.\nThe President. Great job.\nTo the people of Georgia who are affected by the collapse, my administration stands with you. We've already made a $10 million emergency relief funds available. And I called your Governor, who I know very well, who's a terrific guy, and I approved it literally the day that it happened. I had a feeling you'd need a little money—[laughter]—because that looked like a big money deal, right, Elaine? But I approved it immediately, and Elaine took care of it, and we gave fast action.\nWhat happened in Atlanta is a painful reminder of the critical importance of infrastructure. Which we're going to be doing a lot with infrastructure. You'll be seeing that over the coming weeks—tremendous amount. I'm committed to funding a massive nationwide infrastructure program to rebuild, repair, and construct the roads and bridges of the future of this country. This is necessary as a matter of both safety and economic growth, and it's necessary to improve our quality of life as Americans.\nWe will also continue to seek proper funding for law enforcement and public safety in our country. On behalf of the entire Nation, I salute you. You're really amazing people, and I honor your service. I pledge that you will have the support of our country—the police, the firefighters, first responders—you will always have the support of President Trump. I think you know that very well. And I thank you for the great job and the fast action. Really fantastic. A lot of bravery.\nMaybe we could just go around, introduce yourselves. And who knows, maybe you'll become—you become a movie star after this. [Laughter] After all this, you'll become a movie star. If they like the way you look or sound, you'll become a star.\nGo ahead.\nChief Baker. Well, thank you again, sir. My name is Joel Baker, fire chief with the city of Atlanta Fire Rescue Department.\nThe President. And how tall are you, Joel?\nChief Baker. I'm 6'6\", sir.\nThe President. That's all? I thought it was much more than that. [Laughter] I think you're taller than that. [Laughter] Okay, good. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.\nGo ahead.\nGeorgia State Patrol Trooper First Class 2 Thomas Burkett. I'm Trooper Thomas Burkett with the Georgia State Patrol.\nAtlanta Police Dept. Sgt. Ryan Heald.

[Laughter] That's what I want to know. Raise your hands if you're the bravest person. [Laughter] Huh? Maybe it's—[laughter]—I thought so. I thought so.\nSecretary Chao. I think there are two others that are behind them.\nThe President. Oh no, go ahead.\nGeorgia State Patrol Sgt. First Class John Cronin. Sergeant First Class John Cronin, Georgia State Patrol.\nThe President. Great.\nAtlanta Police Dept. Officer Ryan Severance. Officer Ryan Severance with the Atlanta Police Department.\nThe President. Great. Elaine, would you like to say something?\nSecretary Chao. Mr. President, arrayed beside you and around you are true heroes of our country. They demonstrate what courage, steadfastness, commitment, and fealty to their oaths to serve our communities' needs.\nThis fire was reported at 6:12 p.m., right in the middle of rush hour, on March 30. By 6:20, this team was on site addressing the issue. Governor Nathan Deal also deserves some credit because he has, as a matter of policy, pre-positioned State troopers around I-85 to move any traffic incident right out of the way. So that helped a great deal. By 7 o'clock, the bridge had collapsed. By 8 o'clock, these brave men, leaders of their own communities, basically had the fire under control. The U.S. Department of Transportation was on site, and we worked hand-in-hand with these great heroes. And as you mentioned, $10 million from your administration went out within 1 hour of the Governor making this request. The good story following all of this is also that the repair and recovery of this whole scene will occur very quickly. You will like them, because they will come in under budget and on time.\nThe President. That's good. I love to hear the words \"under budget\" and \"under schedule,\" right? [Laughter] We used to call it \"ahead of schedule.\" Now we say \"under schedule.\" But that will be great.\nAnd I have to tell you, Governor Nathan Deal did call me immediately after—as this was happening, and he sort of said, could you be ready? Because we're going to need some emergency money fast. And we were ready, and we got him the money immediately.\nAnd again, we want to thank everybody in the room very much. And, Secretary, congratulations.\nSecretary Chao. Not at all. Again, I told them that you were really approachable and that you would enjoy meeting them so much. They were a little bit apprehensive about meeting you, so they're just so thrilled. And Chief Baker and also Chief Bryant, these are the two leaders here\nThe President. Right.\nSecretary Chao. And they both said what an honor it is to be at the White House, to be with you. And you have done the first responder community a tremendous honor by honoring them. And they want to make sure—because they're saying that you are sending a message to all the first responders that you value them. So, Chief Bryant, why don't you say that to the President? [Laughter]\nChief Baker. Yes, ma'am. I will stand with her, Mr. President, that this is not only a great day for the city of Atlanta and Atlanta Fire Rescue Department, but it's a great day for all of the public safety personnel throughout the country; we have to include department of fire, police, State patrols throughout the country, correctional department. But all the public safety really appreciate the opportunity that you're recognizing public safety members this way.\nThe President. Well, Chief, I have great respect for the people that do what you do. It's amazing bravery. And the speed is incredible. So I just, again, I want to thank you. And I think what we'll do is, when we're finished here, we'll talk, and then, unless you don't want to do this, but I know you do, we'll go right across the hall to the Oval Office, we'll have some pictures. Is that okay? The Oval Office. It is—believe me, I've been in a lot of good offices. [Laughter] It is a special office, okay?\nChief Baker. Yes, sir.\nThe President. So we'll go over there; we'll take some pictures, okay?\nChief Baker. Yes, sir.\nThe President. Thank you all very much. Thank you.\nU.S. Military Operations in Afghanistan\nQ. Mr. President, how about that bomb—[inaudible]?\nQ. Did you authorize the bomb in Afghanistan? The President. Very, very proud of the people. Another—really another successful job. We're very, very proud of our military. Just like we're proud of the folks in this room, we are so proud of our military. And it was another successful event.\nQ. Did you authorize it, sir?\nThe President. Everybody knows exactly what happened, so—and what I do is I authorize my military. We have the greatest military in the world, and they've done a job as usual. So we have given them total authorization, and that's what they're doing. And frankly, that's why they've been so successful lately. If you look at what's happened over the last 8 weeks and compare that, really, to what's happened over the last 8 years, you'll see there's a tremendous difference—tremendous difference.\nSo we have incredible leaders in the military, and we have incredible military. And we are very proud of them. And this was another very, very successful mission.\nThank you very much.\nU.S. Military Operations in Afghanistan/North Korea/China\nQ. Mr. President, did you send a message to North Korea? Does this send a message to North Korea?\nThe President. I don't know if this sends a message. It doesn't make any difference if it does or not. North Korea is a problem. The problem will be taken care of. I will say this: I think China has really been working very hard. I have really gotten to like and respect, as you know, President Xi. He's a terrific person. We spent a lot of time together in Florida. And he's a very special man, so we'll see how it goes. I think he's going to try very hard. Okay?\nThank you.", "timestamp": "2017-04-13", "title": "Remarks at a Meeting Honoring First Responders to the Interstate 85 Bridge Collapse in Atlanta, Georgia, and an Exchange With Reporters"}
{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123745", "text": "Via Conference Call\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Good afternoon, guys. Some of you I've met before. For folks I haven't met, look forward to seeing you on Saturday. For the purpose of the Vice President's upcoming trip to Seoul, to Tokyo, to Jakarta, and to Sydney, we're going to explain, lay out the administration's policies to our allies, to our partners in the Asia Pacific region, and to develop some personal connections with key interlocutors as we conduct economic dialogues and business relationships and business listening session.\nA couple of key themes that you'll see reinforced throughout each visit with our alliances -- that we are fully committed to our security alliances, especially in the face of our evolving security challenges. And you've seen the nuclear threat of North Korea, and we'll reinforce those security alliances.\nAlso, a purpose of the visit -- its key theme is our economic engagement -- that withdrawing from the TPP shouldn't be seen as a retreat from the region. Quite on the contrary, that our economic presence in the region and during continues to grow; our commitment to APEC, our existing bilateral agreement. And we'll talk about the new economic dialogues with Japan, and as you saw with President Xi Jinping with China. And our economic presence in the region is enduring. We'll talk about how to level the playing field and how to maximize growth for the United States.\nAnd then I would say the third theme that we'll reinforce is our partnership -- partnerships with our key countries, for example, Indonesia; partnerships with key institutions like ASEAN; those organizations that help advance our efforts in defeating ISIS; those organizations that assist with the denuclearization of North Korea; and then just upholding the rules-based order.\nDo you want me to go through some of the key meetings or messages with those meetings?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah, I think that will be good.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Okay. I'll try these in chronological order, but bear with me if they're a little bit out of order. Our visit with the Acting President, as we go into Seoul, the Vice President is going to reaffirm our commitment -- ironclad U.S.-ROK alliance. And the Vice President is going to underscore intent -- we're going to continue to consult with the Republic of Korea on North Korea's efforts to advance its ballistic missile and its nuclear program. So that will be critical as we sit down with the Acting President.\nKind of similarly with the key heads of state as the Vice President talks with Prime Minister Abe, he'll underscore about the alliance and building on the discussion that the President had here, underscoring the alliance that they continue to serve as the cornerstone of peace and security in Asia and, obviously, as a platform for our global cooperation. The Vice President, I would anticipate, he'll exchange views with Prime Minister Abe, and will talk security, economy, and regional issues.\nYou might have heard, as well, we'll have our U.S.-Japan economic dialogue kick off. We discussed with the Deputy Prime Minister Aso and then also when Prime Minister Abe was here at the White House, down at Mar-a-Lago. So the Vice President is going to kick off the U.S.-Japan economic dialogue there in Tokyo with Deputy Prime Minister Aso, as we agreed to back in February. We agreed to the structure and the goals of the dialogue and kind of the kickoff of that dialogue going forward.\nWhen we get to Indonesia with President Widodo, the Vice President is going to reaffirm our strategic partnership with Indonesia, thank him for their leadership on counterterrorism, and he'll underscore the importance of their partnership on regional security challenges, again, like North Korea.\nWe're going to meet with the ASEAN Secretariat, and we're also going to meet with the permanent rep for the ASEAN Secretariat. It's the 40th anniversary of our relations, and the 50th anniversary of ASEAN. So the Vice President will reaffirm and talk through some ways maybe to, perhaps, strengthen those strategic partnerships.\nWhen we get down to Sydney, meeting with Prime Minister Turnbull and members of his administration, the Vice President is going to reaffirm our enduring presence in the region. We'll thank Australia for its partnership in addressing global issues, and they'll continue to discuss our bilateral trade and investment relations.\nYou heard from my colleague that at many of the stops we're going to have business listening sessions and some remarks, so the Vice President is going to host smaller listening sessions with business leaders and then have some opportunities to speak to some of the larger business audiences to emphasize our administration's economic agenda, focusing on free and fair trade.\nAnd then a common theme again, you'll see with the security alliance events. As my colleague mentioned, we'll have an opportunity to address the troops at the USS Ronald Reagan, and bring those security discussions at each of the stops with the two leaders, and, as we talked about, rebuilding our U.S. military and the commitment to our alliances and our partners in the region. And then the people-to-people events, we'll have great opportunity to get out and we'll have a few events there separate from the national security and the economic dialogue that some other events underscore -- shared history, shared values, religious freedom, entrepreneurship. So we'll do that in every country.\nAnd I think that hits the highlights.\nQ: Justin from Bloomberg. I have two separate questions. One was on the South Korea portion, and obviously the North Korea issue is kind of looming over that. So I'm wondering if you can talk at all about whether the Vice President will be talking about some of the military options that the White House has been apparently considering in relation to North Korea, and also give kind of an update on the state of the THAAD deployment and how soon it might be operational -- if that's going to something that's talked about.\nAnd then sort of separately, on Japan and the economic talks, I'm wondering if you could, I guess, generally talk about what some of the Vice President's priorities are going to be, but specifically wondering if he's going to advocate for U.S. pharmaceutical companies. I know President Trump has talked about wanting other countries to kind of pay their fair share, and Japan has been one where they've been really hit hard by price cuts. I know that's a lot, but that's all I got.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: I can take the North Korea and THAAD. And I don't my if my colleague is over there with you that can hit the pharmaceutical question. But I can take the first two, if you'd like.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Please do.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So to reference the military option, obviously the Vice President and the President have been in close collaboration with Secretary Mattis, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Dunford, General McMaster and the entire National Security Council as we develop not only for South Korea and the region, but as it relates to all of our national security strategy, but with particular emphasis on the belligerency of North Korea -- absolutely we'll be discussing that with our allies and partners at every stop. And we've got some military options already being assessed, but we'll work that as we sit down in discussions with General Brooks, the commander there on Peninsula.\nTHAAD, I would imagine, would come up in the course of those discussions. Obviously, they've got an election that's coming up in the next few weeks, and that has been a domestic issue for the South Koreans. But from the military standpoint, I would imagine it would come up probably on their end, but we're prepared to address that as well. It's a critical point for the defense of South Korea in recognizing it's not an offensive weapon, it's there to prevent rockets slamming from the North Koreans. I would imagine both of those will come up.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: As it relates to the question on Japan and pharmaceuticals, the Vice President's goal in this is really to establish a bilateral framework that the future discussions -- to lead and guide the future discussions in the coming month -- do not see it getting at industry-specific level. This is going to stay very high level, anticipating just identifying the framework in the areas in which we'll go forward. But I don't think it's going to get into specific industry-level at this time (inaudible) continue.\nQ: Could I just follow up on one of the answers to Justin's questions? Can you just clarify what you mean by military options with regard to North Korea? Are we talking about kind of changing force posture, moving pieces around the border? Or are you considering something more substantial?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: No, we won't talk specifics of our strategy. Obviously, in our commitment to the Republic of Korea, we consult with them as well -- those discussions, as part of the broader assessment with the National Security Council, so we wouldn't get into the weeds in the military setting. That is the purview of the Secretary of Defense. But in the broad national security discussions, we'd welcome the dialogue between the Vice President and the South Korea's leadership, but just as a continuation of dialogue that's already been in place.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, and the only thing I would add, too -- the President has been very clear that, you know, under his leadership that we are not going to telegraph future potential moves one way or the other when it comes to military or national security issues. That's just not something in a public area that we're just going to engage in at any time.\nQ: Hi, it's Roberta from Reuters. I wanted to ask two things -- one about Japan and one about Indonesia. In Japan, will the Vice President discuss at all any plans that the Trump administration may have to pursue a bilateral trade deal with Japan? I know you said that they're going to be sort of high-level discussions, but is that kind of one of the goals that he wants to discuss?\nAnd then, in Indonesia, in the discussions about business issues and free and fair trade, does the Vice President intend to discuss the ongoing dispute between U.S. mining company, Freeport, and the Indonesian government?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So in terms of the first question, which was involving the free trade agreement, again, this is establishing a framework for future discussions. The President has made very clear that we are looking for free, balanced, and fair trade with all of our allies and partners. And that is in the spirit and faith that we are moving forward. We have a longtime relationship with Japan. It is the cornerstone of peace and prosperity in the Asia Pacific region, and so we're going to work together in the mutual interests of both. And really, in terms of -- and so that's the framework which we will move under.\nAs it relates to the issue in Indonesia, we're going to discuss the business environment in Indonesia in a general sense, but it would not be appropriate, if that came up, for us to comment on something that is currently going through in a private business matter.\nQ: So, sorry, just to clarify -- does that mean the Vice President will seek to avoid talking about it because it's an ongoing issue?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I wouldn't be surprised if it came up, but it is something, obviously, that the Indonesian government and the company are working through their issues. And so that would be -- that's the level that that would be handled at.\nQ: So he doesn't plan to weigh in on it one way or the other? That's what you're saying.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I'm sorry. I missed that.\nQ: Sorry, so the Vice President wouldn't plan to weigh in on it one way or the other; he would want it to be left between the company and the government?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: The one thing that I would suggest is that -- as companies internationally are looking to potential investments in Indonesia, they obviously look to see how the business climate, the business environment is in terms of its relationships overall. So I think it would be (inaudible) of that structure and how it might be viewed by potential investors who might be weighing various options for investment in Southeast Asia, it would come up, obviously, in terms of how it would relate toward that.\nQ: Hi. It's Ken Thomas with AP. On South Korea, do you expect the Vice President to talk about potential sanctions on North Korea or firms that do business with North Korea?\nAnd then separately, there's obviously an election coming up in South Korea in May. Do you expect the Vice President to meet with any or all of the major candidates running to become the next President of South Korea?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Ken, this reference to sanctions is just -- it's another tool at our disposal. I would imagine again that the South Korean leadership may raise that as a point and we're prepared to address that. Obviously, we've been working here collaboratively with the National Security Council, again, to look for a wide range of options for North Korea, one of which, to no surprise, would be sanctions. So if that is raised, we're prepared to discuss it. This would not -- not open the dialogue with that, but that is, obviously, a tool at the administration's disposal.\nIn reference to the election, yeah, we've chosen not to -- we're going to meet with the current Acting President and not the presidential candidates. The election is coming up and we feel confident that the free and fair elections with the South Korean people -- whomever they choose as their President -- that we'll be able to work on behalf with the administration and continue to move our relationship forward.\nAny other questions?\nQ: Hey, guys. It's Dana Bash. I just have a quick question, just broadly, about South Korea and whether or not the Vice President is going to be coming -- carrying a specific message, obviously in private, but even maybe more so in public about America's support for South Korea and the region, obviously, given the saber-rattling and everything we've been seeing happening in the North. I mean, is there anything specific and concrete that he's going to deliver either rhetorically or even more?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: The thing I would tell you is I think the overriding message that the Vice President will be taking on a national security side to South Korea is that our long alliance between the U.S. and South Korea is the linchpin of peace and prosperity, that the President takes national security as a top priority, and that we have an ironclad commitment to all of our allies in the Asia Pacific that we take their defense very seriously, and that is unwavering.\nQ: It's Andrew again from AFP. If I could just ask how you're kind of approaching the possibility of North Korea testing either a nuclear device or missile on the day, or just before, we're taking off. Like, what kind of contingencies are you making? Would you expect that it would alter the substance or the actual logistics of his trip, of the Vice President's trip?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, first and foremost, the administration has been very clear -- the President, you've heard again, of the actions -- options available against North Korea -- and our allies in the region. They've telegraphed a bit. It's not a surprise that the anniversary is on Saturday. Traditionally, in the big parade -- rolls out his weapons and his mock weapons. So we're anticipating that. The intelligence community is obviously keeping the President and the Vice President well informed on activities in the region, and the Defense Department and other partners have developed those options.\nSo, safety first, but do we anticipate it? Possibly. But are there options already developed? Absolutely. Unfortunately, it's not a new surprise for us. He continues to develop this program. He continues to launch missiles into the Sea of Japan. So with that regime it's not a matter of \"if,\" it's \"when.\" So we're well prepared to counter that.\nQ: Can I ask another quick one just on Australia? Because it hasn't come up. I'm wondering if the Vice President will have a message on the refugee deal. Obviously that was kind of a big point of contention in the President's first couple of weeks. So I'm just wondering if you guys are planning on, I guess, having any concrete new news on that.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I wouldn't anticipate any new news on that front. I mean, obviously, it's entirely appropriate for a new President to ask questions about agreements struck by his predecessors, especially when it could involve the safety and security of the American people. But the United States is living up to its agreements, and the President is confident that the necessary vetting procedures are in place to protect Americans while, at the same time, accepting refugees through the deal struck by the Obama administration.\nSo I wouldn't anticipate anything other than -- anything additional coming up in that respect.\nEND 4:33 P.M.

U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao also attended the meeting.\nDuring Atlanta's evening rush hour on March 30, 2017, firefighters were called to the scene of a major fire on Interstate 85 that burned for over an hour before a section of a bridge collapsed. Thanks to the courage and professionalism of these first responders, no one was killed in the fire or collapse of the bridge, which carries hundreds of thousands of vehicles every day. The vigilance and training of Atlanta's public safety officers and the Georgia State Patrol kept a catastrophic situation from becoming a deadly tragedy.\n\"Atlanta is beyond fortunate to have the caliber of firefighters and police officers that we do – dedicated men and women who put their lives in harm's way on a daily basis, in order to keep us safe,\" said Mayor Kasim Reed. \"President Trump's recognition of these public servants means a great deal to them and to the City of Atlanta. The collaboration and support we have received from our Federal and State partners has been extraordinary.\"\nAt the request of Governor Nathan Deal, the U.S. Department of Transportation immediately approved $10 million in emergency relief funds to assist the Georgia Department of Transportation with repair of the bridge which is slated to re-open by June 15, 2017.\n\"The City of Atlanta, as well as the entire State of Georgia should be proud of the efforts of our troopers, as well as the City of Atlanta first responders during the tragic incident on I-85. Each performed in a highly commendable manner that, undoubtedly, saved lives and is worthy of the notable recognition that they are receiving from President Trump today,\" said Governor Nathan Deal.\n\"I am extremely honored and proud of the efforts of each of the troopers on scene of the I-85 bridge fire in late March. As the men and women of Atlanta Fire fought tirelessly to get the fire under control, our troopers went onto the bridge in order to guide and direct an evacuation of vehicles approaching the danger.

It is a story of an incredible people who were liberated from oppression and raised up the face of humankind.\nDown through the centuries, the Jewish people have lived through one persecution after another, and yet they persevered and thrived and uplifted the world beyond measure. And now the State of Israel stands as a monument to their faith and endurance.\nAnother day of faith and celebration is also upon us. This Easter Sunday, Christians celebrate the resurrection of Christ and the promise of eternal salvation. It is a holy day of reverence and worship; it is a sacred time that fills the spirit of our Nation with the faith of our people.\nAmerica is a Nation of believers. As families gather in houses of worship across the Nation, we are grateful for the tremendous blessings of this land, our home. We have a beautiful country, an abundant countryside, and an amazing people with a truly bright and wonderful future.\nFrom the beginning, America has been a place that has cherished the freedom of worship. That is the promise the first settlers saw in our vast continent, and it is the promise that our bravest warriors have protected for all of our citizens in centuries since, a long time ago.\nSadly, many around the globe do not enjoy this freedom, and one of the gravest threats to religious freedom remains the threat of terror.

During National Park Week, national parks across our country waive their entrance fees and welcome all explorers to experience, as past generations have, the history and splendor of our Nation's treasures.\nThe national park system started with a painting. In 1872, Thomas Moran painted The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, presented it to the Congress, and captivated countless Americans. Inspired by Moran's beautiful illustration and western explorers' stories, photographs, and sketches, the Congress and President Ulysses S. Grant enacted the Yellowstone National Park Protection Act. This law established Yellowstone as the world's first national park and transformed how we protect many of our Nation's landmarks.\nForty years later, President Theodore Roosevelt, known as the \"Conservation President,\" established Crater Lake, Oregon, as our fifth national park. During his presidency, Roosevelt doubled the number of national parks, designating, in addition to Crater Lake: Wind Cave, South Dakota; Sullys Hill, North Dakota; Mesa Verde, Colorado; and Platt, Oklahoma. Given his instrumental role in expanding our national park system, it is fitting that his likeness endures at Mount Rushmore National Memorial.\nToday, visitors from around the world travel to our Nation's 59 national parks to climb snow-capped peaks, splash under majestic falls, rappel into the deepest canyons, and find peace in shaded forests. Our parks routinely provide visitors with unforgettable, sometimes life-changing experiences. From their unsurpassed beauty to their unmatched physical challenges, our parks capture the spirit of America's pioneering history. They symbolize our ongoing commitment to the preservation of our land and wildlife, and they set the conservation standard for the rest of the world.\nIt is a priority of my Administration to protect these magnificent lands, and to ensure all Americans have access to our national parks, as well as to other National Park Service sites, throughout the next century. For this reason, I chose to donate the first portion of my salary as President to the American Battlefield Protection Program, which the National Park Service uses to preserve significant American battlefields. It is my hope that we will pass down these natural and historic sites to our children and grandchildren.\nNow, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 15 through April 23, 2017, as National Park Week. I encourage all Americans to celebrate by visiting our national parks and learning more about the natural, cultural, and historical heritage that belongs to each and every citizen of the United States of America.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nDONALD J.

It is an honor to be with you today on this Easter Sunday, and let me invite a round of applause from all the great soldiers and their families who are gathered here for General Vincent Brooks, and the great leadership that he provides here to United States Forces Korea. (Applause.)\nGeneral, we are proud -- grateful for your leadership.\nTo Chaplain Kim, to Chaplain Wasaki (ph), and to all of those who made the service so special to us, my daughter Audrey already told me that was one of the best sermons she's heard in a year and a half. So what a special Easter sermon. (Applause.)\nAnd we are just honored to be with you all today and looking forward just to some good food and to some good fellowship. But it is a pleasure to be with you today. On behalf of my wife, Karen, and our two daughters, happy Easter in South Korea. It's a joy to be with you all. (Applause.)\nI bring greetings this morning from your Commander-in-Chief, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) I spoke to the President early today, and I spoke to him on the way over. And he asked me to be here, and he told me in no uncertain terms to make sure that I told all of you we're proud of you, and we are grateful for your service to the United States of America on this frontier of freedom that is South Korea. (Applause.)\nIn fact, I can say with confidence that every American is proud of your service here, and the attention that this part of the world has gotten from people back home is probably no surprise to all of you who are gathered here today. This morning's provocation from the north is just the latest reminder of the risks each one of you face every day in the defense of the freedom of the people of South Korea and the defense of America in this part of the world.\nYour willingness to step forward, to serve, to stand firm without fear inspires our nation and inspires the world. And it's an honor for us to share this meal with you today. Thank you for your service. (Applause.)\nAnd let me say, as the General mentioned, as proud parents of a United States Marine --\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Ooorahh! (Laughter.)\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: It is the greatest privilege of my life to serve as Vice President to a President who cares so deeply about the men and women of our armed forces and their families.\nNow days like today make me think of the separation that comes at special times of the year for those who serve. And so would all of you in uniform join me in giving a rousing round of applause to the family members who are here and the family members far away. We appreciate their service and their support as you serve our nation in uniform. (Applause.)\nAnd let me promise those family members and all of you in uniform here today that under President Trump's leadership, we're going to rebuild our military. We're going to restore the arsenal of democracy. We're going to give our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard the resources you need and deserve to accomplish the mission you are given and come home safe. That's a promise from your Commander-in-Chief. (Applause.)\nThis is a challenging time all over the world, but especially here in the Asia Pacific. The opportunity for me to be here today at such a time as this is a great privilege for me, but let me assure you under President Trump's leadership, our resolve has never been stronger. Our commitment to this historic alliance with the courageous people of South Korea has never been stronger. And with your help and with God's help, freedom will ever prevail on this peninsula. (Applause.)\nBut it is Easter Sunday, and as I look out at all these courageous Americans and courageous Koreans who are gathered here today, I'm deeply humbled. I truly am. We celebrate today what Karen and I and those of us gathered here recall as that Resurrection Sunday, and that worship service was so sublime.\nBut it puts me to mind of one of my favorite stories in the Old Book. It's the story of a moment where the Nazarene encountered a soldier. The soldier walked up to him and told him that he had someone ill in his home, and he asked if he might take action to be helpful. And as Jesus began to walk with him, he said, no, you don't need to come with me. He said, I'm a man under authority. He said, I tell one to do this and he does it. I tell another to do this and he does it. He said, you just say the word and that servant under my household will be healed.\nThe words that ever struck me from that story were there at that crossroads, the story recalls in a little town called Capernaum. It simply said that Jesus was amazed.\nAt no other point in any of the stories of his life do I hear that he was amazed, except when he was speaking to a soldier. Because he saw orientation to authority and he saw faith.\nLet me say on this most holy of days, for those of us who claim Christ as Lord, we're amazed too. We're humbled. We look out today and we see courage writ large in the soldiers and the families who are gathered here.\nAnd I just want to assure you on behalf of the people all across the United States that in these troubled times, in this part of the world, your courage and your valor still amazes the American people.\nSo we just wanted to come and say thank you, say thank you for your service, and thank you, General, for your leadership and the leadership and service of all those represented here, carrying on a tradition and a commitment to freedom here on this peninsula that is now more than six decades in the running; and succeeding far beyond those who carved this free society in this ancient land could possibly have imagined, perhaps, is the American soldier shoulder-to-shoulder with the Korean people who fought for and won the freedom more than six decades ago.\nAnd I stand before you today very moved on this Easter Sunday because one of those soldiers more than six days ago -- 60 years ago was my dad. As we landed today on the peninsula, I looked out at those rolling hills, and I thought about Second Lieutenant Edward J. Pence, who was with the 45th Infantry Division of the United States Army. Dad served here in combat. It was in this month -- this very week -- in 1953 that my dad was awarded a Bronze Star here in Korea for action in combat.\nBut like so many who have worn the uniform and come home, my dad didn't think the heroes were the ones that came home. Whenever he spoke of his time here in Korea, he spoke of the ones that didn't come home. He spoke of friends lost, sacrifices made. And so on this day I think of my dad, gone 29 years now, but still enshrined in the hearts of everyone in our family. And I think of what dad would be thinking about and I believe is thinking about as he looks down to see his third son return to that place that he left so many years ago, and to see that the sacrifices that were made here, and the commitment that endures here has resulted in a free and prosperous South Korea.\nAnd so it shall ever be.\nSo for the sake of all of you who wear the uniform today, for the sake of all who have gone before, thank you for your service and happy Easter. (Applause.)\nNow, the prayer-in-chief in our family is my wife, Karen. And she said that we could impose on her to maybe return thanks for this meal, and then we look forward to meeting as many of you as we have time to meet today.\nSo, everyone, my wife, Karen Pence. (Applause.)\nMRS. PENCE: If you would bow with me. Heavenly Father, we thank you for your son who died on the cross for each one of us in this room. We thank you for the privilege of being able to fellowship today together. Thank you for the sacrifices of the families here. And in this Month of the Military Child, thank you for the sacrifices that the children make as well.\nAnd, Lord, we just thank you as well for the hands that prepared this wonderful meal. We pray that you would bless our conversation and that you would just pour out your blessings on these amazing people in this amazing country.\nIn your son's name we pray, amen.\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: Amen.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Thanks, everybody.", "timestamp": "2017-04-16", "title": "Remarks by the Vice President and Mrs. Pence to the Troops at U.S. Army Garrison Yongsan in Seoul, Republic of Korea"}

{"author": "Mike Pence", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123756", "text": "ACTING PRESIDENT HWANG: (As interpreted.) Good afternoon. First of all I would like to wholeheartedly welcome Vice President Pence on his first visit to Korea, and I would also like to extend my warmest welcome to his family and delegation.\nVice President Pence's late father was a Korean War veteran who had devoted himself to the defense of our freedom and democracy during the Korean War. And this morning, Vice President Pence visited the Demilitarized Zone to inspect our stalwart combined defense posture and reconfirm our strong will to deter North Korea. This symbolizes not only a special personal tie, but also the depth and sturdiness of our alliance that has lasted over 60 years.\nIn particular at this time when the security situation on the Korean Peninsula is dire due to North Korea's nuclear and missile provocations, Vice President Pence's visit to Korea as his first destination in Asia since taking office shows the firm stance of the new U.S. administration on developing our alliance and responding to North Korea's nuclear and missile threats. As such, I believe Vice President Pence's visit is timely and meaningful.\nToday, the Vice President and I shared the view that on the basis of close cooperation and collaboration, the ROK-U.S. alliance has grown into an indispensable linchpin for peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia, as well as a successful strategic alliance that works together to resolve global challenges.\nWe have also reconfirmed our unwavering will to continue to make our alliance even stronger through further cooperation in the areas of security, economy and trade, and global issues.\nTen days ago on April 10th, I spoke with President Trump on the results of the U.S.-China summit and ways to work together going forward. Today with Vice President Pence we shared the understanding of the gravity and urgency of North Korea's nuclear and missile threat and agreed to double our efforts to change North Korea's strategic calculations by further tightening the global network of pressure on North Korea and thoroughly implementing sanctions under the unwavering principle of denying North Korea nuclear weapons.\nFurthermore under the shared view that China's constructive efforts and role are critical, we applaud the results of the recent U.S.-China summit, and we will closely strengthen our cooperation with China. If North Korea commits another provocation, we will swiftly implement intensive punitive measures based on our cooperation with China.\nAt the same time in response to North Korea's continuously advancing nuclear and missile threat, we have agreed to continue to pursue various measures to strengthen our deterrence capabilities and combined defense posture to include extended deterrence. We have also agreed to further strengthen the readiness posture of the ROK-U.S. alliance in response to North Korea's growing threat by ensuring the early deployment and operation of the USFK's THAAD system.\nIn this respect I appreciate the United States taking a clear position on various occasions, including at the U.S.-China summit with regard to China's unfair actions in connection with USFK's deployment of THAAD. We have agree to continue to work together so that such unfair actions may come to an end at an early date.\nFurthermore, we fully shared the view that in responding to and resolving such critical issues the watertight collaboration between our two countries is of the utmost importance, and that all future policies and measures will be made under totally seamless cooperation and coordination.\nFurthermore, as global partners we have also agreed to work together to resolve global issues.\nIt is truly meaningful that close cooperation and collaboration has continued to develop since the launch of the new U.S. administration. And I am confident that today's meeting with Vice President Pence will serve as yet another meaningful occasion for the further development of the ROK-U.S. alliance.\nThank you.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon. Ahn-young Ha-shim-nika.\nTo Acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn, thank you for the kind words and the hospitality you have shown me and my family in welcoming us to the Republic of Korea, my very first stop in the Asia Pacific as Vice President of the United States.\nIt's a great honor for me to be in South Korea today. And I bring greetings from the President of the United States, President Donald Trump, and on his behalf, I am here to express the unwavering support of the United States for our longstanding alliance with South Korea.\nPresident Trump and I are grateful for your strong partnership with the United States. We commend you personally for your steady hand in this time of transition in South Korea. The President and our entire administration admire the South Korean people's commitment to the rule of law and the democratic process -- and we look forward to the upcoming election with great anticipation.\nWhile change is coming on May 9th, the people of South Korea may be assured -- whatever change happens in your elections, the commitment of the United States to South Korea's safety and security will remain unchanged.\nOn behalf of the President of the United States, my message to the people of South Korea is this: We are with you 100 percent. Even in these troubled times, we stand with you for a free and secure future.\nThe United States of America stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the Republic of Korea, and the service and vigilance of some 37,500 U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines on this frontier of freedom stand as a testament to the enduring partnership between our people.\nThe alliance between South Korea and the United States is the linchpin of peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and indeed throughout the Asia Pacific.\nThe United States' commitment to South Korea is ironclad and immutable. And under President Trump's leadership, I know our alliance will even be stronger, our nations will be safer, and the Asia Pacific will be more secure.\nNowhere is that more evident than with our commitment to confront the region's most dangerous and urgent threat to peace and security -- the regime in North Korea.\nSince 1992, the United States and our allies have stood together for a denuclearized Korean Peninsula. We hope to achieve this objective through peaceable means. But all options are on the table.\nJust in the past two weeks, the world witnessed the strength and resolve of our new President in actions taken in Syria and Afghanistan. North Korea would do well not to test his resolve -- or the strength of the Armed Forces of the United States in this region.\nWe will continue to deploy the THAAD missile-defense system as a defensive measure -- called for by the alliance, and for the alliance. We will continue to evolve a comprehensive set of capabilities to ensure the security of South Korea. And as our Secretary of Defense made clear here in South Korea not long ago, we will defeat any attack, and we will meet any use of conventional or nuclear weapons with an overwhelming and effective response.\nStrategic patience has been the approach of the last American administration and beyond. For more than two decades, the United States and our allies have worked to peacefully dismantle North Korea's nuclear program and alleviate the suffering of their people. But at every step of the way, North Korea answered our overtures with willful deception, broken promises, and nuclear and missile tests.\nOver the past 18 months, North Korea has conducted two unlawful nuclear tests and an unprecedented number of ballistic missile tests, even conducting a failed missile launch as I traveled here for this visit.\nThe era of strategic patience is over.\nEarlier this month, President Trump spoke with you, Acting President Hwang, to reaffirm the strength of our alliance. As I reassured you today, we will continue to closely consult with South Korea and your leadership as we make decisions moving forward.\nWe also call on other regional powers and the entire international community to join us to confront North Korea and demand that it abandon its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, to turn away from renewed hostility towards its neighbors, and to end the repression of its own people.\nEarlier this month, President Trump met with Chinese President Xi at the Southern White House. The two leaders noted the urgency of the threat posed by North Korea's weapons programs and each of them reaffirmed their commitment to a denuclearized Korean Peninsula during that meeting on April 7th.\nThey also committed to fully implement U.N. Security Council resolutions, and to increase cooperation to convince North Korea to abandon its illicit weapons programs.\nIt is heartening to see China commit to these actions. But the United States is troubled by China's economic retaliation against South Korea for taking appropriate steps to defend itself. The better path would be for China to address the North Korean threat that is actually making such defensive measures necessary.\nNow while issues like that remain, the President and I have great confidence that China will properly deal with North Korea, but as President Trump made clear just a few short days ago, if China is unable to deal with North Korea, the United States, and our allies, will.\nSo today it is my privilege, on behalf of President Trump, to reaffirm the United States' enduring commitment to the security and prosperity of South Korea and to assure the people of South Korea of our unbreakable bond. We are bound together by our shared values, but also by our shared sacrifice. A free and democratic South Korea was forged in the fires of sacrifice by soldiers from both our lands. And my father was one of them.\nSixty-five years ago, Second Lieutenant Edward J. Pence, of the 45th Infantry Division in the United States Army, fought alongside brave South Korean forces, to win the freedom of this land.\nWhile he came home to raise a family, he had friends in uniform, from America and Korea, who went home to eternity. So, too, the friendship between our two free nations is eternal. We have bled together. We have prospered together. And on that foundation, the people of the United States of America and South Korea, will face the future together.\nWith courage, determination, and faith -- we go together --Katchi Kapshida.\nSo thank you, Mr. Acting President, for your hospitality. It is a great, great honor to be with you today.

When it's all said and done, we will have had thousands of guests, including many active-duty military, veterans, families, children from local schools, patients from local children's hospitals, all here to share in this historic event.\nRight about now, the President is finishing up his regular meeting with the Secretary of State. The Vice President, of course, is currently on a 10-day trip visiting South Korea, Japan, Indonesia, and Australia. While in South Korea, the Vice President participated in an Easter church service with both American and South Korean servicemembers and their families, and has been holding bilateral meetings with representatives of the South Korean government.\nThe Vice President is delivering a message to the people of the Republic of Korea on behalf of the President that even in these troubled times, the United States stands with them for a free and secure future. Under President Trump, our ironclad alliance will be even stronger, our nations will be safer, and the Asia Pacific region will be more secure.\nFrom South Korea, the Vice President will head to Japan. I'll continue to provide updates as they warrant during the Vice President's trip throughout the rest of the week.\nLooking ahead, tomorrow the President heads to Wisconsin, where he'll talk about his \"Buy America, Hire America\" agenda at Snap-on Tools in Kenosha, Wisconsin. For those of you who aren't aware, Snap-on is a prime example of a company that builds American-made tools with American workers for U.S. taxpayers. We'll be having a background briefing here in this room, later this afternoon, with senior administration officials regarding the details of the trip. Further guidance should be coming out in your inboxes momentarily.\nOn Wednesday, the President will sign the Veterans Choice Program Extension and Improvement Act. The President is proud to sign this legislation, which passed unanimously by the Senate earlier this month. The bill ensures that veterans have certainty and continuity of care while this administration works with Congress to develop a plan that reforms the VA system and gives our nation's heroes the care that they deserve.\nHe'll also host the New England Patriots this Wednesday to congratulate them on their fifth Super Bowl win.\nAnd, on Thursday, the Prime Minister of Italy will be here for an official visit.\nAnd with that, I'll kick it off to the birthday boy, Mr. Jim Acosta.\nQ: I'll take it. Thank you, Sean. Does the President have a red line when it comes to North Korea that, if they cross it, they will bring about some kind of military response from the U.S.?\nMR. SPICER: I think when we talked about the use of red lines in the past with respect to Syria -- the President's red line -- that drawing red lines hasn't really worked in the past. He holds his cards close to the vest, and you're not going to see him telegraphing how he's going to respond to any military or other situation going forward. That's just something that he believes has not served us well in the past. We did this with Mosul, where we started to talk about what the action will be months in advance. And it really gives the intended recipient of action a heads-up as to what's going on.\nSo I don't think that you're going to see the President drawing red lines in the sand, but I think that the action that he took in Syria shows that, when appropriate, this President will take decisive action.\nQ: Just to follow up on that, Syria is one thing and North Korea is quite another, when they have nuclear ambitions the way that they do. When you talk about, \"Well, we did this to Syria and we did this to Afghanistan,\" is that being a little too loose with bombastic rhetoric?\nMR. SPICER: No, no, no. And again, please don't read too much into that in terms of trying to make an analogy on the action; I think it's quite the opposite. But I think with respect to North Korea in particular, the President had a really good meeting with President Xi down in Mar-a-Lago where I think he's spoken extensively about the relationship that they made down there and that they continue to work to improve. And the results of that are paying off.\nI think you see China playing a much more active role with respect to North Korea both politically and economically, that they can continue to apply pressure to achieve results. And I think we're going to continue to urge China to exhibit its influence in the region to get better results.\nQ: But North Korea did launch that missile. They did launch it.\nMR. SPICER: I understand that. And it failed. We're well aware of what's going on. We monitored that situation. The President was kept up to date, as you know. But I think that we're going to continue to work with China in particular to help find a way forward on this.\nJohn.\nQ: Thanks a lot, Sean. The President, as you just mentioned, has spoken about this relationship that he's developed with President Xi, where President Xi would be leaning on the North Korean government to prevent the kind of attempted missile launches, like we saw over the weekend. It seems as if that effort in terms of leaning on North Korea did not work. In addition to that, the Vice Foreign Minister of North Korea said to the BBC today that North Korea will test its missiles on a weekly, a monthly, and a yearly basis. So my question is, what kind of pressure is China putting on North Korea?\nMR. SPICER: Well, again, I think this goes back to the nut of what Jim was asking, which is, I think for us to telegraph what we're going to do or what we're going to ask others to do would not be a smart strategy to lay it all out in public. But I think that if you realize -- for example, on the economic side of things, China is the number-one importer of North Korean coal. I think to see them curtail some of that has a real economic impact on the region. There's a lot of economic and political pressure points that I think China can utilize, and we've been very encouraged with the direction in which they're going.\nQ: But North Korea is essentially, just based upon what they tried to do over the weekend, thumbing its nose at even China because of what they attempted to do.\nMR. SPICER: And I understand that question. I think we're just not there yet. We've got a lot of tools left and a lot of conversations that are ongoing. But let's not get ahead of ourselves. I think we've had a very productive direction that we've seen China move in, and I think there's an agreement, I think by everyone so far, that a nuclear capable North Korea is not in anybody's best interest. And I think we're going to continue to work with the Chinese in particular on this case.\nKaitlan.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. What was their view of the White House visitor logs? What's the extent of that review?\nMR. SPICER: I'm sorry, what was --\nQ: What was the extent of their view of the White House visitor logs? What made you change your mind to not continue releasing them?\nMR. SPICER: I think as was noted on Friday, we're following the same policy that every administration from the beginning of time has used with respect to visitor logs. We will comply with both the Federal Records Act and the Presidential Records Act as stated by law.\nQ: So why does the President object to people knowing who is coming in the White House?\nMR. SPICER: It's not a question of objecting. It's about following the law. We're following the law as both the Presidential Records Act and the Federal Records act prescribe it. So it's the same policy that every administration had up until the Obama administration, and, frankly, the faux attempt that the Obama administration put out, where they would scrub what they didn't want put out, didn't serve anyone well.\nThe President wants to make sure that people can come in the same way that they can go into a member of Congress's office, provide information and details. And there's people who want to be able to come have that conversation with members of the administration, the same way that they would do with members of Congress -- go into their office --\nQ: But why didn't he take this opportunity to one-up the transparency game? If Obama was so bad at it --\nMR. SPICER: Because -- I think I'm trying to explain that to you -- I think that we recognize that there's a privacy aspect to allowing citizens to come express their views. And that's why we maintain the same policy that every other administration did coming up here prior to the last one. And the last one, frankly, was a faux level of doing that, because when you go through and you scrub everyone's name out that you don't want everyone to know, that really is not an honest attempt at doing it.\nWe are going to follow the law the way that every administration has followed up until the last one.\nZeke.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Following on Kaitlan's question, the rationale given Friday for the visitor logs reversal was for national security and privacy concerns. Both of those were clear exemptions in the Obama administration's policy which led to that scrubbing that you described. So why exactly the reversal? You seem to be describing maybe a third rationale that you're giving.\nMR. SPICER: No, I think I just touched on privacy, that people have a right --\nQ: The Obama administration had that exception to their visitor logs.\nMR. SPICER: But I think the problem, Zeke, is that we don't know what the -- I mean, they said what it was, but you don't know who got left off and who didn't. They chose to not put people out for whatever reason, and they gave an excuse and no one questioned it.\nSo the question is -- but I think the bottom line is, as I said to Kaitlan, is that we're going to have the same policy that every President has had through time and comply with the law on both fronts.\nBut again, you remember -- it's interesting that we're following basically the same thing that members of Congress follow. You go in and you meet with a member of Congress right now, that there's an option for people to go in and express their opinion. If they want to make it public, who's meeting with them -- and in a lot of cases we do, we bring in you guys to probably a greater extent than has happened before in terms of the pool spray. We list participant lists.\nBut I think there's an opportunity sometimes for American people who want to come in and have a conversation and not become -- and be able to share their view.\nSo again -- but remember, this is the same policy that every President and every administration has followed.\nQ: I'll grant you that --\nMR. SPICER: Thank you.\nQ: -- but this President entered office running a campaign saying he was going to \"drain the swamp.\" So under this existing policy, a lobbyist -- the President has decried on the campaign trail -- Washington insider, members of the swamp can walk into the White House and there is no recourse for the public to hold the President to account --\nMR. SPICER: I think you guys -- but the visitor logs to all the White House components -- OMB, the Council of Economic Equality, U.S. Trade Representative, Office of Science and Technology --\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nMR. SPICER: Huh? What I'm saying is all those are subject to the Federal Records Act. We're complying with all that and we're complying with the Presidential Record Act.\nMy point is, that, look, this is the policy that's existed from the beginning of time since they were kept through the last one. And the last one was a faux attempt at that. Again, it's not really being transparent when you scrub out the names of the people that you don't want anyone to know were here.\nAnd so I think that we've made a decision to stay in line with the law and follow the same procedures that everyone else has maintained.\nTrey.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. On North Korea, is the President prepared to act alone, or does he feel that Congress should be somehow involved in the process if any decision that includes the use of force is made?\nMR. SPICER: I think he's going to utilize the powers under Article II of the Constitution. I think what you saw with respect to the action that he had with Syria, he made sure that members of Congress were notified of his action in a very, very short amount of time. We're going to continue to seek their input on the policy overall and then make sure that they're notified. We'll do that.\nBut I think the bigger consultation issue is what we do with the larger world community and have that dialogue, as I mentioned earlier, to make sure that every country that can is putting the appropriate level of economic and political pressure on North Korea to act in a way that helps us.\nEamon.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. With tax filing day coming up, is the President going to release his 2016 tax returns, given that we can assume, maybe, that those are not themselves under audit, which is the --\nMR. SPICER: No, you can't. They are. I think it's been covered before. It's the same thing that was discussed during the campaign trail. The President is under audit. It's a routine one that continues. And I think that the American public know clearly where he stands. This was something that he made very clear during the election cycle.\nQ: And to --\nMR. SPICER: Hold on. And then so -- and the one time that it was done I think the people understand how successful the President has been and how much he's paid in taxes. But we're under the same audit that existed, and so nothing has changed.\nQ: And as you know, the IRS never comments on individual taxpayer information. This obviously is an extraordinary case involving the President of the United States. The President could authorize the IRS, presumably, to go ahead and confirm that he's under audit and to give us some details about that audit -- what years, how long is this expected to take, et cetera. Will the President authorize the IRS to confirm that he is indeed under audit?\nMR. SPICER: I think the President's view on this has been very clear from the campaign, and the American people understood it when they elected him in November.\nHallie.\nQ: You got a fly on your head.\nMR. SPICER: Thank you. Always looking out for me, John Roberts.\nQ: Political leaders in Hawaii are reviewing plans -- emergency plans in case they are attacked. Does the President believe that the level of tension between the United States and North Korea is at the point where we should start reviewing emergency attack plans?\nMR. SPICER: So just to be clear -- and again, I'm not going to get into -- I would just tell you that there are military contingency plans for almost every scenario, in numerous aspects around the world, here at home -- everything from humanitarian relief to refugee crises, to attacks. That is standard military procedure to have those kinds of things. So to make that in any way, shape or form sound new would be a mistake. It is a standard operating procedure of the military to plan for contingencies in a number of operations, in a number of hotspots throughout the world on a regular basis.\nAnd with respect to Korea, in particular, that's been going on for decades.\nQ: Sean, how high does the President view the threat level from North Korea?\nMR. SPICER: Again, I think the President has made clear we're aware of the activities that they've engaged in, and we're monitoring them. And the national security team continues to keep him up to date.\nQ: Just one more on that topic. One of the reasons why successive administrations have chosen to negotiate with the leaders of North Korea is because it's believed that there are no good military options to deal with it. Does this President believe that there are viable military options for dealing with North Korea?\nMR. SPICER: Again --\nQ: Without telegraphing what --\nMR. SPICER: I understand. But I think taking anything on or off the table is in itself limiting your options to some degree. And so I'm not going to even discuss that.\nJulie.\nQ: I wanted to ask you a couple of questions about the situation in Turkey. Is the President concerned at all about the reports from international monitors that this referendum that gives President Erdogan these sweeping powers have irregularities in it?\nMR. SPICER: My understanding is there's an international commission that is reviewing this and issues a report in 10 to 12 days. And so we'll wait and let them do their job. There were international monitors throughout Turkey and we'll let --\nQ: And what would he like to see Erdogan do? Would he like to see a hold right now while that review happens?\nMR. SPICER: I think at this point -- I don't think -- I think we'd rather not get ahead of that report and start to make decisions without knowing. There were observers there, as there routinely are, and I'd rather wait and see.\nQ: And just beyond the irregularities, just the act that Erdogan is going through to try to accumulate these powers, what does the President make of that?\nMR. SPICER: Again, I'm not going to -- they have a right to elections and their people participate in that. Before we start getting into their governing system, let this commission get through its work.\nSteve.\nQ: Sean, when Vice President Pence says, regarding North Korea, that strategic patience is over, what does that man exactly?\nMR. SPICER: The era of strategic patience was a policy that the Obama administration enacted to basically wait and see. I think we have now understood that that policy is not one that is prudent for the United States. And I think that's why you've seen stepped-up efforts, particularly with respect to China, and that's why I think the relationship that the President really is building on from the time that he spent down in Mar-a-Lago with President Xi is hopefully going to produce results.\nAnd so part of it is to actively engage with world partners like China, in particular, that have economic and political influence that they can utilize.\nQ: What would it take to restart some sort of talks with North Korea?\nMR. SPICER: Well, let's see -- again, I'm not going to get ahead of the policies right now. I think we're seeing some active engagement with China, and that's helpful. So let's see how that goes.\nHallie.\nQ: I have two for you on North Korea. You're doing it today and you've done it before -- you've stood at the podium and said you don't want to telegraph moves that the President will make to preserve that element of surprise. A Kremlin spokesperson said that President Trump is more impulsive and unpredictable than Kim Jong-un. At what point does this strategy of unpredictability become a liability?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I respectfully would disagree. I think that the rest of the world, when he acted in Syria, in particular, the world community -- not just the world community but here at home, on a bipartisan basis, applauded the President's actions.\nQ: So you see unpredictability as an asset?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think -- absolutely. But it's not -- I think that you have to look at the flip. I mean, I talked about it a minute ago -- when you look at some of the actions that we've taken in the past, Mosul being a good example, where we leaned in and started to explain what we were going to do and when we were going to do it, that takes a huge element off the table of not only surprise but achieving the effect that you're trying to do.\nSo the world community, and especially the more that he meets with world leaders and developing relationships, repairing relationships, and reasserting the U.S. place around the globe, should be reassuring to not just us here at home, but around the globe. People are excited that the President is taking action, and decisively so.\nQ: You've made it clear that you're not taking options off the table, including military options. Defense officials have estimated for a long time that war on the Korean Peninsula would cost thousands of lives, it could economically devastate South Korea. Is this to be read then as an acceptance of that risk by the Trump administration?\nMR. SPICER: No. Again, I think the point is, is that when you get into a series of hypotheticals about what you will take on or off the table, will we do this or not that -- at some point, you really start to narrow your options. And I think the President has long held a strategy that doing that begins to give the enemy, the opponent, whatever it is in any particular case, whoever it is, even if it's just a negotiation, the options of knowing where to go or where not to go. And so the President has been very clear that not taking options off the table gives us a stronger hand.\nQ: So do you accept the risk of war?\nMR. SPICER: I didn't -- no. Because, again, by what you're trying to do is to get us take something off. I think at the end of the day, we'll always act in America's best interest to ensure that our national interests are protected. And so if we were to say that we're taking something off the table in any way, shape or form, that would limit what we have to do. We are going to make sure that we do what we have to do to protect our national interests.\nAnd obviously, with respect to South Korea, we've been very clear -- the Vice President spoke very clearly about the need to strengthen and cement the alliance that we have with South Korea during his visit.\nQ: I just want to be clear, because I want to flip the coin, right -- which is something you've talked to us about -- if you're not taking options off the table, if you flip it then, that can be read is you're accepting the fact that that crisis could escalate.\nMR. SPICER: No, I think that's a stretch. I think -- that's the point. I'm not --\nQ: So you don't accept that risk?\nMR. SPICER: No, it's not a question of taking the risk or not taking the risk. Again, you can start to go down a very dangerous path of \"will you use this, will you not use that.\" The President is very clear, and I think everybody who's been briefed on it, and I think when you look at the quality of the national security team that's surrounding him -- by all accounts probably the best in our nation's history in terms of all across the board -- you know that the President is getting unbelievably sound and strategic advice on how to protect our national interests.\nBrian.\nMR. SPICER: Last week you dismissed -- I think it was when Hallie asked a question -- you dismissed North Korea and said it isn't a threat if you can't go through with it. So what changed? What's our goal in North Korea? What's the strategy? And what's your response to the critics who say that this is just blue smoke and mirrors to hide some of the problems on the White House staff that this is a failing domestic social agenda?\nMR. SPICER: I don't think there's anybody in the world who would not believe that North Korea's actions are both provocative and a concern. So the actions that we're taking are extremely --\nQ: But you said that it was --\nMR. SPICER: -- they're appropriate and justified. What we're doing is working with the world community. And as I mentioned multiple times today, especially China, which is really acting in an historic way to ensure that our national interests and the safety of the Peninsula is protected.\nQ: So what about the -- well, the follow-up there is what about the criticism from people on the Hill who say you're just hiding a domestic agenda that isn't working?\nMR. SPICER: I don't -- I've never heard that -- I haven't heard that criticism --\nQ: Actually, I have.\nMR. SPICER: Okay. Well, then we travel in different circles. Look, I don't think that there's anybody who honestly believes that after seeing the launches that they're taking and the work that they're undertaking, that any attempt to protect our country and our national interests is anything other than the right and justified thing to do.\nFrancesca.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. This morning in an interview, you referred to the missile launch as an unsuccessful military attack. That contradicts what other White House officials have said.\nMR. SPICER: It was an unsuccessful launch.\nQ: Okay, so you just misspoke in the \"Fox and Friends\" interview? There's no specific evidence that this was some sort of attack?\nMR. SPICER: No. It was an unsuccessful missile launch.\nQ: Okay. Thank you.\nMR. SPICER: You're welcome.\nGlenn.\nQ: Sean, you talked about the end of strategic patience -- two questions -- in the context of attempting to expand China's role in pressuring North Korea. Do you believe China has the power to change North Korea's behavior if they choose to do so? And then a follow-up.\nMR. SPICER: That's a good question. I think they can definitely try. There is economic and political points that they could be pushing. Whether or not they achieve that outcome is yet to be seen. But I think that there's a lot of influence that they could exhibit in both of those areas, and we'll have to see. But it's clearly the prudent thing for the President to do to try to build that relationship with President Xi and see if we could achieve an outcome that's in all of our best interests.\nQ: How concerned are you that the uptick in the language, the bellicosity, tweets, could potentially provoke unintentionally military action? I mean, is there a concern that a lot of the words that are being thrown around could have an unforeseen impact? Just explain to me what the President is thinking, how concerned he is of the risk of an unintentional conflict.\nMR. SPICER: I don't think that that's there. I think we're taking all the appropriate and prudent steps.\nJonathan.\nQ: I've got a question on North Korea and China, but first to follow up on the tax question. You've been asked about this obviously a thousand times. You always talk about under audit -- the President is still under audit. Is it time to say once and for all the President is never going to release his tax returns?\nMR. SPICER: We'll have to get back to you on that.\nQ: I mean, is he -- I mean, really?\nMR. SPICER: Really.\nQ: He may?\nMR. SPICER: No, I said I'd have to get back to you on that. I think that he's still under audit; the statement still stands.\nQ: And on North Korea, you said that China is playing an active role -- you even said a historic role -- right now in pressuring the North Koreans. What are they doing?\nMR. SPICER: Again, I think when you look at the economic front -- coal, in particular -- that that is North Korea's number-one export --\nQ: That the Chinese cut off the coal?\nMR. SPICER: I think that they have taken some very helpful economic actions and exhibited positive signs on the diplomatic front as well. But again, this is something that is an ongoing conversation both on the relationship that the President established with President Xi. And I think that we'll -- as the President has noted before, we'll have to see, but it is encouraging, the signs that China is showing.\nQ: And the President suggested there was a quid pro quo in terms of not declaring China a currency manipulator because they were helping or going to help with North Korea. So if China does not adequately put pressure on North Korea, is he going to go back and declare them a currency manipulator?\nMR. SPICER: There's a couple things on that. Number one, they haven't been manipulating their currencies since he's been in office. That's a fact. Number two is, I think the President's tweet said clearly that to do so at this time would not be prudent. It's not a quid pro quo. It's just saying that in the middle of them taking very positive signs to help us address the situation in North Korea, that to label them a currency manipulator I don't think would be very productive in achieving a very, very important national strategic objective.\nQ: Sean, on both the taxes and the visitor logs, there are now ethics experts on both sides of the aisle who say this is the least transparent administration in decades. How do you respond?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think that we've taken several steps to allow people access to this White House in terms of -- in particular the press. We hold regular pool sprays. We bring people in. We release participant lists. We give press the opportunity to come into the room, see everybody who's there. You're part of the discussion. So I would respectfully disagree with that.\nAbby.\nQ: Sean, there's a new Gallup poll out today showing that 45 percent of Americans don't believe that the President will keep -- only 45 percent believe he will keep his promises. That's down 17 percent since early February. Given some of his reversals, especially in the last week, does he risk being seen as a flip-flopper?\nMR. SPICER: I don't think so. I mentioned it on the currency, on NATO -- we talked about this last week. The question in my mind is looking at the issue and seeing -- and I mentioned NATO, and I think Matt asked it last week -- where there are certain things -- and again, on NATO, if you go back to, I think it was September 29th of last year, he was talking very specifically about some of the moves that he was seeing NATO make in a positive direction, and, already at that point, encouraging them.\nIn the case of China, they aren't, since he's been in office, manipulating their currency. The Treasury did issue a report on Friday that put them on a watch list with a number of other countries.\nSo I know that it's easy to just take an issue and say, well, he's not -- make it seem very black and white. But on these particular issues, you can see that there's movement to the President's position. I would argue that he's achieving a lot of results on the issues that he talked to the American people about. I think when you talk about the big issues that he promised the American people in terms of immigration, we see immigration is down 60 percent at the border; on jobs, jobs are coming back over and over again, you're seeing companies talk about new job creation here, new manufacturing here. The executive orders that he's signing are all consistent with the promises that he made to the American people on the campaign trail.\nAnd I think on issue after issue -- whether it's immigration, job creation, national security -- the President made very clear promises to the American people that on -- over and over again, he's achieving great success on. And so I would argue that we're going to continue to see the President not only keep his word but be rewarded by the American people on that front.\nQ: On a separate issue, about the President's continued travel to Mar-a-Lago or any other place where he's conducting official business. Does the White House believe that those other locations should be treated like this building in the sense that you guys will be transparent about who he's meeting with and what kind of official business he's conducting while he's there? Is that a commitment that you all are willing to make?\nMR. SPICER: I think we've been fairly consistent with reading out who he's meeting with and what he's done, providing the pool access to his whereabouts and what he's doing. I think we generally do. Obviously, the President has time to spend with family and he makes phone calls. We generally provide readouts of those phone calls with foreign leaders, whether he's here or in Florida.\nSo I think we've done a fairly good job of making sure that people know who he's meeting with, who he's speaking to, and when appropriate, the contents of those calls.\nQ: But, Sean, long stretches of time go by and we get pool reports from the pooler saying, we've been asking the White House for information about what the President is doing and we don't get that information. We can't even get an answer to whether he's golfing or not these days.\nMR. SPICER: I understand that there are some days you don't get it as quick as you want, but --\nQ: Some days we never get it.\nMR. SPICER: Okay, but with all due respect, Julie, he's entitled to have moments with his family and private time. So I think, respectfully, I would disagree. I think we do a very good job of getting you information, of bringing you along to events, whether he's here or at a location or even going out to dinner. We've lived up to that. I think the President is entitled to have some times with his family and friends to just catch up.\nQ: But then that's the difference then to what you're saying to Abby, which is that you are providing that information.\nMR. SPICER: No, but what I'm saying is, her question was about official business. And when he does have a call and when he does meet with advisors, we generally put it out. But when he's meeting internally, in the same way that when he's meeting here with his staff, we don't read out every staff meeting that's going on. And so when he's down, traveling, and he's having meetings -- whether it's on Air Force One or wherever -- that's what his staff does, is they provide him updates and policy briefings and give him an opportunity to make key decisions with their insight into a particular issue. That's what all Presidents do.\nAnd I think that I would respectfully suggest that we have done a really good job of making sure that the pool in particular is provided information in terms of his whereabouts, and then we've provided background briefings on issues that are coming up -- where we're going, why we're going, what we intend to do.\nSo I get that there's always going to be this back-and-forth, you guys are going to always want more. And I think that we've tried to do what we can to get you that information.\nThank you guys very much. We look forward to seeing you in Wisconsin tomorrow, if you can. Thank you.\nEND 2:44 P.M.

It's my great honor to represent the President of the United States here in the Demilitarized Zone. And I'm very grateful for the leadership of General Brooks and General Lee and the ironclad and immutable alliance that is represented here by these two strong military leaders.\nTo stand here in this place to be able to (inaudible) of the commitment of the people of the United States to our long-term alliance for the people of South Korea is a great honor for me.\nAnd I bring greetings to our soldiers here and to soldiers of South Korea from the President of the United States. We commend them for their vigilance here along this historic frontier of freedom, and we express the resolve of the people of the United States of America to stand together in the months and years ahead with the people of South Korea to both preserve their freedom, and ensure the objective of a denuclearized Korean Peninsula. It is an objective not just shared by the United States and the people of South Korea, but by our allies across the globe.\nWe are heartened by the support of allies across the Asia Pacific, including China, who will continue to advance this objective on the Korean Peninsula. And I'm here to express the resolve of the people of the United States and the President of the United States to achieve that objective through peaceable means, through negotiations, but all options are on the table as we continue to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the people of South Korea for the denuclearization of this peninsula and for the long-term prosperity and freedom of the people of South Korea.\nLet me say it's also very humbling for me to be here because my father served here in Korea in the United States Army more than 64 years ago. The General favored me this morning with a few reflections on my father's service here. And it seems altogether fitting that as Vice President I could be here to personally express the timeless bond between the people of South Korea and the people of the United States of America. People across the world should know that the bonds between our people are not simply strategic and military and economic, but they are personal, and they span generations of Americans and South Koreans.\nAnd on that foundation, we will see freedom through. We will see the interests of the security and prosperity of the people of South Korea. And in a word, we go together.\nAny questions?\nQ: Mr. Vice President, question for you. You said that everything is still on the table. Does that include a potential U.S. preemptive strike?\nAnd secondly on China, what concrete steps did China lay out to President Trump that led him to believe that China is working very hard to put pressure on North Korea?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: I think President Trump and President Xi had a very frank and productive discussion about a broad range of international issues, including the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. I know the President is hopeful that China will use its influence here on the Korean Peninsula with North Korea to achieve that objective. And we are heartened by some initial steps that China has taken in this regard, but we look for them to do more. And our hope is that we'll be able -- working with China, working with our partners here in South Korea, working with Japan and other allies across the region -- to achieve this objective through peaceable means.\nQ: And a preemptive strike would be on the table?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: As the President has made clear, we will never discuss military tactical decisions. But the President has made clear, our administration has made clear, we stand with the people of South Korea. And all options are on the table to achieve the objectives and ensure the security of the people of this country and the stability of this region.\nQ: Mr. Vice President, do you have a message for the people on the other side of this line?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: I think the message of the people of the United States of America is that we seek peace, but America has always sought peace through strength. And my message here today standing with U.S. Forces Korea, standing with courageous soldiers from the Republic of Korea is a message of resolve.\nThe people of North Korea, the military of North Korea should not mistake the resolve of the United States of America to stand with our ally. The alliance between South Korea and the United States is ironclad. We will fulfill that alliance for the sake of our people and the people of South Korea. And we will continue to stand strong to achieve our shared objective across this region and across the world of a denuclearized Korean Peninsula.\nQ: Mr. Vice President, how is this a different policy that the Trump administration is pursuing compared to the Obama administration?\nAnd why do you believe that you can trust China this time to follow through? Past administrations have sought help from China and they often haven't come through?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: I know President Trump is very hopeful that China will take actions necessary to bring about a change in policy in North Korea, an abandonment of its nuclear program and its ballistic missile program. We're hopeful that they'll use the extraordinary levers that they have and relationship they have with North Korea to achieve that objective.\nBut as the President has made very clear, either China will deal with this problem or the United States and our allies will.\nNow with regard to a change, we have literally gone through decades -- it was more than some quarter century ago that we first learned of the presence of nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula in the possession of North Korea. There was an agreed framework. There was a period of strategic patience. But the era of strategic patience is over.\nPresident Trump has made it clear that the patience of the United States and our allies in this region has run out, and we want to see change. We want to see North Korea abandon its reckless path of the development of nuclear weapons. And also its continual use of and testing of ballistic missiles is unacceptable. That clarity we hope will be received in North Korea, and that they will understand that the United States of America, the people of South Korea, our allies across the region are resolved to achieve our objectives through peaceable means or ultimately by whatever means are necessary to protect the interest, the security of the people of South Korea and to bring stability to the region.", "timestamp": "2017-04-17", "title": "Remarks to the Troops by the Vice President and a Question and Answer Session with the Press in the Demilitarized Zone, South Korea"}

EDT\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: Thank you for joining us today. This is a background briefing on the executive order that is going to be signed tomorrow in Kenosha, Wisconsin -- Buy American and Hire American. The embargo on the information you're about to hear today is 9:00 p.m. tonight.\nJust to be clear, on this particular briefing, this is just going to be on background, so you can refer to them as senior administration officials.\nQ: Last time we had one of these, you said the default would be on the record.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: And the default will be on that. In this particular case, we're going to do it as senior administration official.\nQ: Can you explain why --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: It's the Easter Egg Roll today. (Laughter.) No, in this particular case, we just wanted to get -- generally, what we would have are individuals from the different agencies brief you on this, and in this case, because several of them are traveling but we still wanted to do the background briefing, we have administration officials. That's why we're doing it on background, rather than when we bring out like the Secretary of Commerce. Then we'll do those on the record. I'm going to try to bring you as many senior officials as we can, but in this case, where you've got individuals from the White House, and so we're going to do this as a senior administration official.\nQ: So the rule is going to be that if you're Senate-confirmed, you're on the record.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: No, that's not a hard and fast rule, but in this case, that's what we're doing today.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: To follow up on his point, the lead agency for the Hire America would have been the Department of Labor, and in a normal environment the Department of Labor would already have its nominee confirmed and in place. And the lead on the Buy American would be the Secretary of Commerce, who was able today.\nThat being said, so the President has repeatedly talked about Buy American and Hire American. I'm sure you've all heard that used many, many times before. What a lot of you may not realize is those are two very specific policy positions that have long been advocated by many groups that represent workers in our country, particularly by many labor unions and labor groups in our country.\nBuy American refers to a set of procurement laws about how goods and manufactured products are obtained and how they're used in federal projects or federally funded projects. And Hire American generally refers to the body of law and policy concerning how our immigration, visa and guest worker programs are operated to ensure proper protections for American workers.\nIt's a well-known fact amongst those who study both procurement policy and our visa and guest worker policies that Buy American and Hire American rules have been enormously diluted over time. And here we'll walk through more details on Buy American, but the waivers and exemptions process in Buy American have been abused greatly, resulting in many lost job opportunities for American workers. And similarly, the Hire American rules that govern many of our visa and guest worker policies have gone unenforced or have been abused to the point of rendered, in some cases, even inoperative.\nAnd so I'll walk through now briefly the Hire American portion of the EO, but again, it's important just to look at the political context of this. And having myself been a staffer in Congress for a long time, I participated in many, many meetings with groups that represent workers that have begged for reforms to Buy American and Hire American, and they've been ignored by, frankly, the political system for a very long time. And so this is really quite an historic step -- just the acknowledgement of the problem in and of itself is quite remarkable in the sense that past administrations in both parties have failed to do so, and have failed to talk about the problems with unenforced Buy American laws and then unenforced Hire American laws.\nSo that in and of itself represents a fairly historic event and really underscores again how President Trump has changed politics as we know it and has captured the hearts and minds of working-class voters in a way that both parties have failed to do. So it's a remarkable testament to his leadership and to our changing political landscape, and turning the Republican Party into a vehicle to broadly represent working-class citizens who felt underrepresented by our political system.\nWith respect specifically to the Hire American reforms, President Trump, when he campaigned, talked a lot about abuses in our guest worker programs and in particular about abuses in our H1B visa programs, and even brought on the stage at a few campaign events individuals who had been displaced by abuses in our guest worker programs.\nNow, this executive order will call for the strict enforcement of all laws governing entry into the United States of labor from abroad for the stated purpose of creating higher wages and higher employment rates for workers in the United States. And the executive order will further call on the Departments of Labor, Justice, Homeland Security and State to take prompt action to crack down on fraud and abuse -- which should both be understood as separate problems -- in our immigration system in order to protect workers in the United States and their economic conditions.\nAnd it's really important to underscore in talking about this that, having been on the receiving end for a long time myself, I can attest to this, of calls for these reforms -- these are reforms that are broadly supported by groups that represent American workers in the United States. And a lot of the driving action historically for these kinds of guest worker reforms have been from groups that in fact even tilt Democratic. And I'm sure that many of you who have covered these issues and studied these issues understand that.\nBut the polling data shows that amongst voters, this has massive support from Republicans, Democrats, independents, et cetera, because you're talking about enforcing our guest worker programs in a way that they don't become a means for replacing or undercutting American labor at less cost.\nAnd so this would apply across the board, but, in particular, the executive order has an additional clause on the H1B visa program, and calls on those same four departments to take -- to put forward reforms to see to it that H1B visas are rewarded to the most skilled or highest-paid applicants.\nRight now, as you may know, H1B visas are awarded by random lottery. And many people will be surprised to know that about 80 percent of H1B workers are paid less than the median wage in their fields. Only about 5 to 6 percent, depending on the year, of H1B workers command the highest wage tier recognized by the Department of Labor, there being four wage tiers. And the highest wage tier, for instance, in 2015, was only 5 percent of H1B workers.\nSo 80 percent receive less than the median wage, and only 10 percent receive the median wage. And so only 5 percent were categorized at the highest wage tier of the four wage tiers that are in place for the H1B guest worker visa. The result of that is that workers are often brought in well below market rates to replace American workers, again, sort of violating the principle of the program, which is supposed to be a means for bringing in skilled labor, and instead you're bringing in a lot of times workers who are actually less skilled and lower paid than the workers that they're replacing.\nAnd we've all seen high-profile examples of this, and I'm sure that many of you are aware -- we're seeing this \"60 Minutes\" special that was aired recently on this very topic -- and President Trump has been a leader in calling attention to this effort. And I don't think anyone would dispute that he's done more to bring a national spotlight onto the abuses in the H1B guest worker program than anybody in the country has at any point in recent history.\nSo if you change that current system that awards visas randomly without regard for skill or wage to a skills-based awarding, it makes it extremely difficult to use the visa to replace or undercut American workers because you're not bringing in workers at beneath the market wage. And so it's a very elegant of way of solving very systemic problems in the H1B guest worker visa.\nJust to illustrate a little bit more how the lottery works -- so some companies oftentimes are called outsourcing firms. You may know their names well, but like the top recipients of the H1B visa are companies like Tata, Infosys, Cognizant -- they will apply for a very large number of visas, more than they get, by putting extra tickets in the lottery raffle, if you will, and then they'll get the lion's share of visas. Which is very different than I think how most people think of the H1B program -- they imagine it for more -- being for -- again, they would think of it as being for skilled domestic work, rather than contract work.\nAnd you've seen some of these high-profile examples where you have career employees at a company who have been working there for 10, 20 years, and then they get laid off and they hire a contracting firm using H1B workers at much less pay. And again, this is an issue that labor unions have called attention to for a long time.\nSo just to get real briefly -- the end of this about how those reforms could be accomplished, some of them would have to be administrative and some would have to be legislative. And so part of the effect of this executive order -- and again, the previous steps I mentioned in terms of the four departments going through all the visa programs -- a lot of that could be done administratively. But with respect to the H1B program in specific, by -- we're basically saying to these agencies, tell us everything you think you can do. And some of that will be administrative, and some if they'll say will have to be done legislatively.\nBut you could be looking at things on the administrative side, like increasing fees for H1B visas. You could be looking at things like if we could adjust the wage scale -- a more honest reflection of what the prevailing wages actually are in these fields. Obviously, taking a more vigorous stance, which various -- in the Department of Justice do with respect to enforcing gross and egregious violations of the H1B program. You could see potential -- and again, we'll have to get a full legal analysis and review from all the departments, but right now the lottery system disadvantages master's degree holders. There's ways that you could adjust the lottery system to give master's degree holders a better chance of getting H1Bs relative to bachelor's degree holders. There's a lot of possible reforms that you could do administratively in addition to a suite of legislative actions.\nAnd then again, you add that on top of the across-the-board reform process for guest worker and visa programs in general to make sure that they're strictly complying with all the rules, laws, and protections for American workers, again, which there are many, but there hasn't been this kind of systematic review. And this is something that the President, if you look, actually promised that he would have the Department of Labor go and do this kind of systematic review and take these kinds of actions.\nSo I'll just close again by saying that these are steps that are broadly supported by American workers, that would bring these programs into compliance with the original state of intent, particularly with the H1B program, which was always intended to be a skilled labor program. I think maybe you'd be shocked to know that a full-on eight out of ten H1B workers are paid less than the median wage in their fields.\nAnd these again are really historic steps by a President -- for anyone who's watched for at least the last two administrations and have seen these kinds of complaints about our immigration and guest worker system go totally ignored, and it's all because of the President and his determination to create an economy where working people can share in the wealth, where the economic growth can be enjoyed by everyday working people, and where workers in states from Michigan to Pennsylvania and everywhere in between can have a realistic path to economic success and full employment. And this, combined with the Buy American provisions, are really historic steps in that direction.\nSo with that, I'll hand it over to my colleague and then there will be questions at the end.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thank you. What I'm going to do for you in the next few minutes is read from some prepared remarks. We'll start with an overview of the Buy American order. And then I'm going to walk you through this chart, because there's four main pieces of it, and I think you'll find it really interesting.\nSo I'm going to begin by saying that, in numerous speeches, including February remarks to Congress, the President has made it clear that we will be following two simple rules when we spend taxpayer dollars on government procurement and federally funded projects: Buy American and Hire American.\nAs my colleague said quite correctly, the President's position is perfectly in tune with the American people, regardless of their political party, for only two-thirds of our citizenry support Buy American, Hire American policies for taxpayer-funded construction and manufacturing. And this support reaches across party lines.\nI brought you some charts that you can look at. We do have some handouts. But it's truly remarkable, regardless of how old you are, male, female, Republican, Democrat, independent -- it's just, boom, this is what America wants, and the President intends to give Buy American, Hire American to the American people.\nAs an overview, the executive order the President will sign tomorrow ushers in a new, more muscular Buy American policy based on the twin pillars of maximizing Made in America content and minimizing waivers and exceptions to Buy American laws. Every agency and department of government will conduct top-to-bottom assessments aimed squarely at cracking down on weak monitoring, enforcement, and compliance efforts, and at rooting out every single Buy American loophole. The Secretary of Commerce, who will coordinate these agency efforts, will then advise the President on how to properly close these loopholes.\nFor the first time, the Buy American bidding process will take into account the flagrant use of unfair trade practices like dumping and injurious subsidization now used to steal government contracts from American workers and domestic manufacturers. This order also breaks additional new ground by taking a very hard look at how waivers of Buy American and our free trade agreements may be a poster child of unfair and non-reciprocal trade in the $4.4 trillion global government procurement market.\nIf it turns out America is a net loser because of those free-trade agreement waivers, which apply to almost 60 countries, these waivers may be properly renegotiated or revoked.\nNow, let's walk through the detail of the actual executive order. And as my colleague noted earlier by way of background, there's a clear distinction between Buy American and Buy America laws and rules. Buy American dates back to the passage of the Buy American Act of 1933. This act, and related laws and rules, govern direct purchases by the federal government. In contrast, Buy America dates back to the Surface Transportation Act of 1978. This act requires the use of U.S.-made iron and steel, and the domestic production and assembly of other manufactured goods when federal funds are used to support projects like highways, public transportation, aviation, and intercity passenger rail, including Amtrak.\nFor the purposes of this briefing, however, and as explained in the executive order, we will refer to both Buy America and Buy American as well as additional legislation, such as the Berry Amendment as Buy American laws.\nLet's turn now to the question of just what the order does. And let's start -- working through the charts, we've got the center here, which is the order, and we've got four main points of this compass. We'll start up here where the order directs every agency to scrupulously monitor, enforce and comply with Buy American laws. And the message here is clear: Buy American is the Trump administration's highest priority when it comes to spending taxpayer dollars.\nAgencies have their clear marching orders, and they will be held strictly accountable for any failure to fulfill the Buy American mission. As part of this accountability, each agency will conduct a comprehensive top-to-bottom Buy American performance review, including an assessment of the agency's use of waivers and exceptions, as well as a requirement to provide recommendations to strengthen Buy American.\nPresident Trump has tasked the Secretary of Commerce, Wilbur Ross, with reviewing all the agency findings and submitting a report to his desk within 220 days. This report and its recommendations will serve as a blueprint for additional executive and regulatory actions to further strengthen Buy American, as well as guide possible legislative proposals. And knowing Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, don't be surprised if some of those recommendations come in well before the 220-day deadline.\nThe second element here speaks to this whole issue of the judicious use of waivers and exceptions. If you look at the problem here, the Trump administration's new policy is to maximize the use of domestic content and minimize the granting of waivers. Going forward, public-interest waivers in particular shall be more narrowly construed and the granting of such waivers will be elevated to the heads of agencies to ensure greater accountability.\nIn addition, for the first time, each agency may also consider the effect of foreign-sourced dumped or injuriously subsidized content in the determination of the low bid. It is simply unfair for government contracts to be awarded to low bidders that use dumped or injuriously subsidized foreign-source content to push out the domestic producers.\nAnd this portion of the executive order is an innovative step to stop the foreign cheaters from using taxpayer funds to steal our jobs, shutter our steel mills, and offshore our factories.\nAs a third key part of the order -- and this is on this portion of the chart -- there is the role of free trade agreements in weakening our Buy American laws. Many Americans may be surprised to know here that previous administrations have regularly waived our Buy American rights as part of our trade deals. In fact, our Buy American rights have been surrendered in almost 20 separate free trade agreements, as well as through America's participation in the World Trade Organization's agreement on government procurement, which covers 42 other countries besides the United States.\nIn these deals, which cover almost 60 countries in total, the U.S. typically provides what's called national treatment to foreign suppliers in exchange for so-called reciprocal access to those countries' markets, thereby waiving Buy American laws. In effect, through these deals, foreigners are treated just like Americans in the government-procurement process.\nJust why has the U.S. surrendered its Buy American rights? The guiding hope that's been driving these free trade agreement waivers is that America will pick up as much or more business in foreign government procurement markets as it gives away to foreigners. However, this hope appears misguided, as compelling evidence from a February 2017 government accounting office report strongly suggests the U.S. may not be getting its fair share of the global government procurement through its free trade agreement concessions.\nAccording to the GAO, the United States reported opening a greater percentage of its government procurement to foreign competition than the next five largest trade agreement partners combined -- the European Union, Japan, South Korea, Norway and Canada. This executive order takes a measured approach to this problem by not immediately rescinding these agreements or calling for their renegotiation. We recognize the jury may still be out until we get better data and analysis, and it is important to determine which deals may actually be working for America and which are not.\nTo that end, this executive order directs the Secretary of Commerce and the United States trade representative to comprehensively assess the effects of each of the relevant agreements to determine whether these agreements do indeed meet President Trump's standard of being both fair and reciprocal.\nWith this measured approach, our trading partners will be put on notice that the U.S. expects fair and reciprocal access to their government procurement markets. If the analysis mandated by this report indicates any agreement is failing to meet the Trump standard of fairness and reciprocity so that the U.S. is a net loser, these findings will inform the President's decision to rescind or renegotiate these deals. And the President need not wait 220 days to take such action if it turns out to be necessary.\nAs a fourth and final element of this executive order, where we go to this box here, the order strongly reaffirms the melted and poured standard for U.S. steel production. The standard remains under attack by foreign interests and lobbyists, but it is critical to maintaining the integrity of our Buy American laws.\nSemi-finished steel, such as steel slab, accounts for about 90 percent of the input costs of a finished steel product. And if a lesser standard than melted and poured were used, slabs could be imported from countries like China and Russia and only 10 percent of the production of steel would likely occur in the United States, with all of the negative impacts on jobs this would entail.\nHere, it is useful to note that every direct job in the U.S. steel industry creates seven more jobs in the U.S. economy. And through this multiplier effect, the steel industry here in America supports more than a million jobs.\nAs part of this multiplier effect, the use of the melted and poured standard ensures that the benefits of Buy American are felt throughout the supply chain, assisting suppliers of raw materials critical to steelmaking, such as iron ore, coal, and limestone miners. In each of these ways, the melted and poured standard would let us fully capture the positive impact of infrastructure spending on the iron and steel manufacturing industry supply chains. From the iron mines of Minnesota, Michigan and Alabama, and coal mines of Kentucky and West Virginia, to the integrated mills of Indiana and Pennsylvania, to the downstream finishing and fabrication shops throughout the nation.\nAs a final comment, critics of Buy American policies typically offer two lines of attack. The first is that Buy American policies drive up prices in costs, and therefore harm consumers and taxpayers. However, this critique fails to take into account either the positive income and tax-based effects generated by Buy American, or the external benefits associated with strengthening the manufacturing and defense industrial base through domestic procurement preference programs.\nIn particular, Buy American and Hire American policies lead to increased jobs and economic growth, higher wages, and a more robust tax base, and thereby offset any price or cost effects. At the same time, it is critical to the long-term economic and national security of this country to maintain a robust manufacturing and defense industrial base. And Buy American contributes to this effort across virtually every sector of our manufacturing economy, even as Hire American helps us maintain a highly skilled and highly trained domestic workforce.\nThe second line of attack of Buy American raises the specter of retaliation by our trading partners. This is simply a red herring, given that virtually all of our trading partners embrace similar kinds of domestic preference procurement programs and such programs are fully compliant with international trade law. This argument also rings hollow, given that the available evidence that I've shown you already indicates the U.S. is a big net loser in the global government procurement market.\nSo chart is here, we have copies of that. There are some people you can talk to to get comment from various labor groups and industry groups. You can check with the comms team afterward. My colleague is going to come up and -- our only request -- and this is firm and unequivocal -- we're only talking about Buy American and Hire American.\nLet's start here and then go here. Yes, sir.\nQ: In your remarks, you mentioned about the 80 percent, 5 percent, 10 percent, and the other point you mentioned about the abuse and fraud. Now, that abuse and fraud has already been given out, but what is the aim? Are you going to say that 80 percent are below, so 80 percent should be out and the 15 percent should stay? There's nothing I can see the future about H1B. The departments are working on abuse and fraud, but what is the future going to be? Are you going to cut down --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: Fraud and abuse should be understood as different things. Fraud is self-explanatory, but an abuse of the H1B visa program is to bring in a worker not because you need their skills or talent, but for the purpose of undercutting the American worker. That's the definition of abuse that we're using.\nI'm not going to, today, tell you that we have an interagency process of what share of the H1B applications to go to what different wage tiers. We're going to switch away from a random lottery system in which it's weighted toward the lowest wage workers towards a system that prioritizes higher-skilled, higher-paid workers, which would make it much more difficult to use it to replace American workers.\nQ: Do you have a timeline? Like you mentioned about the 220 days, the report on Buy American.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: It says to basically move as soon as practicable. In other words, we think that we -- the agencies are ready to get going on this right away, and we think that they'll be able to move quickly, consistent with all applicable law and regulatory process.\nQ: Can you provide us with an embargoed copy or any points from the --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: That would be a question for my colleague.\nQ: You said in the beginning about these meetings that you had and about how people really wanted reform and change. Can you tell us more about the working-class and who you're talking about?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: I was just saying that what's interesting is that -- I think it's sort of a more global operation, which is that the media oftentimes reports that immigration in a left-right nexus, which often fails to hold up against reality. If anything, the best way to understand immigration policy is more in terms of people's economic status. And by and large, your working-class voters are going to be the ones, Republican, Democrat, independent, are going to be the most enthusiastic to have guest worker reform.\nIn the case of the H1B program, that includes your middle-class workers as well who are often those who are likeliest to be displaced. So it's just a general observation about where a lot of the push for this historically has come from.\nQ: These are both executive orders, not memoranda --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: It's a single executive order.\nQ: Single executive order. And why does it need to be an executive order versus just a directive from the President? Is there symbolism or significance you're trying to give to this?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: Well, one of the things that -- when you're dealing with problems that have been very long-running inside departments and agencies, where, for instance, you have an agency culture that is too quick to offer a waiver -- and this is something in which it implicates -- how many agencies do you think are involved in federal procurement? It's a large number.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: DOT, DOD --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Right. That makes it a very large number of agencies and sub-agencies and beyond that.\nHaving a message from the President of the United States that sets forth the clear position of the federal government is a fairly historic event. And then that sets in motion, though, where there needs to be a regulatory process, where there needs to be a change in specific policy. That then follows on from that clear presidential order.\nSo the President doesn't need to get into in an executive order that level of detail, but it sets the policy. And once the agencies understand the policy, then they are able to use that to inform how it's actually implemented.\nQ: Two questions. One, just to clarify -- this order applies not only to government agencies but also their contractors?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: When you're talking about the Buy American portion, I'll direct that to my colleague.\nQ: Well, either one.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: Well, Hire American refers to the policies that govern the issuance of visas. And so that's --\nQ: So Buy American -- I'm sorry.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: So this would be more of the Buy American.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So you're question --\nQ: So the question was, does this apply to only government agencies, or also to government contractors?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: It applies to both in the sense that this is a direction that the agencies are the ones who set the contract rules and contractors have to follow that.\nQ: On the Hire American, if the President is very concerned about abuses and undercutting American workers with guest workers, why does he use foreign guest workers at Mar-a-Lago and other Trump properties?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: Well, I think, first of all, I think it's important to understand that the job of the President of the United States is to set policy for the federal government. So any questions about a private company and a private company's taxes is not even -- I'm not even able to speak to or answer. But I think during the campaign, the President addressed this at length. I'm frankly surprised that you didn't actually research that before coming here. The President was asked this question in a debate and he said, my job as President is to set policy for the American people and to make sure that we reform these programs so they work for the American people.\nAnd he's spoken about that clearly and at length. And so I just don't know if you're asking me because you don't know or because you're pretending you don't know. I mean, he answered that question --\nQ: I'd like to respond. I'm asking the question --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: Right, in other words, if you look at, like, tax policy, for example, it is the job of the private company to comply with tax policy to produce the best outcome for a private company. It's the job of the President to address any loopholes or problems in tax policy as the President to make it work.\nI don't understand the question.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: So we're going to move on now to this gentleman in the front.\nQ: Two questions on the H1B visa program. As a candidate, he said that we should end it. So I would like to know what changed in his thinking. And second, since we're not ending it, will he reduce the number of visas issued, or is it still going to stay at the 85,000?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: Well, administratively, you can't change the number of visas that are issued. But in terms of when you're telling the agencies and suggest reforms to accomplish awarding of visas to the most skilled and highest paid applicants, then as a practical matter, you're creating an entirely new structure for awarding these visas. I mean, it is a completely -- it is a total transformation of the H1B program.\nAnd what immigration reforms take place after that, and the kinds of bigger changes you could see -- as the President talked about in the State of the Union -- to create a merit-based immigration system governing our entire immigration policy -- I could foresee scenarios, which I won't get into now, where you just have a whole different way of looking at immigration. So this is a transitional step to get towards a more skills-based and merit-based immigration system.\nQ: And the first question?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: I don't remember the first question. I think I just answered that -- I answered both your questions.\nQ: You said that the order directs the Secretary of Commerce and USTR to comprehensively assess the (inaudible) trade agreement and determine whether they meet the President's standard of being fair and reciprocal. What is the President's standard of judging whether something is fair and reciprocal?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: Well, reciprocity is not what we've been getting across a whole range. Basically, what the GAO report told us and indicated was that foreign governments, contractors are getting a lot more of our business than we're getting of theirs. So that dimension would say that we need reciprocity. In other words, we shouldn't be a net loser in the government procurement game by entering into these waivers. And it looks pretty much like that's the case.\nAs I said, we want to take a measured approach to this, look at the data, do a deeper dive on it, but so far it looks like we're losers.\nIn the back there, and then we'll come here, sir.\nQ: At the outset you read off a list of companies that you said were taking advantage of the H1B visa program. Are you specifically criticizing those companies? And could you read that list again?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: No, I mean, these are the top three recipients of H1B visas. And those three companies are companies that have an average wage for H1B visas between $60,000 and $65,000. By contrast, the median Silicon Valley software engineer's wage is probably around $150,000. So it just illustrates the point that I was walking you through about how H1B visas are awarded -- if you have contracting firms that are not skills employers, that oftentimes use workers for entry-level positions, and they capture the lion's share of H1B visas. And that's all public record.\nQ: Is that a criticism of those companies --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: No. It's a criticism of the way the H1B visa program is run.\nQ: Two questions. The first, just to help our understanding for tomorrow's event, is there anything that either one of these aspects of the EO have anything to do with Snap-on Tools in Kenosha, Wisconsin, specifically?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATON OFFICIAL: First of all, any company that is involved in domestic manufacturing has an inherent interest in a narrow construction of Buy American rules. If you have any kind of federal contracting whatsoever -- and that goes without saying -- I know that's not for me to get into Snap-on's finances, but I'm pretty confident they have a lot of federal contracting work and they benefit a lot from domestic procurement policies. But more importantly, they also benefit in general when you have a more positive atmosphere for domestic manufacturing and all the benefits that that entails.\nFurthermore, when you're talking about Hire American, you're talking about making sure that we have all workers filling open jobs. And part of this event is also going to be a presence from the community college that does skilled vocational training that actually has a contract -- or a partnership with Snap-on. And so that technical college trains students to basically maintain and repair Snap-on's tools.\nAnd so -- they don't train people to work at the factory, per se, but they train people to get into the field and maintain and repair all those tools. And that's example of our economy functioning correctly -- that you have -- training American workers to do these kinds of jobs instead of bringing in workers from other countries to do them.\nQ: Just to follow up on that question about Snap, the CEO of Snap-on has said that he thinks that the biggest problem for companies like his hiring American workers is the skill level of American workers. So why doesn't this executive order address skills in particular or is there a part of the executive order that addresses training American workers so that they can fill some of these jobs?\nAnd then, just a second question is, some of the reports that will come out of the review process, will those be made public in any way so that people can know what the outcome was?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Full transparency -- those reports will be released immediately when they are presented.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah, I mean, to answer your question, with respect to the H1B visa program in particular which deals mostly with STEM jobs, we graduate about twice as many STEM students each year as find jobs in STEM fields.\nThe issue of training workers for skilled manufacturing jobs is a different aspect of policy than, say, the H1B visa, which obviously is for STEM occupations. But the reality is, is that we have large numbers of unemployed American workers. And right now, we're creating an environment with our guest workers programs where those workers are being bypassed. If you make it harder to abuse the guest worker programs, it creates more of a market for domestic workers, as well as more of a market for the kinds of job training and vocational training programs that you're talking about.\nQ: It just sounds like an EO would not necessarily affect, on the hiring side, a company like Snap-on.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I don't understand the question. I mean, it would -- in other words, the executive order --\nQ: It would not benefit this particular company, given that it affects mostly --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, I think that you're thinking about it in reverse. The way to think about it is, you're going to a company that's partnered with a college to tout the benefit of hiring American workers. And we're implementing reforms to make it harder to bypass American workers. We're saying, we have workers that are ready to go, that are trained to do these jobs all over this country. And we're saying, we don't want to allow our guest workers programs to be a way to drive down wages.\nEvery single worker who graduates from a technical college will earn a higher wage if our guest worker programs are not being used to drive down wages. And every worker who graduates from a technical school will have a better chance of finding a job if there's less competition that's artificially created for those positions.\nSo every person in that audience will benefit, in terms of their economic conditions, as a result of these reforms. So, I mean, you couldn't end up with a more relevant thing.\nYou had a question on H1Bs. Yeah.\nQ: I appreciate it. On the H1B question, is it your expectation that, administratively, you can prevent a company like Disney from going out and abusing this program without any kind of legislative changes?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, I think if you look at the Disney case, which really had to do with the subcontractor who actually makes the petition for the H1B visa. That gets to my point, which is that, I think those workers were -- I don't want to give the exact number, but tens of thousands of dollars paid less than the American workers that had those jobs before.\nSo if you implement the kinds of reforms we're talking about, some of which wouldn't be legislative. Some of it would be administrative, then it would have the effect of making that kind of displacement impossible. So we're going to ask all four departments to tell us everything they think they can do. And, you know, it'll be -- some of it will be in the administrative bucket and some of it will be in the legislative bucket.\nAnd I think that there's going to be a real serious legal review to find out what that is. I mean, preliminarily, we do think that we can make improvements to wages for H1B workers administratively. To what extent, we will see. And we do think that that we can also potentially increase some of the application fees as well, and that's something that we're going to be looking at too.\nQ: I just want to understand the process here in both of these -- both Buy American and Hire American. Once this is signed tomorrow, is there anything specifically that will change about policy tomorrow, or is it all going to follow a review process within departments and agencies?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, I'll let my colleague speak to Buy America.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Okay, so the culture immediately changes across the agencies. We have a lax enforcement, lax monitoring, lax compliance. We are moving forward with a muscular new policy that we're announcing tomorrow.\nIn terms of the waiver process itself, from day one, starting tomorrow, we're going to take a much closer look at all of those waivers. And I can assure that, from day one, there are going to be fewer waivers that are going to be granted even as we're evaluating the waiver process. We are adding, for example, this new standard for looking at the bid by taking into account the role of dumped and injuriously subsidized content that might give a low bidder an unfair advantage relative to domestic-sourced content.\nSo we also think that, just simply by looking at the trade agreement issue that our trading partners will wake up and maybe engage in more fair and reciprocal behavior.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Actually, let me just do a wrap-up and then I'll just take the last couple questions. So I'll take a few more questions, but sort of put this in perspective. And I want to thank all of you for being here and listening very patiently. I know how busy you all are.\nAnd I just want to underscore again that this is a really positive event that's really driven by a lot of complaints we have heard from groups that represent workers and workers themselves who have been the losers financially in a lot of policymaking for a long time, even though they're the hardest working, most talented people on the face of the Earth.\nQ: You mean (inaudible)?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: No, I just mean that -- this is -- I'm saying years, decades. This is the pent-up demand -- what I'm saying is that the pent-up demand for these reforms is decades long. For anyone who's covered these issues -- I mean, who here has covered H1B visa issues in the past? All right, put your hand up. I mean, how many years have you heard some version of the conversation that I'm giving you right now? Right? I mean, years and years and years. And when is the last time you saw, at a podium like this, an administration talking so openly about these issues?\nAnd to your great question back there, it's not a criticism of any company or any private business or anybody's practices. It's a criticism of Washington, D.C. -- how they've been running this program. And it's just a fact that people, probably in their heads, think most H1B visas are going to these romanticized high-skilled firms that are pioneering the technology of the future -- not contract workers -- and that's because of Congress and Washington, D.C. and the federal government for many, many years. And this is an executive order embracing the optimism of a new way of doing business in D.C.\nSo I'll just take two more questions.\nQ: Could you just answer the question I asked before on what specifically will change tomorrow in terms of hiring and visa processes, or is it going to come after a review process? I just want to make sure I understand that.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Some changes will come quickly, some will take more time. But I can assure you that there is a great appetite in these departments and agencies to get to work immediately on closing loopholes, shoring up these programs, dealing with long-running abuses.\nQ: What will come of --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I don't want to -- this is -- again, this is something that the Labor Department, the Justice Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Labor are going to do, and they're going to move expeditiously on it, and I don't want to tell you exactly how long it's going to take.\nBut the point is, is that it's a clear statement from the President of the United States to begin shoring up these abuses and to do so immediately.\nQ: You mentioned that some of this has only been done legislatively. Is the fact that this is happening now tacit acknowledgement? There's no package, there's no vehicle we're seeing in Congress on this. Is there an acknowledgement from the White House that, even with unified Republican government, this is nowhere near coming --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, I think there's great enthusiasm for H1B reform in Congress. I would submit to you that moral leadership begins with leading by example, and so we're going to do that beginning tomorrow. But I think that there is enormous enthusiasm. I think, if you brought up a bill tomorrow on the floor of the United States Senate to shore up some of these abuses, I believe that it would pass with bipartisan support. But we're going to get recommendations back from the agencies based on this process that will greatly aid the legislative process.\nBut there's ultimately -- the federal government has enormous duties and responsibilities when it comes to enforcement of our immigration and visa policies, and there's a lot that we can do administratively, and the rest will be done, hopefully, legislatively.\nQ: When you talk about leading by example -- I'm not trying to go back to a question that you pushed down before, but -- and you said the message to those companies is they're not necessarily doing anything wrong, but what's the message to companies that are essentially doing exactly what the President's companies are doing? If he's leading by example, what is the message to the companies who are doing what he's doing and following the letter for the actual --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I would again refer you back to the comments the President made when he addressed this as a candidate. But I think that the whole point -- and I think -- how many times did he say this when he was campaigning, which is that -- he spent his life in private business, and he understands the private sector better than anyone, and now he's leveraging that knowledge and experience to go to work on behalf of the American people. And I think that's a very inspirational message.\nQ: Two-part question. One, most of these companies are from India. These companies from India have been informed. And second, many of these companies, they bring sometimes people in the name of students or as visitors, and then they apply for them here for H1B. And second, as far as manufacturing is concerned, China is dumping in the U.S. What is the future?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Okay, so we'll avoid making any -- there's a lot of policy in that question that we don't want to make any news on today. But again, this is not going to -- the changes that are going to happen are going to be done responsibly and carefully, and people will be notified as the changes are made.\nDo you want to wrap it there? Do you want to take one more question? We'll do one more question. Okay, this is the last question.\nQ: You started out talking about guest worker programs in general but you spent most of the time talking about H1Bs. Are there other programs -- H2Bs -- that are specifically mentioned in this executive order that are dealt with --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: No, the only program that was mentioned by name --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: That's an easy one, you just say \"no\" and we move on.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah, it's the only program -- well, the only program that was mentioned by name is the H1B visa. But the departments and agencies are asked to crack down on fraud and abuse generally in our immigration system. But I just want to say to everybody again that we really appreciate your time and energy. And there will be lots of chances for follow-up. And I'll hand it over to my colleague.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, I'm sorry. Thank you. The handouts are some polling data that my colleague had brought along. In terms of the executive order itself, the signing of this will be tomorrow and at that point we'll send around the executive order itself. So that -- you will have to wait. This was just to give you some background on what you're going to be receiving.\nQ: Is the signing here or in Wisconsin?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: The signing is in Wisconsin.\nQ: Do you have a factsheet or something --\nQ: Yeah, do you have any --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I'm sorry. So you know what, that is a -- that's a great request. We thought the briefing itself would be enough but it sounds like you need more. So let me go back and we'll pull something together for you. And let me use -- if you've got my colleague's email address, he will be the contact person for this. And I will go talk to him now and tell him we're going to pull that together and then we can get -- okay.\nQ: And 9:00 p.m. tonight?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: And 9:00 p.m. tonight is the embargo.\nEND 5:00 P.M.

Thank you for your leadership of the U.S. embassy as our charge d'affaires. Thank you for your long career in the Asian Pacific representing the United States of America in so many different capacities. I'm grateful for your service as I know is all of our administration. Thank you, Marc.\nTo Ambassador Ahn Ho-young, members of the American Chamber of Commerce in Korea, distinguished leaders of the American and South Korean business communities, honored guests, it is an honor to be here with you today for my first stop in the Asian Pacific as Vice President of the United States of America. It's here in South Korea that we came first. (Applause.)\nAnd it's a special honor for me to have with us today a man who I've had the opportunity to spend time with, traveling around, going to the Demilitarized Zone, being briefed on the circumstances taking place across this region. To General Vince Brooks, the commander of the Combined Forces Command of U.S. Forces Korea, who proudly leads some 37,500 U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines in close cooperation with more than 600,000 courageous South Korean forces, General, we are grateful for your leadership and even more grateful for those who serve under your command. (Applause.)\nI bring greetings this morning from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. The President asked me to come here to South Korea as a sign of our commitment and his personal commitment to the United States' long-term alliance with this great country and to our not only strategic but economic partnership with South Korea.\nThe bonds of security and commerce between our nations stretch back for decades. More than 60 years ago, the United States helped establish the foundation for South Korea's security and economic strength through great sacrifice. And ever since the relationship between our two countries has grown for the benefit of both our nations and all who call them home.\nYesterday I had the privilege to meet with Acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn and leaders of the National Assembly here in South Korea. My message to them, to the people of South Korea, to the business enterprises in this country, and to all of you, on behalf of the President of the United States is simply this: We are with you 100 percent. (Applause.)\nDon't doubt it for a second. Even in these challenging times we stand with you for a free and secure future. The alliance between South Korea and the United States is the linchpin of peace and security not only on the Korean Peninsula but indeed throughout the Asian Pacific. The United States' commitment to South Korea is ironclad and immutable. As I told acting President Hwang yesterday, our alliance will be stronger. Our nations will be safer, and the Asian Pacific will be more secure. And together we will address this nation's most dangerous and urgent threat to peace and security, the regime in North Korea, and we will address it together. (Applause.)\nAs examples we will continue to work closely with our military to deploy the THAAD missile defense system as a defensive measure, called for by the alliance for the alliance. We'll continue to evolve a comprehensive set of capabilities to ensure the security of South Korea.\nAnd while all options are on the table, the United States will continue to marshal economic and diplomatic pressure from regional powers and the entire international community to demand that North Korea once and for all abandon its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, turn away from renewed hostility toward its neighbors, and end the repression of its own people. (Applause.)\nAs an example of that outreach, earlier this month President Trump met with President Xi of China at the Southern White House. The two leaders noted in their meeting, which was productive, the urgency of the threat posed by North Korea's weapons program. And both of them -- I'm pleased to say both of them -- reaffirmed both of our nations' commitment to a denuclearized Korean Peninsula.\nNow, China has taken some initial steps to bring economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea. And we welcome those steps. It's heartening to see China take these actions, and we're hopeful that they will do more in the days ahead.\nWhile the United States is troubled by China's economic retaliation against businesses here in South Korea for taking appropriate steps to defend themselves, you may be assured we will continue to communicate to China that a better path for their country would be for them to join with us to address the circumstances in North Korea that make such defensive measures necessary.\nNow while issues will remain, the President and I have great confidence that China will properly deal with North Korea. But as President Trump made it clear just a few days ago, if China is unable to deal with North Korea, the United States and our allies will.\nBeyond the issues of security and stability, our alliance with South Korea is also grounded in the shared values of freedom, free markets, and a strong and vibrant economic partnership between our two nations and our people. The businesses represented here today -- American and Korean -- have helped build a strong relationship between the United States and Korea. In fact, AMCHAM Korea has been here since the very beginning. Since your founding in 1953, you've brought together businesses large and small to invest in both of our economies. Today you boast roughly 700 members spanning dozens of industries, and you foster jobs and growth and prosperity on both sides of the Pacific.\nAnd thank you. I want to thank all of you who came out here today and the businesses that I spent time with this morning over coffee for your insights -- American and Korean companies, Ford, Boeing, Pfizer, Visa, and really all of you. You're pillars of our economy and pillars of a partnership between America and South Korea, and you have our thanks. (Applause.)\nEach of these businesses creates jobs and drive innovation in the United States and Korea. Each of you have done a tremendous work in strengthening the bond between our peoples over the last several decades. Today thanks in no smart to all of you, South Korea is, in fact, the United States' sixth largest trading partner. America's high quality products and services have made tremendous impact on South Korea's way of life. And South Korea's firms have made and continue to make significant contributions and investments in the American economy, as well.\nNow last month marked the fifth anniversary of the implementation of the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement. Since KORUS went into effect, our two-way trade in goods and services has grown by nearly $20 billion. The United States' goods and services exports have increased by more than 6 percent. Service exports alone have risen by nearly 30 percent to a record high of $21.6 billion. And today South Korea is one of the fastest growing sources of foreign direct investment in the United States of America with more than $40 billion and growing invested in the United States so far. And that's worth a round of applause. (Applause.)\nBut despite the strong economic ties between the United States and South Korea, we have to be honest about where our trade relationship is falling short. Most concerning is the fact that the United States' trade deficit with South Korea has more than doubled since KORUS came into effect. That's the hard truth of it.\nAnd our businesses continue to face too many barriers to entry, which tilts the playing field against American workers and American growth. President Trump has made it clear that the United States will pursue and America first policy in trade and exchange. We'll pursue trade that is both free and fair, and that will be true in all of our trade relationships, including KORUS.\nWe're reviewing all of our trade agreements across the world to ensure that they benefit our economy as much as they benefit our trading partners. As members of the business community, President Trump and I value your continued input on the issues that you face. And we know that you can help us level that playing field between our two countries and move toward a system that will maximize jobs and growth and a brighter future for the people of the United States of America and the people of South Korea. And we will work with you toward that end as we reform KORUS in the days ahead. (Applause.)\nThe truth is a stronger American economy means a stronger economy for South Korea, and for all of our trading partners. And you'll be glad to know the United States will continue to be a driver of global growth. And under President Donald Trump, we'll drive that growth like never before. I promise you.\nPresident Trump and our administration are working around the clock to pass an aggressive agenda to get the American economy moving again -- lower taxes, less regulation, better infrastructure, and a renewed focus on American energy. And tax reform will be one of our top priorities.\nI don't have to tell you in this room how the American tax code tends to hamper the business community at home and abroad. The ability for American companies like those that are located here in South Korea to bring profits back to the United States of America is much in need of reform. Our corporate tax rate is actually one of the highest in the developed world. It's more than 10 percent higher than the tax rate here in South Korea.\nWell, President Trump's tax plan will slash the corporate rate, reform the tax code to make it simpler, flatter, and fairer. Rest assured, our tax reform plan will make the strongest economy in the world stronger still, and that will benefit America and benefit all of America's trading partners.\nThe same is true of the President's actions to reduce the regulatory burden in America. The President has already ordered every agency in Washington, D.C. to find two regulations to get rid of before issuing any new ones. And President Trump has already signed more than a dozen bills turning back the last administration's mandates. And we'll continue to work with Congress to slash through mountains of red tape that are a barrier to economic growth and jobs.\nMake no mistake about it, under President Donald Trump, over-regulations' days are over. And there's a new era of jobs and growth and prosperity in the United States of America.\nNow, these are only a few of the policies that the President and I could discuss today. There are many more from healthcare to infrastructure. But I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to meet with businesses -- great American businesses included -- that are located here in South Korea to reassure you that we're going to continue to promote the policies in the United States of America that will cause investment to occur and businesses to thrive and jobs to be created.\nRest assured, President Trump's agenda will continue to renew America's reputation as the premier investment destination in the world, and as America grows, all of our partners will grow with us.\nAnd our success will further strengthen the bond of commerce and the bond of friendship between the American people and the people of South Korea. Of that I'm very confident.\nToday it's my privilege really to conclude by trip here to South Korea on behalf of President Donald Trump with a simple message to reaffirm the United States' enduring commitment to the security and prosperity of South Korea, and to assure the people of South Korea of our unbreakable bond.\nWe're bound together by our shared values. But also as I said yesterday following my meeting with acting President Hwang, we've also been bonded together by our shared sacrifice. A free and democratic South Korea was forged in the fires of sacrifice by soldiers from both of our lands. And my father was one of them. Sixty-five years ago Second Lieutenant Edward J. Pence, Jr., of the 45th Infantry Division of the United States Army, fought alongside brave South Korea forces to win the freedom of this land. It was my great privilege to stand with the General and look out over the landscape past the DMZ and see the very hills on which my father fought, Mount Baldy and Pork Chop Hill. For me, for my wife, for our two daughters, it was a deeply meaningful time.\nMy dad was able to come home to raise a family, but he had friends in uniform -- America and Korean -- who went home to eternity, and he carried the faces and the names of those heroes in his heart his whole life.\nMy dad any time -- and people would look at the medal that he had earned over here and been awarded -- and anytime anyone would refer to my dad as a hero, he'd shake his head and say the heroes were the ones that didn't come home. And he bore that burden his whole life. But I can't help but feel that Dad looking down from Glory today wouldn't be proud of their sacrifice and proud of his service in this great country. To see now more than six decades on the freedom that he fought and labored to win for the people of South Korea continuing to thrive, continuing to stand, continuing to prosper. Truly the friendship between our two nations -- our two free nations is as eternal as the bonds between those who fought to win it.\nAs I said yesterday we have bled together. We have prospered together. And on that foundation, the people of the United States of America and South Korea will face the future together. With courage, determination and faith, we go together. Katchi Kapshida.\nThank you very much and God bless you.

I'm delighted to welcome to Vice President Pence to Japan in April when some cherry blossoms are still remaining. Perhaps it reminded you of the big celebration of the Cherry Blossom Festival, which was held in Washington last month. So I hope you can still have some good impression about the cherry blossom.\nVice President Pence in his governor days in the state of Indiana visited Japan many times over and attracted many Japanese businesses to Indiana. He had really always worked very hard to strength Japan-U.S. relationship. Very soon after my visit to the United States where I had a very useful meeting with our dear, longstanding friend of Japan in February, I am very proud to say today that the Japan-U.S. Economic Dialogue was kicked off, opening up a new page for our bilateral relations.\nI feel very proud about it. Security and economy are two wheels supporting Japan-U.S. alliance for the stability of the Asian Pacific region, economic prosperity is indispensable. At the dialogue today, from the perspective of further deepening win-win economic relations between Japan and the United States, Vice President Pence and I were able to have a good discussion.\nGoing forward in the dialogue we concurred to discuss three pillars, namely common strategy on trade and investment rule and issues; cooperation in economic and structural policy area; sectoral cooperation. Those three pillars will be discussed.\nAs for the common strategy for trade and investment rules and issues, at the Japan-U.S. summit meeting held a while ago, two leaders confirmed that they are fully committed to strengthening economic relationship bilaterally, as well as in the region based on the free and fair trade rules.\nAnd based on this common recognition, Japan and U.S. relationship will further be strengthened. And under our bilateral leadership we will build high-level trade and investment standards and spread that to the Asian Pacific region, that is free and fair trade rules.\nTo rectify unfair trading practices in the region, Japan and the United States agree to further our mutual cooperation. Being mindful of WTO's dispute settlement procedures, Japan will push for Japan-U.S. authorities to work ever more closely, including the minister of foreign affairs dispute settlement section, as well as general counsel office, which was newly formed within METI.\nOn the cooperation on economic and structural policy area, Japan and the U.S. will actively use three-pronged approach of fiscal monetary and structural policy agreed at G7. And we'll discuss the ways to lead a balanced and strong growth. Views will be exchanged on international economic and financial developments, and we'll work closely.\nOn sectoral cooperation, infrastructure such as high-speed rail and energy various themes where Japan-U.S. could cooperate will be taken up. And Japan-U.S. economic relationship will be deepened, a multi-faceted front along with these three pillars, Japan-U.S. economic relations will leap forward significantly. And Japan and U.S. together will lead strongly economic growth of the Asian Pacific region, as well as the rest of the world.\nAlso Vice President Pence and I agreed to hold the second economic dialogue meeting by the end of this year at a mutually convenient time.\nTo further deepen Japan-U.S. win-win economic relations and to build a new history of our bilateral relations going forward, Vice President Pence and I will continue to have constructive dialogue. As far as looking at the Japan-U.S. relationship, we started with a friction, but for the very first time, no longer it's a friction. But it's based on the cooperation now. This is a very important juncture where we are opening a new page.\nThank you so much.\nVice President Pence, please.\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Konnichiwa and hello. To Deputy Prime Minister Aso, thank you. Thank you for your great hospitality and your friendship and the kindness that you've shown us in the effort that begins today.\nI thank you for your tireless work to strengthen the bond between your nation and mine. It is an honor to be back in Japan. On my very first visit to the Asian Pacific as Vice President of the United States, I had to come to Japan.\nI bring greetings from the President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. And earlier today on the President's behalf, I had the honor to meet with Prime Minister Abe to reaffirm the abiding friendship and the enduring alliance between Japan and the United States.\nThe United States-Japan alliance is the cornerstone of peace, prosperity, and freedom in the Asia Pacific. And under President Trump, America is committed to strengthening our alliance and deepening our friendship for the benefit of our people and for the benefit of the world.\nAlready our bond is growing stronger. Prime Minister Abe was one of the very first world leaders who President Trump hosted at the White House. They continued their meeting at the Southern White House, and I can attest personally that they have forged a good, personal relationship which is already benefitting both of our nations.\nTheir relationship truly demonstrates the extraordinary respect that President Trump has for our critically important ally Japan. Today as we have for more than half a century, the United States and Japan stand united in defense of democracy and the rule of law, not only in this region, but all across the world.\nTomorrow I will speak from the deck of the USS Ronald Reagan at Yokosuka Naval Base, a tangible sign of our unity with Japan and the United States' unyielding commitment to peace and security in the Asia Pacific.\nUnder President Trump, the United States will continue to work with Japan and with all our allies in the region, including South Korea to confront the most ominous threat posing this region of the world, the regime in North Korea. And let me be clear, our commitment is unwavering and our resolve could not be stronger.\nAs President Trump told Prime Minister Abe at the Southern White House so I say on his behalf today to all the people of Japan, in these challenging times, we are with you 100 percent.\nIn the face of provocations across the Sea of Japan, the people of this country should know that we stand with you in the defense of your security and prosperity now and always. Now the United States will continue to work with Japan, our allies across the region, and China to bring economic and diplomatic pressure to bear until North Korea abandons its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. But all options are on the table.\nNevertheless, President Trump and I have great confidence that together with Japan and our allies in the region, we will protect the peace and security of this part of the world and achieve our shared goal of a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.\nNow security is the foundation of our prosperity. But promoting prosperity is actually the main reason that I had the privilege of meeting today with your deputy prime minister. At the direction of President Trump and Prime Minister Abe, today Deputy Prime Minister Aso and I have the great privilege to formally launch the U.S.-Japan Economic Dialogue.\nThis dialogue presents the United States and Japan with an opportunity to deepen our bilateral economic ties and to foster jobs, prosperity, and growth on both sides of the Atlantic [sic]. We're building on a strong foundation. But as the Prime Minister said, our economies have been intertwined for generations, and this is a new day and a new chapter in relations between the United States and Japan.\nEvery day, though, our nations already exchange goods and services that improve people's lives and help businesses on both sides of the Pacific succeed. Japan is the United States' fourth largest goods trading partner and our fourth largest goods export market. And Japan is one of America's leading investors. Japanese foreign direct investment in the United States now totals more than $400 billion, the second-most of any nation.\nI saw that firsthand back in my old job when I was governor of Indiana, how trade and investment between our countries can be beneficial to us all. In 2013 and again in 2015, I led a group of Indiana businesses and community leaders here to Japan to foster closer economic ties, create jobs, and spur opportunity and growth.\nToday the U.S.-Japan Economic Dialogue seeks the very same objectives for both of our countries in full. It signifies President Trump's commitment to strengthening our economic relationship with Japan using a bilateral approach.\nToday's meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Aso was an opportunity for us to broadly discuss how we view the dialogue structure and goals. The Prime Minister and I agreed that the dialogue will focus on three key policy pillars, as he just discussed. The first is a \"common strategy on trade and investment rules and issues.\" Under President Trump's leadership, the United States seeks stronger and more balanced bilateral trade relationships with every country, including Japan. Our goal is simple: We seek trade that is free and we seek trade that is fair.\nThis requires breaking down barriers, leveling the playing field so that American companies and exporters can enjoy high levels of market access.\nThe second pillar involves economic and structural policies with a specific focus on fiscal and monetary issues. President Trump believes that both the United States and Japan can enact pro-growth and fiscally sustainable monetary and budgetary policies, a key to both of our long-term economic success.\nThe final pillar is what we call sectoral cooperation. The President and I are confident that we can find new ways to expand our economic ties with Japan in different sectors and different industries. American and Japanese businesses have much to offer each other. By working together, we can ensure that our two nations' economic leadership grows even stronger in the years ahead to the benefit of all of our people.\nThis is an important day for the partnership between the United States and Japan, and I'm deeply humbled to be a part of it. The U.S.-Japan Economic Dialogue will provide us with a new forum to address the economic issues that are crucial to our long-term success. The relevant U.S. agencies -- the Department of Commerce, the Department of Treasury, and the U.S. Trade Representative's Office will lead discussions for each of these three pillars, focusing on concrete economic results in the near term and reporting back to my office.\nThe Deputy Prime Minister and I look forward to receiving input on the progress and accomplishment from these agencies over the coming months, and we have agreed to meet again by the end of the year to discuss the progress in each area.\nPresident Trump and I are confident that working with Prime Minister Abe and Deputy Prime Minister Aso, we will open a new chapter of opportunity and agreement for both our people.\nThe President is working tirelessly to create forward momentum to deepen our bilateral economic partnership with Japan. And today's announcement is a reflection of that. President Trump and I are grateful that Prime Minister Abe and Deputy Prime Minister Aso share our goal of a mutually beneficial economic relationship, and we look forward to working with them through the U.S.-Japan Economic Dialogue to achieve our vision of an equal partnership that creates jobs and prosperity and growth in the United States and in Japan on an equal basis.\nWe have before us a historic opportunity, and today I say with confidence based on our first discussions we will seize this opportunity. We will take this moment to strengthen the ties of commerce and friendship that exist between our people. And I believe we will usher in a new era of prosperity for ourselves and for future generations.\nThere is a closeness between our people that is best described with a Japanese word, and it does not have a corollary in the English language. But I learned it a while ago. As governor of Indiana, I had the opportunity to understand and appreciate the more than 250 Japanese companies that had decided to make Indiana home. The word is kizuna, and it is a reflection of a close relationship -- a relationship of understanding and of mutual respect. And I can't help but feel today that we're renewing that relationship on that foundation as we initiate this important U.S.-Japan Economic Dialogue.\nSo thank you again, Mr. Deputy Prime Minister, for hosting me here today. I look forward to this work with great anticipation.\nQ: (As interpreted.) I have both questions to Mr. Aso and Vice President Pence. Trump administration declared they would withdraw from TPP. And within Japan great attention is drawn to what is going to be the U.S. trade policy going forward. Mr. Lighthizer, USTR nominee, said that in the agricultural area trading and negotiation Japan will be the first to target. So what will be the trade negotiation going forward between Japan and U.S.? What is the outlook? Are you looking for concluding Japan-U.S. FTA in the end?\nDEPUTY PRIME MINISTER ASO: Thank you, now can I answer your question first?\nWell, at the Economic Dialogue this time as the common strategy on trade and investment rules and issues, free and fair rule-based trade and investment is an indispensable value and action principle for realizing the growth and prosperity not only for Japan and the United States but for the rest of the global economy, as well.\nAnd on this course, once again Vice President Pence and I were able to confirm this. And based on that, having a good understanding about the situations underway in the Asian Pacific, it's important that Japan-U.S. should lead the rulemaking process in the region. I think it's very important, and we've been discussing that concretely -- not only to strengthen trade and investment flow bilaterally, but also Japan-U.S. can play pivotal role in spreading high-level, fair rules over Asia and the Pacific region.\nWe like to strengthen economic aspect of Japan-U.S. alliance, and we've been discussing that.\nAnd looking at the Japan-U.S. economic relationship, it used to be described as being an economic fiction. We started with the word fiction. And fiction used to be the symbol of our bilateral relationship, but no longer. We are now in the era of cooperation between our two countries.\nIt's not a matter of which sides say what to the other side. From the big picture and strategic point of view, we would like to seek the best shape and forum of bilateral framework and define its significance and have a good constructive discussion. And I think we were able to mark a first step toward that.\nThank you.\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, thank you for your comments, Mr. Deputy Prime Minister.\nAnd in response to the question let me say with great respect to those who worked on the Trans-Pacific Partnership in the past, the TPP is a thing of the past for the United States of America. The Trump administration has made a decision and taken steps to formally withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and that will be our policy going forward.\nBut today I think gives evidence to the fact that the United States of America is determined to reach out to our partners here in the Asian Pacific and around the world to at least begin to explore the possibility of expanded economic opportunities, including trade, on a bilateral basis.\nPresident Trump truly does believe that it's in the interests of the United States of America to negotiate trade agreements on a bilateral basis. That creates a framework within which countries can better assess whether the deal itself is -- what we call a win-win arrangement.\nBut today I think what the Deputy Prime Minister has said so eloquently is that today we're beginning a process of an economic dialogue, the end of which may result in bilateral trade negotiations in the future.\nBut we're beginning that conversation today, beginning to identify areas that we can enhance and strengthen the economic interaction between our two nations. And at some point in the future, there may be a decision made between our nations to take what we have learned in this dialogue and commence formal negotiations for a free-trade agreement.\nBut I'll leave that to the future, but tell you that these discussions are very much a reflection of the President's view that negotiating at arms' length on a bilateral basis with nations is the best path forward for the United States, the best path forward for the nations with whom we enter into such agreements, and I think in the days ahead you'll continue to see the United States work on a bilateral basis with countries around the world to expand jobs and opportunity for our people and the prosperity of the world at large.\nQ: Thank you very much. Vice President Pence, you've said that the United States will increase diplomatic and economic pressure on North Korea. Today we heard Prime Minister Abe say that while he agrees with that, and we shouldn't have dialogue for dialogue's sake, Japan also places paramount importance on the need to seek a diplomatic effort to achieve a peaceful resolution to the crisis.\nMy question is: What exactly must North Korea do? What are the conditions for beginning that dialogue? And what form should that dialogue take?\nAnd for Deputy Prime Minister Aso, President Trump during his campaign often called on Japan to share more of the burden for common defense and pay more for U.S. security presence here in Japan. What specifically is Japan prepared to do to respond to President Trump's call?\n(Speaks Japanese.)\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Thank you, Josh. Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula has been the longstanding policy of the United States of America, of South Korea, of Japan, of China, and it's been the longstanding policy of nations across the world.\nFor more than a generation, we've seen the very failure of dialogue writ large. First we remember the agreed framework of the 1990s, then we remember the six-party talks. And with good-faith efforts by nations around the world again and again, North Korea met those efforts and resolution with broken promises and more provocations.\nThat's why we've said the era of strategic patience is over. And President Trump has made it very clear: The policy of the United States of America will be to reach out to our allies in the region here in Japan where I just had a productive conversation with Prime Minister Abe on this topic. Yesterday, in South Korea, where I met with officials in the National Assembly and acting President Hwang.\nPresident Trump recently met with President Xi, and the President of China reaffirmed China's commitment to a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. It is our belief that by bringing together the family of nations with diplomatic and economic pressure, we have a chance -- we have a chance -- to achieve our objective of a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.\nNow all options are on the table, and there they will remain. But President Trump and I and our administration believes the most productive pathway forward is dialogue among the family of nations that can isolate and pressure North Korea into abandoning permanently and dismantling its nuclear weapons program and its ballistic missile program.\nAs Prime Minister Abe said today in our brief conversation, dialogue for the sake of dialogue is valueless. It is necessary for us to exercise pressure, and the United States of America believes the time has come for the international community to use both diplomatic and economic pressure to bring North Korea to a place that it has avoided successfully now for more than a generation. And we will not rest and we will not relent until we achieve the objective of a denuclearized Korean Peninsula.\nDEPUTY PRIME MINISTER ASO: Washington Post, my English hearing is still good enough. But if I may say in Japanese.\n(As interpreted.) Well, economic dialogue, TPP -- whether the TPP can be made as a foundation for a dialogue going forward, is that what you said?\nSorry. Then my English hearing is absolutely wrong. Would you mind repeating the question again?\nQ: Minister Aso, President Trump during his campaign often called on Japan to share more of the burden for common defense and pay more money for U.S. security presence here in Japan. What is Japan willing to do to respond to President Trump's calls for a better deal for the United States in the U.S.-Japan security relationship?\nDEPUTY PRIME MINISTER ASO: I think I got a picture. Response in Japanese is okay, right?\n(As interpreted.) Now, responding to your question, let's look at Japanese defense. Just the other day -- Mr. James Mattis, Defense Secretary, came to Japan, at which occasion I had an opportunity to talk with him.\nAt least look at Okinawa's host nation's support -- host nation's support came up as a topic. And he said that Japan is behaving like a textbook case -- 75 percent is paid to the Okinawa host nation; ROK -- 40 percent; 30 percent Germany; and 20 percent Italy. That is a burden share. And I think whole picture was understood by General Mattis.\nAnd also just lately when the Abe Cabinet was formed, look at the defense expenditure -- how it is being allocated. The navy is the crucial area where more budget allocation has been done, followed by air and the land. And I think this is the most appropriate allocation of the defense budget.\nSo at least -- ever since inclusive by General Mattis and other military personnel of the United States with regard to the Japanese defense or discontent, at least no message has been given to us from the United States as far as I know. So we will continue to make mutual effort and try to share the information as much as possible going forward, and particularly look at the East China Sea and Korean Peninsula and Sea of Japan. Certain fictions might arise. So information exchange is particularly important -- intelligence sharing and the information sharing has to continue in appropriate manner most of all because of the situation we are in.", "timestamp": "2017-04-18", "title": "The Vice President's News Conference with and Japanese Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso in Tokyo, Japan"}
{"author": "Sarah Huckabee Sanders", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123768", "text": "Aboard Air Force One\nEn Route Kenosha, Wisconsin\n12:54 P.M. EDT\nMS. SANDERS: I'll give you guys a couple of quick updates real quick and then I'll take questions. I'll keep it short so we have more time for questions. Also, my apologies, I thought we were landing at 1:30, so I'm a little delayed today.\nWe obviously -- we're headed to Wisconsin where the President will sign a copy of an executive order that will make significant progress towards Buy American and Hire American, the cornerstone of President Trump's vision for a government that answers to the American workers who built this country.\nInstead of going into detail on that -- and, frankly, during Q&A, if we can skip over that -- I have copies of the executive order I'll bring back -- they're printing right now -- and give those to you guys. And then if you have questions after the event on that, I can come back and --\nQ: Has it gone out on email already?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't think so. So you guys -- as far as I know, it has not gone out, so I'll give you guys a first -- hard copies on that.\nIn terms of other announcements and a couple of things, I know we've had quite a few questions come in about the Paris climate meeting that is being rescheduled due to a lot of scheduling conflicts, including several of the people that wanted to participate in that meeting being here in Wisconsin, and part of this trip and a couple of other things. And so that date has not been set when it will be, but it will be scheduled at some point over the next couple of weeks.\nAnd then, lastly, Sean mentioned yesterday that the Prime Minister of Italy will visit on Thursday, and there will be a joint press conference in conjunction with that visit. And so those are all the announcements I have.\nWith that, I'll take you all's questions.\nQ: Following up on Paris, can you respond to the reports that the reason it was delayed is because there's a lot of discord about how to proceed among the top advisors, whether or not to pull out?\nMS. SANDERS: No, the reason, like I said, that it was -- they wanted to have that conversation. Since they haven't had it, I don't think they could say that there's a lot of discord between where everyone is. And that's the purpose of the meeting. And so it was, again, scheduling conflicts for today.\nQ: What's the President's feeling about the Paris agreement? Would he like to pull out? I know he's voiced skepticism in the past.\nMS. SANDERS: I haven't had a chance to have that conversation. Again, I think that's a lot of what this meeting will be about, is the conversation and an open discussion about that.\nQ: On the Turkey situation, is there kind of a disagreement between what the State Department said and then what the President appears to have said in that readout that we got last night congratulating the Turkish President? And is there kind of a dissonance in that message?\nMS. SANDERS: Not at all. So the President -- the purpose of his call, obviously: one, to congratulate; but two -- and I think the bigger point and priority -- was to talk about shared interests as a NATO Ally and a partner there. And look, the Middle East is a pretty rough neighborhood, and sometimes you have to get together to help them beat the bullies, like Syria. And that was something that certainly needed to be talked about.\nQ: Is the President concerned about the future of democracy in Turkey as a result of this vote?\nMS. SANDERS: I mean, we want to encourage democracy. And again, the purpose of the President's call yesterday was not to discourage that but simply to talk about some of the things, like Syria, where they can work together.\nQ: But doesn't it send a message that he supports the fact that President Erdogan expanded his power with this very controversial vote?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't think that -- again, that wasn't the purpose of the call. And that's certainly not the position of the President, and of course supports democracy and would hope for that. But at the same time, the President's number-one priority is protecting Americans, keeping Americans safe, and sometimes we're going to have to work with other countries and some of our NATO partners in order to do that.\nQ: Should that be viewed as an acceptance of the results? I mean, the opposition party is --\nMS. SANDERS: I'm sorry?\nQ: The opposition party is questioning the results, calling for a recount. Should President Trump's phone call be viewed as an acceptance that those are the official results of the referendum?\nMS. SANDERS: No, I think we've encouraged -- I think it's -- don't quote me if I get this wrong -- but OSCE, the election commission, to take a close look at those election results. They're the gold standard when it comes to that. And we certainly want them to do everything that they would normally do in that process and make a determination and put out a full report.\nQ: So did he not congratulate him?\nQ: Sarah, just two questions. One on Turkey, one on the executive order. On Turkey, would it be okay for the President -- is it okay for the President, acceptable, to have an undemocratic Turkey that is a strong ally against terrorism? Is that an acceptable result for the President?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't know that the focus, again, should be on whether or not it's acceptable. I think the President's number-one job is to keep Americans safe. That is his priority. That has been the focal point during the campaign as well as since he took office. And if he needs to work with countries like Turkey and others to do that, I think that's his priority and that's what his focus is.\nQ: Second question, on the executive order. Is it explicitly intended to reduce the number of foreign workers in the United States?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not going to get too far ahead of the President's comments and his remarks that he'll make, but if you guys want to take a look at the executive order, which I'll bring to you shortly, and then after the President speaks if you still have questions we'll work on getting answers to that.\nWe'll take one more. Let's make this the last one. Because I don't want to fall.\nQ: On the event today, is the President trying to re-embrace a populist economic stance after a week when he did reverse some campaign positions, like on Chinese currency, for example, or the Ex-Im Bank?\nMS. SANDERS: The President has never changed his economic message. It's been pretty simple and pretty clear from the very beginning -- that's to grow our economy and create more jobs. That's exactly what he's going to talk about here today. That's what he's been talking about every day on the campaign and every day since he took office.\nQ: Is that why Steve Bannon --\nMS. SANDERS: Sorry, I'm going to take a question from Margaret before we land.\nQ: I have a question, but I also want to clarify to a question. Is what you're saying that the phone call was not an official acceptance of the results of the Turkish election? Or are you just not commenting on that? I just wanted to clarify that.\nMS. SANDERS: That wasn't -- my point was that, again, we want the commission that looks at those to do their job and to do a report on the election results. But the purpose of the call was to congratulate him but also primarily to talk about some of their shared interests, like Syria, primarily.\nQ: And can you just make this official -- on taxes. Today is tax day.\nMS. SANDERS: It is.\nQ: It is, indeed. Will the President be willing to come back and at least talk with us in person a little bit today about his decision not to release those returns? And can you also on the record talk about why the President's decision on staffing at Mar-a-Lago with foreign workers does not run afoul to the message he wants to send with the Buy American, Hire American EO?\nMS. SANDERS: On the first part, I will certainly put your request in to the President and let him know that you guys would love to speak with him. And on the second part, can you say that again? I'm sorry.\nQ: Yeah. On Buy American, Hire American, there were some questions in the background briefing yesterday but I was hoping you could address these on the record about why hiring practices at Mar-a-Lago with foreign workers don't send a mixed signal with what he's hoping to achieve with Buy American, Hire American policy. And I was just hoping you could address that on the record.\nMS. SANDERS: Let me get some specifics on the transcript from yesterday. I haven't had a chance to look at it, but I will and I'll come back afterwards and give you something.\nQ: Has he filed his taxes today, Sarah?\nMS. SANDERS: Honestly, I haven't had a conversation with him about that but I'll ask.\nQ: Can you check on that?\nMS. SANDERS: I'll ask. Did you guys all file your taxes today?\nQ: Of course.\nMS. SANDERS: Of course. We've only got one, come on. (Laughter.) All right. Thanks, guys.\nEND 1:02 P.M.

EDT\nQ: On the EO, are you asking agencies to consider getting rid of the lottery system?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, I think that the question is -- the lottery system right now has no regard for skill, wages, salary, et cetera. So if there is a way to not have it be random but take into consideration all of those things, that's something that should be pursued. What can be done administratively and what can be done legislatively is part of what we're asking agencies to tell us. They've never been asked to go through before and look at all of the reg, all of the rules, of all of the guidance documents and come back with the answer to that question.\nTraditionally, you can have a similar effect by raising the fees or the wages paid to H1B workers because it wouldn't be a random lottery anymore because a lot of the folks that benefit from a random lottery that wouldn't be able to anymore.\nQ: Can you repeat that? I'm so sorry, I didn't hear.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So if you raise the fees or the wages paid to H1B workers, it has the effect of replacing a random lottery system, because even if you're still doing a lottery, it's not random because you're excluding from that lottery folks that are paid well beneath the market wage, or, if you raise the H1B fees, companies that are not looking for skilled workers -- because if they're looking for skilled workers, foreign workers, you're obviously willing to pay a premium. If you're not willing to, then I suggest that you perhaps have a different idea in mind.\nQ: What do you say to the criticism, one, that this is ultimately going to have the adverse effect, that ultimately you're going to look for skilled laborers from outside of the country, and two, that the people who want to see action, that's not actually demanding any action, it's just asking for a review?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: The irony of the second one is you have reporters saying, why an executive order? Why not just pick up the phone and tell them to do it? Well, that's the point. The most muscular thing you can do is an executive order. So I'm starting on your second question first.\nQ: -- than an executive order?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: The best thing that you can do in the realm of administrative action is an executive order. And so agencies now know that when they're asked to give us the full, total menu of all options, it's because the President of the United States has demanded it and specifically demanded it in the context of an executive order which says it's the policy of the government to promote job opportunities and higher wages for American workers.\nAnd so specifically on the wage point, let's say you're going to prioritize higher wages for American workers, you're telling these agencies to find ways to avoid allowing guest workers to be used at beneath-market pay.\nSo an executive order is a very muscular way of getting the agencies to begin that process. And remember, if you go back to the Obama administration, they did some rule-making on guest worker policy and it wasn't done through the executive order process. And nobody said with that that it wasn't strong action. Of course, it was a strong action in the other direction. We're going to be even stronger than that, though, because this is done under the cover of a President's executive order.\nTo your first point -- she asked another question -- so you do get some criticism, that's true, from employers who rely on contract laborers who are trying to cut labor costs. But the job of the United States government is not to be representative to -- and companies will always try to get an advantage by cutting labor costs. That's the job of a company. It's not the job of the American government to have a race to the bottom trying to help any particular company reduce labor costs to the lowest degree possible. It's the job of the United States government to represent the interest of the nation as a whole, and the interests of the nation as a whole is to have higher wages paid to American workers, in particular, or in general, and STEM-trained American workers specifically.\nWe actually have -- to finish the part of your question about looking elsewhere -- we actually have a massive supply of American workers who are trained in STEM -- a lot of great literature and research is done in this area -- that graduates from college with STEM degrees, not able to find employment, or, conversely, they worked in a STEM field for many, many years and laid off in the prime of their career. So the evidence of that point is clearly substantial.\nQ: -- today said that it was hard for them to find enough trained workers to do the kind of jobs that they have in the U.S.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Specifically, are you referring to STEM jobs or a different kind of field?\nQ: -- the kind of jobs --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: -- tech field, for instance, there are tens of thousands of tech layoffs on an annual basis. So are we saying that those workers, the one who are laid off, have lost their entire skill training and career?\nJust imagine for a second, you're one of the tens of thousands of laid-off tech workers, watching TV, being told there aren't American workers trained to do these jobs. That must strike you as a very incongruous statement when you yourself have been laid off. But the point about -- if a company says it's hard to find a worker to do a job, any particular job, the answer to that is not to use immigration policy as a substitute for training and employing our own workers. That's why we had Gateway Technical College at the event today to highlight the need for vocational education in our country.\nSo regardless of which thing is true in a particular circumstance, the answer still isn't to bring in low-cost labor. In other words, if an American worker is available, hire them and hire them at an appropriate wage. If an American worker is not available, the solution is not to bring in another worker from another country to do a job, the solution is vocational education and training.\nQ: So two follow-ups on that. You're talking about -- let's accept your premise that there are domestic workers that are capable of doing this. Two questions. Why not just do an executive order that raises the fees as you have described, enacting that policy instantly? That's the first question. And secondly, on this issue of the older workers, why not incentivize through the tax system, or create some program in terms of educational subsidies that gives American companies an incentive to hire these older workers who, as we know, are often kicked to the curb by tech companies?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, the discount for hiring an H1B worker over an American worker to be -- is $40,000. I won't get right now into specific cases, but there's some high-profile examples where large numbers of American workers were laid off and replaced by foreign guest workers. And the wages kind of ranged between $20,000 and $40,000. So it's very hard for workers to compete with a $20-$40,000 wage discount for a worker who comes here on a three-year visa.\nQ: -- attack it right now instead of studying the thing.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: -- your question first. It is not like a -- sometimes you hear like businesses are offering a 1 or 2 percent margin. These are sometimes 40 percent salary discounts.\nOn the first point, there's a administrative process that has to be followed to get that done. I don't want to get into the details of what that is. I don't want to prejudge the very complex process with respect to rules and regulations. But it was our judgment that we would have the most profound effect in the end by starting with the general instruction to agencies to come up with a full menu of reforms to move forward on.\nQ: How soon would you like to have this review done?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, starting immediately. In other words, literally, this afternoon the work has already begun.\nQ: But when do you want to hear back?\nQ: What's happening this afternoon?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: The workers at the agencies are already beginning to do research in response to the President's order.\nQ: And when would you like to hear back?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I imagine we'll be hearing back on some possibilities in days, and others in weeks. But the timeline for implementing different kinds of reforms depends on the preexisting architecture of -- again, I don't want to prejudge, but the rulemaking process is a complex one, and different actions -- some require to go through the (inaudible), some don't require going through the (inaudible.) I don't want to tie our hands by elucidating all the possible options, but there are many.\nQ: -- Buy America half of this, yesterday you talked about how if after the review of the waivers, specifically, it was found that those are not good deals for America, those waivers, the trade agreements could be either revoked or reformed in some way. Is that -- I didn't see that language specifically in the EO, though maybe I missed it. Is that still something that's a possibility?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: -- the first ever review of worldwide procurement procedures that includes looking at all of our free trade deals in WTO that affect procurement. And we believe that that will show that it has not been reciprocal, that we basically gutted our own Buy American laws and not for the same amount of sales in return for our products in other countries.\nWhen those determinations come back, logically that would lead to a decision about what aspects of trade deals or WTO arrangements could be revisited. But additionally, the public interest waiver, which is the broadest waiver in Buy American, has been abused the most. And further, by saying that calculating the price of a particular bid that you can take into account the use of dumped steel also means that a lot of folks that are currently winning binds from foreign countries presumably wouldn't be able to win those bids anymore if there's a finding that they're using dumped goods. So that will certainly change a lot of outcomes.\nBut, look, a lot of this has to do with -- using that same word again -- extremely muscular implementation. And all the agency heads now have to be accountable to the President of the United States. The order putting waivers on their desks, they now have to answer to the President for every decision they may make about a waiver, and that introduces an enormous amount of accountability.\nQ: I just want to follow up on Gwen's question. It sounded like what you were saying was that I'm in favor of -- that it's very likely that fees will be raised, the number of H1B visas, or the pendulum may be shifted --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I don't want to -- we're going to get a full menu of options from the agencies that will comply with the President's order. But continue.\nQ: -- what you were saying was part of the reason to go through the study and to do it that way, in addition to just gathering information and doing the fact-finding, is that it's just a better likelihood of where you kind of think you probably are or leaning towards doing sticking if you run through the full process -- is that kind of a fair way to think about it?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah, I mean you're -- let me rephrase just so -- we're dealing -- the rules that govern H1Bs are four agencies, four departments, right? You know this. I'll indulge myself in rephrasing. So you have four -- each of them have their own set of rules and regulations. In one case, you have an department that doesn't even have a confirmed head of a department yet. And each of those rules and regulations and memos all have their own governance procedures.\nThe best hope of having the most comprehensive solution is to give those agencies the ability -- and departments -- to dig deep and come up with the most robust set of options possible and then methodically implement them.\nQQ: And then just to follow on Steve's question about the timing -- I think the reason we keep -- it's not to be pesky, it's really to understand. I think -- when, on the background call -- when the 220-day thing -- so I think everyone is thinking is nothing going to happen before 220 days?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, so that's a different thing. So on the procurement side, the thing that's supposed to happen immediately is drastic minimalization of waivers, and especially public interest waivers, and much, much tougher enforcement and much, much more accountability. So, in other words --\nQ: And that will happen as soon as a matter of weeks?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: In other words, from now on, when any waiver request crosses anyone's desk it has to immediately comply with the terms of the executive order.\nQ: Is there a time frame coming up that you can share with us, just that we can keep our eyes on?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: No, as soon as I get that information I'll let you know. But the --\nQ: -- focus on action that is demonstrable action that's going to happen sooner rather than later. What did you say, the drastic minimalization of the public interest waivers be something for us to look at?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah, that's right. That's the --\nQ: That's something we can assert in our story.\nQ: Well before 220 days.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Every executive order -- I'm sorry, every public interest waiver that comes through now has to -- or the request has to comply with the executive order, full stop.\nQ: How many people typically?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I mean, it's a complex patchwork of projects across state, local and federal that have any kind of federal --\nQ: Can you retroactively review existing ones and retroactively deny?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I don't want to give you an answer to that without being better informed on the question.\nOkay, so then on the -- so all the reports and things that are 220 days out should best be understood as monitoring the progress and the success in accomplishing the immediate change. So that's the very important point, is that immediately, we're saying, comply with these executive instructions with every waiver that comes across your desk. And then, some days later, we're going to check in on your reports -- to figure out how to maximize accountability and to give us the broadest range of information about what further actions had to be taken.\nOn the immigration piece, \"as soon as practical\" means just that. When a President issues and executive order and it says \"move as soon as practical,\" then that is what is going to happen. And so as soon as we're able to move is exactly how soon we will move. In other words, we will move -- how do I put this -- whatever the quickest responsible time frame possibly is, it will be that time frame and no slower.\nQ: When you talk about muscular -- if you could expand on that. What does that mean? I mean, is that basically speaking more loudly to your agencies, or does that carry legal standard by having an executive order to help if it gets tied up in court, say?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, this is -- so there's nothing litigable here. In other words, the directing agencies in the case of -- let's just -- the immigration piece, for instance. We're fortunate in that with visa and immigration law, that we have extraordinarily robust laws already on the books. And in fact, you look up the citation that's in these executive order referring to the entry of foreign labor. And so directing agencies the o immediately enforce all of the various rules and restrictions governing entry of workers from abroad is against -- it's not litigable. I mean, you're just saying, use the laws and tools you have right now to the greatest extent possible to protect American workers. So that is an immediate muscular instruction. \"Muscular\" is just the term I'm choosing to use to --\nQ: -- ask one thing?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah, go ahead.\nQ: You're talking to your own agencies, right? So they report to you. So why do you need to have an executive order to make them do something, since they work for you, right? I mean, I'm missing something maybe, because I thought an executive order went beyond that, that you're creating some sort of legal justification for a thing that doesn't do --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: An executive order is a signal to every single worker in the federal government, including career workers -- everyone across the federal government that it is a order from the President of the United States, memorialized in writing, with all of the enormous legal ramifications of it being an executive order in terms of the chain of command in the executive branch.\nI would probably rephrase this -- I would say -- legal ramifications, I would say, just -- the administrative ramifications of saying that this is an order from the President of the United States. There is no higher statement of executive direction than the form of an executive order. And so when you're dealing with -- look at, like, our immigration order on border security, which was an executive order, and look at how much of an effect that has had being in the form of an executive order.\nQ: But it was litigated.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: No, no, no, we're talking about --\nQ: But it was, right? This is different.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We're talking about a whole bunch of different things, but the executive order on border security has -- to my knowledge, nothing in it has been subject to litigation. But regardless -- in other words, the executive order on border security and the one on interior immigration enforcement. But regardless -- we're getting a little bit off track with, like, all this.\nQ: Was there anything that you seriously considered in one of your drafts for this that was removed because of the potential for litigation?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: No, because the absolute best way to get the best result is the formula that's in this executive order, period. And remember, we've done a great number of different executive actions and each executive action requires a different approach.\nLike, for instance, in the case of -- to cite an obvious example that I know is on your mind, in the case of -- travel restrictions, the last stipulates it must be done by presidential proclamation. So everything just depends upon lawyers' best judgment about what is the most appropriate way to construct something to have the best policy outcome.\nQ: Just to clarify something you said, you said that you didn't want to speak about what he can go back and renegotiate.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: He asked me a question that --\nQ: Existing waivers.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: -- that I haven't -- he asked me a question that I haven't contemplated or spoken --\nQ: Yesterday -- the guidance that you guys put out yesterday says, \"If it turns out America is a net loser because of those free trade agreement waivers, which apply to almost 60 countries, those waivers will be promptly renegotiated or revoked.\" I'm just trying to understand.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: He was asking a different question.\nQ: The public interest waivers.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I think you two are having a different conversation now.\nQ: What's the difference between these waivers, then?\nQ: They're entirely different waivers for us, because --\nQ: Then I don't -- this just says waivers of Buy American.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: You're, I think, talking about free trade deals. And I believe you're quoting the senior administration official who said something about how in the course of investigating free trade deals, that if provisions in those trade deals proven to be harmful to Buy American, then we could renegotiate or even rescind those provisions. I believe the question that you asked was --\nQ: There are waivers that are written into the covenants of the trade deals, is what you're saying.\nQ: Yeah.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Right, that's the question that you're asking.\nQ: -- the public interest waivers that you were -- as part of the --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: The public interest waivers are part of federal law governing Buy America.\nQ: For bidding.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah.\nQ: Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's for bidding.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: And you asked a question about some kind of a --\nQ: Okay, so I'm just forgetting that one is for free trade agreements --\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Right. You had a different question about sort of a preexisting waiver under Buy American law, could it be revisited in the case of like an ongoing contract or something. And I just sort of hadn't really studied that question.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: All right, thanks, guys.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thank you.\nQ: Thank you. Appreciate your coming back. Thanks for coming back.\nQ: Sarah, really quickly, did you get an answer to whether the President submitted his taxes?\nMS. SANDERS: I will before we land. Do you all have any other follow-ups from earlier?\nQ: Do you know what the dairy thing he was talking about was? The President, the fight with Canada?\nMS. SANDERS: So there was a story in I believe The Washington Post, and we're aware of it, keeping an eye, monitoring it, and reviewing it is essentially where it stands right now.\nQ: Is the President talking to Trudeau? I mean, if you call out Canada in a speech like that, are they talking on the plane by any chance?\nMS. SANDERS: I haven't been back there, I've been back here with you guys. So I'll find out if anything -- I'm sure we would alert you all.\nQ: Bloomberg and AP, and I think Reuters all have dairy stories out, so we're definitely --\nQ: Yes.\nMS. SANDERS: -- cheese, and many other dairy products.\nQ: Everybody likes milk and cheese. What about the lactose intolerant?\nQ: What about the curds? How did we get --\nQ: I have one follow on Turkey that we didn't get to ask. Given all the backlash that you guys are getting about this call to Turkey, do you have any regrets about making that call?\nMS. SANDERS: No. Again, the President is putting Americans' safety first and foremost, and why would he ever regret taking steps to protect Americans?\nQ: Could you have done that call without congratulating him, or taking a step toward enhancing his own powers that some people are very worried aing democracy?\nMS. SANDERSE: It's about developing the relationship and being able to have that open conversation, and that's what they did. And no, he wouldn't have any regrets about that.\nQ: Any further update on North Korea? Has the President talked to his advisors for an update or anything like that?\nMS. SANDERS: He's continuing to be regularly updated and monitoring that situation very closely.\nQ: You don't have any kind of timing guidance or next-steps guidance on North Korea that you can share?\nMS. SANDERS: I think we've made pretty clear that the President is not going to lay out a plan one way or the other. But again, he's keeping a very close eye, as well as interagency communication, watching that situation very closely.\nQ: No further calls to the Chinese that you can --\nMS. SANDERS: Not in the last hour.\nQ: One very quickly on Georgia. Does the President see this as a referendum on his first 100 days?\nMS. SANDERS: I wouldn't use the word \"referendum.\" I think he hopes to have a Republican elected to that seat, and hopefully it will be someone to follow in Tom Price's footsteps and be a leader from that district. And so that's what he's looking forward to seeing whether that plays out tonight.\nQ: How do you plan to mark the 100 days of the presidency?\nMS. SANDERS: We'll have updates coming on that soon and probably throughout that week.\nQ: He'll travel?\nMS. SANDERS: We don't have any announcements on it at this time.\nQ: What did you say?\nMS. SANDERS: We don't have any announcements on it at this time.\nQ: A speech?\nMS. SANDERS: You guys always do this, you all trade off asking in different ways. But nice try, I like the enthusiasm.\nQ: Any new date set for the Paris discussion?\nMS. SANDERS: Not yet, but we'll keep you guys posted.\nQ: We heard as soon as tomorrow.\nMS. SANDERS: It could be as soon as tomorrow, but I know that they're working on trying to find a time that works for everybody.\nQ: It's fair to say, without any more details, that you expect a week's, several days' worth of events leading up to the marking of the 100 days? He sees it as an important landmark?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't know if there will be events, but I know, for instance, a lot of you guys have stories and a lot of the networks have shows that are specific to that all week long. So I would imagine we weigh in on some of those activities that you all have created for us.\nQ: Thank you.\nMS. SANDERS: You bet.\nQ: Thanks.\nQ: Thank you.\nQ: Is this on the record? I'm sorry.\nMS. SANDERS: My part is on the record. Thank you.\nEND 5:17 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2017-04-18", "title": "Gaggle on Background on the Buy American, Hire American Executive Order"}

That was a—yes, that was a great day, have to say. That was a great day. And thank you, Wisconsin.\nNo administration has accomplished more in the first 90 days; that includes on military, on the border, on trade, on regulation, on law enforcement—we love our law enforcement—and on Government reform.\nToday we're building on that optimism, and I'm proud to announce that we're about to take bold, new steps to follow through on my pledge to buy American and hire American.\nI can't think of a better place to make this announcement than right here at Snap-on—I just took a tour of the company—good place, by the way; it's doing well too—standing among the workers who make the tools that will rebuild our Nation. Your craftsmanship is incredible.\nIt's a pleasure to see my good friend, Governor Scott Walker. He has been such a big help. He has been so incredible. Stand up, Scott. Governor Walker. As well as Senator Ron Johnson. We worked hard together. Thank you, Ron.\nAnd although he could not be here today, my thanks go to Speaker Ryan, who's represented this city for nearly two decades in Congress. And you know where he is? He's with NATO and—so he has a good excuse. And I said, Ron, make sure these countries start paying their bills a little bit more. They're way, way behind, Ron.

[Laughter] Reince went to school right here, just about a mile away, where he took his wife Sally to the prom. And that was a match made in heaven. Very nice.\nI also want to thank Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin for being with us today. Secretary Mnuchin is working to put together a tax reform plan to make our industry more competitive and also to provide a level playing field for our workers. We don't have a level playing field, believe me. You're going to have one very soon. And our tax reform and tax plan is coming along very well. It's going to be out very soon. We're working on health care and we're going to get that done too. Our Education Secretary, Betsy DeVos, is also here. Where is Betsy? She's around here someplace. Stand up. Thank you, Betsy. Secretary DeVos is working to ensure that our workers are trained for the skilled technical jobs that will, in the future, power our country.\nI'm excited to be joined today by students from Gateway Technical College. And remember the college president, Bryan Albrecht. Thank you. Great job. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, Bryan. Your partnership with Snap-on is a great example of why vocational education is the way of the future.\nWhen I was growing up in Queens, we had vocational schools; they were great. We don't have schools like that so much anymore, but we're bringing them back: vocational schools. These are very talented people that love that type of work, and it's great work. It really is great work. So vocational schools are going to be a big factor in the Trump administration.\nTogether, we're going to do everything in our power to make sure that more products are stamped with those wonderful words: Made in the U.S.A. The old days, we used to use it. We don't use it so much anymore. We're going to start using it again: Made in the U.S.A.\nFor too long, we've watched as our factories have been closed and our jobs have been sent to other faraway lands. We've lost 70,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization. And you've seen that, you've heard about it—70,000. The World Trade Organization, another one of our disasters. But this election, the American people voted to end the theft of American prosperity. They voted to bring back their jobs and to bring back their dreams into our country.\nThat's why I'm here today. In just a few moments, I will be signing a \"Buy American and Hire American\" Executive order. You haven't heard about that in a long time in this country. With this action, we are sending a powerful signal to the world: We're going to defend our workers, protect our jobs, and finally put America first. I see all the \"Make America Great Again\" hats, so that's—it's a good crowd. Those are good hats. [Laughter]\nThrough the years, Snap-on tools have been at the center of our industrial life. Your tools have fixed the cars our families depend on. They've sailed with the fleets that patrol the oceans. They've fixed the planes that cross our skies. And Snap-on tools have reached the heights of space, used by astronauts in orbit to carry out their very, very important work. And I don't know if you noticed, recently I signed a very big order. We're going to spend again on NASA, the space program, and that's something we need, and we also need it psychologically. But it's going to be very exciting.\nFor decades, this company has served the needs of American workers. It's time we had a Federal Government that does the same. The \"Buy and Hire American\" order I'm about to sign will help protect workers and students like those of you in the audience today. This historic action declares that the policy of our Government is to aggressively promote and use American-made goods and to ensure that American labor is hired to do the job. It's America first, you better believe it. It's time. It's time, right? It's time.\nFirst, we will fully monitor, uphold, and enforce our \"buy American\" laws, which we haven't done. \"Buy American\" laws require that when the Federal Government buys, builds, or funds a project, domestic goods and products should be used. But over the years, these \"buy American\" standards have been gutted by excessive waivers and reckless exemptions. The result has been countless jobs and countless contracts that have been lost to cheap, subsidized, and low-quality foreign goods. With this order, I am directing every single agency in our Government to strictly uphold our \"buy American\" laws, to minimize the use of waivers, and to maximize \"Made in America\" content in all Federal projects. It's time. And for the first time ever, we are going to crack down on foreign bidders that used dumped steel and other subsidized goods to take contracts from workers like you. They take them away, and they've been doing it for a long time. Not going to happen anymore.\nWe are finally standing up for our workers and for our companies. In short, this order declares that American projects should be made with American goods. No longer are we going to allow foreign countries to cheat our producers and our workers out of Federal contracts. Everyone in my administration will be expected to enforce every last \"buy American\" provision on behalf of the American worker, and we are going to investigate every single trade deal that undermines these provisions.\nSecondly, we are going to enforce the \"hire American\" rules that are designed to protect jobs and wages of workers in the United States. We believe jobs must be offered to American workers first. Does that make sense? Right now widespread abuse in our immigration system is allowing American workers of all backgrounds to be replaced by workers brought in from other countries to fill the same job for sometimes less pay. This will stop. American workers have long called for reforms to end these visa abuses. And today, their calls are being answered for the first time. That includes taking the first steps to set in motion a long-overdue reform of H-1B visas.\nRight now H-1B visas are awarded in a totally random lottery, and that's wrong. Instead, they should be given to the most skilled and highest paid applicants, and they should never, ever be used to replace Americans. No one can compete with American workers when they're given a fair and level playing field, which has not happened for decades.\nWe're using every tool at our disposal to restore the American Dream. In fact, when it comes to wasteful, destructive, job-killing regulations, we are going to use a tool you all know very well—it's called the sledgehammer. [Laughter] It's what we're going to use. We're also going to stand up for our dairy farmers in Wisconsin—and I've been reading about it, and I've been talking about it for a long time—and that demands, really, immediately, fair trade with all of our trading partners, and that includes Canada. Because in Canada, some very unfair things have happened to our dairy farmers and others, and we're going to start working on that with Ron and with Scott and with Paul, with all of your representatives. What's happened to you is very, very unfair. It's another typical one-sided deal against the United States. And it's not going to be happening for long.\nSo, Scott, you and Ron and myself and Paul and everybody else, we're going to get together, and we're going to call Canada, and we're going to say, \"What happened?\" [Laughter] And they might give us an answer, but we're going to get the solution, not just the answer, okay? Because we know what the solution is, all right? And if you guys can't do it, we'll bring maybe Reince. Reince, you ready, Reince? We better bring Reince back. No, we'll get that done. We're going to work on that very hard. We're going to work on it immediately; in fact, starting today. It's a terrible thing that happened to the farmers of Wisconsin.\nThe fact is, NAFTA has been a disaster for the United States, a complete and total disaster. And we're going to do some things, and we have all sorts of rules and regulations that are horrendous. Like we want to start to negotiate with Mexico immediately, and we have these provisions where you have to wait long periods of time, you have to notify Congress, and after you notify Congress, you have to get certified, and then you can't speak to them for a hundred days. The whole thing is ridiculous.\nNAFTA has been very, very bad for our country. It's been very, very bad for our companies and for our workers, and we're going to make some very big changes, or we are going to get rid of NAFTA for once and for all. Cannot continue like this, believe me.\nBig things will be happening on trade with other countries over the coming months, and I mean very big. We're also working with Congress on tax reform and simplification, and we're on time if we get that health care approval. So press every one of your Congressmen, press everybody, because we want to get that approval. And it just makes the tax reform easier, and it makes it better. But it's going to make it steeper, it's going to be bigger, and that's what we want to do.\nSo we're in very good shape on tax reform. We have the concept of the plan. We're going to be announcing it very soon. But health care—we have to get the health care taken care of. And as soon as health care takes care of—we are going to march very quickly. You're going to watch—we're going to surprise you. Right, Steve Mnuchin? Right? Secretary of Treasury. I see Sean, and—stand up, Sean. Stand up.\nI had no idea—I was told a year ago—he's been so great to me—I was told a year ago he's like a world champion climber; climbs the trees. And after that I look—every time I look at him, I look at him now differently. I'm very impressed with that, Sean. [Laughter] And he's also very good on television and very helpful. Thank you. Thank you, man. Thank you.\nWe'll be making big investments in rebuilding our military and repairing our badly depleted infrastructure. And that will happen soon also—infrastructure. Big infrastructure bill, probably use it with something else that's a little bit harder to get approved in order to get that approved. But infrastructure is coming, and it's coming fast.\nNew ships, bridges, tunnels, and airplanes will be constructed with American hands, American steel, and, yes, American tools. As we work to restore the American Dream at home, we're also working to restore America's standing abroad. That means strengthening our partnerships and ensuring that our friends and allies pay their fair share, and that very much includes, as I've already said in my little statement to Paul, it also includes the NATO companies and countries. They are really sort of letting us down in that one respect, and we don't want people taking advantage of the United States. And that's not going to happen for very much longer. I'm going over there very soon, and we're going to have it, and everybody is going to be paying. And we're going to be a much happier country; we're going to be a much happier world.\nNo matter the circumstances, everyone will know we act from this core conviction that America's strength must be unmatched and its first priority unquestioned—the safety and security of our citizens. This is the surest path to a more peaceful and prosperous world for us all.\nTogether, we can build a better future in the spirit of this company's earliest days. Great company, great history. I recently learned that decades ago, in the 1920s, when your salesmen entered a dusty repair shop, or stained a nice, beautiful stained garage floor—which I've seen many of—he would find a spot to lay out a beautiful green felt mat. The people of the company know what that means. And on that green felt mat, he would carefully place a gleaming set of new Snap-on tools. The founders of this company wanted their customers to know that the tools of the mechanic were just as important as the tools of the doctor, the dentist, the politician, or the business leader, and that his craft was a noble, noble craft, as noble as any. This is a wonderful story about your company and its Wisconsin heritage. And Wisconsin has a truly great heritage, and it's led by incredible people.\nBut it's also a story that tells us a lot about the American spirit. In America, we honor work. We honor grit. We honor craftsmanship. We honor the men and women who turn dreams into reality with their own two hands. In America, we honor all of you.\nWe are a nation of builders. We are the country that dug out the Panama Canal, that put a man on the face of the moon, and that linked our cities with majestic railroads and curving highways. We are the country that is always on the cusp of the next invention. But we can only get there with all of you. We can only restore this Nation we love so much by working and building with all of you.\nWe can only get there together. We are the one people sharing one destiny, saluting one great, beautiful American flag. I'm thrilled to be here today, to celebrate our great American heritage and to proudly embrace our great American future.\nI want to thank the people of Wisconsin for doing so much for me. That's why I came back here—not just for the company, frankly; for the people of Wisconsin. You have been so incredible to me and my administration, and we will never, ever let you down.\nGod bless you. God bless the American worker. God bless the American Dream. And God bless the United States of America. Thank you all very much. Tremendous honor. Thank you. Thank you very much.\nGet ready everybody. This is a big one. Get ready. How about having some—Scott, Ron, and everybody, come on up. Come on up. And the Governor, come on up. Come on up here. Who shall I give the pen to is the big question, right? [Laughter] I think one of them should get it. Come on up folks. Great representatives. Okay, this is a tremendous honor for me, and the only question is, who gets the pen?\n[At this point, the President signed the Executive order.]", "timestamp": "2017-04-18", "title": "Remarks on Signing an Executive Order on \"Buy American and Hire American\" in Kenosha, Wisconsin"}

{"author": "Mike Pence", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123763", "text": "THE VICE PRESIDENT: Lieutenant General Martinez, Major General Chiarotti, Vice Admiral Aucoin, Vice Admiral Doman, Rear Admiral Williams, Rear Admiral Carter, Rear Admiral Inoue, Rear Admiral Shimo, Captain Donnelly, Chargй Hyland, Ambassador Sasae, Director-General Mori, members of United States Forces of Japan, the Japan Self-Defense Forces, it is my high honor and distinct privilege to join you here today on America's flagship -- the USS Ronald Reagan -- where every day, all of you prove it can be done. (Applause.)\nYou all look sharp out there, but at ease. It's so good to be with you today.\nI bring greetings from the President of the United States of America, your Commander-in-Chief, President Donald Trump. (Applause.)\nI spoke to the President this morning, just before I boarded the ship. He said to tell you that he's proud of you. And he said to me, \"I wish I could be where you are.\" And I know he meant it, from the bottom of his heart.\nThe President sent me here today to thank you -- to thank you for your service -- all of you, American and Japanese, who have stood up, who've stepped forward to protect our countries, our values, and our very way of life.\nYou are the sons and daughters of freedom, willing to defend it with your life -- so that your families, your fellow countrymen, and future generations may continue to call themselves free. Give yourselves a round of applause. All of America is proud of you. (Applause.)\nThe Good Book tells us, \"if you owe debts pay debts, if honor, then honor, if respect, then respect.\" I stand before you today, on behalf of your Commander-in-Chief, to pay a debt of gratitude to each of you and to express the well-deserved respect of the President of the United States and the American people for all of you who wear the uniform of this country.\nOur prayers for you, for your families, your safety rise every day into the heart of heaven. In a word, you are the best of us -- heroes all. And you are here, the Americans among you so far away from home, because the United States of America and Japan are bound by history, a time-honored treaty, and the abiding oath of friendship.\nThe United States-Japan alliance is the cornerstone of peace, prosperity, and freedom in the Asia Pacific. And let me be clear: Under President Donald Trump, the United States stands unwavering in our alliance and unyielding in our resolve to defend all that we have built together over these generations. (Applause.)\nOur bond with Japan is strong and growing stronger by the day. In February, only weeks after he took his oath of office, President Trump welcomed Prime Minister Abe to the White House, where they reaffirmed in their words \"their strong determination to further strengthen the U.S.-Japan alliance.\"\nYou here, on the deck of this great ship, are the physical manifestation of that alliance, and I have to tell you it is deeply inspiring to stand before you today, and see what I see gathered here on this deck. Every American would be inspired and proud if they had this view, and I know I am. (Applause.)\nAs the President and the Prime Minister made clear, the United States will strengthen its presence in the Asia Pacific, Japan will assume a larger role and responsibility in our alliance in the years ahead, and both of our nations will continue to expand our cooperation for our common defense.\nUnder President Trump, the United States' commitment to Article 5 of our Security Treaty is unwavering. And our treaty covers all of the territories administered by Japan, including the Senkaku Islands.\nIt's fitting that today I deliver this message aboard this great ship, a majestic ship, the USS Ronald Reagan, here at Yokosuka Naval Base. Her steel deck literally signifies the ironclad alliance our country enjoys with Japan and our enduring commitment to the Asia Pacific. (Applause.)\nAnd we are standing on a ship named after my second favorite President. Our 40th President, Ronald Reagan, was a great President who powerfully reminded us that peace only comes through strength. You are that strength.\nToday, over 50,000 U.S. troops and a further 50,000 civilians and family members are stationed here in Japan. And the United States will continue to deploy more of our most advanced military assets to the region in the years ahead.\nBeyond this noble ship and the carrier strike group that it leads, by the year 2020, this ocean will boast 60 percent of our Navy's fleet. And the skies above already have F-35 Joint Strike Fighters flying for freedom. (Applause.)\nAnd you can rest assured, the full range of the United States military capability is dedicated to the protection of Japan. Japan, you are our friend -- you are our ally -- and on that foundation, we will face the future together.\nUnder President Donald Trump, the United States once again will stand with our allies and stand up to our enemies. (Applause.)\nAnd I can assure you President Trump will unfailingly support the brave men and women in uniform who defend our freedom every single day.\nWe're the proud parents of a United States Marine, stationed as we speak at a naval air station in the South of the United States. And I have to tell you, as the parent of someone in the service, it is the greatest privilege of my life to serve as Vice President to a President who is so dedicated to the men and women of our armed forces, their families, and our veterans.\nI can tell you from my heart: President Donald Trump will be the best friend America's Armed Forces will ever have. (Applause.)\nThe President and I will honor your commitment and secure America's safety through historic investments in our national defense.\nJust as President Ronald Reagan restored the armed forces in his day, so too President Donald Trump will make the strongest fighting force in the world even stronger still.\nJust look at what President Trump has already accomplished. In his first 100 days, President Trump has taken decisive action to end the era of budget cuts for America's military. (Applause.)\nPresident Trump has submitted a budget which will rebuild our military and restore the arsenal of democracy with the largest increase in defense spending since the days the namesake of this ship sat in the Oval Office. (Applause.)\nAnd in just the past two weeks, the world witnessed the strength and resolve of our new President in the decisive action that he took in Syria and Afghanistan. The enemies of our freedom and this alliance would do well not to test the resolve of this President -- or the capabilities of the Armed Forces of the United States of America and our allies. (Applause.)\nMake no mistake: Under President Donald Trump, the United States will be strong -- stronger than ever before. For as history attests, when America is strong, the world is safe. (Applause.)\nA strong America -- militarily, economically, and diplomatically -- is vitally important to this region and all who call it home. It was through the bravery of our servicemembers and the spirit of our people, that America established the foundation of peace and freedom that endures in the Asia Pacific to this very day.\nAnd under President Trump, the United States will continue to defend prosperity and ensure security on these seas, and between our lands.\nToday, as in ages past, American leadership lights the way. The United States stands with all our allies and our partners in the region to keep the peace, enrich our people, and advance the common good.\nTogether, we will defend the rules-based order upon which the region's progress, past and future, depends. We will protect the freedom of navigation and overflight and other lawful uses of the sea, in the South China Sea and elsewhere, and we will ensure the unimpeded flow of lawful commerce on the Seven Seas. (Applause.)\nAnd we will uphold international rules and norms, promote peaceful diplomatic dialogue to address issues of regional and international concern, and we will defend human rights -- because the dignity and worth of every person is an eternal value of the United States of America.\nUnder President Trump, the United States will faithfully defend all that we hold dear -- for we know that if we falter, the light of truth and freedom in the world could swiftly be extinguished.\nWe gather here today, on this deck, and in this place, as storm clouds gather on the horizon. On Monday, I traveled to the frontlines of freedom, where the vibrancy of a free South Korea meets directly the repression of North Korea. At the Demilitarization Zone, I met with the brave men and women who watch over that land, day and night.\nThey know what you who stand in the gap in this region already know -- North Korea is the most dangerous and urgent threat to the peace and security of the Asia Pacific.\nFor more than a generation, North Korea's leaders have sought to develop nuclear weapons and the ballistic missiles on which to deliver them. They have impoverished their people and embittered the region in their pursuit of this dangerous goal. For more than two decades, from the Agreed Framework of 1994, the Six-Party Talks from year 2003 to '09, to the strategic patience of the recent past, the United States and our allies have worked to tirelessly to peacefully dismantle North Korea's nuclear program and alleviate the suffering of its people.\nBut at every step of the way, North Korea answered our overtures with willful deception, with broken promises, and nuclear and missile tests -- including a failed missile test they attempted just this past Sunday.\nAs President Trump has made clear to the world, the era of strategic patience is over. (Applause.)\nAt the President's direction, the policy of the United States will be to continue to work diligently with Japan, our allies across the region, China, and the wider world to bring economic and diplomatic pressure to bear on the regime in North Korea, and we will do so until they abandon their nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\nBut as all of you know, readiness is the key. And you, the instruments of American policy, should know -- all options are on the table. History will attest, the soldier \"does not bear the sword in vain.\"\nAnd those who would challenge our resolve or our readiness should know: We will defeat any attack and meet any use of conventional or nuclear weapons with an overwhelming and effective American response. (Applause.)\nThe United States of America will always seek peace, but under President Trump, the shield stands guard and the sword stands ready.\nRest assured, under President Trump's leadership, the United States will continue to protect our people and our allies and to strengthen the bonds between us -- today, tomorrow, and every day that follows.\nAs I look out across this deck, I see men and women -- American and Japanese -- who have answered the call to duty. And you have my deepest respect. In these challenging times, it is you -- through your voluntary service and your sacrifice -- who guard the flame of freedom, undimmed and undiminished, to give to generations to come.\nThe President and I have absolute faith that you will accomplish this mission and freedom will prevail because you follow in the footsteps also of those who defended freedom in the Asia Pacific in the past. I stand before you deeply humbled to be among so many in uniform because my own life's journey did not take me into the uniform of the United States. But it took my father.\nSixty-five years ago, a young Edward J. Pence left his home, in Illinois, put on the uniform and crossed this vast Pacific on which you serve. Like so many of his countrymen, that second lieutenant in the 45th Infantry Division of the United States Army landed on the shores of South Korea, in the midst of a battle for freedom, a rifle in hand, resolved to defend that freedom with his life.\nJust two days ago, I stood at the Demilitarized Zone, and looked out across the landscape -- the very landscape where my father had fought, in the Battle for Old Baldy and the battle on Pork Chop Hill. It was a deeply emotional experience for me. There, alongside his brothers-in-arms, American and Korean, my dad had helped seize the high ground, repulsing more than 20 enemy counterattacks. And they seized the high ground of freedom, which prevails in South Korea to this day. (Applause.)\nSixty-four years ago last week, my dad was -- had a medal pinned on his chest for his valor on the field of battle. But like most of our nation's heroes, my dad never talked much about his time in combat. I believe that he carried in his heart something that you understand in ways that I perhaps never will.\nMy dad never thought of himself as a hero. He often would say that the heroes were the ones that didn't get to come home. He lost friends -- young shining faces filled with promise -- who gave the last full measure of devotion for your sake, and for mine to defend our freedom and to plant freedom in that ancient land. And they succeeded.\nSo now it's our turn in this generation. And more to the point, it's your turn. Today, we best honor the sacrifices of those who have gone before by defending the freedom they fought and bled and died to secure.\nAnd on behalf of your Commander-in-Chief, this we know you will do.\nAs President Ronald Reagan said in his time, \"we must realize that no arsenal, or no weapon in the arsenals of the world, is so formidable as the will and moral courage of free men and women. It is a weapon our adversaries in today's world do not have.\" (Applause.)\nFor generations, the United States has stood guard over the Asia Pacific, protecting freedom through our strength of will and strength of arms.\nWith our friends and with our allies, with Japan and so many others, we have ushered in an era of unprecedented peace and prosperity on these seas and between our lands.\nOur choice today is the same as in ages past: Security through strength, or an uncertain future of weakness and faltering will. Let me assure you, under President Donald Trump, the United States has again chosen the way of strength. (Applause.)\nUnder President Trump, the United States has chosen prosperity and security and an unwavering commitment to the Asia Pacific.\nAnd in the name of the generations that came before, together with our allies, with confidence in all of you, and in the Commander-in-Chief who leads you, I know we will together go forth to meet the glorious future that awaits, a future of freedom for ourselves and our posterity.\nThank you. Godspeed on the USS Reagan's imminent deployment. God bless you. God bless Japan. And God bless the United States of America.

{"author": "Mike Pence", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123772", "text": "THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, good afternoon. Konnichiwa. (Laughter.)\nTo Chris LaFleur, thank you for that gracious introduction and for your great leadership; to Ambassador Sasae; to the chargй d'affaires, Hyland; to our state minister, Sonuora (ph); the members of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan; members of the Keidanren; representatives of the Mount Fuji Dialogue, distinguished business leaders; and my friend the Secretary of Commerce for the United States of America, Wilbur Ross, who is with us today. (Applause.)\nIt is great to be back in Japan. This isn't my first time here. As governor of the state of Indiana, it was my great privilege to come to Japan, which is a great partner with the people of that heartland state, on two difference occasions. But it is my first trip to the Asian Pacific, so I had to some to Japan as Vice President of the United States of America. (Applause.)\nI bring greetings from the President of the United States, President Donald Trump.\nYesterday, under the President's behalf, I had the honor to meet with Prime Minister Abe to reaffirm the abiding friendship and the enduring alliance between Japan and the United States.\nThe United States-Japan alliance is the cornerstone of peace, prosperity, and freedom in the Asia Pacific. And under President Donald Trump, America is firmly committed to strengthening our alliance and defending the prosperity and security that we have built together between our nations.\nAs President Trump told Prime Minister Abe, so I say on his behalf today to all of the business leaders that are gathered here, to all of the people of Japan: We are with you 100 percent. (Applause.)\nKnow that we stand with you, now and always, and together, we will address the challenges that we face in these uncertain times; and most especially, we will address the region's most dangerous and urgent threat to peace and security -- the regime in North Korea.\nNow rest assured, under President Trump, the United States is unwavering in its commitment to defend Japan. Earlier today I had a great privilege to speak on the deck of USS Ronald Reagan at Yokosuka Naval Base. Her steel deck I said there signifies the ironclad alliance between the United States and Japan. And it is a testament to our commitment to our shared security. (Applause.)\nToday, over 50,000 U.S. servicemembers and a further 50,000 civilians and family members are stationed here in Japan. And the United States will continue to deploy our most advanced military assets in the region. And with regard to this challenge, let me be clear: While all options are on the table, the United States will continue to work directly with Japan, our allies across the region, and China to bring economic and diplomatic pressure to bear on the regime in North Korea until they once and for all abandon their nuclear and ballistic missile programs. (Applause.)\nThe President and I have great confidence, that together with Japan, and our allies in the region, we will protect the peace and security of this region, and achieve our shared goal of a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.\nSecurity, of course, is the foundation of our prosperity, and prosperity is what I came to talk about with all of you today.\nUnder President Donald Trump, the United States is deeply committed to strengthening our economic ties with Japan. For more than 70 years, our nations have been partners in commerce, bringing our peoples together and generating growth and prosperity for generations to the benefit of both our nations.\nToday, the United States' partnership with Japan is one of our most vibrant and one of our most cherished. And the American Chamber of Commerce Japan has played a pivotal role in that relationship for decades.\nSince 1948, you've brought together hundreds of businesses, on both sides of the Pacific, to develop commerce between our nations and to invest in our shared future.\nAnd the same goes to all the businesses represented here today. I just had the opportunity to meet with a number of great American and Japanese business executives -- companies like Aflac, IBM, Toyota, General Motors. All of you are pillars of our shared prosperity. And join me in a round of applause for these great business leaders who have joined us here today. We are truly honored by your presence. (Applause.)\nYour businesses create jobs and drive innovation in the United States and in Japan. And thanks in no small part to your hard work, the economic partnership between the United States and Japan will continue to grow and flourish. Of that I'm confident.\nOur two nations have powered the global economy for decades, and today, we account for nearly a third of the world's gross domestic product. And the trade between us is an important factor to our success.\nIn 2016, Japan was the United States' fourth-largest goods exports market. From aircraft to medical devices, machinery to pharmaceuticals, the United States has sent more than $63 billion worth of goods to Japan last year alone.\nWhen you add in services, our annual exports are closing in on $110 billion, supporting more than 600,000 good-paying American jobs.\nOur countries have also invested historic sums in each other's economies. America is a top foreign direct investor in Japan, with over $108 billion invested.\nAnd the benefits flow both ways. Today, Japanese-owned businesses employ 839,000 American workers, and Japanese foreign direct investment in the United States topped a stunning $411 billion -- the second most of any nation in the world. And America is grateful. (Applause.)\nI know from firsthand experience how important Japan is to the American economy. And some of these business leaders I actually met in my old job. As governor of the state of Indiana, in 2013 and 2015, I led a group of business and community leaders here to Japan. I'll always be incredibly appreciative of the more than $1.8 billion in planned investments and the nearly 7,000 jobs in the state of Indiana that have been created by Japanese-owned firms during my time in office.\nI must tell you that I saw firsthand in the state of Indiana more than 250 Japanese companies that came not just to do business, but to help build communities. And the relationship that I saw develop in communities large and small across my heartland state could only be described with that Japanese word kizuna. It's a bond. It's a bond of friendship, of shared heritage and shared values.\nAnd now, as Vice President, I'm grateful to all the Japanese businesses that are investing all over the United States at this very moment. I believe the best is yet to come.\nEver since President Donald Trump's election, Japanese businesses have dramatically increased their commitment to the American economy, and we're grateful. Last December, for instance, SoftBank announced a $50 billion investment in the United States, creating 50,000 new American jobs.\nAnd in January, Toyota unveiled a $10 billion investment in America, and just last week dedicated more than $1.3 billion to a plant in the state of Kentucky.\nThese are only a couple of examples of many more that I could name at the podium today. The truth is, though, is that our economic partnership with Japan could still be even stronger, and that's why President Trump is taking critical steps to strengthen our bond in the years ahead.\nPresident Trump has made it clear that our administration will strengthen our international trade relationships using a bilateral approach, and yesterday, at the President's direction, I met with Japanese Deputy Prime Minister Aso to kick off the U.S.-Japan Economic Dialogue. And we've gone straight to work. (Applause.)\nThis dialogue presents the United States and Japan with the opportunity to deepen our bilateral economic ties, and to foster jobs, prosperity, and growth on both sides of the Pacific.\nIn yesterday's meeting with the Deputy Prime Minister, we broadly discussed how we view the dialogue's structure and goals. That dialogue we decided will focus on three key policy pillars in the months ahead.\nThe first is to seek a common strategy on trade and investment rules and issues.\nUnder President Trump's leadership, the United States seeks a stronger and more balanced bilateral trade relationship with Japan. Our goal is simple: We seek trade that is both free and fair and benefits both our nations equally.\nThis requires breaking down barriers and leveling the playing field so that American companies and exporters enjoy high levels of market access.\nThe second pillar involves economic and structural policies, with a specific focus on fiscal and monetary issues.\nThe President believes that both the United States and Japan can enact pro-growth and fiscally sustainable monetary and budgetary policies, which are both key to our long-term economic success.\nAnd the final pillar is what we call sectoral cooperation. The President and I are confident that we can find new ways to expand our economic ties with Japan in different sectors and industries. In fact, as we discussed earlier today with business leaders, one of the areas we agreed upon is to examine ways that we can promote and advance women empowerment in business in the United States and in Japan. (Applause.)\nAmerican and Japanese businesses have much to offer each other, and by working together, the President and I believe that we can ensure that our two nations' economic leadership grows even stronger in the years ahead to the benefit of the entire world.\nPresident Trump and I are grateful that Prime Minister Abe and Deputy Prime Minister Aso share our goal of a mutually beneficial economic relationship.\nAnd as members of the business community, all of you will play an integral role in helping us identify where and how we can make the most impact in the days ahead.\nPresident Trump and I value your continued input on the issues that you face, and we know that you can help us move toward a system that maximizes jobs, growth, and a brighter future for Japan and the United States of America.\nThe truth is simply that a stronger American economy means a stronger economy for Japan and for all our trading partners. The United States and Japan are drivers of global growth, and under President Donald Trump, I can promise you, the United States will drive growth like never before. (Applause.)\nPresident Trump and our entire administration are working around the clock to pass an agenda of lower taxes, less regulation, better infrastructure, and a renewed focus on American energy. I'm sure you'll be glad to know that tax reform is one of our top priorities. I don't have to tell you how complicated the American tax code is and how much harm it does to business investment in our country -- at home and, frankly, abroad.\nOur corporate tax rate sadly is one of the highest in the developed world -- it's more than 10 percent higher than the tax rate here in Japan. President Trump's tax plan is to slash the corporate rate and reform the tax code and make it simpler, flatter, and fairer.\nRest assured, our tax reform plan will make the strongest economy in the world stronger still. And it will benefit every business represented here today. (Applause.)\nThe same is true of the President's energetic actions from the outset of our administration to reduce the regulatory burden in America. The President already ordered every agency in Washington, D.C. to find two regulations to get rid of before issuing any new red tape on the American economy and the American people.\nThe President has also signed more than a dozen bills turning back the last administration's excessive regulatory mandates, and we're going to continue to work with Congress to slash through the red tape.\nMake no mistake about it: Under President Donald Trump, the era of over-regulation in the American economy is over, and a new era of jobs and growth has begun. (Applause.)\nNow, these are just a few of the President's policies that I could discuss today. I appreciate the feedback I received from so many of you at our earlier conversation about what our administration can continue to do to create an environment on both sides of the Pacific where we can grow and thrive.\nRest assured, President Trump's agenda in America will renew our country's reputation as the premier investment destination in the world, which will benefit both of our countries and all the enterprises gathered here.\nAnd our success will further strengthen our bond with the businesses and the people of Japan. Of that I'm certain.\nThe truth is that both our nations seek the same thing. We want good-paying jobs for our people. We want more investment and higher growth. We want innovation and high-tech companies. And we want our people to be more prosperous tomorrow than they are today. These are shared goals, and they're shared values. And I can tell you that under President Trump's leadership, and working closely with Prime Minister Abe, they're the shared expectations of both of our peoples. We're looking forward to working with all of you and with the leadership here in Japan to achieve that aim.\nThis is a historic time in the relationship between our nations. For more than 70 years, the United States and Japan have built on a foundation of freedom and friendship, and together we've become the pillars that support opportunity and prosperity around the world.\nToday, I say with confidence: With your continued help, through an enduring alliance and economic partnership, and under President Donald Trump, our nations will reach new heights, for the benefit of all of our people, and for the benefit of the world.\nThank you so much for having me here today and thank you for the opportunities that the enterprises here represent in America and in Japan. And God bless you all.

{"author": "Sean Spicer", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123775", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n12:08 P.M. EDT\nMR. SPICER: Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us a little earlier than normal today. I want to make sure that the pool has plenty of time to set up for this afternoon's major event.\nI'm excited to announce that next Monday, April 24th at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time, the President will speak via videoconference with the commander of the International Space Station, Peggy Whitson, and her fellow astronaut, Jack Fischer. In 2008, Dr. Whitson became the first woman to command the International Space Station. And on Monday, she will break the record for the most time spent in space of any American astronaut.\nThe President, joined by his daughter, Ivanka, and NASA astronaut Kate Rubins, will congratulate Dr. Whitson on this incredible accomplishment and discuss the importance of encouraging women to pursue careers in STEM fields -- science, technology, engineering and math.\nAs you're all aware, in addition to signing the NASA Transition Authorization Act, the President also recently signed the Inspire Women Act, which ensures that NASA continues recruiting women for important STEM-related jobs in aerospace, an effort that's particularly important to this President.\nWe're working closely with NASA and the Department of Education to make this conversation available to classrooms throughout the country. The Department of Education will also be providing tools for teachers to build lessons around this conversation between the President and these two outstanding Americans who are orbiting 220 miles above their heads. The call will air live on NASA TV and stream on NASA's website and Facebook page.\nWhile we're on the topic of upcoming events, I'd like to note the President will welcome Palestinian President Abbas for a visit to Washington on May 3. They will use the visit to reaffirm the commitment of both the United States and Palestinian leadership to pursuing and ultimately concluding a conflict-ending settlement between the Palestinians and Israel.\nWe'll have further guidance on that visit as we get closer to the date.\nIn terms of additional announcements, the President will be giving the commencement address at the Coast Guard Academy in New London, Connecticut, on May 17th. As we grow closer to that date we will continue to provide updates.\nMoving along to current events, this morning the President signed an important piece of legislation for our nation's veterans. The Veterans Choice Program Extension and Improvement Act eliminates the original sunset date on the Veterans Choice Program, which gives veterans who are unable to schedule an appointment at a VA facility in a timely or convenient manner the ability to receive care from an eligible non-VA healthcare provider. Using funds that have already been appropriated for this program, this gives our nation's heroes the peace of mind they deserve while this administration works with Congress to enact comprehensive reform and modernization at the VA.\nThe Vice President is continuing on his international tour today. On Tuesday, he spoke to 2,500 servicemen and women on the deck of the USS Ronald Reagan in Japan, thanking them for their service and discussing the President's plan to rebuild our military. He then met with and delivered remarks to Japanese business leaders and stopped by a youth baseball clinic before leaving Japan. He is scheduled to land in Jakarta, Indonesia right about now. We'll have further updates on his travels the rest of the week.\nThis week is also National Park Week, and Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke is currently in California meeting with rangers at five national parks. On Monday and Tuesday, he was at Channel Islands National Park, where he led a class of junior park rangers. And today, he'll visit Golden Gate National Recreation Area. Since being sworn in on March 1st, Secretary Zinke has met with rangers at nine national parks. He'll make that 10 when he visits Shenandoah National Park outside Charlottesville, Virginia, next week.\nEvery American has had the opportunity to participate in the celebration of our nation's parks. They're free of charge this Saturday and Sunday. Anyone who is interested in finding a local park or information can go to nps.gov.\nAnd finally, I note just moments ago the President announced that he will be holding a press conference next Thursday to discuss the progress that's being made on behalf of our nation's veterans. We'll have further updates and guidance next week.\nWith that, I'll be glad to take a few of your questions.\nJohn.\nQ: A couple on unrelated topics. First of all, Georgia's Sixth Congressional District -- the fact that Jon Ossoff pulled in five or six points more than most Republicans thought that he would have, and Lindsey Graham said this is a wakeup call to the Republican Party, that there's a lot of moderates that need to emerge in the South to a greater degree that the Republican Party needs to pay attention to. I don't imagine that the outcome of the runoff is in that much question, but does Senator Graham have something there, that the Republican Party needs to pay attention to changing demographics, particularly in the South?\nMR. SPICER: I think you know that, based on my former position, we talked about changing demographics throughout the country and made significant headway in doing that. I think in large part, that's why we won. We've been talking about how the Republican Party had won in so many different levels of our country, but the presidency had eluded us. This President won, got 306 electoral votes, won 30 of 50 states, over 2,600 counties. I think we did pretty well in November, and we continue to pick up seats around the country at different levels. So I feel very confident about the state of the party.\nQ: The fact that Ossoff came so close to 50 percent, is that a concern?\nMR. SPICER: Well, again, I would -- just looking at the facts, there was one candidate on the Democratic side. They spent over $8 million --\nQ: There was five.\nMR. SPICER: One that they backed. And I think when you look at the total Republican vote, it was over that. This is a district that was very close on the presidential level last cycle, and the Democrats went all in on this. They were clear going into this election -- they said that their goal was to get over 50 percent. They came up short. And if you look at what -- his percentage of what it was presidentially, it pretty much tracks. I think this was a big loss for them. The bottom line is they went all in on it; they said that their goal was to get over 50 percent. They came up short.\nQ: On an unrelated issue, Tillerson's letter to Paul Ryan on the JCPOA in Iran -- is the United States basically saying there's no evidence that Iran is cheating on the JCPOA?\nMR. SPICER: No. I think what the letter says is that the President is directing an interagency review of the deal as -- to review that, and we have 90 days before the next one comes up. We'll have more. But right now we're undergoing a 90-day review. And I think the President's statement that the Secretary of State made to Congress clearly stated that the President is directing the National Security Council to lead an interagency review of the plan and evaluate whether suspension sanctions related to Iran pursuant to the JCPOA are in the vital interests of our national security. The letter clearly lays out what the President is going to do to make sure that they're living up to their agreement.\nQ: Is the President concerned that Iran may be cheating on the JCPOA --\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think --\nQ: -- David Albright, the noted U.N. weapons inspector, says they're developing a new centrifuge which he thinks could be a violation.\nMR. SPICER: And I think that's why he's asking for this review. I think that there's -- if he didn't, if he thought that everything was fine, he would have allowed this to move forward. I think he's doing the prudent thing by asking for a review of the current deal --\nQ: And, Sean, on the USS Carl Vinson, what happened? Can you take us through the events from the perspective of the White House that led to the miscommunication -- this administration thinking that this vessel was thousands of miles away from its actual location?\nMR. SPICER: I'm sorry, can you repeat the last part?\nQ: Can you take us through the events that led people within this administration to believe the vessel was thousands of miles away from its actual location?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I mean, PACOM put out a release talking about the group ultimately ending up in the Korean Peninsula. That's what it will do. I think we were asked very clearly about the use of a carrier group in terms of deterrence and foreign presence and what that meant, and we were -- that's what we discussed. I'd refer you back to any other issues with that to the Department of Defense.\nMR. SPICER: Does the President believe that he might have spoken too quickly on this location of the vessel before it was actually --\nMR. SPICER: The President said that we have an armada going towards the peninsula. That's a fact; it happened -- it is happening, rather.\nQ: Sean, I just want to follow up on that. Obviously, when the President of the United States says there is military hardware going to a region in the middle of a crisis on the Korean Peninsula, the allies of the United States are encouraged. When that happens to not be the case, they can interpret that as a false encouragement. So how is this White House explaining to South Korea and Japan that, in fact, during the buildup and the actual DPRK missile launch, there was no USS Carl Vinson off the coast of the Korean Peninsula?\nMR. SPICER: Well, respectfully, Jessica, I would ask you to either touch base with PACOM or the Department of Defense. The statement that was put out was that the Carl Vinson Group was headed to the Korean Peninsula. It is headed to the Korean Peninsula. And it will arrive there --\nQ: It's headed there now, though.\nMR. SPICER: What's that?\nQ: It's headed there now. It wasn't headed there last week.\nMR. SPICER: Sure. No, no, no -- but that's not what we ever said. We said that it was heading there, and it was heading there -- it is heading there. So that remains --\nQ: -- the impression that allies have --\nMR. SPICER: But if there is an impression, then that's not -- then there should have been clarification from people who were seeking it.\nBut, I mean, PACOM put out a release talking about what its ultimate destination was going to be, and that's where it ended up.\nKaitlan.\nQ: But why did the administration never clarify? Because it definitely -- the intent and media reports was that it was headed there now, and now it's going to be there two weeks later.\nMR. SPICER: With all due respect, that's not my -- we were asked a question --\nQ: You yourself commented on it, though.\nMR. SPICER: I know -- no, no, that's not true. What I was asked was, what signal did it send that it was going there. And I answered that question correctly at the time that it signaled foreign presence, strength, and a reassurance to our allies. That a true statement.\nYou're asking me why you didn't know better. I don't know; that's a question that should have been followed up with either PACOM or the Department of Defense. But the only question that we were asked was what signal it sent, and I think we answered that very correctly at the time.\nQ: Don't you think it was a little misleading? No one found out about it until a picture was posted on --\nMR. SPICER: What do you mean? What part is misleading? I'm trying to figure that out. We were asked a question about what signal it sent. We answered the question on what signal it sent. I'm not the one who commented on timing.\nQ: But what's misleading is that people thought it was headed there now, and now it's going to be there weeks later. They thought it was already headed there, but it wasn't -- it was going an exercise before it was going there.\nMR. SPICER: I understand the question. But what I'm getting at is it was announced that it was going, it will be there. We were asked simply a question on that, and I think all other questions should be asked of the Department of Defense.\nJohn.\nQ: Thanks a lot, Sean. Earlier today, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman said that China is increasingly frustrated with North Korea. And North Korea -- you may have seen it -- put out a simulated video over the past 24 hours which shows its missiles attacking and destroying an American city. What's the American -- White House reaction to that video, and also to the comments by China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson?\nMR. SPICER: Well, on the first part, this isn't the first that North Korea has put out propaganda tools. And I don't think we're going to comment on every time they're put out a piece of propaganda.\nSecond, I think it's encouraging to see China continue to move forward and join us in this effort to control North Korea. I've commented before. I think that the relationship that the President started building with President Xi down in Mar-a-Lago is clearly showing some positive signs. China continues to have both economic and political influence over China. And so I think it's important to see them heading in this direction. I think it's a very positive sign to see them play a larger and larger role. I think it is in everybody's interest to contain North Korea's actions.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ: How strong is that influence, though, if the Foreign Ministry spokesman for China, which the President is depending on for this particular incursion, is saying that he himself -- that China itself is frustrated, increasingly frustrated, with the North Koreans?\nMR. SPICER: Well, again, I think, from an overall diplomatic sense, I think it's positive to see China continue to take positive signs aligning with the position that we have on this. That's a positive thing. I think that time will tell. But I think seeing a unified effort to contain North Korea's threat is a positive step to protect not only our national security interests but those in the region.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. A few weeks ago, I asked you about the President's upcoming visit to Rome and whether or not he would have an audience with the Pope. And I pointed out that this is something that's part of modern history, going back to 1959, when President Eisenhower had an audience with Pope John XXIII. You said it was something you would definitely be in favor of. A few days ago, the Financial Times reported that sources within the administration said this was very unlikely to happen, and that for the first time since nearly 60 years ago, the President would not have an audience with the Pope. Why?\nMR. SPICER: So, right now, at this time, obviously we're headed to both Brussels and Sicily. If we have updates on the schedule -- and we're still plenty far away -- I'm sure that we will let you know about any additional stops.\nQ: Are you in touch with the Holy See about --\nMR. SPICER: I appreciate the effort, but I think until we have an update, I'm not going to go there.\nFrancesca.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Back on Iran and the State Department's letter to Congress. There's been some talk about stricter sanctions on Iran for the ballistic missiles test that it's been conducting and state finance of terror. Are you concerned that tougher sanctions on Iran are motivated to violate the nuclear deal?\nMR. SPICER: Well, obviously, any action that we would take, if we did, is something that gets vetted through the interagency process, and all of those kinds of considerations are taken in terms of trying to achieve the effect that we want. So sanctions have been an effective tool in many cases -- and I think that as we've mentioned a lot of times, the President doesn't telegraph what action he's going to take. But as we conduct review of options of available in this situation, we'll go through the interagency process and have different entities weigh in.\nQ: Sure, but in consideration of those potential sanctions --\nMR. SPICER: Right, obviously -- but we're well aware of any potential negative impacts that an action could have. And so, regardless of whether it's an economic, a political, or a military action, you always weigh all those kind of options.\nQ: Sorry, one small follow-up on that. The President has said, though, that he would like to see the nuclear deal renegotiated with Iran. How specifically does he plan to get a new deal? Is that something that he still wants to do?\nMR. SPICER: Well, again, that's why we're undergoing this interagency review. Part of this is to get the entire team to look at it as part of the next 90-days review that is required under the deal. So we will have recommendations that will be presented to the President on where the deal stands and how to act further.\nGeorge.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Looking ahead to the 100-day mark, and setting aside executive orders, can you say what the single piece of legislation that you are proudest that you got through Congress that was on the President's agenda?\nMR. SPICER: Well, a few things on that. Number one, we're not done. We've got a little ways before we hit the 100-day mark. So I think what you've seen out of this White House is a very robust agenda of activity. There's a lot of executive orders that I think the President has been pleased with -- not only what they've done and what will do, but what they've done. I think when you look at immigration, in particular, we see a very significant drop at the border. I think on jobs there's been a lot of activity that we've been very proud to see America manufacturing and job creation.\nBut then there's pieces like what we did today, that I think if you're a veteran who's served our country, to know that you have additional options to get health care in a timely manner, or not just -- but a geographically-friendly manner, so you're not driving hours -- is very helpful and a strong symbol of how we treat our veterans. There's a lot of things that I think the President has done on veterans, on immigration, on regulatory reform.\nAs I've mentioned here, we're now at a dozen Congressional Review Act pieces of legislation that have been signed that have had, I think, a very positive impact and will have a very positive impact on job creation. When you -- and I've noted before to you that only one had ever been signed in history before -- that's a pretty significant achievement for this President. And obviously, when you look at the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, it's another significant one.\nBut there's a lot. And again, we'll obviously spend some time talking about this next week. But I think we're very pleased with what the President has accomplished. And as he noted yesterday in Wisconsin, the amount that he's done overall has been significant.\nZeke.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Two for you on two separate topics. First, on the potential for a government shutdown next week on the CR, is the President -- the budget supplemental that the White House requested about a month or so ago included a defense spending cut and other discretionary spending -- nondefense, included funding for the wall. Is the President going to insist that the CR that will be necessary to keep the government open after next weekend will include all of those priorities? Or would he accept a flat CR that would just continue the status quo through --\nMR. SPICER: We're having -- those discussions have been ongoing with House and Senate leaders as we approach this deadline. But as you correctly point out, the President's priorities are very well-known -- what he wants to do in terms of both military and homeland security.\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nMR. SPICER: But I think that to start negotiating in public would probably not be a very prudent thing to do as we get closer to that deadline. So I -- respectfully, we're days away. You'll have plenty of time to see what's in there.\nQ: Second question on another topic -- sorry. Late last night, the Presidential Inaugural Committee released its list of donors at the end of the filing period. It included -- (inaudible) -- records of funding, obviously. It included lots of money from corporate donors, many of them who had business before the administration. Is the President, who ran on the \"drain the swamp: slogan, concerned about the perception, certainly, but also the -- or the potential for any real conflict of interest between some of those donations supporting his inauguration?\nMR. SPICER: No, I think that this is just like a campaign in the sense that there's disclosure on this for a reason so that you know what's happening. I think funding the Inaugural Committee has pretty much been a nonpartisan activity that is going back every administration going back through administrations.\nSo this is a time-honored tradition, and I think a lot of Americans and companies and entities are proud to support the inaugural. And I think that you've seen that over time, the people who have been -- there are a lot of people who really take pride in helping us show the world a peaceful transformation of power.\nRichard.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. I just want to go back to Wisconsin yesterday.\nMR. SPICER: You want to go back, huh?\nQ: It was nice there.\nQ: The President said about the issue with the local dairy farmers that the White House was going to work on that very hard -- admittedly, actually, starting today -- that's what he said -- calling Canada and asking for solution. Has the White House been in contact with anybody in Canada, in Ottawa?\nMR. SPICER: I'll have an update for you, hopefully, at some point on that. But I'm well aware of the President's comments on that. I think it's a very important issue for people in Wisconsin, and the President looks forward to following up on that.\nQ: -- on this point?\nMR. SPICER: I think, I just -- all I will say is that the President is going to make sure that we follow up on that.\nQ: Very quickly, he said that, on NAFTA, he wants very big changes. Are we going to get rid of it once and for all? Are we at that point, like, very big changes, or --\nMR. SPICER: I think we'll see what pans out in the negotiation. But I think there's an opportunity that -- can I just --\nMR. GRONKOWSKI: Need some help? (Laughter.)\nMR. SPICER: I think I got this, but thank you.\nMR. GRONKOWSKI: Are you sure?\nMR. SPICER: Maybe. (Laughter.)\nMR. GRONKOWSKI: (Inaudible) -- I'm here.\nMR. SPICER: All right, thanks, man. I'll see you in a minute. (Laughter.)\nQ: Hey, Sean, can I follow on that?\nMR. SPICER: Hold on, one -- (laughter) -- all right, that was cool. (Laughter.) Real quick -- how do you follow that?\nJust to John Gizzi's point, I just want to make sure I note that we will be reaching out to the Vatican to see if a meeting, an audience with the Pope can be accommodated. We'll have further details on that. Obviously, we'd be honored to have an audience with His Holiness.\nDavid. I'm sorry, I called on David first.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. What's the White House reaction to the deportation of Juan Montes? He's a DREAMer from California and the first one to be sent back.\nMR. SPICER: I think that situation is evolving right now. There's a lot of things that are being looked at in terms of the circumstances surrounding that, and I would ask you to stay in contact with the Department of Homeland Security.\nQ: Didn't President Trump say he didn't want the --\nMR. SPICER: Again, I think that -- I don't want to comment right now in the sense that there are some circumstances regarding that I think that need to come out or be further looked into. And I think getting ahead of that could be an issue.\nSo, respectfully, I would say that I don't want to rush to judgment. I think there's a lot of additional details that are coming out about that issue, and I think the Department of Homeland Security is probably the best place to get updates.\nAnita.\nQ: Sean, just to follow up --\nMR. SPICER: Okay, Hallie. (Laughter.)\nQ: Thank you. Two topics, and one of those is a follow-up. But I wanted to ask about GA -- Georgia 6 here. Two quick ones on that. Is the President planning to campaign for the Republican challenger there? Will he go to Georgia to get out the vote?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know. If needed, I think the President is going to make sure that he does everything he can to maintain majorities and further the party, but we'll see if we're needed.\nQ: Is he expending too much political capital on a race that Republicans should be winning easily?\nMR. SPICER: Well, it's interesting, I thought that some of the coverage was a little intriguing as I watched it. The Democrats went all in on this race. They spent over $8.3 million. They said on the record that their goal was to win this race. They lost. And the reaction has somewhat been that they almost won. No, they lost. They made very clear what their goal was in this race. They spent $8.3 million and threw everything, including the kitchen sink at it, and lost. And so --\nQ: Technically, there's still two months left, though, right?\nMR. SPICER: No, not in terms of what their stated goal was. They said that their goal last night was to win the race with over 50 percent. They spent $8.3 million. They didn't run for a runoff, they ran to win last night. And they lost.\nAnd so anything short of describing that as a loss is sort of inconceivable to me in the sense that that's literally what they said their goal was to do. And they said, we want to win Tuesday night with over 50 percent. They came up short of their goal. They put all the money that they had in there, they put all their firepower, and they came up short. So it's a loss. And there's no other --\nMara.\nQ: Let me just follow up. I just had a second topic for you on deportations. And I'm not speaking specifically about this case because I understand that you're referring over to DHS. But there seems to be a little confusion, so if you can clarify: What is this President's position on undocumented immigrants living in this country who have not committed serious crimes?\nMR. SPICER: I think the President's priorities on immigration have been very clearly laid out. First and foremost, he wants to make sure that people who have committed a crime or pose a threat to public safety are dealt with first and foremost, and that we would continue to address immigration going forward.\nQ: So what is the -- I guess my question is, those who have not posed a threat or are not perceived as posing a threat?\nMR. SPICER: Right, and I think that -- as I said, I mean, the goal and the focus has been on people who pose a threat to national security or in some other way in violation.\nQ: But these cases have come up for people who have not posed a threat. So I guess there's some confusion --\nMR. SPICER: But that's -- again, and I would --\nQ: Even Jeff Sessions said it was confusing today.\nMR. SPICER: I would respectfully suggest that in this particular case the facts are not completely out yet, so I'd rather not jump to judgment on what's happening.\nQ: But there's also a case in Ohio. I'm not trying to belabor the point, but there were other instances.\nMR. SPICER: I understand. Thank you. Mara.\nQ: Thank you. I just wanted to get a little more clarity on Iran. Is the President determined to pull out of this agreement, as he promised during the campaign, or will that decision be determined by this review?\nMR. SPICER: I think part of the review -- the interagency process -- is to determine where Iran is in compliance with the deal and to make recommendations to the President on the path forward.\nQ: So he might or might not decide to pull out.\nMR. SPICER: I think that's why you undertake a --\nQ: This decision has yet to be made?\nMR. SPICER: That's why he's doing a review.\nQ: Okay, because that was a campaign promise.\nMR. SPICER: Right, and I understand that. And the point that I'm making is that he asked the interagency team to conduct a review as the Secretary laid out in the letter last night.\nAnita.\nQ: Sean, two questions on one issue. My colleague, who's currently in Colombia, has learned that the President met with two former presidents of Colombia last weekend in Mar-a-Lago, and I think it was set up by Senator Rubio's office. And so I had two questions. One -- well, first, some people there are saying that it's to undermine the current president's visit next month before he comes here next month.\nSo two questions. One, why was that not released publicly, to the press, to the pool at the time? And secondly, can you talk a little bit about the point of that visit? And do you all stand by the Colombian peace pact?\nMR. SPICER: Yeah, I'll be glad to look into the circumstances. I don't have anything for you at this time, so I will get something and then read it out.\nQ: But are you saying that didn't happen?\nMR. SPICER: No, I'm just saying I'm unaware of the circumstances of that.\nQ: So can you get back to me on the policy issue?\nMR. SPICER: I can.\nQ: But why not release that if that's the case?\nMR. SPICER: Because, again, I don't know that it's the case. And so until I know, I think it would be tough to answer the second question.\nThank you guys very much. We'll have an event for you tomorrow. Take care, have a good one.\nEND 12:40 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2017-04-19", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer"}

S. 544, approved April 19, was assigned Public Law No. 115-26.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123787", "text": "The President. Good morning. We're honored to join and be joined today by some absolutely tremendous people and great veterans. Thanks, as well—and I have to thank them dearly—but as well to Representative Phil Roe. Where is he? I love Phil, come here. What a job you've done. And all the Members of Congress who worked on the bill that we're about to sign, such an important bill.\nI especially want to thank Senators John McCain and Senator Johnny Isakson. They have been incredible in working with us. Let me also welcome my good friend, Florida Governor Rick Scott, a Navy veteran who's here with us to represent more than a million veterans from the State of Florida. We're also joined by the leaders of a number of veterans groups. I want to thank all of them for being here and all of the tremendous and important work that they do. We would not be here if it weren't for them, I can tell you that.\nFinally, I want to thank our Secretary of the VA, David Shulkin, who, by the way, was approved with a vote of 100 to nothing. [Laughter] That's shocking, right? [Laughter] A hundred to nothing, Rick. Now, you wouldn't get a hundred to nothing. [Laughter]\nWe met earlier today in the Oval Office, and Secretary Shulkin updated me on the massive and chronic challenge he inherited at the VA, but also the great progress that he is making. He's got a group of people that are phenomenal at the VA. It's one of my most important things. I've been telling all of our friends at speeches and rallies for 2 years about the VA, how we're going to turn it around. And we're doing that.\nAnd actually, next week, on Thursday at 2 o'clock, we're going to have a news conference with David and some others to tell you about all of the tremendous things that are happening at the VA and what we've done in terms of progress and achievement.\nThe veterans have poured out their sweat and blood and tears for this country for so long, and it's time that they're recognized, and it's time that we now take care of them and take care of them properly.\nThat's why I'm pleased today to sign into law the Veterans Choice Program Improvement Act. So this is called the Choice Program Improvement Act. Speaks for itself. This bill will extend and improve the Veterans Choice Program so that more veterans can see the doctor of their choice—you got it? The doctor of their choice—and don't have to wait and travel long distances for VA care. Some people have to travel 5 hours, 8 hours, and they'll have to do it on a weekly basis and even worse than that. It's not going to happen anymore.\nThis new law is a good start, but there is still much work to do. We will fight each and every day to deliver the long-awaited reforms our veterans deserve and to protect those who have so courageously protected each and every one of us.\nSo we've made a lot of strides for the veterans. These are, like, the most incredible people we have in our country as far as I'm concerned, and they have not been taken care of properly.\nI want to thank David. You've done an incredible job. And you're going to see some of that on Thursday. So thank you all very much. And we're going to sign this. And I think I'm going to have to give this pen—the way I look at it, we should probably give it to Phil. What do you think?\nParticipant. I agree.\nThe President. Does everybody agree? I think Phil is——\nRepresentative D. Phillip Roe. I'll agree to that. [Laughter]\nThe President. Phil is—yes, I know—[inaudible]. So congratulations, everybody. Really fantastic. Thank you very much.\n[At this point, the President signed the bill.]\nOkay. Phil, maybe you could say a few words, if you'd like.\nRep. Roe. Well, Mr. President, thank you very much. And this was a very, very important bill to get started with so we can get Choice 2.0 to get to the place exactly where the President said he wanted to be. And it's a privilege to work with all of these great people up here to help make the VA better.\nI spent last week on the break going to Los Angeles and Phoenix to get a firsthand view of what's going on. And what we want to do is put the veteran in charge of these choices, not the bureaucracy. And I think Dr. Shulkin is just the person to see that happen. Mr. President, thank you so much for making it happen.\nThe President. Thank you very much. It's fantastic.\nAnd David? Where's David?\nSecretary of Veterans Affairs David J. Shulkin. Yes, I'm right behind you, Mr. President.\nThe President. Why don't you go ahead. I won't look back. You just talk. [Laughter]\nSecretary Shulkin. Well, first of all, I want to thank everybody here as well and thank Congress for seeing this done and Mr. President to be signing this.\nThis is a good day for veterans. This is a great day to celebrate not only what veterans have contributed to the country, but how we're making things better for them. And by working together, we're going to continue this progress. I think, as the President said, we're actually going to do this a week from Thursday, Mr. President——\nThe President. Right.\nSecretary Shulkin. ——and talk about the tremendous accomplishments, but most importantly, about the great things that are going to come to fulfill the President's commitments that he made to veterans. And so thank you all for being here today.\nThe President. Well, thank you. Great job. So again, next week, on Thursday, at 2 o'clock—it may change a little bit, but about that time—we're going to have a conference to talk about the progress and the achievement.\nI'd like to ask Rick Scott, the Governor of Florida—who's done a fantastic job as Governor, by the way, and really understands this subject and really understands a lot of subjects—Rick, do you want to say a few words?\nGovernor Richard L. Scott of Florida. Sure. Well, I was really proud of my father—was in the 82d Airborne, he did all the combat jumps, and I grew up listening to all his—the stories about the war. I had the serve—I had the opportunity to serve in the Navy. Unfortunately, in 2014, I had to sue the VA because we had—our State health care agency couldn't go inspect their hospitals when we heard all the stories about deaths, delays, and poor conditions.\nAnd so President—Mr. President, and I want to thank Congress for doing this to create certainty of care while we figure out how to fix the VA system. And, David, I want to thank you for what you're doing. You've got absolutely the right background to do this. I know President Trump has been focused on our veterans and our military before he was President, and I know he's going to continue to do a great job. We have 1.5 million veterans. I want them all to move to Florida, of course. [Laughter] So—but thank you for doing this, Mr. President.\nThe President. Thank you very much.\nMost importantly, thank you, thank all of the great veterans. We appreciate—would you like to say something? We have all of these people out there. [Laughter] You'll become a movie star tomorrow. [Laughter] You look so good.\nParalyzed Veterans of America Executive Director Sherman Gillums, Jr. Well, our Nation will be judged by how it treats its veterans, and the future of our country will rely on generations—right now, they're children, but they're going to be our future servicemen. And so we have to treat veterans well. It's about national security, it's about patriotism, and this is a great step forward to doing that.\nThe President. Thank you very much. Nobody can say it better than that, so we're going to end. [Laughter] But I want to just thank you all. Thank you for being here. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2017-04-19", "title": "Remarks on Signing the Veterans Choice Program Extension and Improvement Act"}

In his remarks, he referred to Joe Cardona, long snapper, Danny Amendola, Julian Edelman, Matthew Slater, and Malcolm Mitchell, wide receivers, Trey Flowers, defensive lineman, and Marcus Cannon, offensive lineman, National Football League's New England Patriots.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123784", "text": "The President. Thank you very much. What a great day it is to be with all of our friends at the White House. We celebrate the Super Bowl New England Patriots, world champions, Super Bowl Champions—champions, period—and their historic win. And they are champions.\nBefore we get started, I want to acknowledge some special guests. We're proud to be joined by seven wounded warriors who have bravely served and sacrificed for our Nation: Specialist Cameron Greenstreet, Staff Sergeant Frederick Manning, Specialist James Matthews, Sergeant Christopher McGinnis, Specialist Stephanie Morris, Sergeant Major James Watson, Staff Sergeant Sheldon Warner. Special people. And America is very blessed to have you with us. Thank you.\nThe New England Patriots are big supporters of our military and America's veterans. Joe Cardona—where's Joe? Where is Joe? There he is, in his beautiful Navy—[applause]—thank you, Joe. Serves in the Navy Reserves and is a graduate of the Naval Academy. Coach Belichick is the son of a Navy veteran. And Bob—that's Bob Kraft—he's becoming a pretty famous guy for winning, I'll tell you that. Between him and Belichick, wow. You do so much to support our military. Bob has been my friend for a long time, and he wants to support our military.\nSo what a group of champions, all of them. And, Bob, I want to commend you for building such an extraordinary organization—five Super Bowl victories since 2002—really unbelievable. And I'll say this right now: George Steinbrenner, as you know, was a very good friend of mine. And George was a great champ too, but there was a little more turmoil, right? [Laughter] A little more turmoil in his victories. And that's okay. He was another great one.\nSince Bob bought the Patriots in 1994, they've won more division titles, conference championships, and Super Bowl wins than any other team. No team has been this good for this long. [Applause] Amazing. He's built a culture dedicated to winning. And he started it with his coach, and I want to tell you, that is some special man. It's called the Patriot way, and that really starts with Coach Belichick.\nAnd I want to thank all of you for being with us. The Patriots are an incredible organization, and this Super Bowl victory was a complete team effort. That's the beauty of what they do: They win as a team. With your backs against the wall, and the pundits—good old pundits, boy, they're wrong a lot, aren't they—[laughter]—saying you couldn't do it, the game was over, you pulled off the greatest Super Bowl comeback of all time, one of the greatest comebacks of all time, but the greatest Super Bowl comeback of all time. And that was just special. I think I looked at odds, and they gave you less than one-half of 1 percent of winning the game.\nAnd then, the coach said, let's go for three. He's losing by so much, he said, let's go for three. And I say, what is he doing? That was a great decision, Coach. [Laughter] I tell him that all the time.\nThe fourth-down conversion by Danny Amendola—where's Danny? Where's Danny? Way to go, Danny. The big sack by Trey Flowers. Big sack. Where's Trey? Come on, put your hand up, Trey. See, he's shy, a little bit. You weren't shy when you hit that guy, were you? You weren't shy about—he didn't mind hitting. Thank you, Trey. Great job. The incredible catch by Julian Edelman. What a catch. We all said, no, that ball was dropped. Isn't that good? You know, in the old days, they might have said that was dropped. Those replays are good. You're starting to like the replay, right? [Laughter] Great going, Julian.\nI think of guys like Marcus Cannon and the offensive line. Marcus? That's some line. Or Matt Slater, who was awarded the 2017 Bart Starr Award for the character and leadership he has shown both on and off the field. Malcolm Mitchell—[applause]—it's true. Malcolm Mitchell, who, as a rookie, handled the pressure of the Super Bowl like an absolute true veteran. Way to go, Malcolm. Good job.\nOr Nate Ebner, who played on our Olympic rugby team last summer. Pretty good athlete, right? [Laughter] And in Brazil—he was in Brazil playing and doing really well and is an All-Pro special team guy and player. So, Nate, congratulations. Where's Nate? Which is the tougher sport, Nate, football or rugby?\nSafety Nate Ebner. I don't know. [Laughter]\nThe President. I had a feeling you might say that. [Laughter] But everyone played a role, and everybody played as champions. It was the first overtime game in Super Bowl history, and it ended with a legendary victory for this proud franchise and for these absolutely terrific players and coaches.\nYou had the best record in football with 14 wins and only two losses. And that doesn't happen by accident. It takes hard work, dedication, and a commitment by every member of the team to work together in pursuit of the ultimate goal, a goal that very few people achieve. And you've achieved it five times, many of you, and our coach and our owner have achieved it five times. Great, great talents, great, great people.\nWhether you're trying to win a Super Bowl or rebuild our country, as Coach Belichick would say, there are no days off. And just a quick story about the coach. So I had won the primaries, and I'm now in this rather heated election that a few of you have read about. And he wrote me this beautiful letter after the primaries. \"Congratulations,\" he said all sorts of things that were really good. I mean, it was really a beautiful letter. And it was very close to going before the election. And I called up, and I said, Coach, do you mind if I read the letter tonight to a stadium full of people in a very, very big and important State? And he said: \"You know what? I'd rather not have you do that. Could you send it back to me? I'm going to give you another one.\" I said, \"No, that's okay.\" \"Nope, I want to give you another one.\" Now, immediately to me, that means he's going to tone it down, because what he said was so nice. And you know what he did? He toned it way up. It was much better. It was much better. He made that the greatest letter, and I did very well in that State. Thank you, Coach. [Laughter] That was very good.\nBut you know, he's just a very special guy. And he's tough. Is he tough, fellas, or a nice guy? Tough? Huh? A little tough, right? He's tough, he's smart, and he's got a great heart.\nSo the Patriot coaches and these great players have delivered iconic American sports moments that will last forever. We're going to watch that game over and over and over. That game will last forever. Five Super Bowl wins in the era of free agency, which is really, really tough. What an achievement.\nSo again, congratulations to Super Bowl Champion New England Patriots. And with that, I'd like to ask a very special and talented man—and a great friend of mine for a long time—Bob Kraft, to say a few words. Thank you all very much. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert K. Kraft. Thank you, Mr. President. It's a true honor to be here for the fifth time celebrating a world championship. And every time that we have the privilege of coming here to the White House, I think about the long odds that were faced by our country's forefathers who fought for our freedom and independence.\nOvercoming long odds through hard work, perseverance, and most importantly, mental toughness is the foundation of everything that is great about this country. I am proud that the first time we came here as a team after winning a championship as 14-point underdogs, but infinitely more important was, it was the season of 9/11, 2001, at a time in which our Nation showed its mental toughness to rally together and to rebound from an unthinkable tragedy.\nThis year's championship was achieved after falling behind by 25 points, a deficit so great that in the 97-year history of the NFL—over 20,000 games—that deficit had only been overcome seven times. In that same year, a very good friend of mine for over 25 years, a man who is mentally tough and hard-working as anybody I know, launched a campaign for the Presidency against 16 career politicians, facing odds almost as long as we faced in the fourth quarter. [Laughter] He persevered to become the 45th President of the United States.\nIt's a distinct honor for us to celebrate what was unequivocally our sweetest championship with a very good friend and somebody whose mental toughness and strength I greatly admire. And I would like to call upon our coach to say a few words. But before, we'd like to jointly present——\n[At this point, the President was presented with a team jersey.]\nSymbolic, a Super Bowl LI Championship jersey.\nHead Coach William S. Belichick. Thank you. On—so, on behalf of the team, the organization, I just want to thank the President and his great staff for wonderful day, a wonderful opportunity here. We've had the great privilege to be here several times, but this one—the way we were treated and the opportunities to be in the Oval Office, to meet with the President, to see the inside of the White House—it's just been fabulous.\nSo along with the parade, the ring ceremony, as a team, the opportunity and the privilege of coming to the White House is just one of the great things about winning the Super Bowl. And so we're very privileged to be here, and we thank the President and his great staff for the hospitality that they have shown us.\nAlso, our great Patriot fans here and throughout Patriot nation, thank you for coming out today. This—as Mr. Kraft said, this is really a special team. These guys work incredibly hard all year. They put all the work in in advance when we didn't have anything to show for it. And then, as the year went on, you know, a total of 17 victories. They were all tough. These guys are mentally tough. They're physically tough. They love to compete, and they knew how to compete under pressure, and that's probably when we played our best football as we saw in overtime in the Super Bowl.\nSo I'm incredibly proud and honored to coach this group with our coaching staff. Our coaching staff did a tremendous job this year. I'm so appreciative of them. And then, this day really is a great—you know, it's a great day for us, it's a thrill to be here, and we appreciate your support, and we appreciate the, again, the great treatment that we received from the President and his staff. Thank you very much.\nAnd we have one other presentation to make, Super Bowl LI helmet. [Laughter] The President. Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much.", "timestamp": "2017-04-19", "title": "Remarks Honoring the 2017 Super Bowl Champion New England Patriots"}

Trump\nA JUSTIFIABLE AND NECESSARY ACTION: As imports of steel to the United States continue to rise, an examination of foreign practices is urgently needed.\n* Despite America's existing domestic steel industry, imports of steel into the United States have risen 19.6 percent between February 2016 and February 2017.\n* Recent reports by the United States International Trade Commission (USITC) have found that steel imports injure the United States steel industry.\n* The USITC has found domestic steel makers are harmed where nations that export steel products to the United States unfairly subsidize their products or sell them at artificially low price.\nTAKING STEPS TO PUT AMERICA'S STEEL INDUSTRY FIRST: President Donald J. Trump is taking action to ensure America's steel industry comes first, in addition to his Buy American and Hire American policies.\n* Today, the President signed a Presidential Memorandum prioritizing an investigation initiated by the Secretary of Commerce into whether steel imports threaten to impair the national security.\n* The investigation is being conducted under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.\n* The Secretary of Commerce is directed to expedite his investigation of the effects of steel imports on the national security to determine the following:\n* Whether steel imports cause American workers to lose jobs which are needed to meet security requirements of the domestic steel industry.\n* Any negative effects of steel imports on government revenue.\n* Any harm steel imports cause to the economic welfare of the United States, recognizing the close relationship between economic prosperity and national security.\n* By law the investigation must be concluded and a report submitted within 270 days.\n* If the report concludes that steel imports threaten to impair the national security, and the President concurs, he may take several actions, including tariffs, to eliminate the negative effects of steel imports on the national security of the United States.\nKEEPING HIS PROMISE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE: President Trump promised that he would scrutinize U.S. steel imports and seek a revitalization of the American steel industry.\n* Then-Candidate Trump:\n* Observed that foreign nations are \"dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and steel companies.\"\n* Promised that \"we will put new American steel into the spine of this country.\"\n* Promised that \"We're going to use American steel, we're going to use American labor, we are going to come first in all deals.\"", "timestamp": "2017-04-20", "title": "Press Release - President Donald J.

It is an honor for Indonesia to welcome the visit of the Vice President of the United States, His Excellency Michael Richard Pence.\nThis is my first meeting with the new administration of the United States. However, I have communicated with President Trump since January. And receiving the courtesy call of Vice President Pence, we discussed a number of bilateral and international issues.\nThe first is the commitment of the United States to enhance its strategic partnership with Indonesia. We'll focus on the issues of cooperation and investment. And next month, there will be a team that will discuss the arrangement of trade and investment bilateral between the countries based on the principles of win-win solution.\nSecond, as the largest Muslim population country in the world, as well as the third largest democracy in the world, Indonesia also agree to strengthen cooperation on peace. That is what I can convey to you all in this auspicious occasion. And I also send my best regards to President Trump through Vice President Pence. That is all from me. Thank you very much.\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Good morning. Thank you, President Widodo, for hosting me here today. Thank you for your warm hospitality to my family, and the extraordinarily colorful welcome that we received from all the children as we approached this morning will be a memory for a lifetime.\nIt is my great privilege to be here in Indonesia. My very first visit to Indonesia to represent the President of the United States of America, Donald Trump. And I bring his greetings to you and his appreciation for your kindness and outreach since his election in November.\nI know I'm the first member of President Trump's administration to visit Southeast Asia, and the President sent me here -- sent me here as a sign of the high value the United States places on our strategic partnership with Indonesia.\nAs the second and third largest democracies in the world, our two countries share many common values -- including freedom, the rule of law, human rights, and religious diversity.\nThe United States is proud to partner with Indonesia to promote and protect these values, the birthright of all people.\nAnd as President Widodo and I discussed under President Donald Trump, the United States and Indonesia are going to work even more closely together for the mutual benefit of our nations, our people, and for the benefit of Southeast Asia, as a whole.\nEconomically, President Trump and I seek to expand the United States' commercial relationship with Indonesia. And the President and I spoke about that very openly today, and we look forward to those discussions continuing.\nAmerican companies have been doing business in Indonesia for years, and American products and services have contributed greatly to Indonesia's economic development. But we believe that we still have room for significant progress.\nUnder President Trump's leadership, the United States seeks trade relationships that are both free and fair, that spur job creation, and economic growth for both parties.\nAs you, President Widodo, have said so often, we're looking for a win-win relationship, and we're confident that we can find it on an increasing basis.\nWe believe we must level the playing field, break down barriers to ensure that American exporters can fully participate in the Indonesia market, the same freedom that Indonesia exporters have had in many sectors in the United States for many years.\nMr. President, President Trump and I look forward to working with you to make progress for this objective and are grateful for your openness to our teams beginning those conversations in the coming weeks.\nThe United States is also proud to be one of Indonesia's oldest and most engaged defense partners. And under President Trump we are firmly committed to continuing to collaborate on the security of both of our peoples. A stronger defense partnership will serve us well as we confront the various security threats and challenges that we now face. And of course, one of the greatest threats we face is the rise and spread of terrorism.\nSadly, Indonesia is no stranger to this evil, nor is the United States of America, as the President and I discussed. The world watched with heartbreak in January of last year when ISIS-linked terrorists struck in central Jakarta in a barbaric suicide bombing. Our hearts broke for your people. This vile attack claimed the lives of five innocents, injured more than two dozen others. What I can assure you and the people of Indonesia is that you had the condolences and the prayers of the American people as you confronted this tragedy.\nWe too know the terrible cost of terrorism, and the United States stands with you to condemn it and to confront it.\nWe will also continue to work with Indonesia to defend the rules-based system that is the foundation for Southeast Asia's peace and prosperity. The United States will uphold the fundamental freedoms of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea and throughout the Asia Pacific; will ensure the unimpeded flow of lawful commerce; and promote peaceful diplomatic dialogue to address issues of regional and global concern.\nFinally, with President Trump's leadership, the United States intends to deepen our cultural ties with the nation and the good people of Indonesia. Later today I'm greatly humbled to have the privilege to visit Indonesia's national mosque, where I'll have the opportunity to speak with leaders of many faiths.\nAnd, Mr. President, I'm very much looking forward to that visit and that honor.\nAs the largest majority Muslim country, Indonesia's tradition of moderate Islam, frankly, is an inspiration to the world. And we commend you and your people.\nIn your nation, as in mine, religion unifies -- it doesn't divide. It gives us hope for a brighter future, and we are all grateful for the great inspiration that Indonesia provides for the world.\nRest assured, under President Trump, the United States welcomes all who share our values and strive for that brighter future. Today on President Trump's behalf, I have the privilege of reaffirming the United States' strategic partnership with Indonesia and declaring our commitment to strengthen our bonds of friendship, commerce, and security.\nToday I say with confidence through our continued partnership, the United States and Indonesia will continue to maintain a peaceful, stable, and a prosperous Southeast Asia for the benefit of both of our nations and for the benefit of the world.\nSo on behalf of President Trump, let me say again, President Widodo, thank you. Thank you for your leadership. Thank you for your hospitality. And thank you for the opportunity to build on a foundation of friendship and partnership between our two nations.", "timestamp": "2017-04-20", "title": "Remarks to the Press by the Vice President and Indonesian President Joko Widodo in Jakarta, Indonesia"}

This is my first visit to the Asia Pacific as Vice President of the United States, and I bring greetings from the President of the United States, President Donald Trump.\nAnd it is such an honor to be here today at ASEAN, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Since 1967, ASEAN has fostered friendship and economic integration between its members. It's helped forge regional cooperation to tackle common challenges. It's promoted prosperity and security -- not just for ASEAN and its members, but for the Asia Pacific as a whole.\nI want to thank the chargй d'affaires, Jane Bocklage, for that kind introduction. Thank you for faithfully representing the United States of America to ASEAN. The President and I are grateful for your work.\nI also want to thank Secretary General Minh and Chairwoman Bwin Soseso (ph) and the ASEAN permanent members who are here with me today.\nI was grateful to have the opportunity to meet with each of you today and appreciate our discussion about our shared values and shared opportunities.\nToday on President Trump's behalf, I'd like to congratulate ASEAN on its 50th anniversary. This year also marks the 40th anniversary of the United States' diplomatic relationship with ASEAN. Our relationship without a doubt has benefitted both ASEAN and America -- diplomatically, economically, and from the standpoint of national security.\nThe relationship between the United States and ASEAN is a strategic partnership. And under President Trump's leadership, the United States is already taking steps to strengthen our partnership with ASEAN and deepen our friendship.\nI spoke to President Trump this morning, and he gave me the great privilege to inform the Secretary General and the permanent members of ASEAN that the President of the United States will attend the U.S.-ASEAN Summit, the East Asia Summit, and the APEC Leaders Meeting in Vietnam and the Philippines this November. (Applause.)\nThe President asked me to deliver this message directly to the leadership here at ASEAN and to express how enthusiastic he is to join the U.S.-ASEAN Summit during the golden anniversary year of this organization.\nIt is a testament to the value that President Trump places on the U.S.-ASEAN strategic partnership and the Asia Pacific as a whole. And it's a sign, I hope, to all of our firm and unwavering commitment to build on the strong foundation that we already share.\nBy strengthening our economic ties, the United States and ASEAN member nations can foster jobs, prosperity, and growth in new and unprecedented ways. American exports to ASEAN member nations already support more than 550,000 jobs in the United States, and almost 42,000 U.S. companies export more than $100 billion in goods and services to ASEAN nations every year. At the same time, the United States imports a significant amount from ASEAN member nations, as well. But amazingly, U.S. companies invest more in ASEAN and its members than any other part of Asia, nearly $274 billion, which is an investment -- which is more, in fact, than our investment in China, India, and Japan combined.\nNow to protect that prosperity and to ensure our continued growth, the United States will redouble our cooperation with ASEAN on issues of regional security. The menace and the reality of global terrorism threatens all our nations. And under President Trump, we will continue to support increasing information sharing and security efforts to protect our people and our way of life across this region and across the wider world.\nWe'll continue to work closely with ASEAN to promote peace and stability in the South China Sea by upholding a rules-based order, ensuring the lawful and unimpeded flow of commerce, and encouraging the peaceful and diplomatic resolution of disputes. For 40 years, the United States has worked side by side with ASEAN to foster peace and prosperity on these seas and between our lands; and President Trump and I are confident that through our continued partnership, which even now, today, is growing stronger, together we will build on our firm foundation to reach even greater heights in the next 50 years of this great organization.\nSo I want to say thank you. Thank you to the permanent members, thank you to the Secretary General for the warm hospitality today. President Trump and I look forward to reaffirming our commitment to each of you in the days ahead, and I know he looks forward to seeing you all at the summits this November.\nThank you very much for giving me the opportunity to make this announcement. It is an honor to be with you all. (Applause.)", "timestamp": "2017-04-20", "title": "Remarks by the Vice President at a Meeting with ASEAN Permanent Representatives in Jakarta, Indonesia"}
{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123860", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n11:10 A.M. EDT\nSECRETARY ROSS: Thank you very much for coming this morning. Last night, the Department of Commerce initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. The technical caption is 19 USC 1862.\nWhat that's all about is that authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to conduct comprehensive investigations to determine the effects of imports of any particular item into the United States on the security of the country. This has been invoked a number of times before, most notably in the period of the Arab oil crisis some years ago.\nSo what it will include consideration of is, one, the domestic production needed for our projected national defense requirements; two, the domestic industry's capacity to meet those requirements; third, the related human and material resources; fourth, the importation of goods in terms of their quantities and use; fifth, the close relation of national economic welfare to national security; sixth, the loss of skills and investment, substantial unemployment and decrease in government revenue; and finally, the impact of foreign competition on specific domestic industries and the impact of displacement of a domestic product by excess of import.\nWhat does that mean in real terms? Over the years, we've conducted 152 steel cases against improper imports of one type of steel or another, and we have another 25 cases pending. The problem with those anti-dumping and countervailing duty cases is they're very, very limited in nature to a very, very specific product from a very, very specific country. So what really happens is you'll bring the action and that will help eliminate the problem with that one little product from that one country. That country then will start shipping something else in, or they'll modify slightly the product to get around the order, or they will ship it in through another country and pretend that it came from a country not subject to the duties.\nSo it's a fairly porous system, and while it has accomplished some fair measure of reduction, it doesn't solve the whole problem. So we're groping here to see whether the facts warrant a more comprehensive solution that would deal with a very wide range of steel products and a very wide range of countries.\nSo that's really the genesis of it. And, as you know, steel has been a very important issue in the President's campaign for office and in his actions subsequent to being in office. The then-candidate Trump, a quote from him, \"Foreign nations are dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steel workers and steel companies. We will put new American steel into the spine of this country. We're going to use American steel. We're going to use American labor. We're going to come first in all deals.\"\nSo this is a consistent investigation with his objectives. Steel imports, despite the activities that we've already had in countervailing duties and anti-dumping, have continued to rise, and they've continued to rise despite repeated Chinese claims that they were going to reduce their steel capacity when instead they have actually been increasing it consistently.\nIn the first couple months of this year alone, steel imports rose 19.6 percent year over year, and are now more than 26 percent of the entire U.S. marketplace. So it's a very serious impact on the domestic industry. The question we will be trying to address in the report is to what extent that impinges on our economic and national defense security.\nUnder the statute, the investigation needs to be completed within 270 days. But given the number of trade cases and, therefore, the consequent amount of research that we've done, we think it will be accomplished a lot sooner than that. And we will be holding at least one and perhaps more public hearings, and we will be inviting public commentary as we go through the research project being expedited by this memorandum issued by the President today.\nQ: So what if the domestic production does not meet the domestic demands -- in other words, the demand is more than the production -- what will the reaction of this administration be at that point?\nSECRETARY ROSS: Well, the fact is that the domestic industry is only operating at about 71 percent of capacity. And since the foreign imports are some 26 percent, there clearly is room for increase in the productive utilization in the United States.\nQ: How long will it take to bring it up to 100 percent?\nSECRETARY ROSS: Well, that's one of the questions that we'll be trying to deal with. Because one of the factors relating to national security would be if you needed a very rapid buildup, are the skillsets there; particularly, are the skillsets there for the very complex alloys that are needed for armor plate and things of that sort. That's a very good question.\nQ: So in the meantime -- you've got a lapse in time -- so if you're 71 percent and you want to build it up to 100 percent, you're going to have to have foreign steel in the meantime, so what's the reaction going to be during that period?\nSECRETARY ROSS: Well, no decision has been made to take any concrete action as yet. But the net effect of the tariff, if that were what we -- came as a recommendation, won't be to prohibit foreign imports, it just will be to change the price.\nQ: You mentioned China. The President's been very clear that he doesn't think right now is the right time to press China on currency manipulation. Why do you think now is the appropriate time to potentially press them on steel?\nSECRETARY ROSS: Well, currency is a totally different issue. That's not the province of Commerce; that's the province of the Treasury Department. And as you know, they recently issued a report on currency manipulation dealing with China and various other countries.\nThe reason for it now is that steel is an important factor in our infrastructure as it relates to national defense, and directly an important factor. As you know, we're building up aircraft, we're building up our fleet, we're building more tanks, building all kinds of military equipment, and that's even in a peacetime context. If it turned out they had to ramp up, the question is, are we getting to the point where the industry couldn't be able to deal with that?\nQ: And what's the level of concern that China could retaliate if there are, in fact, additional tariffs, and potentially not be as cooperative in terms of the work that's being done to pressure the North Koreans?\nSECRETARY ROSS: Well, we're not taking any action in this study, so we shouldn't really be prejudging it. But we have to make our decision based on what's important to the United States and its security.\nQ: Are you concerned that China could retaliate there if you do get to that point? I mean, is that being weighed, in other words?\nSECRETARY ROSS: The important question is protecting our defense needs, and we will do whatever is necessary to do that. But we've come to no conclusion yet because the study has just recently begun.\nQ: My understanding is that the Trade Expansion Act gives the Secretary of Commerce the authority to launch these investigations on his own authority, and you've said you started that investigation yesterday. So could you explain what the presidential memorandum today does, what guidance it gives you or what legal authority it gives you that you didn't already have when you started this yesterday?\nSECRETARY ROSS: Sure. The thrust of the memorandum today is that we should expedite the study. It does not confer any new legal power. The legal power is what was already established under Section 232.\nQ: Just following up on that question, why last night, then, was this launched before the President signed the memorandum today?\nSECRETARY ROSS: Well, it was in the normal course of our schedule to get this investigation going, and there's a statutory notice that we have to give to the Secretary of Defense, and it seemed appropriate to let him know what we were doing prior to a big public announcement.\nQ: It's well-known that the Chinese and the Americans have a conflict over steel, and, as you mentioned, there's been a lot of cases. But you also mentioned that this order and investigation gives you an opportunity to broaden the scope of steel imports and an investigation into those. Can you describe what other countries and supply lines could be impacted?\nSECRETARY ROSS: Well, conceivably it could result in a recommendation to take action on all steel imports, Whereas a countervailing duty investigation or an anti-dumping, as I've said, would be limited to one set of products from one or a limited group of countries. So it could be broader both geographically and product-wise.\nQ: You also gave the rationale a lot about defense use of steel, but isn't there a contractual obligation by most defense contractors to use U.S.-produced products to make those things anyway?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I'm sorry, could you say --\nQ: You talked a lot about the needs of the defense industry for steel as a possible rationale for doing this. Doesn't the U.S. military already have to prioritize U.S. manufacture of steel in these types of items?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Sure, they can. But if you need workers with particular skills to make a particular product, prioritizing doesn't do you much good.\nQ: There are reports that the Navy is delaying construction of new frigates to fix problems with the littoral combat ships because of shipbuilding capacity issues. Is the President concerned that problems in the steel industry and being under capacity is having a direct effect on our ability to produce ships for the Navy? Is that a specific concern?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, that certainly would be one of the areas that would be covered by the investigation.\nQ: The President has taken a number of actions related to the U.S. steel industry. It seems that one of his goals is to bolster the U.S. steel industry domestically. But clearly that has implications for steel prices in the United States. To what extent have you guys considered the effect of rising steel prices on steel consumers in the United States, and what that impact will be -- the knock-on impact will be on other industries inside the United States? Are you concerned about that at all?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, that surely would be one of the topics in the report because everything interacts with everything else, and so it's a question of balancing one's priorities.\nQ: Apparently, in 2001, the Commerce Department looked into this issue and concluded that there was no risk. So can you explain what it is that is raising your concerns this time around?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Sure. If you look at the capacity charts, particularly from China, you would now find China has over one billion tons of capacity. That represents one-half the capacity in the whole world. They use about 700 million tons directly in their own country, and they export over 100 million tons. That still leaves 200 million tons of unutilized capacity, and their exports of that 100 million tons\n-- which is, itself, about the total U.S. consumption -- has created all sorts of follow-on effects in other countries.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, following on the previous question, has Commerce done any kind of preliminary calculation on what the effect to consumers would be of any kind of plan to put tariffs on steel in order to protect the American steel industry?\nSECRETARY ROSS: Well, we've already got tariffs on a few of the cases, on more than 150 different items. So the question is, what would be the incremental effect if any additional tariffs were recommended? But no decision has been made as to whether or not to do so; if so, what amount or what products.\nQ: I understand that. Have any preliminary calculations been done in various scenarios -- potential scenarios?\nSECRETARY ROSS: We haven't gotten that far yet. We're still in the research stage.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, investigations like this may be based on an application from an interested party, a request from another agency or department, or maybe self-initiated by the Secretary of Commerce. Can you clarify who requested that this investigation be launched?\nSECRETARY ROSS: We self-initiated this.\nQ: Based on what?\nSECRETARY ROSS: Based on the facts that I have just outlined to you, and based on the fact that the President, in its supplemental budget and in the proposed budgets going forward, is calling for increased military spending, and increased military spending inevitably will have an effect on steel.\nQ: Are there other investigations that you would consider launching or that you're waiting to pull the trigger on into other potential imports?\nSECRETARY ROSS: Well, I don't know if that's -- that's really more a psychotherapy question than it is a policy question. (Laughter.)\nYes.\nQ: And the best one-liner of the day.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, you said that the Commerce Department self-initiated this, and the statute says that there is a 270-day window and that you're going to try to beat that. So what is the purpose of the memorandum if you are going to try to do this as fast as possible? Is it to set down a new deadline to do this more quickly, or is it just going to tell you to do it as fast as possible, which you already said you are going to do?\nSECRETARY ROSS: Well, as you know, the President is very results-oriented, and he has issued this memorandum to stress that he would like us to make this a real priority and to expedite it. Not to short-circuit it, not to cut out any steps that should be followed, but he'd like it to be the real priority and expedited.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, you talked about steps to protect the U.S. steel industry, but there's also the problem in China of the overcapacity, the overproduction of steel, which is really a structural problem in their economy, one that they, I think, have tried to address or would like to address. Is that something that you discussed with China in your bilateral discussions? Is there something you anticipate where the U.S. could help China reduce its production and overcapacity in steel?\nSECRETARY ROSS: Overcapacity is a topic for the ongoing discussions with the Chinese, and not just in steel. It's also true in aluminum; it's true in quite a lot of other products.\nQ: Is there anything, any steps that you would take there with China? Is there anything specific that you've discussed with them that you can share?\nSECRETARY ROSS: We're wading back into psychotherapy.\nSTAFF PERSON: The Secretary is trying to get to the signing. So, I have all the handouts for you guys. Again, now the embargo is lifted, on the record.\nQ: Can you recommend a good psychotherapist?

Ross, Jr.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123788", "text": "The President. Thank you very much. We appreciate everybody for being here. It's a historic day for American steel and, most importantly, for American steelworkers. Thanks, especially, to Secretary Wilbur Ross for helping to lead this critical effort. We've been working on it since I came to office and long before I came to office. We're going to fight for American workers and American-made steel. And that's beginning immediately.\nFor decades, America has lost our jobs and our factories to unfair foreign trade. And one steel mill after another has been shut down, abandoned, and closed, and we're going to reverse that. Other countries have made a living taking advantage of the United States in so many ways, as you know, and I've been talking about that for a long time.\nAs I traveled the country, I saw the shuttered factories and the shuttered dreams, and I pledged that I would take action. And I think it's probably one of the primary reasons I'm sitting here today as President.\nAnd since the day I entered office, I have followed through on that pledge, big league, beginning with our withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have been a catastrophe for our businesses and for our workers. I'm very proud of that withdrawal. Some people say, oh, gee, I wish you didn't do that, but the smart people say, thank you, thank you, thank you. That would have been another NAFTA disaster. And NAFTA, believe me, was a disaster and continues to be a disaster for our country.\nOn Tuesday, I signed an order to enforce the \"buy American\" laws and stop foreign countries from stealing contracts from American companies and, essentially, from American workers.\nToday I'm directing the Department of Commerce to immediately prioritize the investigation it began yesterday and really long before that—because Wilbur and I have been working on this for a long time—into foreign steel arriving into our markets and to submit a report on the effects of these foreign steel products on the national security of the United States. It's not just the pricing, it's not just employment, it also has to do with the national security of our country, which people never talk about. I talk about it.\nMaintaining the production of American steel is extremely important to our national security and our defense industrial base. Steel is critical to both our economy and our military. This is not an area where we can afford to become dependent on foreign countries. We have a product where we actually need foreign countries to be nice to us in order to fight for our people. And that's not going to happen any longer, believe me, especially as it comes to steel.\nThis investigation will look at how steel imports are impacting United States national security, taking into account foreign practices such as steel dumping. Dumping is a tremendous problem in this country. They're dumping vast amounts of steel in our company—in our country, and they're really hurting not only our country, but our companies. Their targeting of American industry and other foreign strategies designed to undermine American industry as a whole. Based on the findings of this report, Secretary Wilbur Ross will make formal recommendations to the White House in a very, very, near future. He'll be back very soon with those recommendations that we will implement.\nFrom now on, we're going to stand up for American jobs, workers, their security, and for American steel companies and companies generally. Today's action is the next vital step toward making America strong and prosperous once again.\nAnd I want to just add—I wasn't going to do this—but I was in Wisconsin the other day, and I want to end and add by saying that Canada, what they've done to our dairy farm workers is a disgrace. It's a disgrace. I spent time with some of the farmers in Wisconsin, and as you know, rules, regulations, different things have changed. And our farmers in Wisconsin and New York State are being put out of business, our dairy farmers. And that also includes what's happening along our northern border States with Canada, having to do with lumber and timber.\nThe fact is, NAFTA—whether it's Mexico or Canada—is a disaster for our country. It's a disaster. It's a trading disaster. And we'll be reporting back sometime over the next 2 weeks as to NAFTA and what we're going to do about it. But what happened to our dairy farmers in Wisconsin and New York State, we're not going to let it happen. We can't let Canada or anybody else take advantage and do what they did to our workers and to our farmers. And again, I want to also just mention, included in there is lumber, timber, and energy. So we're going to have to get to the negotiating table with Canada very, very quickly. Again, just to tell you, this is another NAFTA disaster, and we're not going to let it continue onward.\nI think what I'd like to do is ask a few of the people if they'd like to—these are some of the great steel companies of our country. Now, some of those companies were much bigger years ago. U.S. Steel would be an example, and others would be examples. But they were much—these were the greatest companies in the world years ago. And today, they've been hurt, but they'll be great again. And they'll be great, I think, very soon. We're going to impose very, very strict regulations on unfair competition from the outside world.\nPerhaps I could ask the head of United States Steel to say a few words.\nU.S. Steel Co. Chief Executive Officer Mario Longhi. My honor, Mr. President, Mr. Secretary. I think the signing of this Executive order clearly demonstrates your understanding of the fundamental importance that our industry has, not just to the national economy, but to our national defense.\nThe President. Thank you very much. I appreciate—anybody like to say something on behalf of your company or your workers?\nNucor Corp. Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President John J. Ferriola . I would just like to thank you, Mr. President and Secretary Ross, for this action to protect not only our industries, our employees, but frankly, our country. So thank you for this bold move.\nThe President. Thank you very much.\nUnited Steelworkers International President Leo W. Gerard. Mr. President, on behalf of the workers in the industry—President of the Steelworkers Union—I have worked a long time with Wilbur, and we've been fighting this unfair trade for more than 30 years. Hopefully, this Executive order will give us the tools we need to grow our companies back and put people back to work. The President. Good.\nMr. Gerard. And I have lots of faith that Secretary Wilbur Ross will help make that happen.\nThe President. I have to say, the unions have been working with us very closely, and they've been great. So I appreciate that. Thank you very much.\nSo we're going to sign, and this is a very important signing. And we'll be back over a period of the next 30 to 50 days, I would say, and maybe sooner than that. But statutorily, we probably want to take a very good, strong, hard study. And we're going to do something really great for our industry, but in this particular case, for the steel industry. I look forward to it too.\n[At this point, the President signed the memorandum.]\nThe President. So should I give this pen to labor or to steel? [Laughter] That's the big question. And I'm going to look at it, and they're going to be a partnership. So how about we give it to the union for a change? Should we do that? Come on.\nParticipant. We're all on the same team.\nThe President. You treat us fairly, that's all.\nMr. Gerard. Thank you.\nThe President. Okay, you treat us fairly. [Laughter]\nChina/Trade\nQ. Mr. President, how will this affect your dealings with China on North Korea? Are you concerned that this will affect that at all?\nThe President. This has nothing to do with China. This has to do with worldwide, what's happening. The dumping problem is a worldwide problem.\nThank you, everybody.", "timestamp": "2017-04-20", "title": "Remarks on Signing a Memorandum on Steel Imports and Threats to National Security and an Exchange With Reporters"}

Trump", "note": "An original was not available for verification of the content of this memorandum.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123783", "text": "Memorandum for the Secretary of Commerce\nSubject: Steel Imports and Threats to National Security\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, it is hereby directed as follows:\nSection 1. Policy. Core industries such as steel (including specialty steel unique to defense applications), aluminum, vehicles, aircraft, shipbuilding, and semiconductors are critical elements of our manufacturing and defense industrial bases, which we must defend against unfair trade practices and other abuses. In the case of steel, both the United States and global markets for steel products are distorted by large volumes of excess capacity—much of which results from foreign government subsidies and other unfair practices.\nThe United States has placed more than 150 antidumping and countervailing duty orders on steel products, but they have not substantially alleviated the negative effects that unfairly traded imports have had on the United States steel industry. Repeated efforts by the United States to encourage other countries to reduce and address the underlying causes of excess capacity in the steel market have had little meaningful effect.\nThe artificially low prices caused by excess capacity and unfairly traded imports suppress profits in the American steel industry, which discourages long-term investment in the industry and hinders efforts by American steel producers to research and develop new and better grades of steel. If the present situation continues, it may place the American steel industry at risk by undermining the ability of American steel producers to continue investment and research and development, and by reducing or eliminating the jobs needed to maintain a pool of skilled workers essential for the continued development of advanced steel manufacturing.\nSec. 2. Investigation. The Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) has initiated an investigation under section 232(b)(1)(A) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (the \"Act\") (19 U.S.C. 1862(b)(1)(A)) to determine the effects on national security of steel imports. In conducting this investigation, and in accordance with section 232(d) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1862(d)), the Secretary shall, as appropriate and consistent with law:\n(a) consider the domestic production of steel needed for projected national defense requirements; the capacity of domestic industries to meet such requirements; the existing and anticipated availabilities of the human resources, products, raw materials, and other supplies and services essential to the national defense; the requirements of growth of such industries and such supplies and services, including the investment, exploration, and development necessary to assure such growth; and the importation of goods in terms of their quantities, availabilities, character, and use as those affect such industries and the capacity of the United States to meet national security requirements;\n(b) recognize the close relation of the Nation's economic welfare to our national security, and consider the effect of foreign competition in the steel industry on the economic welfare of domestic industries; (c) consider any substantial unemployment, decrease in government revenues, loss of skills or investment, or other serious effects resulting from the displacement of any domestic products by excessive steel imports; and\n(d) consider the status and likely effectiveness of efforts of the United States to negotiate a reduction in the levels of excess steel capacity worldwide.\nSec. 3. Submit Report and Provide Recommendations. (a) The Secretary shall, consistent with applicable law, proceed expeditiously in conducting the investigation described in section 2 of this memorandum and shall submit to the President a report on the findings.\n(b) Pursuant to section 232(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1862(b)), if the Secretary finds that steel is being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security, the Secretary shall, in the report submitted under subsection (a) of this section, recommend actions and steps that should be taken to adjust steel imports so that they will not threaten to impair the national security.\nSec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nDONALD J.

Thank you very much. Prime Minister Gentiloni, welcome. Great honor. Thank you.\nIt's wonderful to have you in our wonderful people's house, known as the White House. And so many great Italian friends are with us today. And we renew, always, the deep ties of history and friendship that link together the American and the Italian peoples. That history traces its roots to the timeless contributions of Italy to civilization and human progress—so true. Stretching all the way back to ancient Rome, through the ages, your country has been a beacon of artistic and scientific achievement—and that continues today—from Venice to Florence, from Verdi to Pavarotti, a friend of mine. Great friend of mine. These bonds of history and culture have only grown stronger as our two nations have become close partners, dear friends, and very vital allies.\nMr. Prime Minister, I'm thrilled that you are here today to discuss how we can make this great relationship even more productive in the years to come. On the economy, Italy is one of America's largest trading partners. A lot of people don't know that. We both seek a trading relationship that is balanced, reciprocal—I love the word \"reciprocal,\" because we don't have too many reciprocal trading partnerships, I will tell you that, but we will very soon—and fair, benefiting both of our countries. And we can work together to achieve that outcome, and that will happen.\nItaly is also a key partner in the fight against terrorism. Italy is now the second largest contributor of troops to the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. I would also like to thank you, Prime Minister, for your leadership on seeking stabilization in Libya and for your crucial efforts to deny ISIS a foothold in the Mediterranean. You fought hard. We're grateful for your role in the anti-ISIS campaign. All nations must condemn this barbaric enemy and support the effort to achieve its total and complete destruction.\nAlso, as you know, Mr. Prime Minister, we have more than 30,000 American servicemembers, families, and personnel who are stationed across your country. As we reaffirm our support for historic institutions, we must also reaffirm the requirement that everyone must pay their full and fair share for the cost of defense.\nTogether, we can address many pressing challenges, including two that greatly affect both of our countries, those of large-scale migration and international smuggling. Maintaining strong borders is a vital component of any security policy, and a responsible approach to refugees is one that seeks the eventual return of refugees to their home countries so that they can help to rebuild their own nations.\nFinally, I want to say how much I look forward to visiting Sicily for the G-7, as we seek to foster cooperation not only on matters of security, but also science, commerce, health, and technology. Our two countries have shared interests and shared values, and we can each make great contributions to the other.\nMr. Prime Minister, I again want to thank you for being with us and being our true friend. Italy is a spectacular place; I know it well. I love the people of Italy. We have 18 million Italians living in the United States, people originally from Italy. And it's a great honor to have many of them as my friends. Thank you for being here.\nPrime Minister Gentiloni. Thank you very much. Thank you for hosting us here. It's an honor to be here at the White House today. And I'll now switch to Italian.\n[At this point, Prime Minister Gentiloni spoke in Italian, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nPrime Minister Gentiloni. We had a very fruitful meeting, which reflects an ancient friendship, as the President reminded us with his words. This friendship is also a sign of the 18 million Italian Americans who have such an important role in our country—in this country. And this friendship is witnessed also by the fact that Italy is the second choice for American students who study abroad, and we're very proud of this. And this confirms the importance that the United States gives to the cultural dimension of our country, as the President, himself, just said.\nThis friendship is based on a common commitment against terrorism. This commitment, see, is a commitment in which we are both very active—our country is very active in Iraq and in Afghanistan, and I think that the stabilization work will be decisive, the civilization work of Iraq, after the military defeat that we expect for Daesh.\nWe know that this action against terrorism must take place within our individual countries. In Europe, with the social and cultural commitment against radicalization, by cooperating with Islamic communities, Italy contributes to peace and to stability in the Mediterranean. In Syria, where I believe the U.S. choice to react to the use of chemical weapons by Bashar al-Asad, and where a negotiated solution is more necessary than ever. In Libya—and we discussed this in our meeting—where we need to work against the division of the country in order to stabilize it.\nThis is a very decisive task if we want to manage the migratory flows without giving up on our values and our humanitarian principles. And we need to contrast the horrible traffic of people and clandestine refugees.\nItaly is convinced of its strategic commitment in favor of the transatlantic relationship. We have also spoken about common commitments in NATO and the goals that were identified in 2014 and the commitments on military expenses and the contribution that each country must make towards collective security. We are proud of our contribution.\nAnd finally, Italy is a country of dialogue. We are proud because we succeeded in keeping open the doors in difficult crises. Dialogue can be useful, even vis-à-vis Russia, without obviously giving up our unity and our principles and without giving up our strength and our values.\nI also told President Trump that we have confidence—even though this is a difficult moment, and we all know it's difficult right now—I have—we have confidence in the future of the European Union and certainly in the importance of the relationship between the U.S. and Italy. These are the two pillars that the transatlantic relationship is based on and a great part of peace and freedom in the world. We are going through a difficult time, but I have confidence that the European Union will continue to be a positive response to this.\nAnd finally, we are expecting and I look forward to the President's visit to the summit in Taormina, and I trust that this will be the opportunity to show him the unity of our leaders and of the principal free economies of the planet. Because right now we really do need this unity. Once again, thank you, Mr. President.\nPresident Trump. Thank you very much, sir. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nI'll take a few questions. John Roberts of Fox, please.\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization/Shooting in Paris, France/North Korea/China/Iran\nQ. Mr. President, thanks so much. I hope you'll forgive me for asking you three-part questions; it's been a while. In just the last few minutes—I believe it was while you were meeting with the Prime Minister—there was a shooting in downtown Paris.\nPresident Trump. I see that.\nQ. It's being described as a potential terrorist attack. I wonder if you have something on that.\nAnd further to that, to the big trouble spots that you're dealing with right now, North Korea and Iran. Do you believe that the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Un, is mentally unstable? Is that one of the reasons why you're so concerned about these latest developments? Is he a man who can be reasoned with? And on Iran, do you have reason to suspect that they are cheating on the JCPOA?\nAnd to Mr. Prime Minister, you talked just a moment ago about your commitment to NATO. President Trump would like to see all NATO members contribute 2 percent of their GDP to NATO. Your contribution is slightly less than 1 percent. Will you commit to committing 2 percent of your GDP to the alliance going forward? Thank you.\nPresident Trump. Well, first of all, I love the question you asked the Prime Minister. I look forward to his answer—[laughter]—because I'm going to be asking him that same question very soon.\nWell, first of all, our condolences from our country to the people of France. Again, it's happening, it seems. I just saw it as I was walking in, so that's a terrible thing, and it's a very, very terrible thing that's going on in the world today. But it looks like another terrorist attack. And what can you say? It just never ends. We have to be strong, and we have to be vigilant. And I've been saying it for a long time.\nAs far as North Korea is concerned, we are in very good shape. And we're building our military rapidly. A lot of things have happened over the last short period of time. I've been here for approximately 91 days; we're doing a lot of work. We're in very good position. We're going to see what happens.\nI can't ask your—answer your question on stability. I hope the answer is a positive one, not a negative one. But hopefully, that will be something that gets taken care of. I have great respect for the President of China. As you know, we had a great summit in Florida, and Palm Beach, and got to know each other and, I think, like each other. I can say from my standpoint I liked him very much. I respect him very much. And I think he's working very hard.\nI can say that all of the pundits out there are saying they never have seen China work like they're working right now. Many coal ships have sent back. Many other things have happened. Some very unusual moves have been made over the last 2 or 3 hours. And I really have confidence that the President will try very hard. We don't know whether or not they're able to do that, but I have absolute confidence that he will be trying very, very hard. And one of the reasons that we're talking about trade deals and we're talking about all of the different things—but we're slowing up a little bit. I actually told him, I said, you'll make a much better deal on trade if you get rid of this menace or do something about the menace of North Korea. Because that's what it is, it's a menace right now.\nSo we'll see what happens. As far as Iran is concerned, I think they are doing a tremendous disservice to an agreement that was signed. It was a terrible agreement. It shouldn't have been signed. It shouldn't have been negotiated the way it was negotiated. I'm all for agreements, but that was a bad one, as bad as I've ever seen negotiated.\nThey are not living up to the spirit of the agreement, I can tell you that. And we're analyzing it very, very carefully, and we'll have something to say about it in the not-too-distant future. But Iran has not lived up to the spirit of the agreement. And they have to do that. They have to do that. So we will see what happens.\nThank you very much, John.\nPrime Minister Gentiloni. Thank you, Mr. President.\n[Prime Minister Gentiloni continued in Italian, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nPrime Minister Gentiloni. First of all, allow me to join President Trump's words for what happened in Paris, these words of condolences and closeness to the French people. And this is a very delicate period for them, just 3 days before the election.\nAs far as the question is concerned, the commitment has been made. It was made during a NATO summit. And we are used to respecting our commitments. We know that this will be a gradual process; it has already begun. And we know that Italy has certain limitations when it comes to its budget, but despite these limitations, our commitment for common defense is very clear.\nAnd as I said earlier, I'm very proud not only of the progress made by—in our financial commitment, but also proud of the contribution that we give to the security of the alliance in so many areas of the world. We talked about Iraq and Afghanistan, but we could also talk about the Baltic Sea or the Balkans. And in all of these areas, you will see the presence of Italian forces within the alliance, and we are proud of that.\nSky News.\n[A reporter spoke in Italian, and her remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nEuropean Union/Pope Francis\nQ. Giovanna Pancheri, Sky Italia. First, for you, President [Prime Minister; White House correction.] Gentiloni, I wanted to ask you: We saw from this new administration a new type of policy on the international scene, very different from what we had in the past. And one of the last important operations, which was carried out by President Trump, was in Syria with a bombing following the use of chemical weapons by the Asad regime. I wanted to ask you, does Italy think or conceive a possibility to take action in—more action in Syria?\n[The reporter continued in English as follows.] Q. ——since my colleague from Fox News did, so I'm going to take as well the possibility to ask you two questions. First of all, about European Union, you have said in the past the Brexit was a great thing, and that you think that other country will follow. So you know that Italy is an important player and supporter of European integration. Do you believe that actually a strong Europe is important from—for the United States, also looking forward at the French election?\nAnd on the second question, is that you said that you're looking forward to come to Italy for the G-7, and I wanted to know if you're also looking forward, if it's going to be possible, to meet Pope Francis during your Italian trip. Thank you.\n[Prime Minister Gentiloni spoke in Italian, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nPrime Minister Gentiloni. Syria: We immediately assessed the operation that was ordered by President Trump and decided that this was a motivated response to the use of chemical weapons. We added that it's up to everyone to consider negotiation as the road through which we, hopefully, can put an end to this infinite dramatic war and come to peace. Italy is not directly involved in the operations, in military operations in Syria other than marginal aspects, but it's not our plan to change this attitude.\nPresident Trump. Yes, a strong Europe is very, very important to me as President of the United States. And it's also, in my opinion, in my very strong opinion, important for the United States. We want to see it. We will help it be strong, and it's very much to everybody's advantage. And I look very much forward to meeting the Pope.\nFabian of the Hill [Jordan Fabian, The Hill]. Fabian. Yes.\nHealth Care Reform Legislation\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President. Some people on Capitol Hill believe you can get one of two things next week: a vote on health care or a vote on a Government funding bill. So my question is, which one is more important to you have: a vote on health care or a vote on a bill to keep the Government open?\nAnd, Mr. Prime Minister, I want to get your thoughts on a referendum in Turkey that occurred last week. You spoke about democratic values in the European continent, so are you concerned with the result of the Turkish referendum? And is that something that you discussed with President Trump?\nPresident Trump. Okay, I want to get both. [Laughter] Are you shocked to hear that? And we're doing very well on health care. We'll see what happens. But this is a great bill. There's a great plan. And this will be great health care. It's evolving. You know, there was never a give-up. The press sort of reported there was, like, a give-up. There's no give-up. We started. Remember, it took Obamacare 17 months. I've really been negotiating this for 2 months, maybe even less than that, because we had a 30-day period where we did lots of other things the first 30 days.\nBut this has really been 2 months. And this is a continuation. And the plan gets better and better and better. And it's gotten really, really good. And a lot of people are liking it a lot. We have a good chance of getting it soon. I'd like to say next week, but it will be—I believe we will get it. And whether it's next week or shortly thereafter. As far as keeping the Government open, I think we want to keep the Government open. Don't you agree? So, yes, I think we'll get both. Thank you.\n[Prime Minister Gentiloni spoke in Italian, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nPrime Minister Gentiloni. The Turkish referendum is a fact that we must take note of, leaving aside any debates that can take place about how the vote took place. But I believe that the European leadership have taken note of the vote. The consequences will depend a great deal on how the Turkish Government and President Erdogan, especially, will take into account almost half of the population's expression of a different opinion. Will there be an inclusive approach, or will there be a confrontation in this part of Turkey? This will be very important for us and the European Union.\nThe other thing that's going to be very important is to—is the respect of the certain fundamental principles. We are members of the Atlantic alliance—Italy and Turkey—and Italy contributes to Turkey's defense with its own military assets. We believe that, among our countries, there should be a cooperation, and hopefully—and we trust—that this cooperation will have, among its consequences, the solution of the case concerning the journalist—blogger who's been detained over the last few days in Turkey.\n[Inaudible]—Italian Radio.\n[A reporter spoke in Italian, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nLibya/Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) Terrorist Organization\nQ. Ruffalo—[inaudible]. President Gentiloni, you have focused a lot on the leadership—Italian leadership and American leadership—in order to stabilize Libya. What do you expect exactly from Washington? And especially, I am asking you, what is necessary in this process, in this relationship of cooperation with Russia?\n[The reporter continued in English as follows.]\nQ. President Trump, do you see a role for your administration in helping stabilizing Libya? And do you agree that stabilizing Libya means combating terrorism and ISIS?\n[Prime Minister Gentiloni spoke in Italian, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nPrime Minister Gentiloni. America has played a very key role, first of all, to prevent the consolidation of an important basis for terrorism while Daesh was undergoing defeats in Iraq and Syria. There were operations that were sustained by the U.S. against Daesh in the city of Sirte, which were successful. Now the commitment must be political. And therefore, in the cooperation between U.S. and Italy and other key partners in the region, the goal is to broaden the basis of the consensus for the Tripoli Government, which is recognized by the international community, but which must be able to count on a broader consensus.\nI believe that one clear goal should be this: We need the region, and we need countries like Egypt and Tunisia that are close to Libya. We need a stable and unified Libya. A divided country and in conflict would be—would make stability worse. The U.S. job is—the U.S. role, sorry, in this is very critical.\nPresident Trump. I do not see a role in Libya. I think the United States has right now enough roles. We're in a role everywhere. So I do not see that. I do see a role in getting rid of ISIS. We're being very effective in that regard. We are doing a job, with respect to ISIS, that has not been done anywhere near the numbers that we're producing right now. It's a very effective force we have. We have no choice. It's a horrible thing to say, but we have no choice.\nAnd we are effectively ridding the world of ISIS. I see that as a primary role, and that's what we're going to do, whether it's in Iraq or in Libya or anywhere else.

{"author": "Sean Spicer", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123789", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n11:23 A.M. EDT\nMR. SPICER: The U.N. Secretary General is in Washington for meetings today. He came to the White House to meet with National Security Advisor McMaster, and we anticipate he'll be\n-- our plan is that he'll stop by the Oval Office and meet with the President today. So I just wanted to update you on that. We'll provide a readout after that meeting concludes.\nThe President is also extremely pleased to have Aya Hijazi and her husband home again after three long years -- nearly three long years. The President directly engaged behind the scenes on her behalf and made it clear to the Egyptian government how important it was to him that this American be released and returned.\nFor those of you who are not fully aware of the story, Aya Hijazi was running an NGO dedicated to improving the lives of children in Cairo. Nearly three years ago, she, along with her husband and six Egyptian colleagues, were arrested and held without trial for almost, as I mentioned, three years. Early in the administration, the President was briefed on the situation and directed his national security team to figure out ways to address this situation through diplomatic channels.\nThe President discussed the issue privately with President el-Sisi when he visited the White House a short time ago. And today, the President is proud to be welcoming her back to the White House and happy that she is back home on American soil. He will be meeting with her, and her brother is accompanying her in the Oval Office very shortly.\nMoving on, the Office of Management and Budget, as required, is taking routine steps to prepare in the unlikely case that there's a lapse in appropriations next week following the continuing resolution. We have a handout -- I don't know if that's already been -- okay.\nJust to be clear -- and again, I just want to make sure -- we remain confident that we're not going to have a shutdown. These are required steps that OMB has to do in terms of agencies and departments to make sure that they are prepared. It's part of the agency guidance. OMB has held these pre-appropriation-lapse calls with agencies since 2013. Calls were made once in 2013 for FY14, once in 2015 for FY16, and twice in 2016 for FY17.\nI would direct you to OMB, but my understanding is that there is a policy that directs OMB to conduct certain activities with these departments within a -- I think it's a seven-day window. And again, I'm not -- I don't want to be prescriptive, but I believe that it's a seven-day window. If there hasn't been -- as you come up to a CR, they must take -- they're required to take certain steps, and so they are just going through those routine steps.\nAgencies are required to develop and maintain plans with updates every two years for such an event. As I mentioned, this is a routine part of the interagency process. At the bottom of the handout is a contact number for any further questions you may have.\nThe Vice President, as you know, is continuing on his trip. While in Indonesia, Vice President Pence and his Indonesian counterpart presided over $10 billion in trade and investment agreements that demonstrate the strength of the U.S.-Indonesia economic relationship, and included delivery of cutting-edge U.S. technologies. He also visited Indonesia's national mosque, where the Grand Imam guided him and his family on a tour of the largest mosque in the largest Muslim democracy in the world.\nVice President Pence also announced the President will attend three summits in Southeast Asia: The U.S. Association of Southeast Asian Nations -- or ASEAN -- Summit, and the East Asia Summit in the Philippines, and the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit, or APEC, that will be in Vietnam.\nOn Saturday, he will visit Sydney, Australia, and have a series of meetings with senior Australian government officials. The Vice President's Office has been providing readouts and pool reports and further information on all of that during his trip.\nThis weekend, the President and the First Lady will open the White House gardens to the public on Saturday and Sunday. And finally, I know that we've gotten a couple requests from you all about Bring Your Child to Work Day, which is next week -- I think, Anita -- one of them. I am pleased to let you know that on behalf of the President, the First Lady, the White House will be welcoming your kids to join us at work that day. We're planning some activities for them, and I will have further guidance on that hopefully this weekend. We're working out some details.\nAs you know, there's a foreign leader visit that day, and we're trying to work out some spacing and some other things during the day. But anticipate further guidance on that if you want to have your kid come.\nQ: What day is that?\nMR. SPICER: It's Thursday, right? It's next Thursday.\nQ: That's the press conference --\nMR. SPICER: That's right. (Laughter.)\nQ: My daughter has some questions. (Laughter.)\nMR. SPICER: Your daughter may get some questions. So anyway, we'll try to give you guidance, and just plan appropriately in terms of -- the lower press will be working with you in terms of getting all that kind of vitals that we need to enter the White House, et cetera. But plan on a day of some back-and-forth that we can do with you.\nSo with that, let's go. Adam.\nQ: Sean, thank you. Just a quick question about tax reform. And I know the details are not 100 percent public, but there have been trial balloons, whatever you want to call them, about maybe repealing the deductions for state and local taxes. How does that play into middle-class tax relief? What does that look like for the middle class in terms of --\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to even start to talk about the nature of tax reform. I think you heard the Secretary -- we'll have something soon in terms of an outline. They've been working for a while now with House and Senate leaderships in undergoing the process of engaging with various stakeholders, but I'm not going to start talking about what's in and out.\nMajor.\nQ: What's the source of your confidence that there will not be a shutdown?\nMR. SPICER: Strong.\nQ: No, the source.\nMR. SPICER: The source?\nQ: From what does it -- why are you so confident? What is it that you're seeing or hearing in the back-and-forth that gives you confidence? Because yesterday, there seemed to be a chill brought into negotiations introduced by the OMB Director and the request for specific allocations either for the border wall or some limitation on sanctuary cities. And that seemed to create a hostile response from some of the people who are not just in the Democratic Party, but are the key negotiators with House and Senate Republicans.\nMR. SPICER: So you heard Director Mulvaney yesterday saying a shutdown is never desired and neither is it a strategy, and I think we echo that. We feel confident. We've been working with House and Senate leadership, and our goal is to continue to do what's necessary to fund the government.\nQ: Right, but is it your goal in that process to obtain the President's spending cut priorities and spending allocation priorities, or avoid a shutdown? Right now you can't do both.\nMR. SPICER: Well, I don't necessarily -- I think we've made it very clear that we want border wall funding, we want greater latitude to deny federal grants to sanctuary cities. We want hiring of immigration agents, and we want $30 billion to infuse the military budget. Those are our priorities.\nThat being said, I don't think it's synonymous with -- we'll continue to negotiate and work with the leadership. But no one wants a shutdown, we want to keep it going. And I get the question, but I think we've talked about what our priorities are. We're working with members on both sides of the aisle in both chambers to find a way forward. But I think we feel confident that that will happen, that we will avoid a shutdown.\nQ: And if push comes to shove and your priorities have to take a backseat, they will?\nMR. SPICER: We're working with House and Senate. Our goal now is -- we've laid out our priorities and we're committed to not having a shutdown. So I don't know how easier to put it.\nJohn.\nQ: Yesterday at the press conference, the President said that there had been some \"unusual moves\" -- I assume those were by China -- \"in the last few hours\" regarding North Korea. What was that all about?\nMR. SPICER: The President, obviously, is privy to a lot of information. He's not going to share everything he knows, but there's some things that he saw that were helpful in that -- with respect to that subject.\nQ: Can you tell us what --\nMR. SPICER: I cannot. I'm not privileged -- I'm not privy -- no.\nQ: Not at liberty to say.\nMR. SPICER: Thank you.\nQ: Also, today, yesterday the President seemed to indicate that he had liked what China was doing, but this morning said \"if they want to solve this they will.\" It seemed like he was giving X Jinping a bit of a push.\nMR. SPICER: I think we've seen a lot of positive action from China, both at the U.N., some of the public statements they've made on -- the President noted yesterday with respect to some -- the energy sector. So we're very -- I think that, growing off of the relationship that they established down in Florida, we've seen some very positive signs with China that -- to help put the appropriate pressure on North Korea.\nQ: But am I wrong in reading that as a little bit of a push?\nMR. SPICER: No, I think the President -- he tweeted out a week ago, I think, if they won't we'll do it ourselves. So this is very consistent with what he's been saying.\nAthena.\nQ: Speaking of tweets, the President, back in October, gave a long speech in Gettysburg, I believe, talking about what he wanted to accomplish or hoped to accomplish in his first 100 days. And then just recently he tweeted that it was a ridiculous construct. So is it ridiculous, is it not ridiculous? And what do you guys see as the President's biggest accomplishments? I know we're not there yet, but we're getting close to there.\nMR. SPICER: Well, you're right, I mean, we do have a ways to go. And I think that you're going to continue to see activity to further that goal. So far, we've passed 24 laws, we've signed 24 executive orders; we've achieved the first Supreme Court confirmation in 100 days since 1881; we've instituted tough immigration policies that have driven illegal border crossings to a 17-year low; we've removed more job-killing regulation through legislation than any President in U.S. history.\nI think that there's a lot of things that have been accomplished so far, and I think you're going to continue to see it. We're not looking at, like, a marker and saying let's just rush to it and get to -- I think day 101, 102, 103, 180, 200, we're going to continue to press on.\nQ: And just two quick follow-ups. One is, does the President believe that Judge Gonzalo Curiel needs to recuse himself, or does he --\nMR. SPICER: I'm sorry, say that --\nQ: Does the President believe that Judge Gonzalo Curiel should in any way -- should recuse himself from this case that he's overseeing on the DREAMer? And also, does the President have a preferred candidate in the French election?\nMR. SPICER: No, and no.\nMatt.\nQ: Sean, thank you. Can you tell us any more about the behind-the-scenes with getting this American home from Egypt? When did this become a priority for the President? And can you tell us some more about the specific actions he took over the past few months to make that happen?\nMR. SPICER: So as I mentioned -- I don't have the dates in front of me, but he was briefed by his national security team on a whole host of issues around the world, including this one, early on in the administration, and directed the national security team to begin to take steps and work behind the scenes.\nAnd again, I'm not sure that it's appropriate that I get into it from here, but I will say that the team and he, in particular, brought this up privately with el-Sisi when he was here during the visit, and the team has worked extensively behind the scenes over the last couple months, as least, to make this a priority and bring her home.\nAnd so, again, I hope you can respect that there are some things that I can't publicly address at this time in terms of the dates, but I would say that early on in the administration, when he became aware of it, he began to instruct his team, and then obviously it was something that he believed from a behind-the-scenes sense was best addressed to achieve in a positive outcome for her.\nQ: So he brought it up specifically with el-Sisi when he was here?\nMR. SPICER: Again, I don't want to get into it, but, yes, it was brought up. And I think we've had obviously very productive and helpful discussions that resulted in her being able to come back to the United States.\nHallie.\nQ: Sean, forgive me if you've talked about healthcare already, but there does seem to be some optimism in the West Wing about getting something done, perhaps the timeline of next week. It seems to be not at all unrealistic from what we're hearing from the Hill, particularly around leadership. Can you characterize where the President is on this? Is this the White House sort of trying to get something done before the 100-day mark to point to an accomplishment?\nMR. SPICER: Again, we're not looking to get something done to point -- we're trying to get it done. I mean, I don't think it's --\nQ: Next week?\nMR. SPICER: If it gets done next week, great. If it gets done -- it will get done when we feel like we've got the votes and we've got a position where we're there. But I don't -- this has not been our goal. and I would respectfully say that to -- I'm sorry, let me just finish the sentence -- to sort of say that we have to have it done by X date -- I think the President addressed this yesterday. If we can get it done next week, great. If we get it done the week after, great. We're going to get it done when it's appropriate in terms of getting to that 216, or depending on when some of these members -- the specials happen. So we're not -- there's no -- it is not our official position to get this thing done by next week.\nQ: But did he move the goalpost a little yesterday? Because on the campaign trail he said he would do it day one, and now he's sayING, well, maybe it will take months, maybe it will take longer.\nMR. SPICER: Well, I mean, I think we addressed this during the debate. It's funny -- first we rushed it; and now we're not getting it done quick enough. No, but I'm saying -- I think he did make it a priority right away. We started working with Congress, and as soon as we can get them to 216 -- but that is part of the constitutional process that they get to do.\nAnd so we are working very diligently with them. I think we've had very productive conversations. There is a sense of optimism, I think, in terms of the direction. But as soon as Speaker Ryan and Leader McCarthy and Whip Scalise believe that they have this -- I know Chairman Walden has been doing a tremendous amount of work through his committee in particular to get there. And if we get to a point where we feel like they've got the votes, obviously we would be very excited to see a vote happen.\nJeremy.\nQ: Sean, can you characterize the extent of the White House's involvement in the budget negotiations up to this point? Has there been a recent flurry of activity, particularly from Director Mulvaney? And has the White House issued any --\nMR. SPICER: You're talking about the CR?\nQ: Yeah.\nMR. SPICER: FY17 OR '18?\nQ: The funding -- the budget showdown to avoid the government shutdown.\nMR. SPICER: Okay, that's FY17.\nQ: Yes. Sorry, I'm not a reporter from -- and as far as the border wall funding, is that something that the White House sees as a sticking point, and is that scuttling negotiations?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know that I'd say it's a sticking point; it's a priority. And I answered Major's question to the extent that I think I'm going to comment on this, that we've laid out our priorities and we're working with them, and I think we feel good about the direction that those conversations are going.\nEamon.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. These financial executive actions that the President is undertaking today, they set off a number of countdown clocks. You have the issue to study and conduct a report and there's the 100-day clause and all that. At the end of all of that, can you give us the President's specific vision for what he wants to do with Dodd-Frank? What's in his mind right now about where this is all going to end up, if he's sort of firing the starting gun today?\nMR. SPICER: I wish you would have asked that question of the Secretary of Treasury. So I will let his responses go. I'm not going to -- I'll do a little message discipline today. (Laughter.)\nKatherine.\nQ: Mick Mulvaney said that funding for the border wall is tied to this funding bill, this spending bill. Is this a hard line for the White House? And is there any funding bill without funding for the wall? And then, secondly, on a different topic, you said there were ongoing developments with regard to the DREAMer who was deported. Do you have any updates you can share on that?\nMR. SPICER: I think that DHS is the best -- when I said -- my point then and my point continues to be I think there is some question about how everything played out, whether -- in this particular case, my understanding is he may -- when he was stopped and when he wasn't. Those questions are all best directed to towards the Department of Homeland Security in terms of the exact nature of -- or the circumstances surrounding that. So I would continue to direct you there.\nQ: And the first?\nMR. SPICER: Oh, the first part. I just think --\nQ: Is there a bill without funding for the wall.\nMR. SPICER: Well, I'm not going to -- I mean, obviously, Director Mulvaney is negotiating with the House and the Senate. We've made very clear that border wall funding is a priority.\nQ: I have a follow-up on Hallie's question on healthcare. So when you're sitting there at the 100-day mark trying to judge the progress, will the President feel like he has delivered on his promise to repeal and replace Obamacare if he's tried to do it and it hasn't yet passed? Does he consider those attempts to be kind of check marks?\nMR. SPICER: No, he wants it done. He talked about this yesterday, and I think his comments yesterday should stand. He spoke very clearly that he wants to get it done, and his team is making progress. But I don't -- I mean, to Hallie's point, I just don't think -- we're not looking and saying we have to have it done. We want to get it done right, and we want to get it done so that it passes the House. And so Obamacare, I think it was -- and again, don't -- 17 months or something like that. And I think we're well on track. We've had an unbelievable 91 or 92 days I think right now, as we entered in, and we're looking forward to keeping that activity going for the American people.\nApril.\nQ: Sean, thank you. How did the President work with human rights organizations in reference to helping this aid worker come back home after three years?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know what NGOs, specifically. Like I said, I think this was handled primarily through diplomatic channels. I'd be glad that -- my understanding is that the national security team in particular was working through diplomatic channels to folks in the el-Sisi government, and then the President brought this up directly during that visit. I don't know the extent to which, either prior to in the past three years or in the last --\nQ: But since he's been in office.\nMR. SPICER: Since he's been in office, I'm not sure. I know most of this was directly tied to his staff and his actions.\nQ: And a follow-up, on another question on something, the topic that I've been asking about, on HBCUs. Bennett College is in need of $4.5 million by June of this year. The President has talked about bolstering or helping them. What can this administration do for Bennett College, as HBCUs are a priority for this administration?\nMR. SPICER: I got to be honest with you, I don't know the exact nature of their financial situation, and so -- I really don't. I would -- I think maybe the Department of Education would be a better source for that. But I don't know specific universities' funding situations, and so, sorry, I can't.\nQ: I understand. And I appreciate you saying that. But when it comes to this and this is being a priority for HBCUs -- is it beyond the realm of possibility that the Department of Education would ask for emergency funding, specifically --\nMR. SPICER: Again, April, I'm just not well-versed in terms of the exact nature of a particular university's funding and what the requirements would be and how that process works. So I think it's probably a question much better asked to the Department of Education.\nAndrew.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Two questions. First, Buzzfeed is reporting that the Trump administration is expected to appoint a new special envoy to communicate directly with Vladislav Surkov, a top aide to Russian President Putin, once known as the Kremlin's \"Grey Cardinal.\"\nMR. SPICER: I don't have anything on that for you.\nQ: And the second question -- there are reports that the Justice Department is going to pursue charges against Julian Assange. Will the Justice Department also be considering charges against, or requesting extradition of Edward Snowden?\nMR. SPICER: We won't comment on ongoing investigations. However, I think it's been pretty clear that the Department of Justice will prosecute any violations of federal law when it comes to our national security.\nKaitlan.\nQ: The President tweeted that he thinks the terrorist attack -- or the assumed terrorist attack in Paris yesterday will have an effect on the outcome of the election. What effect does he think it's going to have?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know. I mean, I think major events have, clearly, effects on voters' attitudes, but I'm not going to weigh in on -- I'll let the voters of France decide this Sunday what direction they want their country to go in.\nJohn.\nQ: Just on Russia, Sean -- thanks. Four times in four days, Russian military jets have flown very close to Alaskan airspace. Does this concern the President? Can you comment on their actions over the last few days?\nMR. SPICER: We're obviously -- we're aware of it. But we conduct -- this is not highly unusual, nor do we -- I mean, we conduct military operations in international space. And as long as those are conducted in accordance with international protocols and rules, then that's obviously -- but we monitor everything. And any further comment on that I would refer to the Department of Defense.\nQ: Hey, Sean, back on the DOJ thing.\nMR. SPICER: Hold on, give me one second. Let me go to Abby.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Two quick questions -- or maybe more. On the Egyptian prisoner, do you guys have any sense of what made the difference this time around? The Obama administration tried for some time to free her. What was it that you all were able to do that they weren't that resulted in her being here today?\nMR. SPICER: I would much rather take that question offline. I think the President and his team worked behind the scenes -- I would just leave it at this: I think that the President and the team worked behind the scenes in a much more productive way, maybe. One could look at the tactic that was done to achieve the result. And I think, at the end of the day, we're just pleased that she's back home. And I think it will be for others to look at the different strategies to see why the President was successful and others may not have over a much longer period of time.\nMajor. I'm sorry, I told John, and then I'll --\nQ: Well, here, let Major follow, and then --\nQ: Just really quickly related to that. Because President el-Sisi has always said that it would be up to the judicial process in Egypt to render a judgment on this case and that he had really nothing that he could do through his presidential powers to change the status of --\nMR. SPICER: Yeah, and that's why --\nQ: -- and so what you're leaving us with the impression is that the President intervened, that el-Sisi intervened, and that something outside the judicial process made this happen in ways that didn't occur before. Is that a fair reading of this?\nMR. SPICER: All I'm going to say is that we are obviously pleased that she is back home and that the President and the team successfully worked to have her -- to bring her back home. I understand the question. I'm just saying --\nQ: I'm just going with what President el-Sisi said.\nMR. SPICER: I understand that. And I'm just telling you that, as this point, all I'm comfortable in saying is that we're pleased that she has returned home.\nJohn.\nQ: Back on the question of Snowden, but particularly on Assange, would you wave us off the idea that charges are being prepared against Assange?\nMR. SPICER: No, I would wave you -- I would just -- as I said, I mean, we don't comment on ongoing investigations. But I this the department's view has always been that they would prosecute violations of federal law when it comes to our national security.\nQ: Does anybody believe that there's been a violation of law when it comes to Assange?\nMR. SPICER: I think that's better directed towards the Department of Justice.\nAnita.\nQ: Hi. USA Today is reporting that the administration is ending its temporary protected status for Haitians that are here in the country and allows them to be in the United States when there's been natural disasters. It was outlined in a letter from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Can you confirm that and talk to us about it? And before you send me to DHS, they will not say anything. (Laughter.)\nMR. SPICER: Okay, well, then I'm going to refer you to DHS until they have something to say. I don't have anything further for you on this.\nSo thank you very much. Have a good weekend, guys.\nEND 11:50 A.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2017-04-21", "title": "Off-Camera Press Gaggle by Press Secretary Sean Spicer"}

SPICER: I just want to go over -- first of all, happy Friday. I want to go over the ground rules, which we adjusted some after a lot of feedback from you guys. So I appreciate the feedback.\nSo, first, we're passing out some background material so you can reference them during the briefing, which is something that was suggested by several members in this room that it would be helpful when do background briefings. So there you go.\nSecretary Mnuchin is going to speak on the record, as several of you have requested. And this part of the briefing is going to be embargoed until 12:30 p.m. to give you guys to write the stories, which was a request that some folks also made. So I think you went three for three on the requests. When Secretary Mnuchin is done speaking he'll take some questions. He's obviously here to talk about the executive order and memoranda that are being signed later today at Treasury. When he's done, he'll take some questions, and then I'll get up and kind of have some fun with you guys -- see who else stops by.\nSo, with that, as long as everyone is clear on the ground rules -- the Secretary is going to come up, he is on the record, embargoed until 12:30 p.m. He will take questions; they will also be embargoed until 12:30 p.m. When the Secretary is done, we will clearly transition back to me. That is then on the record and no embargo.\nWith that, I am pleased to welcome the Secretary of the Treasury, Steven Mnuchin.\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Thank you. It's a pleasure to be here. So let me just say a couple of words and then I'm happy to answer questions and clarifications.\nSo, first of all, this will be the President's first trip to the Treasury, so we are enormously excited to welcome him at the Treasury. I will say the importance of the Treasury and the location of it on the White House campus is very important and allows constant communication and ease for us to go back and forth. I think it was not coincidental that it was built next door.\nSo we are thrilled to welcome him. There will be a lot of people there outside to greet him, and he will then be coming up, seeing the line of portraits of past Treasury Secretaries, and then coming into my office and signing the executive order and the two memoranda -- with Alexander Hamilton looking over us.\nSo with that, I think you know we have been busy since he signed the initial executive order on core principles, looking at financial reform. It encompasses all the aspects of Dodd-Frank, but goes much further than Dodd-Frank. We've already conducted a large number of meetings -- I think we've had over 16 group meetings, and in many of these meetings there's 50 people in each meeting or more. So we've been conducting a lot of feedback overall on regulatory reform.\nThese three are specifically designed to focus on certain aspects that are enormously important to the Treasury and to the President, and that fill in with his campaign promise to make sure that Dodd-Frank is not harming our financial system. But first let me just comment on the tax executive order.\nUnder the previous administration, the tax code has become extremely expensive and burdensome. Individuals and business spend over 6.1 billion hours; the cost is over $230 billion. The basic 1040 has grown enormously. And I think everybody would agree that the tax system is way too complicated and burdensome.\nSo the purpose of this is that the President will be instructing us to review all significant tax regulations since the beginning of 2016, so all of 2016 and this year, and to look at where there are undue financial burdens, unnecessary complexity and requirements, and for us to issue a report that goes through what the issues are and comes up with solutions by repealing or modifying them. That's the first part of this.\nThe second part of it is two memoranda that review very specifically two important parts of Dodd-Frank. The first is OLA -- orderly liquidation authority. We will do an analysis to make sure that this doesn't encourage excess risk-taking, moral hazard and exposure to taxpayers. And while that period -- he will direct us not to use OLA unless required by law, in consultation with him. So in the event that there is a significant emergency and we do need to use it, we have a way of doing it.\nThe second one will be to put a 180-day review on FSOC designation, and I distinguish -- FSOC is a very important council that I chair. I think the most important part of FSOC is that I can bring the regulators together, get everybody in a room, be able to address important part of regulation. FSOC also has the responsibility to designate certain entities, and the President will be instructing me to put a hold on that for designations until we do a thorough review and make sure it's a fair and transparent process.\nSo with that little overview, I'm happy to answer any questions.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, do you feel that these policies will help to get rid of Too Big to Fail, or at least take a look at -- several conservatives have argued that Dodd-Frank has codified Too Big to Fail. And second, Chairman Jeb Hensarling, in the House Financial Services Committee, this week introduced a Dodd-Frank bill. Are you working with him, and do you support that piece of legislation?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Well, let me just first comment -- we have been working closely with Chairman Hensarling. We have been in discussions about all different aspects of regulatory reform. It's obviously a complicated bill, so I won't go through the entire bill, but I will say we are supportive of him bringing forward this legislation and look forward to working with him and Congress on the specifics of it.\nIn regards to your other question, let me make it absolutely clear, President Trump is absolutely committed to make sure that taxpayers are not at risk for government bailouts of entities that are too big to fail.\nQ: It was clear to candidate Trump that the tax code was too complex long before he became President. And he said on the campaign trail, repeatedly, tax reform would be a top priority. He said it here as President. Where are you on that? You've made it pretty clear the August deadline is no longer realistic. How far away are you from putting together a tax reform package? And does this slow that process down -- this review?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Well, let me first comment, President Trump, who was originally candidate Trump, he understood how complicated tax administration reform was even before he became a candidate. Tax reform is way too complicated. We said during the campaign, and we've said now, we will be working with Congress on a comprehensive tax reform package with the idea to simplify personal taxes, create middle-income tax cuts, and make business taxes more competitive.\nI want to first focus on the specifics of what we're doing today. I did comment yesterday -- I wanted to make sure there is no misunderstanding that we have been working extensively -- from the day I had been confirmed, I've been having meetings with the leadership in the House and the Senate on tax reform. Our staff has been meeting every week. I've been meeting with Chairman Brady every week for the last month or two. And what I said yesterday is we are very close to coming with the administration's plan. So the President is very focused on this. It has been one of his biggest priorities to create economic growth, and we are very focused on that.\nBut I will ask just to hold questions on tax reform for the moment so that we can finish specifics of these.\nYes.\nQ: Secretary, just reading through here, what are some specific actions available to you to ease these tax compliance burdens?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Well, there's -- I mean, just to be clear, what we're going to do is we are going to go through and look at every single significant regulation that has been done in the last year-and-a-half. We're going to determine whether we think they're needed in the tax code or whether they're unnecessary, and the tax burden and complexity is too much. And if we think it's too much, we will make a recommendation to the President how to change that.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, in Congress it seems like in the Senate they want to do GSE reform before Dodd-Frank reform. Is that order you would support? And what do you think is the biggest holdup to getting a GSE deal?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Okay, well, I'm not going to comment on the Senate's priority. I defer to them on that. But I will say, and I've said this from the time period in the campaign and from the minute I was nominated for this position, that housing reform is very important to this administration; that this is not something we're focused on in terms of legislation in the first half of this year, but again, we've been having significant discussions at Treasury with the FHFA, with congressional leadership on this. And we are committed to working with the House and the Senate on having a reform package that makes sure that we promote necessary liquidity in the housing markets. These are very important to the economy and we want to make sure in no way do we not have that, but also making sure that we don't put taxpayers at risk and leave these entities as they are.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, thank you. ExxonMobil has requested --\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: I'm really -- I'm going to ask people first to focus on -- if I could just ask everybody for questions on this, and then at the end perhaps I can answer a few more questions.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, for those who have just a general understanding that the regulations are tied to underlying law, could you explain why the review is necessary if simultaneously you're working on a tax reform law? In other words, aren't you expending a lot of effort to do something that would be overtaken if the President is proposing new law?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Not necessarily. I mean, first of all, these are regulations that exist today. And just to be clear, although the report takes a period of time, that doesn't mean that we can't start on the more important things right away.\nSo I think the issue here is this has to do with the complexity of tax regulations. Some of those issues may be addressed in tax reform. Some of those things have nothing to do with tax reform, and the President wants to make clear to the American people that we are going to fix the tax code.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, you're not commenting on any specific regulations, but some of the most significant tax regulations adopted in this time period are the corporate inversions. Is that what this is really targeted at?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Again, it's not targeted at just those, it's targeted at things that are significant and create complexity and undue burdensome situations.\nQ: It's certainly one of the things this would be looking at.\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Again, it's obviously one of the significant things and one of the things we would be looking at.\nQ: Just on OLA, do you believe that bankruptcy judges are better equipped to deal with financial contagion risk than regulators?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Let me say that obviously this is a complicated issue. The bankruptcy code right now doesn't work, so if entities were going to go through bankruptcy I think it's important that we have necessary changes to the bankruptcy code. But on the other hand, there is a reason why we have the bankruptcy code. So this is something we'll be looking at very carefully as to what the right solution is.\nQ: And then just to follow up --\nQ: Do you have any -- back to the tax inversions. I mean, --\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Wait a second, tax inversions aren't on this. That --\nQ: Well, it's part of the issue of tax review. Does your staff have any kind of idea of what it would look like if it's determined that that portion of the tax review was overreaching by the Obama administration or violated the law in some way?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Again, let me just say we've got 100 people in the tax department at Treasury right across the street, and they are busy to work at everything.\nSo -- in the back.\nQ: Would you have done these reviews without executive presidential order? What was the purpose specifically of the orders?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Again, I think the purposes of the orders are to make clear what the President and the administration's priorities are and to signify the importance of these issues to the American people.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, it seems to me that when you're looking at reviewing the rules regarding inversions, that if you were to roll those back and not get your corporate tax cuts, your tax reform, that you might just start the exodus of companies all over again by removing these rules. I know that you're just beginning the review here, but is that part of the calculation? Is that part of the discussion here -- that these two things would really have to go hand in hand or we could be right back where we were?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Well, let me just say a general comment -- as I like to say, there were a lot of things coming to this job that I knew a lot about and there are certain things that I had to learn a bit about. So on my first day in office, Sean was kind enough to invite me over here and I had the pleasure of dealing with the Venezuelan vice president and the Kingpin Act.\nI can assure you on tax reform, this is an area that I've spent a lot of time on. This is an area that the President and I have worked together during the campaign on. This is not just something we've started thinking about.\nThe priorities are making U.S. business more competitive. And we're not going to do anything under this administration that inadvertently makes U.S. business less competitive or encourages U.S. business to go abroad. We are focused on making U.S. business the most competitive in the world, giving them the tools, and bringing back trillions of dollars.\nAnd I can tell you, between the President and I, we've literally met with hundreds and hundreds of businesspeople, listening to ideas -- small business leaders, big business leaders. This administration is open to getting feedback, real-live feedback before we make decisions.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, a related subject -- on a related subject. Exxon -- on the same subject --\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: I'm going to finish these comments. I have another few minutes.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke has written that repealing Title 2 to eliminate the OLA would be a major mistake, in his view, and it would imprudently put the economy and the financial system at risk. Do you envision ultimately repealing Title 2 and eliminating OLA? Or is there some middle ground you see where you're going to end up after this review is complete?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Well, we're going to do the review and conclude what we think makes sense. And I would just say -- nothing against him, I have a lot of respect for him -- again, we're listening to regulators' views; we're listening to people who were previously in the administration; we're listening to people who were impacted by this and we'll be taking that all into account.\nQ: Going into the review, can you give us a sense of what you think --\nQ: Thank you very much, sir. India's financial minister here in the World Bank in meetings, and this will be your first meeting with him under this new Trump relationship. So what is the future of U.S.-India trade and financial and economic relations, sir?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Well, let me say, kind of -- I broke out from the IMF meetings to come here today. I think I had a series of eight bilaterals yesterday. I think I've done four this morning, have a full day tomorrow and the rest of this afternoon. And that's one of them that I look forward -- we've had very constructive discussions with all our counterparts about trade and investment and opportunities for global growth, and I look forward to working with all my counterparts in the G20.\nSo thank you all very much. Appreciate it. Thank you, Sean.\nQ: And then you were going to answer questions after --\nQ: Sorry, sir --\nQ: You said you were going to answer some tax questions when you were done.\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Well, I'll take one more tax question from you, but then I have to go to IMF meetings. So what was your tax question?\nQ: Anyone else --\nQ: Sir, on Exxon --\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Tax question.\nQ: The President has talked a lot about preventing U.S. companies from moving overseas. That is different from moving profit overseas. And I just want to know where do you think -- where do you land on that? Is it okay for U.S. companies to move profit overseas? Or are you more focused on the jobs side?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Well, let me be clear, we're focused on everything. So we want trillions of dollars to come back onshore, to be re-invested. And we expect that that will be a major part of tax reform. And we are committed, through trade policies, tax policies, economic discussions, to make sure that we have free and fair bilateral trade that works in both directions.\nQ: Sir, on the Exxon, one thing -- request your permission to deal in the Black Sea region. When can the decision be expected?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Can't comment on that right now, but -- that's not something I can comment specifically on at the moment.\nQ: -- on the difficulty of doing tax reform, if you're not able to get this healthcare repeal through? There's a lot of savings that were expected from healthcare repeal.\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: I think, as you know, the President wants to get healthcare done and he wants to get tax done. And hopefully we'll get them both done, but we're going to get tax done.\nThank you very much.\nQ: Is there a timeline for that now? A new timeline?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: As I said yesterday -- soon.

For too long, American workers were forgotten by their government, and I mean totally forgotten. Their interests were pushed aside for global projects, and their wealth was taken from their communities and shipped across the world, all across the seas.\nMy administration has offered a new vision. The well-being of the American citizen and worker will be placed second to none, and, boy, do I mean second to none. Since day one, I have been fighting for the hard-working people of this country, and this week, we took historic action to continue delivering on that promise.\nWe did so in one of the many proud industrial towns of our Nation—Kenosha, Wisconsin—with the men and women of Snap-On, who make American tools for workers around the world. They were there, and they loved what they heard, and they loved what they saw.\nIn Wisconsin, I signed an Executive order to buy American and hire American. I took historic action to ensure that Federal projects are made with American goods and to keep American workers and companies from being cheated out of contracts by countries that break the rules and break every regulation in the book to take advantage of the United States. That's not going to happen anymore.\nI also took action to reform our immigration system so that it puts the needs of American workers first. The duty of Government is to represent the citizens of the United States, and that is what we will do. Whether it's removing job-killing regulations, protecting our borders, or unleashing American energy, we are keeping our promises and delivering for the American worker.\nDuring my visit, I talked about how America is a nation that honors work. We honor grit. We honor craftsmanship. We honor the skilled tradespeople who turn rock and steel and iron and cement into works of art and grace and beauty. There's tremendous talent there, believe me.\nThe wrench and ratchet are not only tools, but instruments that help build cities out of deserts and send ships across the ocean. And the tools of craftsmen and the masons are just as important as the tools of the doctor and the dentist or the CEO or even the tools of politicians—believe it or not—and their work is every bit as noble. They take pride in their jobs, and we take pride in them. No longer will the concerns of these hard-working Americans go unanswered.\nBy making government answer to our citizens, we are removing the limits on our future and setting free the dreams of our people. As long as we do this, optimism will continue to soar, hope will continue to spring, and this country we love will grow stronger and stronger day by day.\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless America.", "timestamp": "2017-04-21", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}

Tenney.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123793", "text": "The President. Thank you very much, Steve. Great honor, I must say. It's a great pleasure to be at the United States Treasury Department and to meet so many dedicated public servants. I went through that beautiful hallway where those incredible paintings of past secretaries, and it was really very interesting. I want to read every one, I want to learn about every one of them, but we have one that I hope will go down as one of the greats. I think Hamilton is tough to beat, but maybe you can do that too.\nSecretary of the Treasury Steven T. Mnuchin. Thank you.\nThe President. We'll take it, right? But thank you very much.\nThe Treasury Department is the guardian of America's wealth and a worldwide symbol of American prestige. This department was first led by the same gentleman, Alexander Hamilton, a man who understood that the Government must protect the jobs of its citizens and the wealth of our Nation.\nSecretary Mnuchin, who I have known for so long, and he's so good and so smart and so financially adept, is working very hard every day to do just that: to protect the working citizen of America, and to safeguard our finances from anyone, anybody, any nation who would try to take advantage of the United States. His vast experience and financial talent are now being put into service on behalf of the American people. And you'll see what I mean very soon.\nWe have taken unprecedented action to bring back our jobs and return power to our citizens. It's been taken away. We've lifted one terrible regulation after another at a record clip, from the energy sector to the auto sector. And we have many more to go, and that's going to be happening over the next, I would say, 4 to 5 weeks. And we've begun a historic effort to protect our manufacturing and our manufacturing businesses, companies, and our workers from unfair foreign trade.\nProtecting our Treasury also means getting other countries to finally pay their fair share for the cost of defense, and many other global projects that for too long have fallen under our guidance and, unfortunately, fallen under the United States taxpayer expense. And we're going to end that; we're going to end it quickly. We want fairness. We don't want to take advantage of anyone. We want fairness.\nWe're now in the process of rebuilding America, and there's a new optimism sweeping across our country like people have not seen in many, many decades. We're here today to continue this great economic revival. I will be signing three Presidential directives to further protect our workers and our taxpayers.\nThe first executive action instructs Secretary Mnuchin to begin the process of tax simplification. Such a big thing. People can't do their returns. They have no idea what they're doing. They're too complicated. This regulatory reduction is the first step toward a tax reform that reduces rates, provides relief to our middle class, and lowers our business tax, which is one of the highest in the world and has stopped us from so much wealth and productivity. Secretary Mnuchin is a leader in our effort to make America competitive again. We're going to make it great again, we're going to make it strong again, we're going to make it safe again, and we're going to make it competitive again. I'm also issuing two directives that instruct Secretary Mnuchin to review the damaging Dodd-Frank regulations that failed to hold Wall Street firms accountable. I mean, they've done really, in many cases, the opposite of what they were supposed to. These regulations enshrine \"too big to fail\" and encourage risky behavior.\nWe're taking steps to make our economy more fair and prosperous for all. As part of our broader financial strategy, we're working to open up lending to small businesses and entrepreneurs, including our incredible women entrepreneurs who are doing better and better and better. We want opportunity for everyone and in every single part of our country.\nSecretary Mnuchin and my entire administration are working around the clock to help struggling Americans achieve their financial dreams, earn a great paycheck, have a job that they love going to every single day, and have real confidence in the future. Together, we will restore prosperity to this Nation, a nation that we so dearly love, and to bring people—who call this home—into a great, great way of living and a great way of life. They're going to be thrilled. We're going to be thrilled.\nAnd you're going to be seeing some very, very major changes. You've already seen them. I don't know if anybody has looked recently, but, you looked at optimism indexes that are just coming out, manufacturing in particular, where it's up to the highest point it's ever been—93 percent—it was a 27 percent increase over the past, over the last one.\nSo I just want to thank everybody for being here. This is such a privilege for me to sign. This is really the beginning of a whole new way of life that this country hasn't seen in really many, many years. I want to thank you, and I want to God bless America. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Okay.\nSo this is identifying and reducing tax regulatory burdens. That covers a lot of territory, believe me. [Laughter]\n[At this point, the President signed an Executive order titled \"Identifying and Reducing Tax Regulatory Burdens\" and gave the pen to Sen. David A. Perdue, Jr.]\nSenator how about you get the first one? Can you handle that?\nSen. Perdue. I think I'll give it to the Congresswoman.\nThe President. Okay.\nRepresentative Claudia Tenney. It's for my son.\nSen. Perdue. It's for her son.\nThe President. Oh, that's even better. I like that.\nRep. Tenney. Thank you so much.\nThe President. Thank you. He's a great boy.\nThis is the subject of financial stability, the Oversight Council. Very important.\n[The President signed a memorandum on the Financial Stability Oversight Council and gave the pen to Sen. Perdue.]\nOkay, this one is for you. Sen. Perdue. Thank you.\nThe President. Okay, thank you. This is Orderly Liquidation Authority. Doesn't sound like much, but it is. [Laughter] That's a biggie. It doesn't sound good, but it is.\nRep. Tenney. That's right, we're in financial services.\nThe President. That's right.\nRep. Tenney.

Policy. The Federal tax system should be simple, fair, efficient, and pro-growth. The purposes of tax regulations should be to bring clarity to the already complex Internal Revenue Code (title 26, United States Code) and to provide useful guidance to taxpayers. Contrary to these purposes, numerous tax regulations issued over the last several years have effectively increased tax burdens, impeded economic growth, and saddled American businesses with onerous fines, complicated forms, and frustration. Immediate action is necessary to reduce the burden existing tax regulations impose on American taxpayers and thereby to provide tax relief and useful, simplified tax guidance.\nSec. 2. Addressing Tax Regulatory Burdens. (a) In furtherance of the policy described in section 1 of this order, the Secretary of the Treasury (Secretary) shall immediately review all significant tax regulations issued by the Department of the Treasury on or after January 1, 2016, and, in consultation with the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, identify in an interim report to the President all such regulations that:\n(i) impose an undue financial burden on United States taxpayers;\n(ii) add undue complexity to the Federal tax laws; or\n(iii) exceed the statutory authority of the Internal Revenue Service.\nThis interim report shall be completed no later than 60 days from the date of this order. In conducting the review required by this subsection, earlier determinations of whether a regulation is significant pursuant to Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993, as amended (Regulatory Planning and Review), shall not be controlling.\n(b) No later than 150 days from the date of this order, the Secretary shall prepare and submit a report to the President that recommends specific actions to mitigate the burden imposed by regulations identified in the interim report required under subsection (a) of this section. The Secretary shall also publish this report in the Federal Register upon submitting it to the President. The Secretary shall take appropriate steps to cause the effective date of such regulations to be delayed or suspended, to the extent permitted by law, and to modify or rescind such regulations as appropriate and consistent with law, including, if necessary, through notice and comment rulemaking. The Secretary shall submit for publication in the Federal Register a summary of the actions taken in response to the report no later than 10 days following the finalization of such actions. Should all such actions not be finalized within 180 days following the submission of the report to the President, the Secretary shall submit for publication in the Federal Register an initial report summarizing the actions taken to that point.\n(c) To ensure that future tax regulations adhere to the policy described in section 1 of this order, the Secretary and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall review and, if appropriate, reconsider the scope and implementation of the existing exemption for certain tax regulations from the review process set forth in Executive Order 12866 and any successor order.\n(d) The Secretary shall cause section 32.1.5.4.7.5.3 of the Internal Revenue Manual to be revised, if necessary to fulfill the directives in subsection (c) of this section.\nSec. 3. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nDONALD J.

If the FSOC makes such a determination, the affected nonbank financial company shall be subject to supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board) and certain prudential standards. The Dodd-Frank Act similarly authorizes the FSOC to designate certain financial market utilities and financial activities as \"systemically important,\" and thus subject to certain risk management standards, among other things. These determinations and designations have serious implications for affected entities, the industries in which they operate, and the economy at large. Therefore, it is important to ensure that these processes for making determinations and designations promote market discipline and reduce systemic risk. It is equally important to ensure that, once notified by FSOC that it is under review, any entity under consideration for a determination or designation decision is afforded due, fair, and appropriately transparent process.\nAccordingly, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and to promote certainty in the financial markets, I hereby direct the Secretary of the Treasury (Secretary) to take the following actions:\nSection 1. Report on FSOC Processes. The Secretary shall conduct a thorough review of the FSOC determination and designation processes under section 113 (12 U.S.C. 5323) and section 804 (12 U.S.C. 5463) of the Dodd-Frank Act and provide a written report to the President within 180 days of the date of this memorandum. As part of this review, and along with any other considerations that the Secretary deems appropriate, the Secretary shall consider the following:\n(a) whether these processes are sufficiently transparent;\n(b) whether these processes provide entities with adequate due process;\n(c) whether these processes give market participants the expectation that the Federal Government will shield supervised or designated entities from bankruptcy;\n(d) whether evaluation of a nonbank financial company's vulnerability to material financial distress, under 12 CFR 1310 App. A.II.d.1, should assess the likelihood of such distress;\n(e) whether any determination as to whether a nonbank financial company's material financial distress could threaten the financial stability of the United States, under 12 CFR 1310 App. A.II.a, should include specific, quantifiable projections of the damage that could be caused to the United States economy, including a specific quantification of estimated losses that would be likely if the company is not subjected to supervision under section 113; (f) whether these processes adequately consider the costs of any determination or designation on the regulated entity;\n(g) whether entities subject to an FSOC determination under section 113 or designation under section 804 are provided a meaningful opportunity to have their determinations or designations reevaluated in a timely and appropriately transparent manner; and\n(h) whether, prior to being subject to an FSOC determination under section 113 or designation under section 804, the entity should be provided with information on how to reduce perceived risk, so as to avoid being subject to such determination or designation.\nAs part of this review, the Secretary shall include in the required report: the Secretary's conclusions regarding the issues enumerated above; recommendations, as appropriate, on how the FSOC processes for determinations under section 113 and designations under section 804 could be improved; and recommendations for any legislative changes necessary to improve these processes.\nSec. 2. Evaluation and Review of the FSOC. The Secretary shall also evaluate and report to the President on whether the activities of the FSOC related to the determination and designation processes under section 113 and section 804, respectively, are consistent with Executive Order 13772 of February 3, 2017 (Core Principles for Regulating the United States Financial System). In the report, the Secretary should provide, if appropriate, recommendations for legislation or regulations that would ensure that the FSOC and its activities are consistent with the principles set forth in Executive Order 13772.\nSec. 3. Temporary Pause of Determinations and Designations. Pending the completion of this review and submission of the Secretary's recommendations, the Secretary shall, to the extent consistent with law, not vote for any non-emergency proposed determinations under 12 CFR 1310.10(b) or any non-emergency proposed designations under 12 CFR 1320.13(c).\nSec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nDONALD J.

Using OLA, the Secretary of the Treasury (Secretary) may place a financial company in receivership and initiate liquidation after making a determination, in consultation with the President, that it is in default or in danger of default and its failure and resolution under otherwise applicable law would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the United States, among other considerations. Further, under section 203(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act, 12 U.S.C. 5383(b), OLA shall not be invoked unless and until the Secretary determines, in consultation with the President, that use of OLA would \"avoid or mitigate\" adverse effects on financial stability in the United States, \"taking into consideration the effectiveness of the action in mitigating\" those potential effects, \"the cost to the general fund of the Treasury,\" and \"the potential to increase excessive risk taking on the part of creditors, counterparties, and shareholders in the financial company.\" In addition, section 214(c) of the Dodd-Frank Act, 12 U.S.C. 5394(c), requires that taxpayers shall \"bear no losses from the exercise of\" OLA.\nThe existence of OLA, however, may encourage excessive risk taking by creditors, counterparties, and shareholders of financial companies, because section 210(n) of the Dodd-Frank Act, 12 U.S.C. 5390(n), also created an Orderly Liquidation Fund (OLF) in the Treasury of the United States that is authorized to use taxpayer funds to carry out OLA liquidations. While any losses incurred from the use of the OLF are ultimately supposed to be covered by assessments on other financial companies, taxpayer money may always be at risk. To the extent that OLA provides a Government backstop that shields creditors, counterparties, and shareholders from losses by shifting their losses to the financial sector as a whole, it may reduce market discipline and increase excessive risk taking. Thus, it is critical to understand OLA's full contours and acknowledge the potentially adverse consequences of its availability and use. If OLA's availability creates a significant risk-taking incentive, for example, the Secretary may be unable to make determinations justifying its use, as required by section 203(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act.\nAdditionally, it is important to evaluate the extent to which other legislative solutions, such as changes to title 11 of the United States Code (the \"U.S. Bankruptcy Code\"), could fulfill OLA's policy objectives in a more effective manner.\nAccordingly, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to promote certainty in the financial markets, I hereby direct you to take the following actions:\nSection 1. Review of Orderly Liquidation Authority. (a) The Secretary shall conduct a thorough review of OLA and provide a report to the President within 180 days of the date of this memorandum. The review shall consider:\n(i) the potential adverse effects of failing financial companies on the financial stability of the United States; (ii) whether the framework for using OLA is consistent with the principles set out in sections 1(b) and 1(c) of Executive Order 13772 of February 3, 2017 (Core Principles for Regulating the United States Financial System);\n(iii) whether invoking OLA could result in a cost to the general fund of the Treasury;\n(iv) whether the availability or use of OLA leads or could lead to excessive risk taking on the part of creditors, counterparties, and shareholders, or otherwise leads market participants to believe that a financial company is \"too big to fail\"; and\n(v) whether a new chapter in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, in which the claims against a failed financial company would be resolved pursuant to the procedures of bankruptcy law rather than the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, would be a superior method of resolution for financial companies.\n(b) The review shall include, where applicable and feasible, a quantitative assessment of OLA's anticipated direct and indirect effects.\n(c) The report shall provide recommendations for improvement, including any recommended legislative changes.\nSec. 2. Exercise of Orderly Liquidation Authority. Pending the completion of the review and submission of the recommendations required by section 1 of this memorandum, the Secretary shall, to the extent consistent with law, refrain from making any determination under section 203(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act unless the Secretary determines, in consultation with the President, that the criteria enumerated in section 203(b) require otherwise.\nSec. 3. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nDONALD J.

Our volunteers are often unsung and unseen, but they are heroes.\nOne of our Nation's greatest strengths has always been our citizens' unique commitment to improving the lives of others. The principles of charitable compassion and philanthropic collaboration were at the heart of our Founding Fathers' efforts to build a culture that serves the greater good. From our earliest days, Americans have answered the call to help those in need—at home and around the world. This service, fundamental to our Nation's character, is renewed each day by citizens who generously give their time and talents to help others.\nOur Nation's commitment to civic engagement continues to thrive. American volunteers keep students on track for graduation, care for seniors and veterans, and rebuild communities after terrible storms. Beyond our borders, our volunteers often place their lives at risk as they help those affected by war, poverty, and disease.\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, more than 60 million Americans volunteered in 2015, giving an estimated $185 billion in service to their communities. The latest data shows that our Nation's seniors lead the way in time spent volunteering, and we are immensely thankful for their commitment. Our busy adults aged 35 to 54 volunteer at the highest rates, and our communities depend on their continued involvement. Our Nation continues to build a culture of service—the volunteer rate among our teenagers has steadily climbed over the past several years.\nThis week we pay tribute to the extraordinary faith-based, nonprofit, national service, service club, military service, and community organizations that provide volunteers with opportunities to serve. These organizations engage and connect Americans from every walk of life. Through the generosity of our citizens, we are reminded that each one of us has a role to play in improving our communities. During the recent International Week of Service, service organizations across the globe came together to assist others and make an impact. This effort is a shining example of how our Nation's generous volunteers continue to lead the world in helping those most in need.\nNow, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 23 through April 29, 2017, as National Volunteer Week. I call upon all Americans to observe this week by volunteering in service projects across our country and pledging to make service a part of their daily lives.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nDONALD J.

This is the earliest visit to Australia of any Vice President in a new administration. And your commitment to our alliance, your commitment to the region, the commitment of the Trump administration to the security and the stability, the maintenance of the rule of law in our region, in the Indo-Pacific is one that we welcome. We are delighted that you're here.\nAnd it's been great, too, we discussed earlier for Lucy and I to welcome you and Karen and your daughters with our family -- or many of them, two out of our three grandchildren. And as we observed earlier, your Karen was showing great ability in nursing Baby Alice. So that all augurs well.\nSo we've had a very productive discussion this morning. We have the strongest and the closest ties between our two nations at every level. And the Vice President's visit is an opportunity for both our nations emphatically to reaffirm those ties and our deep commitment to the alliance.\nThe alliance is as important today as it was more than 60 years ago, indeed, as it has been for the 99 years that -- since Australian and American troops went into battle together. It will be 100 years from the Battle of Hamel in 2018.\nAnd through all of that time, the people of the United States understand that they have no stronger, no more committed, no more loyal partner, ally than Australia -- in every major conflict for 99 years, we have stood side-by-side in freedom's cause.\nAnd this year is also the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea, when American and Australian naval forces turned back the Japanese invaders, and then went on to turn them back again and again and keep Australia and our region free.\nWe have stood side-by-side in freedom's cause through all those years, and today the brave men and women -- the Australian Defense Forces -- and their American allies and our partners are fighting together with the common goal of utterly destroying ISIS in the field in the Middle East. That is our commitment. In that theater of war and around the world, we are in absolute lockstep, totally united with a common purpose, and a resolute intent to destroy the threat of terrorism, and to destroy it in the field, and to combat it around the world -- whether at home or abroad. Our freedom depends on it. And we're committed to it.\nAnd again, today, as 99 years ago, as 75 years ago, in all of those conflicts, we have stood side-by-side because we are united by values, a commitment to freedom, democracy, and the rule of law. Our two great nations -- we share so much. But above all, we share -- and, Mr. Vice President, you know you come here on the eve of ANZAC Day where we honor the sacrifice of thousands of Australians -- over 100,000 Australians who've paid the supreme sacrifice to keep us free, and they have done that again and again, side-by-side in mateship -- an Australian term, but well understood across the Pacific, in mateship -- a hundred years of mateship side-by-side with our American allies.\nMr. Vice President, we also stand with you and with President Trump in condemning the behavior, the criminal, abhorrent use of chemical weapons in Syria by President Assad's regime. We welcomed and endorsed and supported the quick and calibrated and proportionate response of the United States in answer to that shocking crime.\nAnd here in our region, we have spent a lot of time this morning talking about the threat from North Korea. This reckless and dangerous regime puts the peace, the stability, the prosperity of our region at risk. And we endorse and, indeed, have echoed and made directly the calls to China to step up, to take responsibility. Because China has a leverage, an ability to influence North Korea that far exceeds any others -- with their economy, the North Korean economy is entirely dependent on China. So as I've said earlier this week, the eyes of the world are on Beijing, and we seek leadership from China to join the leadership shown by the United States and Japan and Australia and other nations around the world committed to peace; call on China to make that stronger commitment to ensure that North Korea stops this reckless and dangerous conduct.\nWe are very, very heartened by your visit, Mr. Vice President. The United States' commitment to our region has underpinned the prosperity of the last 40 years. We would not have seen the extraordinary lifting out of poverty of billions of people in our region had it not been for the peace and the stability, the Pax Americana, if you like, that has been delivered by that continuing American commitment.\nAnd your presence so early in the administration, and of the Secretary of State, and of the Defense Secretary, and as you've confirmed on your visit, the commitment of President Trump to attend the East Asia Summit, all of this sends a strong commitment, a strong message that the United States is committed to our region, committed to the peace and stability upon which so much depends in every nation.\nWe've also discussed matters economic. The United States is by some considerable margin Australia's largest source of foreign investment. And the United States is also the leading destination for Australian foreign investment. In 2015, Australian investment in the United States was worth $594 billion, representing almost double what it was in 2005; while the United States' investment in Australia has almost tripled since then and now represents about $860 billion.\nWe have a very successful free trade agreement. Bilateral trade has grown from $41 billion to $70 billion since the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement entered into force in that year, 2005. And the U.S. is Australia's second-largest trading partner.\nWe'll continue this close cooperation on trade and investment. And we had a very good discussion, too, about President Trump's commitment to reduce company tax and tax generally in the United States. We too recognize that reducing business taxes is vital to deliver stronger economic growth. Businesses that can retain more of their profits for investment will grow. They'll hire more employees. Investment, employment are driven by lower business taxes. And we applaud the commitment of President Trump to that, and we're grateful for your update on those plans.\nWe will continue to work more closely together in every field. The relationship is a very deep -- it's a very intimate one. It is carried by millions of Australians and Americans over a century and more. We have a shared destiny. We always have. We grow closer together, built on those ties, defense, common strategic goals, shared values, stronger economic relationship, and above all, those connections of family that extend across the Pacific. It's a close relationship. It's a family relationship. And our family gathering this morning underpin the nature of this very deep friendship, Mr. Vice President.\nSo I thank you very much for visiting Australia. We've had a very good meeting with the foreign minister this morning, following on her meetings with you in Washington. And you'll meet more of our ministers today, including the deputy prime minister and the trade minister. We have a very deep commitment to growing and strengthening this relationship so important to our region, so important to our world, so important for the security and the prosperity, the opportunity of both our peoples.\nWelcome, Mr. Vice President.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Prime Minister Turnbull, thank you so much for those gracious words, for the hospitality you have shown me and my family upon our arrival in Australia today. The warm welcome that you and the Australian people have given us is something that we will cherish for the rest of our lives.\nI am honored to be in Australia today to offer greetings from the President of the United States, President Donald Trump. And as I spoke to the President this morning, Mr. Prime Minister, he wanted me to offer his best wishes to you and his congratulations for your strong leadership of the Commonwealth.\nMr. Prime Minister, with the strong encouragement of your administration, only two days ago, as you mentioned, it was my privilege to announce that President Trump will attend the APEC Leaders Summit, the East Asia Summit, and the U.S.-ASEAN Summit in Vietnam and the Philippines this November.\nI trust that my visit here today -- on my very first trip to the Asia Pacific as Vice President of the United States -- and the President's plans to travel to this region this fall, are a strong sign of our enduring commitment to the historic alliance between the people of the United States of America and the people of Australia.\nAs I told Prime Minister Turnbull today, Australia is, and always will be, one of America's closest allies and truest friends.\nWe are partners in security, we are partners in prosperity, and together we are bound by our historic alliance. And under President Trump, I can assure you, that the United States is committed to strengthening our bond for the benefit of our people, and for the benefit of our world.\nThe relationship between our nations stretches back for generations, as the Prime Minister just said. From the Coral Sea to Kandahar, our friendship has been forged in the fires of sacrifice.\nVery humbling for me to say that only three days from now, on April 25th, Australia will commemorate ANZAC Day, to honor those brave Australians and New Zealanders who gave their lives in defense of freedom, oftentimes shoulder-to-shoulder with Americans.\nThe sons and daughters of both our lands have fought together in every major conflict for the past 100 years. From World Wars One and Two, to Korea, to Vietnam, and most recently, in the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, our grandparents, our parents, and now our children have served together and sacrificed together, and have defended our freedom and all that we hold dear. That represents the foundation of an unshakeable bond between America and Australia.\nEven now our citizens serve together, in Afghanistan and in the fight against ISIS. And around the world, we are deepening our defense collaboration, and as Prime Minister Turnbull and I discussed today, we will continue to deepen our defense and security collaboration in the days ahead.\nThe historic United States-Australia alliance is more vital than ever to regional security and prosperity. In recent years, we have dramatically stepped up our intelligence sharing, increased our emphasis on shared cyber capabilities, and we have conducted and will continue to conduct joint military exercises to ensure our readiness, including the Talisman Saber later this year.\nAs the Prime Minister and I discussed, together, our nations will continue to uphold a rules-based system that is the foundation of peace and prosperity in the Asia Pacific.\nIn the South China Sea and throughout the region, we will defend the fundamental freedoms of navigation and overflight, and ensure the unimpeded flow of lawful commerce, and promote peaceful diplomatic dialogue to address issues of regional and global concern.\nAnd as the Prime Minister and I just reaffirmed, under President Trump's leadership, and yours, the United States and Australia will continue to stand firm and stand strong to confront the most urgent and dangerous threat to peace and security in the Asia Pacific, the regime in North Korea.\nWhile all options are on the table, let me assure you, the United States will continue to work closely with Australia, our other allies in the region, and with China to bring economic and diplomatic pressure to bear on the regime in Pyongyang until they abandon their nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\nMr. Prime Minister, know that President Trump and I are truly grateful -- truly grateful -- to you for calling on China even this week to play an even more active and constructive role in addressing the North Korean threat.\nThe President and I have in his words great confidence that China will properly deal with North Korea. And I know you share that hope. But as President Trump made clear just a few days ago, if China is unable to deal with North Korea, the United States, and our allies, will.\nThe United States and Australia face this threat, and every other, together -- because we know that our security is the foundation of our prosperity. And today, Prime Minister Turnbull and I discussed ways for us to promote renewed prosperity for our people.\nWe are already building on a sturdy foundation. The U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement is a case study in success. And while we can still make additional progress, it's a model for what a mutually beneficial trade agreement can be.\nToday, the United States is far and away Australia's largest economic partner -- not just in the region, but all across the world. Our economic relationship is worth a stunning $1.5 trillion, and our two-way investment has grown by 50 percent in just the last three years alone.\nAnd we still have room to grow. Today, the Prime Minister and I discussed the need to break down barriers and encourage the kind of policies that will encourage even more trade and investment, more innovation and more opportunities for both our peoples.\nWe're confident that, working together, we'll build on our strong foundation in a way that will be beneficial to the people of America and the people of Australia.\nBeyond our commercial partnership, the President and I are confident that this historic alliance between the United States and Australia will grow even stronger in the years ahead. Nowhere is our enduring commitment to each other and to our shared future more evident than in the topic that the Prime Minister just addressed so eloquently and so passionately -- the global fight against terror.\nThe people of the United States will never forget that Australia invoked our ANZUS Security Treaty for the first and only time following the September 11th terrorist attacks, which claimed the lives of nearly 3,000 innocent people, including 11 Australians. The support that Australia showed America in our darkest hour will never be forgotten.\nAustralia, like the United States, has not been spared. The four-lone wolf terror attacks over the past 31 months were all inspired by this global cancer.\nThe people of Australia can rest assured: Under President Trump's leadership and under your capable leadership in Australia, we will not rest, we will not relent until, together, we drive this evil from the face of the Earth.\nAs I close, let me simply say it's an honor to be here on behalf of President Donald Trump to say simply from our hearts that the historic alliance between the United States and Australia is inviolate. It's immutable. And it's a beacon that shines throughout the Asia Pacific and inspires the wider world.\nOur shared history, our shared values bind us together, and as we look toward what lies ahead, it's always heartening to stand beside a friend, and I do so today.\nPrime Minister Turnbull, know that under President Donald Trump, the historic alliance between the United States and Australia will grow stronger, our people will grow closer, enhancing our security and our prosperity for generations to come.\nAnd so we go forward with faith -- with faith in our historic alliance, faith in our shared values, and faith that the best days for America and for Australia are yet to come.\nThank you, Mr. Prime Minister. It's an honor to be with you.\nPRIME MINISTER TURNBULL: Thank you, Mr. Vice President, for those eloquent words -- heartfelt, passionate, committed. Thank you so much.\nNow, we have some questions.\nQ: Very well said, Mr. Prime Minister. This question is actually for both of you, if I may, does Australia have an increased role to play in helping moderate the North Korea threat? If so, what is that role? And could it, indeed, be a military one down the track?\nPRIME MINISTER TURNBULL: Well, thank you. We work very closely with our ally -- our ally and our friends in the region. The global community is committed to the end of this reckless and dangerous conduct, and the challenge now is obviously for China because they have, as I've said, and this is not a political point, this is a statement of fact, China has the greatest leverage over North Korea. There is no question about that.\nSo I've made this point to Chinese leaders over a long period of time, in fact, before I was Prime Minister. It is self-evident that China has the opportunity and we say the responsibility to bring pressure to bear on North Korea to stop this reckless and dangerous trajectory upon which they are embarked.\nNow we will work closely with the United States as we always do. At this stage, the support that we are providing at the level of diplomacy and public diplomacy -- both public and private diplomacy is of critical importance. And we share the -- we are quietly confident I would say that China will step up to this challenge and responsibility.\nVice President.\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: For more than a generation there has been a consensus in the world community for a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. In the 1990s, it was a subject of negotiations and an agreed framework was arrived at. Six-Party Talks would follow sometime later. The last administration embraced a policy of strategic patience. All along the way the regime in North Korea answered the entreaties of the world community with broken promises and with continued pursuit -- headlong pursuit of their nuclear and ballistic missile ambitions.\nAnd as President Trump has made clear, and I've made clear as I've traveled on this behalf throughout the region, the era of strategic patience is over. Under the President's leadership and working closely with our allies, with Prime Minister Turnbull, in my meetings with Prime Minister Abe, and with acting President Hwang in South Korea, and others, the United States is determined to bring economic and diplomatic pressure to bear working with all of our allies -- and China -- to ensure that we achieve a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.\nNow all options are on the table, and the United States is prepared to do what's necessary in conjunction with our allies to see to the security of this region and of our own people. But we are hopeful -- in fact, in President Trump's words, we have great confidence that China, with the encouragement of the United States, of our allies, and we're grateful to say with the strong encouragement of the leadership here in Australia, that China will take advantage of the unique position and relationship that it has with North Korea to bring an end to their nuclear program and to their ballistic missile programs. We call on them to do that.\nThe President observed recently that China in a very real sense is the economic lifeline for North Korea. They've already taken steps, which we greatly welcome -- intervening in coal shipments and intervening in commercial travel. But we believe China can do more, and on behalf of the President, I'm just very grateful that even this week, Australia has taken steps to engage with China directly and encourage them to take even more steps to bring that economic and diplomatic pressure to bear.\nBut make no mistake about it, the United States of America is committed to seeing this way forward and achieve what's eluded the world community for a generation. And that is to achieve the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\nQ: Thank you. Prime Minister, I wanted to ask you about trade, and if there are specific steps the U.S. has asked you to take, or that you will be taking to improve bilateral trade after President Trump pulled out of TPP?\nI'm also wondering what you see is the best way to improve regional trade after the collapse of that agreement.\nAnd then, Mr. Vice President, I just wanted to follow on North Korea but ask specifically about some recent statements from the administration earlier this week there was some controversy regarding the timing of the armada that President Trump said that he'd send to the region. It's led to mockery in North Korean and Chinese press and criticism from a South Korean presidential candidate who said that it potentially undermined your administration's credibility. Is the lack of rhetorical clarity making your job with allies and partners like China harder?\nAnd to that point, can I ask you explain the President's recent statement that China is just now taking \"some unusual moves\" towards North Korea?\nPRIME MINISTER TURNBULL: Well, thank you. And in terms of trade, we have obviously continuing discussions. But at this stage, the Australia-U.S. Free Trade Agreement is working very, very well.\nIn terms of trade generally, Australia has been a great beneficiary of free trade and open markets.\nJust let that helicopter pass.\nWe've been a great beneficiary of free trade and open markets. We strongly supported the TPP as being in our national interest. President Trump has discontinued America's engagement in it. That is his right. Absolutely each nation must -- look, each nation is committed to protecting its economic interests, first and foremost. That's the duty each leader has to their own people.\nSo the United States government must make its own judgements on that. We look forward to more trade. President Trump is an international businessman. So he's not -- he can hardly be described as somebody who is unused to the benefits of international trade and international commerce. He understands it very well.\nBut he obviously will decide, as the Vice President and I were discussing today, he will decide how agreements, new trade deals, whether and to what extent they work in America's interest. That is the sovereign right, and, in fact, the solemn obligation of every nation and every leader. But at this stage, in terms of the bilateral relationship, it is proceeding very, very well. It's proceeding apace, actually. And the economic engagement and the prosperity that flows from that has been demonstrated over the years since it came into force in 2005.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: First on trade, with great respect to the Prime Minister's view and Australia's view of TPP, the President has made it clear and America has taken steps -- the Trans-Pacific Partnership is a thing of the past for the United States.\nAs we move forward with the President's philosophy of an America first foreign policy and trade policy, we'll continue to pursue opportunities for expanded commerce, but do so on bilateral basis.\nI trust that my travels throughout the Asia Pacific this week give evidence of the fact that this administration is committed to building both our security and economic relationships with countries all across this region.\nWe do believe that the bilateral agreement, trade agreement between the United States and Australia is a win-win for our countries. It is -- as I said earlier, we think it's a model agreement for how to encourage investment and encourage trade between nations.\nI think in the days ahead we initiated an economic dialogue that I and the deputy prime minister of Japan will be heading up to begin to explore the possibility of expanded economic relations with Japan. We had discussions about our free trade agreement while I was in South Korea. But I think you'll continue to see President Trump engaging with nations across this region, but again on a bilateral basis.\nWith regard to the USS Carl Vinson and the carrier group, our expectation is that they will be in the Sea of Japan, in position in a matter of days -- before the end of this month. That decision was set into motion some time ago. And the one thing that nations -- most especially the regime in North Korea -- should make no mistake about is that the United States has the resources, the personnel, and the presence in this region of the world to see to our interests, and to see to the security of our those interests and our allies.\nI think what the President was referring to with regard to China is encouraging news. In his summit at the Southern White House with President Xi, President Trump engaged President Xi in a candid and respectful discussion about China's engagement with North Korea. And now the steps we're seeing China take, in many ways unprecedented steps, bringing economic pressure to bear on North Korea are very welcome.\nWe do believe China can do more. And as I mentioned, we're very grateful for the clear message that Prime Minister Turnbull's government and Australia are sending to the Chinese to do just that. But this is a time when I think you'll continue to see the United States and our allies in the region work together to encourage China to take those steps necessary to bring about a peaceable solution to achieve a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.\nQ: Thank you. My question -- the refugee deal last year. Mr. Vice President, in February, President Trump said of the refugees deal, \"I will study this dumb deal\" -- seemingly contradicting assurances given to Mr. Turnbull. In recent weeks we've seen officials (inaudible) can we infer that President Trump has given final approval to that deal proceeding? And if so, how many refugees will be resettled in the United States?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Let me make it clear the United States intends to honor the agreement, subject to the results of the vetting processes that now apply to all refugees considered for admission to the United States of America.\nPresident Trump has made it clear that we'll honor the agreement. It doesn't mean we admire the agreement. Frankly, looking back on the last administration, the President has never been shy about expressing frustration with other international agreements, most notably the so-called nuclear agreement with Iran. But rest assured, as I confirmed today with the Prime Minister, the United States of America will honor the agreement.\nAnd actually we've initiated the process of fulfilling that agreement, subject to the results of the vetting processes that now apply to all refugees in the United States.\nPRIME MINISTER TURNBULL: Thank you. And, Mr. Vice President, as I said to the President, we thank you for honoring the commitment made by the President's predecessor. The commitment to honoring that deal is -- that agreement is very important, and it's one that speaks whatever the reservations of the President are -- and we know what they are about the deal -- nonetheless, it speaks volumes for the commitment, the integrity of President Trump and your administration, sir, to honor that commitment as you have committed to and, indeed, as you are doing. So we thank you for that commitment. That's -- it's a very important commitment, and we thank you for restating that today.\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: I would just add, if I may, Mr. Prime Minister, that as this topic came up early in the administration, Prime Minister Turnbull made a case for the agreement with the President, and the decision to go forward I think can rightly be seen as a reflection of the enormous importance of the historic alliance between the United States and Australia.\nAnd whatever reservations the President may have about the details of agreements reached by the prior administration, we'll honor this agreement out of respect for that enormous and important alliance.\nPRIME MINISTER TURNBULL: Thank you, sir.\nQ: Mr. Vice President, the administration is ramping up pressure on North Korea at the same time you seem to have ruled out talks. I'm wondering what you think the endgame is here. What makes you believe that the regime will give up the weapons systems and weapons that it has to ensure its -- are perhaps guarantee of its own survival?\nAnd for the Prime Minister, did you get any clarity on the U.S. position with regards to the South China Sea? Do you think that there is a need for more freedom of navigation operations in the region? Would you consider more joint operations in the region? Thank you.\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: This is just a very serious time. And the President sent me to this region to engage with our allies to reaffirm the alliances that we enjoy, but also to make it very, very clear that the era of strategic partnership -- strategic patience is over; that the United States of America is determined to work with our allies and especially with China to achieve the objective of a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.\nWe believe that that can occur peaceably, largely owing to the new engagement of China. In this regard, I think the world is seeing President Trump's leadership in high relief. He is in a very real sense -- like the Prime Minister of Australia -- he is a bottom-line person that likes to get to the point.\nAnd in his meeting with President Xi, they had a very candid conversation about a broad range of issues. But on the issue of North Korea, the President made it very clear to President Xi that we were looking to China to step up and use that unique relationship that it has with North Korea to achieve an end to the nuclear ambitions and the ballistic missile ambitions of that regime.\nAnd as I said, we're encouraged by the steps that China has taken thus far. That being said, we also wanted to make it clear that all options are on the table, and that the United States is prepared to work with our allies to ensure the security of our allies in the region, and ensure the security of the people of the United States of America.\nNuclear weapons in the hands of the regime in Pyongyang with a ballistic missile program and with the potential for intercontinental ballistic missiles represents a threat to the stability and security of this region, and potentially a threat to the continental United States. And continuing on the path the world has been on with North Korea over the last 25 years is just unacceptable.\nBut again, we continue to be hopeful and continue to have great confidence that we can finally after a generation achieve a peaceable solution. And I want to reiterate again the gratitude of the United States of America for the strong support that our ally here in Australia has provided to this effort; even this week, meeting with high-ranking officials from China urging them to do more to bring economic and diplomatic pressure to bear on China is welcome. We truly believe that as our allies in the region and China bring that pressure to bear that there is a chance that we can achieve a historic objective of a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula by peaceable means.\nPRIME MINISTER TURNBULL: Thank you, Mr. Vice President. And as we've described, we share that commitment. And we are absolutely united in our determination to achieve a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. That has been the goal, as the Vice President described, of the global community for many years. The time has come now to realize it.\nYou asked about the South China Sea, and I just repeat what we have said consistently for many years and that is this, that Australia has no territorial claims in the South China Sea. We are committed to freedom of navigation and freedom of overflight. Any territorial dispute should be resolved peacefully and in accordance with international law. And we call on all parties to refrain from actions that would exacerbate tensions. And in particular, we call on all parties to refrain from militarizing any features in the South China Sea, any disputed features in particular in the South China Sea.\nThe critical thing to understand in our region, as we said at the outset -- both the Vice President and I observed -- is the prosperity of everybody in this region, in every nation has been underpinned by decades of peace and stability, supported by the strong commitment of the United States to this region.\nThe maintenance of peace and stability in this region has had as its sheet anchor the strong commitment of the United States. And that is why we so welcome the commitment of President Trump's new administration shown by the visit here today and through the region over the last week of the Vice President.\nThis is a historic visit, and it underlines the importance of the American commitment to our region -- the sheet anchor, the foundation, the bedrock of the peace and the stability upon which the security and the prosperity of billions depend.\nThank you all very much, indeed.", "timestamp": "2017-04-22", "title": "The Vice President's News Conference with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in Sydney, Australia"}
{"author": "Mike Pence", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123791", "text": "THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, g'day. Minister Steven Ciobo, thank you for that kind introduction and those eloquent words about the relationship between the United States and Australia. And I want thank you for tireless work strengthening the economic partnership between your nation and mine. And it's an honor for you to be joining us here today.\nTo all of our honored guests, to our host, Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce, who I'll be meeting with momentarily, to Minister Arthur Sinodinos, Ambassador Joe Hockey, our Chargй d'Affaires, Jim Carouso, Consul General Valerie Fowler, to Maureen Dougherty, and members of the American Chamber of Commerce for Australia hosting us today, distinguished leaders of the business community, honored guests, it is my great honor to be here today in Australia on behalf of the President of the United States of America -- on my first visit to the Asia Pacific as Vice President I had to come to our ally and friend Australia. (Applause.)\nAnd I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States, President Donald Trump, to all of you who are gathered here today, and especially to the business leaders who are gathered here and have been a part of such a dynamic economic relationship between the United States and Australia.\nThe President sent me here as the first member of his administration to visit Australia, and I am tremendously grateful for the opportunity to be with all of you.\nEarlier today, on President Trump's behalf, I had the great privilege of meeting with your Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull. I reaffirmed to him what I would reaffirm to all of you today and to the people of Australia who may be looking on: Australia is, and always will be, one of America's closest allies and truest friends. We are partners in security. We are partners in prosperity, and together we are bound by our historic alliance.\nAnd under President Trump, the United States is dedicated to strengthening our bond, strengthening our ties for the benefit of our people of both of our nations and people all over the world. (Applause.)\nThe relationship between our nations stretches back literally generations. From the Coral Sea to Kandahar, our friendship has been forged ultimately in the fires of sacrifice.\nOnly three days from now, it's humbling for me to say that I stand here on the eve of when Australia will commemorate that extraordinary moment every year, ANZAC Day, to honor those brave Australian and New Zealand veterans who gave their lives in the defense of freedom, often alongside Americans. We call a similar commemoration Memorial Day in America, and it's humbling for me to stand before you today just a few short days before this annual commemoration of those who gave the last full measure of devotion.\nThe sons and daughters of both our lands have fought shoulder-to-shoulder in every conflict for the past 100 years. From World Wars One and Two, to Korea, to Vietnam, and most recently, in the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan -- it's remarkable to consider it -- our grandparents, our parents, and now our children are serving together. They have sacrificed together to defend the freedom that we all hold dear. And we honor them this day and every day.\nEven now our citizens serve together in Afghanistan and in the fight against ISIS. And around the world, we are deepening our defense collaboration, and we will continue to do so to ensure the safety and security of our people.\nThe historic United States-Australia alliance is more vital than ever to regional security and prosperity. In recent years, we have dramatically stepped up our collaboration and cooperation between the United States and Australia -- intelligence sharing, increasing our emphasis on cyber capabilities, and we've conducted and will continue to conduct joint military exercises to ensure readiness, including the Talisman Saber, which will take place later this year.\nTogether, our nations will continue to uphold a rules-based system as the foundation of peace and prosperity in the Asia Pacific.\nIn the South China Sea and throughout the region, we will defend the fundamental freedoms of navigation and overflight, and the United States of America with Australia will ensure the unimpeded flow of lawful commerce, and promote a peaceful dialogue to address every issue that arises of regional and global concern. (Applause.)\nUnder President Trump's leadership, the United States and Australia will continue to stand firm and to stand strong, as well, to confront the most urgent and dangerous threat to peace and security in the Asia Pacific, the regime in North Korea.\nWhile all options are on the table, the United States will continue to work closely with our allies, including Australia and other allies across the region, and with China to bring economic and diplomatic pressure to bear on the regime in Pyongyang until they finally and permanently abandon their nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\nPresident Trump and I are truly grateful -- truly grateful to Prime Minister Turnbull and all the people of Australia -- for calling on China to play a more constructive role in addressing the North Korean threat.\nThe President and I have great confidence that China will properly deal with Korea. But as President Trump made clear just a few days ago, if China is unable to deal with North Korea, the United States, and our allies, will.\nThe United States and Australia face this threat, and every other one, together -- because we know that our security is the foundation of our prosperity. And strengthening our prosperity is what I came to this forum mostly to talk about today, so let me begin by simply saying thank you.\nAll the businesses represented in this room are why the United States and Australia are such close economic partners.\nJust look at the American Chamber of Commerce in Australia. Since 1961, AMCHAM has brought together American and Australian businesses to foster investment and opportunity on both sides of the Pacific, and your 600 corporate members are a testament to our collective success.\nOn behalf of President Trump, let me just say thank you for your tireless work to draw the United States and Australia closer together.\nAnd thank you to all the businesses that are represented here today -- ConocoPhillips, Microsoft, GE, and really, all of you in this room -- you're titans of industry and you're pillars of the U.S.-Australia economic partnership.\nYou create jobs in both of our countries. You drive innovation. You open up opportunity. And you've helped build a strong and durable bond between the United States and Australia.\nIn fact, thanks in no small part to you, the United States is far and away Australia's largest economic partner -- not just in this region, but across the wider world.\nAll told, our economic partnership is worth a staggering $1.5 trillion - and investment has grown by 50 percent in the last three years alone.\nCountless American companies export tens of billions of dollars' worth of goods and services to Australia every year -- machines, appliances, automobiles, parts, electrical machinery, textiles, apparel, you name it.\nToday, more than a quarter of a million American jobs depend on exports to Australia. The American people are grateful.\nAmerican companies also are investing in Australia like never before. More than 1,000 U.S. businesses large and small, have operations here today. My own brother who works with Cummins engine company spent five memorable years with his family here in Sydney as he worked in their Australia operation.\nTo name just another one of these companies, Chevron's gas facilities are now the largest single foreign investment ever in the history of Australia. And U.S. investment here has contributed greatly to Australia's huge commodity exports to Asia.\nAnd the investments flow both ways. Today, the United States is Australia's leading destination for investment, and we're grateful. Australian companies have invested just under $45 billion in America, where they employ over 95,000 Americans in good-paying jobs.\nI know the benefits of Australian investment firsthand. In my home state of Indiana, IFM Investors, who are represented here today, invested more than $5 billion in the Indiana toll road. The bottom line is that our economies are inextricably intertwined in a win-win relationship that's creating jobs and opportunity for both our nations.\nFrom energy to agriculture, advanced manufacturing to aerospace, our economic partnership is vital to the American people and vital to the people of Australia.\nAnd today, under President Trump, I'm very pleased to pledge that the United States will continue to work together with Australia to forge even greater opportunity and prosperity for both our nations and our people.\nPresident Trump is committed to fostering free and fair bilateral trade relationships with Australia and throughout the Asia Pacific.\nThe good news is that the U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement is already working. In fact, the United States believes our agreement with Australia is a case study in success -- and while we can always make additional progress, and the Prime Minister and I talked about identifying areas that we might lower barriers to trade and investment, we consider the U.S.-Australia trade agreement to be model for a mutually beneficial trade agreement and a model for the world.\nEver since it came into force in 2005, bilateral trade and investment between our nations has soared. Minister Ciobo, know that your contribution to our trade relationship is deeply appreciated.\nBut we think we can still do better. This morning, Prime Minister Turnbull and I discussed the need to take those additional steps that I mentioned to break down barriers to foster even more investment and exchange between our nations.\nIt is just the beginning of a conversation that will continue. But President Trump and I look forward to continuing our dialogue with Australia's leaders in the months and years ahead to the benefit of all of our people.\nAnd we hope that all of you in this room will join that conversation. We had a good one earlier today with some of the business leaders who gathered for our listening session. As members of the business community, you can help us identify the barriers that we need to break down and areas that we can improve to make more economic progress possible.\nPresident Trump and I value your continued input on the issues that you face, and we know the job creators in this room can help us move toward a system that maximizes jobs and growth, and a brighter future here in Australia and in the United States.\nThe truth is that a stronger American economy also means a stronger economy for all of our trading partners, including Australia.\nAnd let me promise you, under President Trump's leadership, the United States is going to drive growth like never before.\nPresident Trump has already taken decisive action to get our American economy moving again. Our administration is working around the clock to pass an agenda of lower taxes, less regulation, better infrastructure, and a renewed focus on American energy.\nI'm sure you'll be glad to know that American businesses represented here today and businesses that are investing in our country -- that tax reform is one of our very top priorities, including a reform of corporate taxes. I don't have to tell you how the American tax code harms our business community, at home and abroad.\nOur corporate tax rate today is one of the highest in the developed world -- and it's 5 percent higher than the tax rate here in Australia. President Trump's tax plan would slash the corporate rate and reform the tax code to make it simpler, flatter, and fairer.\nRest assured, our tax reform will make the strongest economy in the world stronger still, and it will benefit the American people, American workers, and it will benefit the economy of Australia.\nAnd the same is true of President Trump's decisive action on regulation. He's already announced that our various agencies have to find two regulations to get rid of before they create any one new piece of red tape on the American people.\nThe President has already signed dozens bills turning back the last administration's burdensome mandates, and he'll continue to work with Congress to slash through red tape so jobs and opportunities can flow in the United States.\nMake no mistake: Under President Donald Trump, the era of over-taxation and over-regulation is over, and a new era of jobs and growth and prosperity has just begun.\nNow these are a couple of the policies that the President is advancing, and I could keep on going. But I'll go easy on you. I just appreciate the feedback I received from so many of you earlier today in our roundtable about what our administration can continue to do to foster jobs and investment and growth.\nAnd rest assured, President Trump's agenda will renew America's reputation as the premier investment destination in the world. And as America's economy grows, all of our trading partners and Australia's economy will benefit as a result.\nAnd we're confident that working together with you and with Australia's leaders, we're going to build on a strong foundation. And we're going to reach even new heights in our partnership, in our relationship, strategically, and economically.\nAnd the President and I are also confident that the historic alliance between the United States and Australia will grow even stronger in the years ahead. Nowhere is our enduring commitment to each other and to our shared future more evident than in our shared struggle against global terrorism.\nThe people of the United States will never forget that Australia invoked our ANZUS Security Treaty for the first and only time following the attack on our nation on September the 11th, an attack which claimed the lives of nearly 3,000 innocent people, including 11 Australians. The support that Australia showed in our darkest hour will never be forgotten by the American people.\nAustralia, like the United States, has not been spared in this regard. The four-lone wolf terror attacks over the past 31 months were all inspired by this global cancer.\nAnd as the Prime Minister and I discussed today, the people of Australia can rest assured: Under your leadership here in this nation and under President Trump's leadership, we will not rest, we will not relent until, together, we drive the evil of global terrorism from the face of this Earth. (Applause.)\nAs I close, let me simply say that the historic alliance between Australia and the United States is a beacon that shines not only throughout the Asia Pacific, but across the wider world. Our shared history and our shared values bind us together. And as we look toward what lies ahead, we do so with confidence as we stand here today with a true friend and a true friendship between the United States and Australia.\nAnd I am confident that in the days ahead, I have faith that our relationship will only grow stronger, our historic alliance will benefit the people of our country and yours. And the best days for America and Australia are yet to come.\nThank you. God bless you all. God bless Australia. And God bless the United States of America.

You look at TPP, one of the first executive orders the President signed was getting out of TPP. You look at ethics, that was one of the bullet points. You had every employee of the West Wing signed an ethics pledge that said you're not going to lobby for five years after you leave this place, and you're never going to lobby for a foreign country. Look at Neil Gorsuch, first 100 days a Supreme Court justice is sworn in, first time since 1881. And if you just give me one minute, I won't drone on. But, this idea about major legislation not being passed within the first 100 days, Barack Obama had a prebaked stimulus package that started in October … passed in February, it was pre-baked. George Bush didn't get any major legislation until June. Clinton, August 10th. Bush 41, a year and a half later. Reagan, August 13th. Carter, 658 days after he took the office. Nixon, one year. Johnson, 225 days. Here is the deal, the President signed over 28 bills already. Health care may happen next week; it may not. We're hopeful it will. As far as border security, you said the military. We have right now in the CR negotiating one of the biggest increases in military spending in decades. So, he is fulfilling his promises and doing it at breakneck speed.\"\nOMB Director Mick Mulvaney on Fox's Fox News Sunday: \"We're talking about historic accomplishment by this administration in the first 100 days.\"\nDIRECTOR MICK MULVANEY: \"What I think folks don't realize is we've signed more legislation into law in the first 100 days than anybody in the last 50 years. We've put out more executive orders than any previous administration in the last 50 years and importantly, these are not creating new laws. Most of these are laws getting rid of other laws. Regulations getting rid of other regulations. We are reducing the role of government in your life during the first 100 days, and we are doing so on truly historic basis. Then you add Justice Gorsuch. No president has ever had a Supreme Court Justice confirmed in 100 days, and we're talking about historic accomplishment by this administration in the first 100 days...\"\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions on ABC's This Week: \"The President is honoring his promise to end the lawlessness at the border.\"\nATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS: \"I think the President is honoring his promise to end the lawlessness at the border. The first thing we need to do is to stop the additional flow of illegal people into our country. Many of these are involved in criminal enterprises, hauling drugs, and that kind of thing. We need to end that and then we have to wrestle what to do about people who have been here a long time. But, I would say that the President is honoring his commitments to the American people, to fix this border and we're going to stay at it.

This is a great, great leader. (Applause.)\nAdmiral, thank you for that kind introduction. Thank you for your resolute leadership of the U.S. Pacific Command at this pivotal time in the life of our nation. I'm very humbled to be with all of you. Thank you so much for the warm welcome. And most especially, I bring greetings on behalf of your Commander-in-Chief, President Donald Trump. (Applause.)\nThe President -- we're on our way back to Washington, D.C. We'll be back to work at the White House tomorrow morning, but the President wanted me to come by today just to tell you how grateful we all are for your service. And as he said to me, just tell them I'm proud of them. And I promise all of you, the American people are proud of every man and woman in this room. Give yourselves another round of applause. Thank you for serving your country. (Applause.)\nI just had a chance to visit with a family member of mine, Master Sergeant Jimmy Leseune (ph), who is Air Force.\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: Ooorah!\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: He and his family are here in Hawaii, and he's been in the service I think upwards to 18 years.\nAnd as the Admiral said, I'm not a soldier. My life didn't take me into the uniform that every one of you have put on voluntarily, but I am the son of a soldier, a combat veteran who served in the Korean War. And I'm the proud father of a United States Marine. And so I stand before you today deeply humbled -- deeply humbled because I really speak on behalf of the hundreds of millions of Americans, who each and every day benefit by the services and the sacrifices that you and your families make on our behalf.\nAnd I just really came by to say thanks. Thank you for stepping forward to serve your country; and also to assure you that in these days that lie ahead, in these uncertain times, people who serve here at U.S. Pacific Command will know that in your Commander-in-Chief, you have a President who is going to fight to rebuild our military, restore the arsenal of democracy. And we're going to give our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard the resources you need to accomplish your mission for the American people. We're going to do it. (Applause.)\nEven this week, my fellow Americans, I can tell you I'm headed back to Capitol Hill. There's a spending bill that's being considered as we speak. The President is working even in what remains of this budget year to begin to supplement our military spending. The President truly believes that the time has come for us to rebuild this military.\nAnd the budget that the President submitted you may be glad to know had the largest single-year increase in military spending since the days of the Reagan administration. (Applause.)\nIt is the greatest privilege of my life to serve as Vice President to a President who cares so deeply about the men and women of our armed forces, their families, and our veterans. And I know in my heart President Donald Trump is going to be the best friend the American Armed Forces have ever had in the White House.\nWith that said, let me close by simply thanking you. Thanking you from the bottom of my heart for being willing to step forward and volunteer to wear the uniform of the United States of America.\nIt's not lost on any American that the way that you arrive in those uniforms which you're wearing from all the different branches of the service are because you stepped forward. I was speaking to one young airman a little bit ago, and she told me that she just felt early on the calling to serve. And I thanked her for answering that call.\nAnd each one of you have responded to the call of your country. And I just want you to know that it is going to be to your eternal credit that here in this time in the life of our nation, you stepped forward and you said yes to America.\nSo I'm here basically to do two things: To assure you of our thanks, the admiration and gratitude of your Commander-in-Chief, and the gratitude of the American people for the service that you render here in this place. But also I'm here to assure you of their prayers. The American people are grateful every day for those who serve around the globe -- whether it be the U.S. Pacific Command or in far-flung places in the world, oftentimes separated for months at a time from your families, I want you to know that as you go, you go with our gratitude. And you go with our prayers.\nEach one of you carries with you the strength of this nation and the pride of this nation. And on behalf of your President and on behalf of the American people, I say from my heart, God bless you. Thank you for your service and God bless America.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123852", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n5:05 P.M. EDT\nMS. WALTERS: Ray Starling, who is at the National Economic Council, he's going to be briefing you. This is embargoed until this evening at 9:00 p.m. It is on the record, and Ray can spell out his name for those of you who need it. Again, embargoed until 9 o'clock tonight. You have a factsheet, and Ray will take questions at the end after he runs you through anything. And any additional follow-ups, direct them to Kelly. She will be here after.\nMR. STARLING: Thank you. Good evening and -- or afternoon, rather, and thank you for not leaving and for being interested in the event that we're doing tomorrow. My name is Ray Starling. I am the Special assistant to the President for Agriculture, Trade and Food Assistance. And as you can guess, I was not raised north of Washington, D.C., so if we have any translation issues, we'll let Kelly step in for those. (Laughter.)\nYou have a briefing sheet in front of you. I want to provide a little more commentary about the folks that will be joining us tomorrow afternoon. We have assembled quite the group, and I want you to have a little background on each of them. So I will move through that list much like a fat man moves through a barbed wire fence -- hitting on the main points but getting through as quickly as possible. (Laughter.)\nOf course, you know Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue. We are very much looking forward to him being confirmed tonight. He will have a busy day tomorrow beginning with his swearing-in first thing tomorrow morning, then going to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for a speech to the employees there in the patio -- that inner sanctum, if you will, of the USDA property over there. I believe at the end of that event they will have Georgia peach pies for folks who partake in that, so that's a nice touch.\nSecretary Perdue -- or, by tomorrow, Secretary Perdue we will call him -- he is a farmer and has been engaged in agriculture and agribusiness for a number of years, so we're certainly proud to have him at the table.\nI would also point out Zippy Duvall. Mr. Duvall is the president of American Farm Bureau. He is a broiler, cattle, and hay farmer in Greensboro, Georgia. A broiler is a meat chicken, as opposed to an egg chicken. I'm sure you knew all that, but, in case you didn't, I'm just showing off.\nMs. Valerie Early will be at the table tomorrow. Valerie is a national FFA officer. She is also a former 4-H member. So Valerie will bring a younger perspective to the table. She is an agricultural education major. She is currently taking a year off from her studies to serve the FFA as an officer. So we look forward to having Valerie in town tomorrow afternoon as well.\nA.G. Kawamura. Mr. Kawamura is from California; he has an interesting background. His family has been involved in agriculture for a number of years. They farm both conventionally and organic in Orange County, California. So he has had to deal with some of the urban sprawl and rural interfacing issues that are really hitting a number of farmers around the country. He's also served as the Secretary of the California Department of Food and Agriculture, and has been active in the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture. A ton of stuff on the web about A.G. if you want to read more about his background.\nLuke Brubaker. Luke comes to us from Mount Joy, Pennsylvania. He is a dairy farmer in Lancaster County. Started the farm in 1970 with only 18 cows, and now has over 800, and farms over 1,000 acres of land. Has a number of different production techniques that he engages there in Pennsylvania.\nIowa's Secretary of Agriculture, Bill Northey. Mr. Northey is also still farming, in addition to serving his state as Secretary of Agriculture. He is a fourth-generation Iowa farmer, and still grows corn and soybeans on his farm near Spirit Lake. He has been the Secretary of Ag since 2006, and so he certainly understands this sector and will bring an important perspective to the table tomorrow.\nTom Demaline from Avon, Ohio. Tom is -- we certainly consider him, in the agricultural space, as a farmer, but he does nursery and landscape projects -- or nursery and landscape production, I should say. His entity, Willoway Nurseries, supplies nursery products to, I believe, 26 states throughout the Midwest and out on the East Coast. So he's certainly been active in the Ohio Nursery and Landscape Association and in other industry associations. So Tom will be with us tomorrow afternoon.\nMs. Lynetta Usher Griner. Ms. Griner farms two different main crops in Florida. One is -- she's actually a timber producer. She's a forester. She was the first female president of the Florida Forestry Association. She also farms cattle. Some of that production occurs in Florida, and some of that production occurs out in Kansas. She piqued our interest because there happens to be someone in the Senate from Kansas who is very interested in agriculture. And so she can represent both Florida and Kansas during the conversation tomorrow. She was Florida's 2013 Woman of the Year in agriculture.\nTerry Swanson is from Walsh, Colorado. He has lived in Colorado all of his life and raises a number of cattle on 10,000 acres of ranch land, and then he also farms 7,500 acres of land. He's been very active in the National Sorghum Producers Association and also on some research panels with the Colorado State University Extension Service there in Colorado.\nCommissioner Steve Troxler is the North Carolina Commissioner of Agriculture. Commissioner Troxler no longer farms tobacco, but at one time did -- that, wheat, vegetables, and soybeans. At one time Commissioner Troxler -- if you were eating a tomato in the Piedmont of North Carolina at a restaurant, you, more than likely, were eating his tomato. He's a past president of the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, and he has been very active with the FDA as they are implementing their Food Safety Modernization Act regulations.\nAn eleventh person on our panel tomorrow is James Lamb. Just as an aside, Mr. Lamb told me a fun story. I asked him, I said, what is the name of your farm, and do you call it Lamb Farms or Lamb Family Farms? And he said he had to change his name and put his entire name on the sign by the road because when people drove by and saw \"Lamb Farms,\" they kept stopping and wanting to buy a lamb. So he does not raise lambs. He is, however, a pig farmer for Prestage Farms, down in North Carolina, and he also does environment quality for Prestage Farms. So he has his own farm, and in addition he works for the company, leading part of their environmental protection efforts.\nHe has been named an \"outstanding pork producer\" by the North Carolina Pork Council. He also grows corn, soybeans, millet, Bermuda grass, and cattle. That is not unusual for that part of the country -- pig farmers who spray their effluent out on Bermuda grass, wait for the appropriate period of time to pass, grow out the grass, and then harvest the grass and feed it to cattle. So if we were looking at a production map of that part of the country, we would see both hay, cattle, and pork all be sort of synonymous in that area. So Mr. Lamb will be with us tomorrow.\nHank Choate. And I need to apologize -- completely my mistake -- on your briefing document he is referred to as \"Hang Choate.\" He is not \"Hang,\" he is \"Hank.\" So my apologies for that. Please help us correct that. Hank runs Choate's Belly Acres, in Cement City, Michigan. A very interesting story: A seventh-generation farmer, and they take very seriously continuing to involve the different generations in the farm. He has been very active in a number of associations and organizations in the ag world there. He's also a dairy farmer. He has Holstein cows, and also grows corn, alfalfa, soybeans, and wheat. So a great story with Mr. Choate coming in tomorrow.\nMs. Maureen Torrey. She is from Mr. Trump's home state of New York. She's an eleventh-generation farmer near Rochester, New York. She raises fresh market vegetables and runs a dairy farm with about 2,000 cows. Also operates a grain farm and a trucking company. So Ms. Torrey, we're pleased to have her at the table, and we look forward to seeing how she and the President interact over their rural New York roots.\nMr. Jose Rojas is the vice president of farm operations at Hormel in Colorado Springs, Colorado. He is the only person in our group who can honestly make a claim to the fact that he raises over 450,000 pigs a year. He oversees the production operations for Hormel, and as I understand it, later this summer will be transferring over, where he will be helping to raise turkeys. So he checked both of those boxes. An interesting gentleman because he was born in Mexico, came to Iowa State to receive part of his education -- a master's degree in animal husbandry -- and then started working in the vertically integrated pork sector.\nAnd the last person on our list, Ms. Lisa Johnson-Billy. And I also apologize, I might have mis-alphabetized her name. I probably put it with the J as opposed to the B. But Ms. Johnson-Billy is a former member of the Oklahoma House of Representatives. She was termed out there. She started the first Native American caucus that the legislature in Oklahoma had. She is still a farmer, and her family lives on about a 200-acre farm. She has three sons, all of whom were involved in FFA, and one of whom, when he went off to Oklahoma State University, he got active or became active in ROTC and is currently in training to be an active-duty helicopter pilot with the United States Army.\nOur intention tomorrow is for the President to meet each of these folks to hear a little bit about their operation and to hear what's on their minds. As we point out, in terms of pure numbers, the ag sector does not make up a large part of the population, but certainly those engaged in the allied industry sector do and their economic impact in rural communities across America certainly allows them to punch above their weight, if you will. We also brag on them. Certainly we have the most efficient farmers in the world, the most effective at producing our food, and that's why we pay a lower percentage of our income on food than any country in the world.\nI would add one other thing, and I would just say, to my knowledge -- we have asked the librarian to help us double-check this, actually raised this point this morning with the North American ag journalists and I got checked a little bit, but not entirely wrong -- we cannot find any reference to a presidential meeting with a group this size this early in a President's administration, back to Reagan's time, when in either January or February of 1981, when the Russian wheat embargo was going forward, something that Reagan had agreed to end were he to become President and something that Carter had implemented. Our understanding is that there were a group of farmers that came to the White House very early in Reagan's administration to have a conversation about that. That's the only other record we can find at the moment. But I'm sure if I'm wrong about that you will let me know. But to say that it's been a while would be an understatement.\nThe last thing I would cover on the roundtable is that we certainly expect a wide range of topics to come up, as is evidenced by the wide range of folks who will be attending the meeting. They are listed there for you. I will not insult you by reading them, but certainly the list could grow longer. All of these things are issues that those of us in agriculture see as potential limiting factors economically and things that we need to address.\nI think that then sets up exactly -- that need is what sets up the task force that the President will establish tomorrow. He will be asking Governor Perdue -- hopefully by tomorrow Secretary Perdue -- to establish a task force that does a 180-day review of regulations, policies, legislation that unnecessarily hinders economic growth in the agricultural sector.\nWe also, in the course of that executive order, sunset the current makeup of the Rural Council. We certainly think they did some important work and we're glad that they focused on rural America and brought some of the members of the last administration together. However, there are very few records formally of their meetings. I think a blog was maintained, but very little in the way of their accomplishments. And so one of the things that we will ask the task force to do is to take a look at, were we to create another body along those lines, what would that need to look like and how could it be most effective at establishing cross-agency communication and cross-agency collaboration that's good for agriculture.\nWith that, I think I'm happy to take questions. Are we good?\nQ: In terms of this effort, the Rural Council included a lot of people from -- various officials in the Obama administration. Is this task force going to be people from the Ag Department, is it going to be outside people? How is that going to continue to work?\nMR. STARLING: So two answers to that question. Number one, certainly if you were to look at the executive order tomorrow, the list will look very similar to the list of players that were involved in the Rural Council. We have certainly all the same Cabinet Secretaries listed, to my knowledge. It is a long list -- Treasury, Defense, Attorney General, Interior, Commerce, Labor, EPA -- we go down the list. And the idea there is, to your question and to the point, I believe, certainly farmers have to interface with the United States Department of Agriculture, and there are things there that we can do, regulatorily, to make their life easier. But I think many farmers, were you to interview them, they would say that most of their challenges come from other agencies -- not intentionally, but because there are fewer people in those agencies that understand agriculture, or that might have been raised or grown up or familiar with our production, techniques and technology.\nSo, number one, I would say, yes, cross-agency, a number of Cabinet Secretaries at the table. The second thing I would say is the EO obviously has specific language directing the task force to do outreach and to accept ideas and thoughts from the field, not just of federal officials but also state and local officials as well.\nQ: You spent a lot of time talking about farming issues, but USDA also deals with rural development, housing, broadband. Could you talk about the scope of this executive order?\nMR. STARLING: Sure. Those things are absolutely included. I would say on the messaging point there that we do believe that in these rural communities, the best thing we can do to make them grow quickly and economically is to focus on agriculture because it is the number-one driver in most of these rural communities. But we certainly understand that's not the only silver bullet.\nAnd so one of the things the task force is charged with doing is looking at those rural communities and also making recommendations with regard to what we can do to promote their economic stability as well.\nYes, ma'am.\nQ: Can you tell me -- trade has been such a big issue for the administration. Can you tell me about how this group will discuss trade and how that fits into --\nMR. STARLING: Absolutely. I think there is a lot of conversation in the ag community now about how we are a net contributor to lessening the trade deficit. Ag believes we are doing a good job. We obviously grow more food than we can eat in the United States. So our real potential for economic growth is either talking you all into eating more, or to finding new markets for our products overseas. And while I'm a big fan of the latter -- or is that the former? -- the former, we know that our real potential is in countries where incomes are growing and in countries where populations are growing.\nSo if you look at agreements like NAFTA, if you look at the negotiations that happened in TPP, certainly on the table there were goods things there for ag. I think there was renowned recognition across the ag communities that should this become our agreement, this is good for us. I believe those things now become a part of the new conversations, even in these bilateral agreements, to the extent that we're not pursuing multilateral, large trade agreements like the TPP.\nAnd so I think the point to be made there is these farmers will make sure they leave the President with an impression of how important that agricultural trade is and, in particular, how important the agricultural trade is just north and just south of our border here with the United States, namely with Canada and Mexico.\nQ: So I just wanted to clarify, is the task force only going to be made up of officials from federal agencies? Is that what the task force --\nMR. STARLING: That's correct. And White House officials. Yes, ma'am.\nQ: Okay. And then so I also wanted to ask -- so this task force is going to be looking at identifying regulatory policy challenges for agriculture. It seems like the White House has done a lot of these. I mean, is there anything in particular that the White House now has in mind that they feel like is hindering agriculture? Any policies in particular? I mean, it just seems so broad to say, look at all regulations. Is there anything in particular that --\nMR. STARLING: Yeah, it's a great question. And I think when you see the executive order tomorrow, you will see that some direction is given in the order for the purpose and functions of the task force, and it is along the lines of seeing, \"consider changes, including the following\" -- certainly things that are not on the list may be included. But you'll see some directives there to think in particular about how we adopt technology and agriculture.\nThere's a large debate, I think, internationally about biotechnology, not just here in the United States, but that's a very good issue that ties into the trade question. To the extent that we are going to sell our products overseas, we need to make sure that we have the biotech approvals in those foreign markets that we need. So looking at how we do that across the government, there are a number of players in involved in that. It's not just USDA; it could be FDA, EPA, and certainly those folks that are responsible for international trade as well.\nI would also point out, think about FSMA implementation, the Food Safety Modernization Act. For the first time over the course of this administration, FDA will be responsible for -- farm regulation with regard to things like water and soil additives. And so there's a lot of talk and concern in the ag community that we make sure those regulations, as they are being created and promulgated, that they recognize the difference in small farms and big farms, the difference in water sources, the difference in terms of application so that one size does not fit all. I would also throw out that farmers need crop protection tools when they are faced with insects or pests, and how we move those products to market in a safe and effective way will certainly be something I think the task force would take seriously. So a myriad of things, absolutely.\nThere was a question back here.\nQ: Yeah, this task force, will it also be looking honestly at the labor issue vis-а-vis the immigration crackdown? Because my understanding is a significant part of labor in ag is undocumented workers. I believe in California it's like 70 percent of farmworkers. It seems like there should be some ramifications there. Will this be honestly addressed?\nMR. STARLING: Absolutely. In fact, there is certainly language in the EO that talks about how do we ensure access to reliable workforce. I suspect tomorrow that is certainly something that a number of the folks in the room will bring up to the President. We have a number of growers in the room that use H-2A workers, so they use the temporary guest workers through the Department of Labor program. There's also a number of farms in the room that use local laborers. I don't want to quibble with your statistics, but I will tell you we have each year a little over a million farmworkers. And in any given year, most recently we've had between 170,000 and 180,000 H-2A workers.\nSo figuring out what that delta is, I think you can think through that. A number of those folks also supply papers that maybe the farmer does not even understand, it may not be accurate. But that is a problem, a consistent issue for agriculture that is not new. It is perhaps more pressing now; we hear more farmers talking about it now. And hopefully in this new environment we'll be able to make some progress on it. But certainly the task force will take a look that that.\nYes, ma'am.\nQ: Can I just clarify, is this group going to operate separate and apart from what the NEC is doing, what the Trade Council is going, what the USDA is doing in decision-making that would be happening either simultaneously or in the next couple months, let alone the next six months?\nMR. STARLING: Sure. Structure-wise, Secretary Perdue is the chair of the task force, and it is managed out of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. So it will not be run exclusively out of the White House. So we do not know exactly how quickly he'll convene that group, but I think it will be on its own track. We will certainly plug in -- the Domestic Policy Council, the National Economic Council will have a seat on the task force. So I hope it's really an integrated operation, and not one that is one-off or doesn't fit in with all the other efforts that are ongoing.\nQ: But it will be a series of reports, or just a report at the end of --\nMR. STARLING: That's a question better for Secretary Perdue. I don't know the answer to that. I don't know how he'll end up managing that process.\nYes, ma'am.\nQ: Can I follow up on that last question? The President himself, and his family, is in the wine business. He's used, personally, seasonal workers. But we really haven't heard him talk a lot about these issues; maybe a little bit during the Iowa caucuses, or right before them. Can you fill us in a little bit on the President's thinking when it comes both to farm labor as well as kind of point some of the direction he'd like to see things moving in, giving us like a little hint of maybe what he'd like to see?\nMR. STARLING: Well, I think in talking with the President I would say a couple of things. Number one, he said he loves his farmers. He has also said he recognizes that farming is a difficult business and that there are tight margins in agriculture. On the trade front, I think he would say, we need to win there and we're not going to sacrifice wins in agriculture for gains in other sectors. So I definitely think the President gets that. I look forward to hearing what he says tomorrow when he's pressed and discussed these issue with the group of farmers.\nQ: Do you know specifically on the labor issue?\nMR. STARLING: I don't know specifically on the labor issue. I can tell you he has never said anything hostile about temporary ag guest workers.\nQ: And one other thing that I do remember that he talked a little bit about was changing kind of inheritance taxes so that -- he talked a little bit about how family farms had trouble passing those along. Have you talked to him about that issue at all?\nMR. STARLING: No. We know that the estate tax issue is a part of the comprehensive tax reform conversation. Another issue that's very important for agriculture there is not just that estate tax issue, particularly given the new limits, but also the question of stepped-up basis. It's a real issue for ag as families try to pass along their operations. But we have not had a specific conversation in that regard.\nQ: Is that part of the EO at all?\nMR. STARLING: Yes, I think we say something in the EO about our tax policy.\nQ: Is there any way that you might be able -- just because we won't see -- we're going to have to write before we actually see the EO. Would it be possible for you just to read out what the main categories are that it touches on?\nMR. STARLING: Let me make sure I have not told you a fib about taxes. It does not look like we mention the word \"tax\" in the EO, but I definitely think that conversation fits into our other qualifiers about anything that impacts economic development, job growth, and quality of life in rural America.\nIn terms of you guys getting a copy of the EO, that is why Kelly makes the big bucks. So I'll defer that question to her.\nAll right, maybe one more, two more. Anything else?\nThank you all.\nEND 5:29 P.M.

Well, can't outdo Gronk, but I brought some special guests today. As you know, the ambassadors to the U.N. Security Council are here today visiting, and Ambassador Haley wanted to come by and make sure we have an update as to what they're talking about -- some of the issues. When she's done, she's got to join a meeting that's in progress.\nSecretary Mnuchin has some comments that he'd like to make. We'll take some questions from him and then resume the briefing.\nSo without further ado, the Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley.\nAMBASSADOR HALEY: Thank you, Sean. I will tell you, we have had an exciting day in D.C. We are hosting the members of the Security Council. And when you think of that, this is the most powerful group that decides sanctions, relief, any sort of conflict that comes up. This is the group. And so the idea that they were able to come to D.C. is overwhelming for them. They are extremely pleased.\nWe started the morning at the Blair House with Senators Graham and Cardin, as well as Congressman Smith and Congresswoman Bass. So they had a lot of interaction, probably about an hour and a half, talking about issues from budget all the way to peacekeeping issues, as well as conflicts in North Korea and Syria, and then with the problems in Iran. So it was a very healthy discussion there.\nFrom there, we came over to the White House, and the President greeted all of the members, had his picture taken with them, and then we all sat down for lunch. And it was an open dialogue, very much of the members wanting to hear from the President what his plans are, what he was going to continue to do on Syria or not continue to do -- North Korea. All of those issues are certainly at the forefront. And the idea that he would have that dialogue with them is tremendously helpful to me -- whereas in the Security Council, we need them to really engage, we need them to now know that we are about action.\nAnd I think that what we've tried to do in the U.N. is really bring reform -- reform in the way we spend, reform in the peacekeeping operations, but also reform in the resolutions that are passed, that what we pass actually means something and that there's accountability in what we pass.\nAnd so I think they heard that loud and clear today from the President. I think that they are thrilled with the engagement that they had. And I think it shows that the President is very engaged on foreign policy, and they see that. The idea that he would sit down and want to talk to them about each of their countries and the Security Council collectively is massive for a President to be able to do this, and it was certainly helpful for the United States.\nNow they are in briefings with General McMaster focusing on North Korea, also focusing on ISIS and engaging on that front. And we'll continue to have other conversations as well. But as far as we go, great day for the Security Council, great day with the President, and certainly more good to come out of this meeting.\nSo thank you very much, I've got some ambassadors waiting, and we will talk to you soon. Thank you.\nMR. SPICER: Thank you, Ambassador. So without further ado, Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin.\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Seems like I'm becoming a regular here. It's nice to see all of you again.\nQ: We have no problem with that, sir.\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Earlier today, the United States Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control imposed sanctions in response to the April 4th, 2017 sarin attack on innocent civilians by the regime of Syrian dictator Assad. OFAC is sanctioning 271 employees of Syria's Scientific Studies and Research Center -- the Syrian government agency responsible for developing and producing nonconventional weapons and means to deliver them. OFAC has targeted these 271 employees because they have expertise in chemistry and related fields, or have worked in support of chemical weapons programs since at least 2012.\nToday's action, less than three weeks after the attack on Khan Sheikhun, is one of the largest ever executed by OFAC. In a single action, we are more than doubling the number of individuals and entities sanctioned since the start of the Syrian conflict pursuant to Syria-related executive orders. These sweeping sanctions are intended to hold the Assad regime and those who support it, directly or indirectly, accountable for their blatant violations of the Chemical Weapons Convention and U.N. Security Council Resolution 2118.\nThe United States is sending a strong message with this action that we will not tolerate the use of chemical weapons by any actor, and we intend to hold the Assad regime accountable for its unacceptable behavior. The Treasury Department, together with the Department of State and our international partners, will continue to relentlessly pursue and shut down the financial networks of any individuals involved with Syria's production or use of chemical weapons.\nI'd also comment that, recently, we had sanctions on North Korea and Iran, and will also continue to add to and monitor those as appropriate.\nAnd with that, I'd be happy to take a few questions.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, is this the only round of sanctions we can expect against Syria in the wake of that chemical weapons attacks or are you considering more? And are you considering the possibility of sanctions against Russia for not going far enough to try to dissuade Assad?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: We don't comment on the specifics of sanctions that we are going to do in the future. But again, what I will tell you is, these sanctions programs are very important, they're very effective, and we will continue to use them to the maximum amount available by law.\nQ: Secretary, on the budget, is the border wall a deal breaker for the President, even to the point of a government shutdown?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: I'm not going to comment on the specifics of that, but I will say is, I was in a meeting this morning with Director Mick Mulvaney and other senior people. The President is working hard to keep the government open and addressing various issues.\nQ: Secretary, can you tell us what these sanctions actually do? What is different today than was different yesterday before OFAC moved?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Well, the sanctions are enormously important. So by identifying 271 additional people, these sanctions, as you know, will both freeze assets, if there's assets here, and prevent U.S. entities from doing business, as well as these sanctions have enormous impact with all of our partners around the world who also work with us on these issues.\nQ: As you know, the administration is trying to grapple with the Paris Climate Agreement and come to a decision on that. Where do you stand on it? Do you support staying in Paris or coming out?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Again, I would just comment that we're having discussions on that, and that's where I'll go on that.\nQ: The President said last week there would be a tax reform proposal Wednesday.\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: He did indeed. It's been widely reported.\nQ: I imagine that surprised you a little bit. What can we expect?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Let me just first say, I've been working with the President for over the last year on his economic plan in regards to creating growth. The President is very determined that we can get to sustained economic growth of 3 percent or higher. We're working on tax reform, we're working on regulatory reform, we're looking at job creation, and this is something that, on the tax side, I've been meeting weekly with the House and the Senate on designing things. And we'll be coming out, as the President said, with more details on Wednesday.\nQ: Secretary, thank you very much. Along the lines of tax reform, I know the specifics of the broad details will be delivered on Wednesday, but without getting into the specifics, what does the middle class gain if there is a simplification but also a loss of deductions, whatever they might be. If we lose the deductions, how does that help the middle class?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Well, let me just say, we've been clear on what the President's objectives are for tax reform: Middle income tax cut -- a priority of the President's. Simplification -- the average American should be able to do their taxes on a large postcard. Business tax reform -- we need to make business taxes competitive, and we expect, with doing that, we will bring back trillions of dollars from offshore.\nQ: Thank you, sir. I guess the question I have is to sort of bounce off of what John was asking about this announcement on Wednesday. It doesn't sound like we're going to get the finer details of what this tax reform package will entail. Is it a good idea to start talking about tax reform -- something that you say can't be accomplished by August -- when you don't have all the details?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Well, there will be details that will come out. And yes, I think it is important that we're talking about it and we are going to move forward.\nI'll just take a couple more. Right there, yes.\nQ: Can I just follow up on what Major was asking you? For those of us who are not completely clear about the 271 employees, are you suggesting, by looking at these sanctions, that there are U.S. companies, or they have holdings in the U.S., or they would be traveling or doing some sort of business that we're actually freezing or barring?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Again, I can't comment on the specifics of these sanctions beyond what we release. But I can assure you that when the U.S. puts out sanctions, they have impacts both here and throughout the world, and we wouldn't be doing this if we didn't think it is impactful; it's quite impactful.\nOne more. Back there, yes.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, would you say that simplification of the tax code or cuts would be the first priority? You've mentioned both the Coast Guard --\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Both.\nQ: -- and closing the gap with growth. But which is the first thing that we're going to hear about on Wednesday?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Again, what I'd say: On the personal side, we're about a middle income tax cut and simplification. On the business side, we're about making them competitive.\nThis is the last one. Go ahead.\nQ: Can you say if the tax plan will be revenue-neutral?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Again, what I've said before is, the tax plan will pay for itself with economic growth.\nThank you, everybody. Nice to see you.\nMR. SPICER: Thank you, Mr. Secretary and Ambassador Haley. So I just want to kind of walk through what the rest of the day and the week, and then we'll get to some questions.\nAs you know, this morning, the President had a call with German Chancellor Merkel who had extended a gracious invitation for the First Daughter and Assistant to the President, Ivanka Trump, to attend the W20 Summit. Tomorrow, Ivanka will be in Berlin at the W20 participating in a panel that is entitled, \"Inspiring Women: Scaling Up Women's Entrepreneurship.\" This follows the roundtable on vocational education and workforce development -- issues that are central both to Ivanka and the Chancellor's agenda that they hosted here at the White House in March.\nWhile in Germany, Ivanka will also visit a school for an interactive tour and discussion with students participating in the apprentice program. In commemoration of Holocaust Remembrance Day, she will visit the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe in Berlin. A readout of the President's and Chancellor Merkel's call should be out already.\nFollowing that call, the President spoke with Dr. Peggy Whitson, the commander of the International Space Station via video teleconference. As I told you guys last week, Dr. Whitson, who is on her third extended stay aboard the International Space Station, breaks the record for the most space time of any American astronaut. The President was honored to celebrate this incredible achievement by Dr. Whitson and the American space program, and discuss the exciting future of space exploration and space science -- including how the Inspire Women Act, which the President recently signed, ensures that NASA continues recruiting women for important STEM-related jobs in aerospace.\nAfter that, as I mentioned at the top, the President had a working lunch with U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and the other ambassadors of the countries that are part of the U.N. Security Council. Under the President's leadership, America has once again taken a leadership role on the world stage, and our global partners have welcomed this renewal of American diplomacy.\nLater on, this afternoon, the President will sign a proclamation on Holocaust Remembrance Day, part of the weeklong Days of Remembrance first held in 1979, and later established by Congress as our nation's commemoration of the Holocaust.\nTomorrow, as every President since the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum opened in 1993, President Trump will participate in a Days of Remembrance commemoration. As he said during his video message to delegates of the World Jewish Congress Plenary Assembly, the Trump administration is committed to stamping out prejudice and anti-Semitism everywhere it is found.\nFollowing the proclamation, the President will host a credential ceremony for newly appointed ambassadors. He will then have dinner with Senator and Mrs. McCain and Senator Lindsey Graham.\nLater this evening, the Vice President will return to Washington where he finished his time throughout the world. While in Hawaii today, the [Vice] President will have lunch with U.S. troops at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam and participate in an arrival ceremony at USPACOM before boarding Air Force Two for the ride home to Washington.\nAs we get closer to the President's 100th day in office, throughout the week the White House is hosting briefings and events to provide several opportunities for many folks in the press to hear directly from the administration and our officials on what we've achieved in the first 100 days, and what we're looking to continue to achieve on days 101, 102, 200, et cetera.\nThroughout the week, the President, Cabinet officials, and senior White House staff will be talking about the President's agenda on national, local media, and various platforms.\nFinally, I want to acknowledge the distressing reports regarding American citizens coming out of the Ukraine and North Korea. We're deeply saddened by the death of a paramedic, a United States citizen, serving in the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe -- Special Monitoring Mission. We extend our deepest condolences to his family, friends, and loved ones, and wish his colleagues who were injured in the blast a quick and speedy recovery.\nWe call on all parties to cooperate with the Special Monitoring Mission to allow it to fully investigate this incident. The tragic death of a staff member only serves to underline the urgent need for all sides, particularly the Russian-led separatist forces, to implement their commitments under the Minsk agreements.\nWe're also aware of reports a United States citizen was detained in North Korea over the weekend. The protection of United States citizens is one of our government's highest priorities. I would direct any further inquiries on this matter to the State Department.\nAlso on North Korea, on Wednesday, the White House campus will play host to a briefing for all U.S. -- 100 U.S. senators on the subject. The briefers will be Secretary Tillerson and Mattis, Director Coats and General Dunford. This is a Senate briefing convened by the Majority Leader, not a White House briefing. We are just serving as the location. For further questions, I'd direct you to the Majority Leader's office and the office of the four briefers.\nWith that, I'm glad to take a few questions.\nQ: Talking about the budget, how committed is -- this was asked earlier, but can you talk about how committed the President is to having the border wall funded this week or having some funding in that spending bill? And if it is not in there, will he sign it?\nMR. SPICER: Again, those negotiations continue with House and Senate leadership. Obviously, the money for our military and our border security and wall have been part of that request and that is something that really are the President's priorities heading in -- with respect to the CR and keeping the government open.\nI think we feel very confident where we're headed, and I'm not going to get ahead of the negotiations that are ongoing. Director Mulvaney has been very, very deep in those discussions and I expect there to be an announcement soon with what -- but I'm not going to start to take things on and off the table with respect to what the President may or may not do.\nPhil.\nQ: Yes, Sean, just doubling up on that question there about the CR debate and the funding, does he specifically expect there to be funding for the border wall, or would border security measures be enough to satisfy the President? And how do you differentiate between the two? For example, what could be funded in the CR that you could say is part of the wall even if it's not explicitly funding for the wall?\nMR. SPICER: There's obviously a lot of components to that. You've got fencing and drones, and again, I don't want to get ahead of those negotiations. They are ongoing. But the President's priorities have been very clear from the beginning.\nQ: Sean, just to follow up -- are we backing off from the wall? Are you saying it is on the table?\nMR. SPICER: No, we're saying that the President has made very clear that he's got two priorities in this continuing resolution -- number one, the increase in funding for the military; and number two, for our homeland border security and the wall. But I'm not going to start to get into -- we are having a negotiation with House and Senate leadership, and to prejudge where it ends up at this point would be -- would not be prudent.\nQ: Two questions for you. On the Syrian economic sanctions, how would the administration determine how effective they are?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think there's going to be a lot of ways. But I think first and foremost is to send a clear signal to make sure that they understand that we don't take their actions lightly and that we want to do everything we can to have stability in the region. So I think there's going to be a lot of ways in terms of their behavior going forward that we'll know whether they're working. But I think as the President has made clear and Secretary Mnuchin just did, I think we have a lot of tools at our disposal to try to achieve an outcome that brings stability to that region.\nQ: And my second one on North Korea. The fact that a third U.S. citizen has been detained by the regime in Pyongyang, does this make it more difficult for the President to negotiate through China to try to denuclearize North Korea?\nMR. SPICER: No. I think China -- and we noted it before, Ambassador Haley noted it in several interviews this morning -- but China has been very, very helpful in this process and continues to be. And I think we hope to see a change in behavior. But it is a very positive sign, the level of engagement that China has been -- has enacted.\nQ: Is the Trump administration calling for the release of this U.S. citizen currently being detained?\nMR. SPICER: Well, absolutely. I mean, we want to make sure that all of our citizens are protected and returned home. But the State Department is playing the lead on that.\nEamon.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. You know there's quite a bit of concern among Republicans on Capitol Hill about the federal deficit. When you roll out the tax plan on Wednesday, are you also going to include pay-fors in there, that is those things that raise revenue as well as those things that are tax cuts, so that conservatives can be confident that this won't blow a hole in the deficit?\nMR. SPICER: I think we will have further details. I'm not going to get ahead of the President's rollout, but I'm not going to -- the level of specificity in terms of the pay-fors and the cost, we'll have to see how comfortable the President is.\nJennifer.\nQ: Sean, can you tell us if the President is aware of the American pastor jailed in Turkey? And did he raise that with President Erdogan in the call he made to congratulate him?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to get into the specifics of the President's conversation. We're obviously aware of that action, and we're going to continue to work through the State Department on that.\nJordan.\nQ: Sean, can you explain why President Trump didn't use the word \"genocide\" to refer to the killing of 25 million Armenians in his statement today?\nMR. SPICER: Yes. The statement that was put out is consistent with the statements that have been put out for at least several of the past administrations. So I think if you look back to the language that President Obama, President Bush have used, the language the President used is consistent with all of that.\nQ: I have two questions on two different topics. First, the border wall, the logistics of that. Secretary Kelly said he still expects construction to start this summer. There are still a few ranchers in Texas and Arizona who welcome the security but are skeptical of giving up family-owned land that's been in their families for generations. So what is the White House message to them directly? And what -- can you guarantee that they will be compensated?\nMR. SPICER: We're going to -- we will do everything in accordance with the law. This has been an issue that has gone on several times as that issue has been raised over the last several decades -- excuse me -- several years. And so we will do everything in accordance with the law with respect to the land that's needed for that. But again, the Homeland Security Secretary understands what's going to be needed and will do surveys and the appropriate planning to make sure that we minimize that to the extent possible.\nQ: And on the next question on a different topic -- the FBI and Justice Department last week arrested two doctors in Michigan for allegedly performing genital mutilation on little girls, as young as six years old. It's the first case in the United States. What is the White House reaction to that case?\nMR. SPICER: We've talked before about having investigations and we don't comment on any pending investigations or actions by the Justice Department.\nMajor.\nQ: Is 100 days, as the President said on Twitter, a ridiculous benchmark, or an important one?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think obviously in the context of an entire administration, there is a lot that I think we feel very proud of what we've gotten done and taken care of. You look at the immigration piece in particular, border crossings way down. The number of executive orders and pieces of legislation the President has signed -- I think we feel very proud of what we've been able to accomplish and fulfill the promises that he's made to the American people.\nBut I think it's got to be kept in context. And I think that's -- there is sort of this artificial number that gets thrown out. So on --\nQ: What is the context?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I mean, the context is it's 100 days, and four years in your first term and eight years for two terms -- that I think --\nQ: In the campaign Mr. Trump introduced a contract with the American voter over 100 days --\nMR. SPICER: Right. And so, again, I think when you look at the number of pieces of legislation, the executive orders, business confidence, the U.S.'s role in the world -- there's a lot that we feel -- a lot of accomplishments that have occurred. And we feel very good about what we've done as we head up to this first 100 days. But I think you're going to continue to see a lot of action, a lot of results going into the second 100 days, the third 100 days, all the way through.\nQ: If in that 100 days there is no funding -- explicit funding for the wall, and there's no healthcare reform or repeal of Obamacare -- would the President consider that, and would he invite his supporters to consider that a conspicuous failure, based on the promises he made during the campaign?\nMR. SPICER: I think when you look at the totality of what we've accomplished on job creation, on immigration, on trade, it is unbelievable what he has been able to do. And so it's not -- you can cherry-pick any couple of things and say, okay, well, what about this and that. But I think when you look at it overall in terms of the drop in border crossings, if you look at consumer confidence, and the relationships that we've developed around the globe, and the accomplishments this President has had in protecting the country, in bringing back jobs and starting -- those have been unbelievably significant.\nAnd so to minimize that, or to look and pick out two or three things -- but I think, look, we're going to continue to push for healthcare reform. We feel very good about the direction that it's going in. It's been very positive. And I think the construction of a wall is going to continue to be an area that moves forward. But all of that stuff is happening just as the President asked for and committed to doing. Some of it has been a little slower, but mostly because of working through Congress and getting things done. But when you think about what he started -- he'll move forward on tax reform, healthcare, on immigration, on trade -- it's been a hugely successful first 100 days.\nQ: And without the President necessarily describing it as a failure or not, would he say that he's learned something about the process and how long things take that he perhaps didn't appreciate as a candidate? Maybe he over-promised on the speed with which he'd achieve these things?\nMR. SPICER: Look, with all due respect, I think that when you look at the list of things in each of the various areas that he's been able to do, I think he's very pleased --\nQ: I'm talking about some conspicuous campaign promises that, at rally after rally, he made and said, don't worry it's going to happen.\nMR. SPICER: Right. And I think on healthcare --\nQ: All I'm asking is, does he have a different awareness of how difficult those things are than he did as a candidate?\nMR. SPICER: I'm sure that there are things that you learn on the job, but I think that he is very proud of what he has set out to do and the progress that we've made. And I think you're going to see healthcare get done, but it's going to get done right, and that in particular is something that we're continuing to work at. We can't make people vote, but we've made significant progress and moved the legislation forward and improved it greatly. And I think that we are going to see progress on that.\nZeke.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Two questions on two different topics. First, to follow up on Jordan, and the other question is on the budget. Is the President willing to sign a continuing resolution that is not deficit-neutral or deficit-reducing? For instance --\nMR. SPICER: Sign a continuing resolution?\nQ: Yeah. Continuing resolutions that would increase the deficit.\nMR. SPICER: I have not seen a score on anything that's come out. And I think we'll have to wait and see what the final --\nQ: You're not ruling that out one way or --\nMR. SPICER: I'm not -- not at this point.\nQ: And following up on Jordan's question, the President talked a lot about -- he has not been shy about criticizing his predecessors for some of their missteps from both parties, and also hasn't -- has made a point of often balking (inaudible). So why not take this moment to label the killing of a million-and-a-half Armenians a genocide?\nMR. SPICER: I think, again, as I noted to Jordan, the statement that the President put out is consistent with the last several administrations.\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nMR. SPICER: I understand that. But it is perfectly in keeping with the language that's been used over and over again.\nJohn.\nQ: Would you agree with the assessment that some within the administration have that a vote on healthcare this week is very, very unlikely?\nMR. SPICER: I think the vote is going to get scheduled when Speaker Ryan and Leader McCarthy and Congressman Scalise determine that they have the votes and they feel confident. I think we've been very clear -- the President made it clear on Friday when he was walking back over from the Treasury Department -- that if it happens and we have the votes this week, great; if it's next week or the week after. But I think we want to make sure that we've got the votes and we're headed in the right direction before putting some kind of artificial deadline.\nQ: But would you think that this week is unlikely?\nMR. SPICER: I think that whenever the Speaker and the Leadership over at the House tell us that they feel confident that they have the votes, then we would encourage them to move forward. I hate to -- I'm not trying to not answer the question, but I think that's the answer. It comes down to when they feel as though they've got the commitments to push the bill forward.\nQ: But there was a push to try to get something on the legislative scoreboard by the 100th day. Does it look like that now will not happen?\nMR. SPICER: As I said, we have been very clear from here, and I think the President has been very clear in his comments that our goal is to get it done and get it done right, and get it done to make sure that we have the votes. I think there have been some -- I've read some background quotes and sources about when it -- but we've been very clear publicly about when we want to get that done.\nKelly.\nQ: The President has been very clear that Judge Gorsuch, now Justice Gorsuch, is a big part of his first 100 days' accomplishments. And the White House, in the rollout about the 100 days, said there would be a dinner with the President and all the justices of the Supreme Court. Now that is off the list. Is the dinner not happening, or is not publicly being talked about because it's wrapped up in the politics of the White House?\nMR. SPICER: I think we've moved some things around on the President's schedule this week, but we hope to have something at some point.\nQ: Was it unfortunate to sort of sweep the High Court into the politics of 100 days?\nMR. SPICER: No. I think having a relationship and meeting with the Supreme Court at some point would be a great idea and something that we hope to have on the schedule some point soon.\nKaitlan.\nQ: Can you explain the President's change of thought on DACA?\nMR. SPICER: I think he's been consistent about two things. One, that he has a heart. He wants to make sure that he does what's in the interest of children in particular. But secondly, I think the President's priorities since he took office have been very clear that the focus would be on folks who presented a danger to public safety. And that's what it's been, and that's where it continues to be. And I think he is someone who understands the issue and the priorities that need to get laid out by this country. And so everything that he has done has been consistent with what he said from the get-go.\nQ: But I understand that he said that the criminals would leave first, but last August he said that DACA defied federal law and was illegal. So does he still think it's illegal?\nMR. SPICER: I understand. And I think that his comments that he made last week, that he understands that in a lot of cases this involves families and small children who have been here, and he has a heart, and we're going to work through the immigration --\nQ: But does he still think it's illegal?\nMR. SPICER: I understand. What I'm trying to do is answer the question. I think the President wants to make sure that he addresses the issue of illegal immigration and all of its components in terms of visa reform, border security, the wall, all of these things, in a system of priorities. And right now, the priority is to make sure that folks who present a public-safety concern to the United States and to our citizens are dealt with first, and that's what's happened. He's also very pleased that, through his action and his vision for how he wants to move forward on this, sees a huge drop of illegal border crossing. That is a big accomplishment for this presidency and is something that we're obviously very proud of.\nQ: Border crossing is a big thing, but amnesty is a big part. Does he --\nMR. SPICER: I understand that. I've just walked through the question.\nJonathan.\nQ: Sean, how confident are you that there will not be a shutdown? Can you, from that podium, guarantee that there will not be a government shutdown?\nMR. SPICER: I can't guarantee anything. (Laughter.)\nQ: How close can you get to confidence --\nMR. SPICER: But I think that the work that Director Mulvaney and others have made in these negotiations has been very positive. They feel very confident that that won't happen.\nQ: So he won't insist that his priorities get funded on the border, the wall, or increase security?\nMR. SPICER: That's not what I said. I said that I think that --\nQ: Is he willing to shut down the government to accomplish that?\nMR. SPICER: No, it's not -- look, they are currently negotiating. We feel very confident that they understand the President's priorities and that we'll come to an agreement by the end of Friday.\nQ: And on the 100 days, if I could just follow up. The contract with the American voter that the President signed included 10 pieces of legislation. Right now he's over 10, and only one of those has been introduced.\nMR. SPICER: Right. And I think we're going to continue to work with Congress -- as he says in that document, I will work with Congress to achieve these things; we are going to continue to work with Congress to achieve those.\nQ: But why have nine of them not even been introduced yet?\nMR. SPICER: I think when you look at what he has done in terms of the Supreme Court justice, the executive orders, the number of legislation, there's a lot that has gotten done. I don't think anyone -- I remember very clearly the first few weeks and still, to some extent, the comments that got made about the pace that we were keeping and we have kept. The President has been extremely busy. And I think when you recognize the amount of issues that he's tackled and the amount of progress that he's made, it is very significant, and we will continue to present all that throughout the week. But again, as I said to Major, I think you can look at a few of these areas and nitpick a couple of them, but I think overall he has signed a record number of executive orders, he has rolled back regulatory reforms --\nQ: But this isn't nitpicking. These are 10 pieces of legislation --\nMR. SPICER: No, I understand that, but --\nQ: -- he promised to take action on in his 100 days.\nMR. SPICER: But I don't think there's any question that the President has done a significant amount for the American people on the issues that he has put forward during the campaign.\nQ: And just to be clear, you're not describing the wall and healthcare as nitpicking, are you?\nMR. SPICER: No, I'm not -- those pieces are not small. But I'm saying in terms of overall, what he has accomplished, has been unbelievably significant when you talk about all of the other areas -- the regulatory relief, the efforts that he's made on immigration, on trade. All of those issues. And again, what I'm trying to say is, when you look at everything that he's done and the amount that he's accomplished in these first 100 days, I think you can go back and find an area, one or two, and say, okay, well, he didn't do this. But I think you have to look at it in totality of what he actually did get done.\nJim.\nQ: Sean, on the wall, why is there even a discussion about shutting down the government over paying for the wall? Isn't Mexico supposed to pay for the wall?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think, Jim, the President has made very clear that initially we needed to get the funding going, and there's several mechanisms to make sure that that happens. That funding piece will happen in due time.\nQ: But that is a promise that the President made during the campaign time and again --\nMR. SPICER: I understand that.\nQ: -- that Mexico would pay for the wall. And now we're having a discussion that the government might shut down over the wall and who's going to pay for it.\nMR. SPICER: Right. So a couple things. One, as I pointed out to Jonathan, we feel very confident the government is not going to shut down. Number two is, I think the President has been very clear in the past about the fact that -- and this is not a new thing; he talked about this -- that in order to get the ball rolling on border security and the wall, that he was going to have to use the current appropriations process but he would make sure that that promise would be kept as far as the payment of it.\nQ: And just a real quick follow-up. If border crossings are down -- and that's a talking point that the White House uses time and again -- is the wall even necessary?\nMR. SPICER: Absolutely. The wall does several things.\nQ: How can the border crossings be down when the President is saying, well, we're going to have all these drugs flowing in if we don't have a wall?\nMR. SPICER: Because you can't -- just because you have a couple good months in a year, I think you want to make sure that you take prudent long-term steps. So the President is going to fulfill it, and frankly, it's a promise that he made to the American people. I think if you are coming in from our southern border, he has taken a lot of steps so far that has deterred border crossing. But this is a permanent step that will extend beyond his presidency. Eight years from now, the next President will have that wall in place to make sure that it doesn't continue.\nQ: So Mexico is going to pay for it?\nMR. SPICER: That's right. Thank you. Alexis.\nQ: Sean, this might relate to Jim's question, too, but on Wednesday -- I have two questions. On Wednesday, when we see the outline that Secretary Mnuchin was just describing, will the President help aim Congress toward his decision about whether the border adjustment tax is the right idea, and also, related to that, whether the pay-fors for the wall that might be of interest to lawmakers will become evident as part of the outline of what he'd like to do in terms of taxes?\nMR. SPICER: Right. Well, I don't mean to evade that, but I think there's a reason he chose -- we're waiting until Wednesday to have the details that he wants to share out. We got a couple days before that happens, so I'm going to have to ask you to wait 48 hours.\nQ: Can you say whether we will have a generally better idea? Will we have a generally better idea of where his thinking is?\nMR. SPICER: I think you will have a better idea of where the President stands on tax reform and what he wants to accomplish. Yes.\nJohn.\nQ: Wait, wait, I have one follow-up. When you were just describing, and Secretary Mnuchin was describing, achieving economic growth of 3 percent or higher, which is slightly lower than what the President talked about in the campaign, which was a very ambitious goal of 1 percent -- I'm just trying to figure out, what is the timeline for that? Is the President thinking he would like to achieve 3 percent or higher in his first term because of the headwinds that obviously the United States is facing abroad? I mean, that's a very ambitious goal still -- 3 percent.\nMR. SPICER: Well, and I think that he has taken a lot of steps not just on the tax side, but on the regulatory side, as well, that I think are clearly already paying dividends in terms of what you're seeing -- we've talked about this before -- manufacturing come back and jobs come back. And I think there's going to be a renewed commitment of manufacturers, American companies to bring back jobs, to grow, to hire, to expand here in the United States. And so I think that that growth will proceed the President's actions, both on the tax front and on the regulatory side.\nJohn.\nQ: Thanks so much, Sean. As you know, the first go-around at replacing Obamacare was not successful. Since then, are you any closer to getting 218 votes in the House to pass or replace the Affordable Care Act?\nMR. SPICER: Yes. (Laughter.)\nQ: Got a number?\nQ: Yeah, elaborate a little more than \"yes\"?\nMR. SPICER: Well, first of all, we only need 216. You're making it a little tougher on us right now. But I do think that we have seen progress with members in terms of some of the changes that have been made to make it a stronger bill. But we're getting close. And as I mentioned at the outset, when I think the President feels confident that -- or when the leadership of the House tells him that they feel confident that they have the votes, then I'm sure they'll call a vote. But that's up to them to decide.\nQ: And a separate one, obviously a different topic, and that's the election over the weekend in France. Any comment on the results that came out of France over the weekend? Would the President be satisfied with either alternative, Macron or Le Pen?\nMR. SPICER: Yeah, obviously it's up to the people of France to decide who their next leader is. And we respect the decision that they make in May. So let's -- our job is to work with whomever the French people choose.\nAnita.\nQ: Two questions. One, on the budget, the spending plan, what is the President doing? I understand Mick Mulvaney and others are doing things. Is he calling members? I don't see anything on his schedule for this week. Are members coming over?\nMR. SPICER: As needed, he'll be involved. I think the legislative team has been giving him updates, and as he needed --\nQ: Has he been calling members?\nMR. SPICER: He's talked to members. I just mentioned he's having dinner tonight with Senator McCain and Senator Graham. He's had lots of discussion with members at various times. This is not -- we're not at a position now where he is actively engaging the way he was at, say the end of healthcare. I think as his team tells him that he needs phone calls, but he is actively monitoring and been given updates by the senior team that is working with the Hill.\nQ: When he calls, is he talking about his priorities? I would like you to include --\nMR. SPICER: I think his priority have been crystal-clear. I mean, remember, starting in the first week of March, Director Mulvaney engaged with appropriators on the House side. And I'm not sure when he started. So this has been an ongoing discussion now, almost for eight weeks, with the senior team here and appropriators in the House in particular.\nQ: Okay. And then on the second issue, on the 100 days, someone mentioned the President tweeted that it was a ridiculous timetable or whatever. Why is the White House doing so much this week? You have indicated that all these activities this week, from hearing from different people, are because of the 100 days. Why do this 100-day push if it's a ridiculous amount of time?\nMR. SPICER: I think we've gotten a fairly decent amount of inquiries from you and your colleagues. And so in order to answer those inquiries --\nQ: So you're doing something for us?\nMR. SPICER: Yeah, well, you know, we're givers. (Laughter.) But I don't think there's anyone in this room that hasn't lodged a request to say, \"We're writing a story on the 100-day mark, we're doing this on the 100-day mark.\" And so we want to make sure that we answer your questions as truthfully as possible and as thoroughly and comprehensively. So we will have to fulfill all of these requests that are coming in from you and your colleagues, but I also think that we are very proud, and the President is very proud, of what he's been able to accomplish in the first 100 days.\nAnd as we sprint towards these final 100 days, there's two things. One, I think because of the inquiries we've had, we want to make sure we take an opportunity to make sure that people understand how much he's done in all the different areas, but we also want to start talking about the next 100 days and what else is left to be done, and how we're going to continue to work hard to get all of that done. But there's a lot that has been accomplished, and I think it's appropriate to comment and to share with the American people all the things that he has done to fulfill the pledges that he made to the American people.\nQ: And just to clarify, are we going to hear, prior to the rally on Saturday, are we going to hear directly from him? There was some talk of a press conference.\nMR. SPICER: I'll have further updates on the schedule going forward.\nQ: So there will be one, or maybe not?\nMR. SPICER: Huh?\nQ: The press conference --\nMR. SPICER: We're working on some scheduling issues for the rest of the week, and I'll make sure I give you an update as we move forward.\nKristen.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. I just want to circle back on healthcare, because at the top of the President's listed agenda items for the first 100 days was repealing and replacing Obamacare. So does the President want to, expect to see, a vote on healthcare this week?\nMR. SPICER: Look, he'd love to do it. If the Speaker and the Majority Leader and the Whip come and tell him that they've got the votes, then we'd love to do it. I think his goal isn't to fit it into a finite timetable, as he mentioned on Friday. If it happens this week, that's great. If it happens next week, that's great too. The goal is to get it done, and get it done right. And so we're not going to jam it through just for the sake of it.\nQ: So he's concerned about potentially rushing it through.\nMR. SPICER: No, no, he --\nQ: I hear what you're saying is he doesn't want it to happen this week just to meet that.\nMR. SPICER: Exactly.\nQ: Okay. Let me ask you about tax reform. I know you don't want to get ahead of the announcement on Wednesday.\nMR. SPICER: Thank you.\nQ: But there's a sense that it is more realistic to pursue targeted tax cuts as opposed to broad tax reform. Will we, on Wednesday, see a proposal for targeted tax cuts?\nMR. SPICER: As you stated in your question, I'll let the President and the team speak on Wednesday with respect to what they're going to outline, but I'm not going to get --\nQ: But does the President think that it's realistic to do broad tax reform without having to repeal or replace Obamacare?\nMR. SPICER: I think that the President said that he's going to --\nQ: Is it possible, mathematically?\nMR. SPICER: There's a lot of things that are possible, but let's let the President -- he made a commitment to get it out on Wednesday, so let's be patient and wait until Wednesday.\nQ: And just one more.\nMR. SPICER: Of course. (Laughter.)\nQ: Is there a plan for infrastructure reform in the works? Will we get that before --\nMR. SPICER: That's another thing that's on the list, but I think we seem to have our hands full right now with healthcare and tax reform. He's obviously still committed to seeing infrastructure, something he's talked about a lot in terms of roads and bridges and rebuilding things. But let's get these first two things moving. But I think you're going to see a continued commitment to infrastructure as well.\nQ: It's one of the things that could potentially have bipartisan support. Is there urgency to get infrastructure reform passed?\nMR. SPICER: (Laughter.) So either we're doing too much or we're not doing enough. But I think -- look, he has made it very clear that that is a priority of his. As you point out, it's something that I think both sides of the aisle, of both chambers, probably agree on. There's a public-private partnership that could really benefit our infrastructure in terms of the financing piece of this. We'll have further details on that moving forward, though.\nThank you, guys, very much. I'll see you tomorrow. Have a great Monday.\nEND 2:14 P.M.

Do you hear me?\nNASA Mission Control. Station, this is Houston. Are you ready for the event?\nISS Expedition 51 Cmdr. Peggy A. Whitson. Yes, we're ready for the event.\nNASA Mission Control. White House, this is Mission Control, Houston. Please call Station for a voice check.\nThe President. Do you hear me?\nCmdr. Whitson. Yes, sir. We have you loud and clear.\nThe President. Well, that's what we like—great American equipment that works. And this isn't easy. [Laughter]\nI want to say it's very exciting——\nCmdr. Whitson. Yes, we like that too.\nThe President. ——to be here today—very, very exciting—and to speak to you live with three brave American astronauts. These are our finest. These are great, great Americans, great people. Two join us from orbit aboard the International Space Station: Commander Peggy Whitson and Colonel Jack Fischer. And Peggy Whitson has been setting records, and we're going to talk about that very soon.\nI'm here in the Oval Office, along with my daughter Ivanka and astronaut Kate Rubins, who recently returned from space and from the Space Station. Together, we are being joined by students all across America, thousands and thousands of students who are learning—they're learning about space, learning about a lot of other things—and they're watching this conversation from the classroom. And all over, we have astronauts and we have everybody, who are flying right now, 17,000 miles per hour. That's about as fast as I've ever heard. I wouldn't want to be flying 17,000 miles an hour. But that's what you do.\nPeggy, Jack, and Kate, I know that America's students are thrilled to hear from you. But first, I want to say that this is a very special day in the glorious history of American spaceflight. Today, Commander Whitson, you have broken the record for the most total time spent in space by an American astronaut—534 days and counting. That's an incredible record to break. And on behalf of our Nation and, frankly, on behalf of the world, I'd like to congratulate you. That is really something. And I'd like to know, how does it feel to have broken such a big and important record?\nCmdr. Whitson. Well, it's actually a huge honor to break a record like this, but it's an honor for me basically to be representing all the folks at NASA who make this spaceflight possible and who make me setting this record feasible. And so it's a very exciting time to be at NASA. We are all very much looking forward, as directed by your new NASA bill—we're excited about the missions to Mars in the 2030s. And so we're actually—physically, have hardware on the ground that's being built for the SLS rocket that's going to take us there. And, of course, the hardware being built now is going to be for the test flights that will eventually get us there.\nBut it's a very exciting time, and I'm so proud of the team.\nThe President. Great. And what are we learning from having you spending your time up there? I know so much research is done; I'm getting a glimpse of some of it right here in the Oval Office. What are we learning by being in space?\nCmdr. Whitson. Well, I think probably the International Space Station is providing a key bridge from us doing—living on Earth to going somewhere into deep space. So on those Mars missions, we need to better understand how microgravity is really affecting our body, and we need to understand it in great detail. So, many of the studies are looking at the human body. We're also looking at things that involve operations of a space vehicle on these long-duration missions and the technological advancements that will be required.\nFor instance, on a multiyear Mars mission, we're going to need to be able to close the life support system, and that means we, right now, for instance, are taking solar power that we collect, and using it to break apart water into oxygen and hydrogen. The oxygen, we breathe, of course. We use the hydrogen, combine it back with the CO2 that we take out of the air, and make more water. But water is such a precious resource up here that we also are cleaning up our urine and making it drinkable. And it's really not as bad as it sounds.\nThe President. Well, that's good. I'm glad to hear that. [Laughter] Better you than me. [Laughter] I will say, Colonel Fischer, you just arrived, and how was your trip? Complicated? Easy? How did it go?\nISS Expedition 51 Flight Engineer Jack D. Fischer. Oh, sir, it was awesome. It made even my beloved F-22 feel a little bit underpowered. It was a—I launched in a Russian vehicle with my Russian friend, Fyodor Yurchikhin, from Kazakhstan. Got the immediate perspective change as we got to orbit, and I saw that frail, thin blue line of life around the Earth. Six hours later, we're docked to the station. The next day, I install an experiment in the Japanese module that's going to be looking at new drugs and how we can make those drugs for muscular dystrophy, Alzheimer's, multi-drug-resistant bacteria—all sorts of things. Couple hours later, I watched our crewmate, Thomas Pesquet, a Frenchman, drive a Canadian robotic arm to capture a spaceship from Virginia, carrying 3½ tons of cargo and science that's going to keep us busy for the next few months, and dock that to the station.\nSir, it's amazing. Oh, and then, you know, now I'm talking to the President of the United States while hanging from a wall. [Laughter] It's amazing. The International Space Station is, by far, the best example of international cooperation and what we can do when we work together in the history of humanity. And I am so proud to be a part of it. And it's also just cool. [Laughter] Like, yesterday I had—well, there you go—there's our resident space ninja doing the gravity demonstration. And yesterday morning, I had my coffee in floaty ball form, and, sir, it was delicious. [Laughter] So, it's awesome.\nThe President. Tell me, Mars—what do you see a timing for actually sending humans to Mars? Is there a schedule? And when would you see that happening?\nCmdr. Whitson. Well, I think as your bill directed, it will be approximately in the 2030s. The—as I mentioned, we actually are building hardware to test the new heavy launch vehicle, and this vehicle will take us further than we've ever been away from this planet. So, unfortunately, spaceflight takes a lot of time and money, so getting there will require some international cooperation to get the—it to be a planetwide approach in order to make it successful, just because it is a very expensive endeavor. But it is so worthwhile doing.\nThe President. Well, we want to try and do it during my first term or, at worst, during my second term. So we'll have to speed that up a little bit, okay?\nCmdr. Whitson. [Laughter] We'll do our best.\nThe President. I'm sure you will. And I have great respect for you folks. It's amazing what you do. And I just want to introduce another great one. Kate Rubins is with us today, and she has been so impressive in research and so many other things having to do with NASA. And, Kate, I understand you're the first person to sequence DNA in space. Can you tell us about that?\nNASA astronaut Kathleen H. Rubins. Yes. So that was actually just this last summer, and it's a real example of what we can do with technology and innovation. We've gotten a sequencer down to the size of your cell phone, and we were actually able to fly that onboard the Space Station and sequence DNA. It's not just the technology demonstration, but we can actually use that to do things like detect microbes on the Space Station, look at astronaut health. We can easily use that in Earth-based settings, too, to look for disease outbreaks and to do rural health care as well.\nThe President. That's fantastic. That is really great. I saw some of the work, and it's incredible. You know, I've been dealing with politicians so much, I'm so much more impressed with these people. [Laughter] You have no idea.\nNow, speaking of another impressive person, Ivanka, you've been very much interested in this program.\nAssistant to the President Ivanka M. Trump. Yes, it's amazing.\nThe President. Tell us something about it.\nMs. Trump. Hi, Dr. Whitson. First of all, congratulations on your incredible milestone today. You may know that my father recently signed the Inspire Women Act to encourage female participation in STEM fields across all aerospace areas, and really with a focus on NASA. So encouraging women and girls to pursue STEM careers is a major priority for this administration.\nAnd today we are sitting with an amazing example of that—Dr. Rubins, and you, Dr. Whitson. So I would love to hear from you, what was the impetus for you to get involved in the sciences?\nMs. Rubins. Yes, so when I was around 15, I actually went to a conference——\nCmdr. Whitson. Actually, I——\nMs. Rubins. ——and that was very inspiring for me. It was sort of the beginning of recombinant DNA and understanding biology. And so just that exposure to scientists and the kinds of things that you can do with science and technology innovation.\nMs. Trump. Amazing. Dr. Whitson?\nCmdr. Whitson. For me, it was actually the Apollo program was my inspiration, and that was when it became a dream to become an astronaut. But I don't really think it became a goal until I graduated from high school, when the first female astronauts were selected. And seeing those role models, and with the encouragement of my parents and various mentors in college and graduate school, and when I started working at Rice, that's what made it possible, I think, to become an astronaut. And it took me a lot longer to become an astronaut than I ever really wanted it to take—[laughter]—but I do think I'm better at my job because of the journey.\nMs. Trump. You're an incredible inspiration to us all. So I would also like to ask you one more question. I'm incredibly curious, as I'm sure all the students across the country are, to know what a day in the life in space is like. Could you share what a typical day looks like, what the challenges are, just any special moments?\nCmdr. Whitson. Well, a typical day, we work—wake up and look at the messages from the ground, because we have a huge ground team that's working overnight to prepare changes or the details of the tests that we're going to be performing at the course—over the course of the day. So first thing I do is check out that, see what's changed.\nBut on any given day, it can be so dramatically different. On one day, we might be focusing on science. On another day, we might be repairing the carbon dioxide removal system. On another day, soon Jack and I are going to do a spacewalk. We talked about, last Saturday, we did robotics operations. I love the diversity of the different activities that we do. Plus, you know, we have over 200 investigations ongoing onboard the Space Station, and I just think that's phenomenal part of the day.\nOf course, there's also just the living and, onboard the space station, it's such a unique and novel environment. Nothing that we're used to on the ground. And it's so special to just be in zero gravity. So—but Jack is the new guy here, and I think he can probably give you a better perspective on what that's like. It's still on.\nFlight Engineer Fischer. Well, you know, I—everything here—my dad always said that if you love what you do, you never work a day in your life. And we work really hard up here, but it's not really work, it's just fun. It's like playing fort almost, only you're changing the world while you do it.\nAnd then on the off time, the other morning I was working out, and on our machine that we work out on, right below it is the Cupola window. And so when you're on the kind of device where you do crunches, every time you come up, you see out the window. And it's awesome because you kind of go, crunch: \"Oh, my gosh, that's beautiful! I've got to do that again.\" Crunch, \"Oh my gosh, that's beautiful.\" It's awesome. Everything we do here is fun, and it feels so great to know that we're making a difference on the ground and for the future of humanity as well. So it's an incredible, incredible job.\nThe President. You're making a great difference, I have to say. And this is a very exciting time for our country, and you see what's happening with our country in terms of jobs, in terms of business, and there's such excitement and such enthusiasm. Many American entrepreneurs are racing into space. I have many friends that are so excited about space. They want to get involved in space from the standpoint of entrepreneurship and business.\nTell us about the opportunities that could exist for the next generation of scientists and engineers. Is that something that you think a student—because you have so many students, hundreds of thousands watching—is that something that you think that students should be focusing, or should they be thinking about other subjects? What do you think are the opportunities for young students wanting to be involved in space?\nFlight Engineer Fischer. Sir, absolutely. I think that this is probably the most exciting time in space exploration, certainly in my lifetime. We are about to just go—just have an explosion of activity. There is so much involvement on the Space Station with commercial industries and commercial partners. We have an entire program to manage the science. NASA has done a wonderful job of seeding a new industry with the Commercial Crew Program and the Commercial Cargo Program so that we can build the infrastructure we need for the future exploration.\nOne thing I love about American entrepreneurs is, once you get them going, you better stand out of their way because they're going to start chucking. And we're about to that point. NASA is taking on that expensive, hard, complex task of going further and deeper into space with the wonderful new rocket, Space Launch System and Orion. And then, as soon as that's—as soon as we break open that door, this incredible infrastructure that we've been building is going to be right there to pick up the baton and continue into the stars.\nI would say to all the students that are watching, the time to get excited is now. If you aren't studying science and math, you might want to think about that because there—our future in the stars starts now, and you can be a part of that if, like Dr. Whitson, you can find that passion and work really hard. And we're going to find a permanent foothold in the stars for humanity if you do that.\nThe President. Well, thank you. So well said. And I have to say, there's tremendous military application in space. We're rebuilding our military like never before. We're ordering equipment, and we're going to have the strongest military that we've ever had, the strongest military that the world has ever seen, and there's been no time where we need it more. And I'm sure that every student watching wants to know, what is next for Americans in space.\nI'm very proud that I just signed a bill committing NASA to the aim of sending American astronauts to Mars. So we'll do that. I think we'll do it a lot sooner than we're even thinking. So which one of you is ready to go to Mars? Are you ready? And I think you're ready. I know you're ready, right? [Laughter] We just discussed that. She'd like to go to Mars very quickly. Who's ready to go to Mars up there?\nCmdr. Whitson. We are absolutely ready to go to Mars. It's going to be a fantastic journey getting there, and very exciting times, and all of us would be happy to go. But I want all the young people out there to recognize that the real steps are going to be taken in a few years. And so by studying math, science, engineering, any kind of technology, you're going to have a part in that, and that will be very exciting.\nThe President. I just want to thank you very much. And, Dr. Whitson, I just—congratulations. Amazing. What an amazing thing that you've done. Everybody here—I know your family—but everybody here is incredibly proud of the record you just broke. I hope that every young American watching today finds, in your example, a reason to love space and think about space because many great things are going to come out, tremendous discoveries in medicine and so many other fields.\nSo thank you very much. I want to say God bless you, God bless America. We are very, very proud of you, and very proud of your bravery. Thank you very much. Good job. Thank you very much.\nCmdr. Whitson.

[Laughter] For one, you know, I heard there were a lot of very angry spouses—[laughter]—and this is their first time to the White House. So it's a great honor for those of you that brought your wife or spouse.\nAs you know, the United States holds the Presidency of the Security Council this month, and I'm glad that we are continuing the tradition of hosting the Council's Ambassadors in our Nation's Capital. It's our great honor, believe me.\nI want to thank Ambassador Nikki Haley for her outstanding leadership and for acting as my personal Envoy on the Security Council. She's doing a good job. Now, does everybody like Nikki? Because if you don't—[laughter]—otherwise, she can easily be replaced. [Laughter] Right? No, we won't do that, I promise. We won't do that. She's doing a fantastic job. And everyone, I see—even as we took pictures before—the friendship that you've developed, all of you together. That's really a fantastic thing.\nThe mission of the United Nations and the U.N. Security Council is to maintain international peace and security. These are important aims and shared interests. But as we look around the world, it's clear that there is much work for you to achieve. You're going to be very busy people, I suspect, over these coming months and years.\nOur Nation faces serious and growing threats, and many of them stem from problems that have been unaddressed for far too long. In fact, the United Nations doesn't like taking on certain problems. But I have a feeling that people in this room—and I know for a fact that Nikki feels very, very strongly about taking on problems that really people steered away from.\nI encourage the Security Council to come together and take action to counter all of these many threats. On Syria, the Council failed again this month to respond to Syria's use of chemical weapons. A great disappointment; I was very disappointed by that.\nThe status quo in North Korea is also unacceptable, and the Council must be prepared to impose additional and stronger sanctions on North Korean nuclear and ballistic missile programs. This is a real threat to the world, whether we want to talk about it or not. North Korea is a big world problem, and it's a problem we have to finally solve. People have put blindfolds on for decades, and now it's time to solve the problem.\nFor the United Nations to play an effective role in solving these and other security challenges, big reforms will be required. In addition, we must also take a close look at the U.N. budget. Costs have been—absolutely gone out of control. But I will say this: If we do a great job, I care much less about the budget, because you're talking about peanuts compared to the important work you're doing. You really are. You're talking about the most important things ever. And I must say, I'm a budget person. You see the way I'm talking about NATO, the same thing, but if you do a great job at the United Nations, I feel much differently about it, because we're talking pennies compared to the kind of lives and money that you'll be saving. The United States, just one of 193 countries in the U.N., pays for 22 percent of the budget and almost 30 percent of the United Nations peacekeeping, which is unfair. We need the member states to come together to eliminate inefficiency and bloat and to ensure that no one nation shoulders a disproportionate share of the burden militarily or financially. And this is only fair to our taxpayers.\nI look forward to a productive discussion about our shared role in keeping the peace, advancing reforms, and getting everyone to do their fair share.\nI also want to say to you that I have long felt the United Nations is an underperformer, but has tremendous potential. There are those people that think it's an underperformer and will never perform. I think—and I think especially I'm so happy with the job that Nikki is doing and our representatives—but Nikki and the group—and I see the relationship that she has already developed.\nI think that the United Nations has tremendous potential—tremendous potential—far greater than what I would say any other candidate in the last 30 years would have even thought to say. I don't think it's lived up—I know it hasn't lived up—to the potential. I mean, I see a day when there's a conflict where the United Nations, you get together, and you solve the conflict. You just don't see the United Nations, like, solving conflicts. I think that's going to start happening now. I can see it. And the United Nations will get together and solve conflicts. It won't be two countries; it will be the United Nations mediating or arbitrating with those countries.\nSo I see fantastic potential and fantastic things ahead for the United Nations. And I have to say, it's a tremendous honor to know you and to meet you. And Nikki has given me a little briefing on each and every one of you, and I must tell you—I will tell you, you know, I'm a very blunt person, if she didn't like you, I would tell you right now—[laughter]—but she gets along with everybody and respects everybody in this room.\nI'll end by saying that—unless you would rather not do it—so we have an office in the White House, you may have heard of it, it's called the Oval Office. So I thought what we'd do is we'll go down as a group, and we'll take some pictures in the Oval Office. I know you've never seen it. Nobody has—seems to get to see the Oval Office very much, but we're going to show you the Oval Office. So we'll go down, take some pictures in the Oval Office, and we'll have a good luncheon, and we'll talk about the United Nations, and we'll talk about peace.\nThank you all very much for being here. It's a great honor, and I'm glad you brought your spouses. [Laughter] Thank you.", "timestamp": "2017-04-24", "title": "Remarks at a Working Lunch With United Nations Security Council Ambassadors"}

By the end of World War II, six million Jews had been brutally slaughtered. The Nazis also targeted other groups for persecution and murder, including Roma (Gypsies), persons with mental and physical disabilities, Soviet prisoners of war, Jehovah's Witnesses, Slavs and other peoples of Europe, gays, and political opponents.\nThe United States stands shoulder to shoulder with the survivors of the Holocaust, their families, and the descendants of those who were murdered.

By sharing their experiences and wisdom, they continue to fuel our resolve to advance human rights and to combat antisemitism and other forms of hatred.\nDuring this week in 1945, American and Allied forces liberated the concentration camp at Dachau and other Nazi death camps, laying bare to the world the unconscionable horror of the Holocaust. We must remain vigilant against hateful ideologies and indifference. Every generation must learn and apply the lessons of the Holocaust so that such horror, atrocity, and genocide never again occur.

Federal law explicitly states that \"a Federal, State or Local government entity or official may not prohibit, or in any way restrict, any government entity or official from sending to, or receiving from, the Immigration and Naturalization Service information regarding the citizenship or immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of any individual.\" 8 U.S.C. 1373(a). That means, according to Congress, a city that prohibits its officials from providing information to federal immigration authorities -- a sanctuary city -- is violating the law. Sanctuary cities, like San Francisco, block their jails from turning over criminal aliens to Federal authorities for deportation. These cities are engaged in the dangerous and unlawful nullification of Federal law in an attempt to erase our borders.\nOnce again, a single district judge -- this time in San Francisco -- has ignored Federal immigration law to set a new immigration policy for the entire country. This decision occurred in the same sanctuary city that released the 5-time deported illegal immigrant who gunned down innocent Kate Steinle in her father's arms. San Francisco, and cities like it, are putting the well-being of criminal aliens before the safety of our citizens, and those city officials who authored these policies have the blood of dead Americans on their hands. This San Francisco judge's erroneous ruling is a gift to the criminal gang and cartel element in our country, empowering the worst kind of human trafficking and sex trafficking, and putting thousands of innocent lives at risk.\nThis case is yet one more example of egregious overreach by a single, unelected district judge. Today's ruling undermines faith in our legal system and raises serious questions about circuit shopping. But we are confident we will ultimately prevail in the Supreme Court, just as we will prevail in our lawful efforts to impose immigration restrictions necessary to keep terrorists out of the United States.\nIn the meantime, we will pursue all legal remedies to the sanctuary city threat that imperils our citizens, and continue our efforts to ramp up enforcement to remove the criminal and gang element from our country. Ultimately, this is a fight between sovereignty and open borders, between the rule of law and lawlessness, and between hardworking Americans and those who would undermine their safety and freedom.", "timestamp": "2017-04-25", "title": "Statement on the Sanctuary Cities Ruling"}

As you guys knows, we're going to go through an EO for tomorrow. The speaker this evening is Secretary Zinke. This is embargoed until 9:00 p.m. It is on the record, so everything discussed here will be on the record. The embargo is until 9:00 p.m. tonight.\nAgain, this falls underneath Kelly's issue area, so if you have any additional follow-up questions, please reach out to Kelly Love. For those of you on the phone, there will be a handout during this session, so if you would like the handout please email Kelly as well, and we will get it to you.\nWith that, I'll turn it over.\nSECRETARY ZINKE: So I'll read this and then I'll answer some questions. Tomorrow, the President will come to the Department of Interior, to my office, and sign the executive order to review the Antiquities Act. The executive order will direct me, as the Secretary, to review prior monument designations and to suggest legislative changes or modifications to the monuments. The monument designation period stretches from 1 January 1996 under which the act -- and it has to include acts and monuments that are 100,000 acres or more -- so the beginning date is January 1st, 1996, and the other condition is they have to be a total of 100,000 acres or more. That should include about 24 to 40 monuments. That gives you kind of a thumbnail.\nThe executive order directs the Interior to provide an interim report to the President within 45 days of the day of the order and a final report to the President within 120 days of that order.\nFor the record, in the last 20 years, in particular, that would cover about, oh, tens of millions of acres to include marine area sanctuaries. Some of these areas were put off limits for traditional uses, like farming, ranching, timber harvest, mining, oil and gas exploration, fishing, and motorized recreation.\nThe designations on kind of the bookends are the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument of 1996. And that was the first BLM land designation, all the way to really the Bears Ears National Monument in 2016, which has been in the news a lot. So those are the kind of two bookends. Again, it's monuments that are 100,000 acres or larger, so it hits the big ones.\nThe President's -- the authority on such matters is singular, so you know. There's no requirement for public input before the designation of a monument and there's no NEPA requirement. Normally, when you do a land use project, we normally NEPA. The Antiquities Act is the exception. Again, we don't have to go through legislative process; the President determines it, and it does not have to go through NEPA.\nIn this case, the administration, as you all know, has heard from members of Congress and states and, in some cases, the designation of the monuments may have resulted in loss of jobs, reduced wages and reduced public access. And in the case of sign public land use, we feel that the public, the people that the monuments affect, should be considered. And that's why the President is asking for a review of the monuments designated in the last 20 years to see what changes, if any, improvements can be made, and give states and local communities a meaningful voice in the process.\nAnd I can tell you, from a kid who grew up in Montana, or grew up in the West, where much-needed monuments have taken place, I think today's executive order and review of the Antiquities Act over the past two decades is long overdue.\nAnd the policy is consistent with the President's promise to give Americans a voice and make sure their voices are heard. Like many of the actions he's taken since assuming the role of the President, the office, this is yet another example the President is doing exactly what he was saying in his campaign promises, and he's delivering.\nThe President believes, like I do, that many of the neighbors in the Western states of the federal government can be a good neighbor. We can protect areas of cultural and economic importance, and they can use the federal lands for economic development when appropriate, just as Teddy Roosevelt envisioned it. I am a lifetime supporter and admirer of Teddy Roosevelt's policies, and the President is the same.\nThe Antiquities Act of 1906 -- and that was under President Roosevelt -- it did give the President the authority to declare historic monuments, landmarks, prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic and scientific interest on federal lands. Also in the Antiquities Act, authors specified the scope of the authority to \"designate the smallest area compatible with proper care and management of the objects to be protected.\" That's verbiage from the act itself.\nSo with the average size of the monument's designations over the past years has increased. I think that should be worthy of notice. Since the 1990s, when the act was first used, the average size of the national monuments came from 422 acres to, today, in the millions of acres.\nSo here's what the executive order does in summary. It restores the trust between local communities in Washington that the local communities and states will have a voice -- those states that are affected, and local communities. The executive order puts America and the Department of Interior back on track to manage our federal lands in accordance with traditional multiple use, as laid out by Pinchot and the President, and directs the Department of Interior to make recommendations to the President on whether a monument should be rescinded, resized, modified in order to better manage our federal lands. And this executive order gives rural communities across America, again, a voice, as his campaign promised and is delivering that.\nHere's what the executive order does not do. The executive order does not strip any monument of a designation. The executive order does not loosen any environmental or conservation regulation on any land or marine areas. It is a review of the last 20 years, and the review has timelines in which I am obligated to uphold.\nSo I have with me my advisor, Downey Magallanes, with me. Downey is there, and she'll help me answer questions if I cannot field them. So, questions? Sir.\nQ: Does this executive order presuppose that the President has the authority to unilaterally withdraw weigh-ins or revoke a national monument designation? Or is that one of the issues that --\nSECRETARY ZINKE: No. As I said in my hearing, it's undisputed the President has the authority to modify a monument. It's pretty premature to suggest we do the review in which I'm going to review and recommend to the President whether to rescind a monument completely or modify it. It is untested, as you know, whether the President can do that, but at this point, I haven't gone through the list -- and I'm sure someone is going to ask me how I'm going to go through and review, so I'll be glad to answer that.\nYes, sir.\nQ: Thank you very much. First, just to clarify, it was extended to 21 years just to include Grand Staircase in this review? And secondly, do you believe, at the end of this review process, you'll recommend changes to the Antiquities Act?\nSECRETARY ZINKE: The bookends really are from the Grand Staircase to Bear's Ears, so that's the period of time, roughly -- about 20 years.\nQ: So it's included on purpose?\nSECRETARY ZINKE: Well, it went back 20 years. So I'm not going to predispose what the outcome is going to be. How I'm going to proceed is this -- is I'm going to talk to congressional delegations and review the list. I'm going to talk to governors. I'm going to talk to the stakeholders involved and formulate recommendations that are appropriate.\nUp front, I'm a Teddy Roosevelt guy. And so I think, when the Antiquities Act came out, I think we should all recognize that, by and large, the Antiquities Act and the monuments that we have protected have done a great service to the public and are some of our most treasured lands in this country. So this is an enormous responsibility I have to make recommendations that are appropriate, that follow the law. But no one loves our public lands more than I. You could love them as much, but you can't love them more than I do. And that's one of the reasons why I love my job.\nQ: During your confirmation hearing, you told Maria Cantwell, I am absolutely against the transfer and sale of public lands, it can't be more clear. Do you still believe that? And I have a follow-up.\nSECRETARY ZINKE: Absolutely, unequivocally, I stand by -- matter of fact, with a recreational guide this morning, I made the same statement again, is that I am opposed to transfer or sale of public land.\nWhat I am strongly supportive of is managing our land. And there's no doubt if you -- especially out West. You look at the catastrophic forest fires, our wildlife corridors, our water management -- that we can do a lot better as a government of managing our land. And, to a degree, we've drifted too far away from multiple use into single use.\nQ: Do you worry, though, that this will lead to the transfer of land?\nSECRETARY ZINKE: No. I've heard that argument; I think that argument is false.\nQ: It just won't happen?\nSECRETARY ZINKE: And remember, the monuments before this happened were public land. And when they designate a monument, what it does is it restricts it and sometimes it restricts it from traditional uses like grazing. Public access, in some cases, can be restricted because gates go up.\nSo I think you have to proceed carefully on it. But multiple use on much of our land was designed under Pinchot to use for the public good for all of us, and not necessarily single use. And that's where we are.\nQ: You said in your last response that in general you feel like in most of these cases the designations have provided some kind of public service and they've done a good job. Can you talk about the flip side of that coin -- cases where you feel like maybe they actually haven't? And then just one clarification -- does this apply to monuments that were designated earlier than 1996 but then modified after 1996? Apparently there are a number that fall into that category.\nSECRETARY ZINKE: On your second point, if the modification was significant, we'll look at that. My understanding is there's about 30 or so monuments that fall into the category of 100,000 acres or larger and the modification was significant. But by and large, it's the bookends we talked about.\nI think the concern that I have and the President has that when you designate a monument, the local community that's affected should have a voice. And he said that in the campaign, he said that American citizens should have a voice. The little community, the loggers, the fishermen, those areas that are affected should have a say and a voice.\nAnd so, again, this executive order doesn't predispose any action other than having the Secretary that he chose -- me --review them. And I'm going to review it in a transparent matter to make sure, A, we have a voice, the process is transparent. And at the end of it, we're going to follow the law as Teddy Roosevelt laid out.\nQ: Just want to get back to concern swirling around the EO. What's your response to people who believe that the review is setting the stage for an assault on public lands for the purposes of oil and gas development?\nSECRETARY ZINKE: I've heard that many times about -- and I think it's the modern media that we live in today. We're so polarized as a country, and action is perceived as doing something that's not -- and this, the executive order is carefully crafted to review. It doesn't predispose an outcome.\nAgain, the President -- I was honored to be chosen and confirmed as his Secretary of Interior. I've laid out my beliefs, as well as the President shares, about public land. But again, the core of this is to make sure the public has a voice. That's who I work for. That's who the President works for, is the people. And that's -- love to get the people a voice on that. But I think it's a false narrative that we're going to predispose any particular action until the review.\nQ: Are you anticipating any legal challenges from environmental groups? And what are you doing to prepare for some pretty staunch opposition from some of these groups opposed to the President's --\nSECRETARY ZINKE: It's interesting, in the first days of my office, I think I got sued six times before lunch. So prudent public policy should be the right policy, and I'm not in fear of getting sued. I get sued all the time. I don't think lawsuits should shape public policy. I think our public policy should do what's right. The courts are free to challenge, and we live in a great country that people are free to challenge. I'm not going to make my judgments on the basis of getting sued or not sued doing the right thing.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, you referred to lost jobs. Could you provide a concrete example, going back to 1996, of where there's community that -- in terms of net job loss, it exceeded the gains from being designated a national monument? And in terms of your recommendations, obviously, you and White House officials have indicated that it might include legislative recommendations. To what extent do you think Congress is the one that should redraw the lines based on community input, as opposed to, say, the White House and the Interior Department redrawing any lines for these monuments?\nSECRETARY ZINKE: Great question. Jobs, that's part of the study we're going to look at. Because you have, on the side -- some jobs would probably be created by recreation opportunities. So in the parks, we had 330 million visitors last year. Some of our parks alone are at record capacity. And so I was this morning in our parks, and I think our economic driver is at $34.9 billion a year. And if you look at the recreation industry, it's quite a bit more than that.\nSo there's jobs across -- we'll look at what sectors were affected, plus or minus, and that will be part of the recommendation. I can't give you any numbers until we look at it, but jobs -- I recognize on both sides.\nSecondly, I'm sorry, your second point was?\nQ: My second question is, to what extent should it be Congress that actually redraws the lines for any of these monuments, or to what extent do you think that the White House and the Interior Department can unilaterally redraw them?\nSECRETARY ZINKE: From an Antiquities Act point -- this is -- the President has singular authority. But I think the philosophy on public lands should be what's inscribed in the Roosevelt Arch, Yellowstone Park -- it's for the benefit and enjoyment of the people. That's what's ascribed in stone at the Yellowstone Arch. And oddly enough, in one of the pillars, it says \"Enacted by Congress.\"\nSo I think it's appropriate, the three branches of government -- at least the Congress and the President -- should work together. Certainly in Utah, you have a congressional delegation -- this is the two we've talked about in Utah. I think that the delegation that represents the people should be coordinated with, the governor should be coordinated -- and the principals on the ground on both sides, their voice needs to be heard.\nQ: Yes, thank you. Is it your opinion that (inaudible) will be used in the Antiquities Act?\nSECRETARY ZINKE: Well, certainly, that's a concern. If you're out in Utah, the Utah legislature -- on a state side, they're vehemently opposed to it. Those out in the West would probably say it's abused. My position is I'm going into it and evaluating on a legal basis, and making sure people have a say. But I'm not going in with a political judgment either way. I just want to make a firm judgment based on the facts on the ground and giving people a voice.\nCertainly the governor is going to have an influence. Jobs are going to have an influence. The congressional folks are going to have an influence on it. But given my personality, I'm going to be transparent about it.\nAnd, sir, I'm going to give you the last question.\nQ: Thank you. So you said there's going to be a 45-day interim review. We've seen the President sign other executive orders where he just asks for a final review. Is there a particular reason why there's a shorter window for that --\nSECRETARY ZINKE: The 45-day review is pretty much centered on Bears Ears, because that's the most current one. My obligation is to wrap up at least my recommendation in 120 days. The recommendation I could save for further review.\nSo that's part of it, is I have some latitude as the Secretary to look at whether I have the facts on the ground. Again, a lot of it's going to be driven on talking to elected officials, local governments, the stakeholders, and making a reasonable decision so we, the people, have a voice.\nAnd I think it's appropriate to -- a couple mentions whether the President -- this President has some plan to sell or transfer public lands -- no. This executive order simply, I think, initiates a review, which is appropriate. When an administration comes in -- a new administration, that was one of his campaign promises. He's delivering on a promise. He selected me to review it. I may be the most popular individual in the world, or I may be the most unpopular position in the world, but it's a job that -- I can't be more thrilled being the Secretary of Interior. I mean, to be the steward of a fifth of our country and the majesty -- it's an enormous responsibility, but also it's a gift. So I'm going to use that authority I think to the benefit of us all.\nSo thank you, everybody.\nQ: Just to clear up, do you expect to have a decision on Bears Ears in 45 days?\nSECRETARY ZINKE: I expect to have a recommendation.\nQ: A recommendation on Bears Ears in 45 days.\nSECRETARY ZINKE: I do.\nQ: And are you planning on going in that amount of time?\nSECRETARY ZINKE: I am going to be out there. There's no doubt I'm going out there. And I would have been sooner, but we had the first Cabinet meeting. I was delayed in the hearings. So no doubt that my travel schedule is going to be busier than it already is.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, just on (inaudible) -- can you just say anything about your philosophy about that upcoming executive order, which we also expect this year?\nMS. WALTERS: We'll be able to comment on that on Thursday. We're going to put together a background briefing. Thank you.\nSECRETARY ZINKE: Keep the faith. It's all good.\nQ: Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\nQ: Thank you.\nEND 5:34 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2017-04-25", "title": "Press Briefing by Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke on the Executive Order to Review the Designations Under the Antiquities Act"}
{"author": "Sean Spicer", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123829", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n2:07 P.M. EDT\nMR. SPICER: Good afternoon. I'd like to start off today by having the Secretary of Commerce discuss an action that the Commerce Department took last night with respect to Canadian softwood lumber. It's an action that talks about what we're doing to make sure that we're fighting for our industries here at home.\nSo without further ado, I want to bring up Secretary Wilbur Ross.\nSECRETARY ROSS: Thank you, Sean.\nThe action we took last night is actually the culmination of a couple of decades of disputes between the United States and Canada. What's provoked the disputes is the following. In Canada, the forests are owned by the individual provinces, and each of the provinces sets a charge for the loggers to use when they're taking trees down. In the U.S., it's all open market, it's all market-based prices.\nSo the provinces subsidize the cutting down of lumber -- the technical term being stumpage -- and then that lets them charge a subsidized low price when the product hits the U.S. border. We have determined preliminarily that those problems, while they vary from one province to another, in some cases are as high as roughly 25 percent, and on average are around 20 percent. So they're quite material items.\nSo the preliminary decision that was put out yesterday imposes those countervailing duties on softwood lumber from Canada. Those duties will be collected starting today and they will be collected on a retroactive basis, going back 90 days, because it is 90 days ago that the Canadians were put on notice about this being an inappropriate process. What it amounts to is the following.\nThere is roughly $15 billion worth of softwood lumber used in houses in this country, and about 31.5 percent of that comes from the Canadians. So that's roughly $5 billion a year. A 20 percent tariff on that is essentially a billion dollars a year. And the retrospective 90-day feature adds another $250 million to that on a one-time basis.\nSoftwood lumber, as I say, is fundamentally used in single-family houses. We do not think that the price of lumber will go up by anything like the 20 percent, but there may be some small increase in the price of lumber for the house.\nQ: Will housing prices be increased in the United States due to that action?\nSECRETARY ROSS: Not necessarily, because you're talking such a small amount. And the biggest part of most home prices in any event is the land value, not the lumber value. Lumber is a pretty small percentage of the total cost of the house.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, what provoked this? As you mentioned, this has been a long-running dispute, subject of conversations between U.S. and the Canadian governments, the Bush administration and the Obama administration. Is this part of the milk dispute and is this a lever or a bargaining chip with the Canadian government over that dispute that's going on as we'll?\nSECRETARY ROSS: This investigation had been underway before anything came up about milk. And on a statutory basis, the last day we could have released the findings would have been today, so the only thing that we did do was accelerate it one day.\nQ: If this is not related at all to the milk dispute, do you see it as factoring in the Canadian judgments about how to respond or how to resolve some of these other trade disputes?\nSECRETARY ROSS: Well, everything relates to everything else when you're trying to negotiate, so I can't say there's no impact. But what we have tried to do was to clear the air and get this dispute out of the way before the big NAFTA talks went on. That was not possible to achieve, and that's why we went ahead and released the findings.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, Canada is an extremely close ally and a neighbor. Are you comfortable with how this has worked out in terms of what it means for the overall relationship between our two countries?\nSECRETARY ROSS: Well, they are a close ally. They're an important ally. They're generally a good neighbor. That doesn't mean they don't have to play by the rules.\nQ: What do you mean by \"generally\" a good neighbor?\nSECRETARY ROSS: Well, things like this I don't regard as being a good neighbor -- dumping lumber. And there's a feeling in the dairy industry that they're a little bit abrupt in the action that they took the week before.\nQ: The Canadian government said that those are unfair tariffs. And each time the case was brought to an international court, Canada won its case. What do you answer to this?\nSECRETARY ROSS: I had nothing to do with the prior cases. I'm confident that this case is a good case.\nQ: Going to put tariffs on dairy, too?\nSECRETARY ROSS: The problem with dairy isn't that they're dumping dairy products in the U.S. The problem is the reverse\n-- they're prohibiting U.S. dairy producers from selling their products in Canada, as a practical matter, and we're looking into whether there are measures we can do to try to correct that.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, have you heard from anybody in the Canadian government, or has the Prime Minister reached out to President Trump to try to convince you to change your policy or change the approach or work with you in any way?\nSECRETARY ROSS: Well, I haven't heard of anybody trying to ask us to change the approach. You've seen the public statements that the Canadians put out. As far as I know, that is their position.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, I'm curious whether this softwood lumber dispute or the milk dispute points to the need to revisit, to renegotiate NAFTA sooner rather than later.\nSECRETARY ROSS: Well, I think it does, because if you think about it, if NAFTA were functioning properly you wouldn't having these kinds of very prickly, very unfortunate developments back-to-back. So in that sense it shows that NAFTA has not worked as well as it should.\nQ: Milk is not covered by -- this particular dispute is not covered by NAFTA.\nSECRETARY ROSS: That's one of the problems.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, in other words, why not try to resolve this in not-so-public fashion? You're coming in the Briefing Room. You're obviously trying to flex the muscles of this administration. What would you say to the layman out there who says, why is President Trump messing with the Canadians now?\nSECRETARY ROSS: It's not a question of President Trump messing with the Canadians. We believe the Canadians violated legitimate practice. And to the degree we're correcting that, it should be corrected, just like steel dumping from China or any other trade infraction.\nQ: You're trying to make a point, publicly.\nSECRETARY ROSS: We make it publicly all the time. It's just that there has been so much general public interest engendered by the two things -- the dairy and the lumber -- that we thought it was good to clarify.\nQ: Secretary Ross, during the presidential campaign, people following then-candidate Trump would have assumed his singular focus would be on Mexico in terms of trade. All of a sudden now we're hearing all these items related to Canada. Can you tell us why the focus seems to have shifted up north?\nSECRETARY ROSS: Well, we had no way to know that the Canadian diary people would take the action that they did; nor did we have any way to know that the lumber dispute wouldn't have been resolved by negotiations. We tried. It didn't work, and so we went ahead with the statutory proceeding.\nQ: -- any additional trade against Canada?\nSECRETARY ROSS: I'm sorry?\nQ: Is the administration contemplating additional trade actions against Canada at this point?\nSECRETARY ROSS: As far as I know, there's nothing immediate contemplated.\nQ: Secretary Ross, when I talk to trade experts about this, they say the substance of what you did is very routine, like this has been done before, these preliminary countervailing duties. But they said what was really irregular was the way that you communicated it. Is this something that you're trying to sort of do as a bit of a PR thing to put NAFTA on notice? How should we read your very aggressive statement?\nSECRETARY ROSS: Well, it's not routine -- it's not routine in that a $1 billion of countervailing duties does not happen every single day. This is a quite large --\nQ: It happened in the early 2000s. It's happened before. It's not unprecedented.\nSECRETARY ROSS: No. We made the release the way that we made the release.\nQ: But why did you make it that way?\nSECRETARY ROSS: It seemed appropriate under the circumstances.\nYes.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, thank you, sir. Sir, India and America both were -- America was the largest trading partner of India -- or India was largest trading partner under Prime Minister Modi. And now we have a new administration with a new TP, and a revisionist administration -- same thing in India. Prime Minister has the same thinking. So what is the future of the trade between U.S. and India, sir?\nSECRETARY ROSS: Well, the U.S. does not have a free-trade agreement with India at this point, so the trade relations between the U.S. and India are governed by the WTO rules. There's nothing in the actions we've taken that changes that.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, following up on what Jim said, though, if housing prices do increase due to this, what do you tell the average consumer in the United States if the prices are going up? They didn't bargain for that.\nSECRETARY ROSS: Well, I don't know what they bargained for, but I'm sure what nobody in the United States bargained for is people dumping product. It's no different whether you dump steel or aluminum or cars or lumber or anything else. Nobody has --\nQ: You used the term \"countervailing duty\" and \"anti-dumping\" interchangeably, and they're two different things. Which is it -- dumping or countervailing duties?\nSECRETARY ROSS: This is countervailing duties.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, do you have a specific timeline for when the President is going to announce his intention to renegotiate NAFTA? And could this move actually complicate his efforts to get a deal?\nSECRETARY ROSS: Well, we've put the Congress on notice quite a few weeks ago of our intention to renegotiate NAFTA. What's been stalled is getting the Trade Promotion Authority, the so-called fast track authority, approved by the Congress. Now, Bob Lighthizer, having been confirmed out of committee today, and hopefully coming to the Senate for a full vote very shortly, that should cure one of the objections that some of the senators had. Namely, they were concerned about formerly reopening NAFTA when you have the U.S. Trade Rep being confirmed.\nNow, the Catch-22 to that was they were also slow-walking the confirmation, so it was a little bit of a circular thing. But in any event, that appears to be in the process of being corrected.\nQ: Will this move complicate your efforts to get the deal?\nSECRETARY ROSS: Everything affects everything else. But this trade issue over lumber, as has been pointed out, is not a brand-new issue. It's been around for quite a while.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, the next upcoming meeting of the G7 is about a month away, and the U.S. is in the middle of negotiations with -- or talks with China about how to address North Korea. Are you comfortable that the North Korea calculus has not hamstrung your ability to be as direct with China on matters like that? And is the action with Canada meant also to signal to our other Western economic allies and partners that if they mess with the U.S., they could face something like this?\nSECRETARY ROSS: Well, as to Canada -- as you know, at the Mar-a-Lago meetings, we agreed on a kind of 100-day program, and we're going back and forth with the Chinese over the 100-day program. So we shall see what comes from that. As to the action with lumber or, for that matter, with dairy with Canada, it really has no bearing on the Chinese relationship at all.\nQ: It seems to me that the object of the 25 percent tariff on soft lumber coming out of Canada is not to raise wood prices, it's to save and create American forestry jobs and loggers who are losing their jobs right now as a result of the dumping. Has the administration done a study? Do you know how many American jobs are going to be saved by this tariff?\nSECRETARY ROSS: Well, it's quite a lot of board feet of lumber. Lumber sells for about 38 cents per foot. So if you take all these large amounts -- there's about 47 billion board feet of lumber consumed in the U.S. market in a given year. And part of the reason I don't see that there be a huge price differential coming in is this only affects 31.5 percent of that output. The competition among the American producers remains the same. So this is not like suddenly house prices are going to go up 10 to 15 percent. That's silly.\nQ: How many new jobs will be created or jobs will be saved as a result of stopping the dumping?\nSECRETARY ROSS: I don't have an exact total, but I can tell you it's in quite a few states -- so along the northern perimeter, going all the way down into Louisiana. So this affects quite a number of people and quite a number of businesses.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, you're getting bipartisan support, at the very least, for your actions on softwood lumber, and I expect there will be bipartisan support on whatever action you take on behalf of the dairy industry as well. I mean, you appear to be laying the groundwork here for your notification to Congress that you would like to renegotiate NAFTA. Are we correct in reading it that way, that you're kind of paving the pathway here, or at least greasing the skids?\nSECRETARY ROSS: Well, the President announced a couple of months ago that he wanted renegotiate NAFTA. And as I say, it's been stalled in the Congress, because to do it effectively you really need to use the Trade Promotion Authority. I think you're aware of the benefit that gives, which is when it comes to the floor of the vote, it's an up or down vote; they can't amend the deal. So it makes it much more probable of getting a deal approved. That's the practical significance of it.\nQ: So there's these very public actions that you're taking in being here in the briefing. Is that sort of paving the way for promoting that authority?\nSECRETARY ROSS: Well, we hope to get as soon as possible the Trade Promotion Authority granted. Only Congress can do that. And so we've been consulting with the staff. I've met I don't know how many times -- quite a lot of times, both with Ways and Means and with the Senate Finance Committee. And we hope that with the Lightheizer confirmation, that will remove that impediment.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, on India? A follow-up on Goyal's question?\nSECRETARY ROSS: I'm sorry, I couldn't hear.\nQ: Do you favor a free trade agreement with India? As you said earlier, there isn't one between the two countries right now. Do you favor a free trade agreement with India?\nSECRETARY ROSS: Oh, any pending trade events with India? Is that the question?\nQ: Free trade agreement.\nQ: Free trade.\nSECRETARY ROSS: I don't believe that there have been any serious discussions with India of late on the topic of a free trade agreement, but there's no inherent negative attitude on our part relating to that.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, you're going to have an announcement on Thursday that you'll do something similar with aluminum that you did with steel last week in terms of initiating investigations into potential aluminum dumping into the country. Could you talk a little bit about that?\nSECRETARY ROSS: Well, I think the right time to talk about executive orders is once they've been issued.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, this is a high-profile action, in keeping with -- there's a precedent for similar action in the past. Is there a risk that this could provoke retaliation on the part of the Canadians and we could see a trade war between the United States and Canada?\nSECRETARY ROSS: Well, I know that that would be a stimulatory thing for all your readership, but we don't think that's going to happen.\nQ: So you think this is isolated, this is dairy and softwood?\nSECRETARY ROSS: We think so, and we certainly hope so. And we look forward to constructive discussions with the Canadians as we get into NAFTA.\nQ: You don't anticipate any retaliatory action on the part of Canada?\nSECRETARY ROSS: It's totally Canada's decision what they'll do. I'm not aware of anything that we've violated, so I don't know what it is that they could do that would be a legitimate action.\nQ: What if we passed a border adjustment tax? What if that were part of the tax reform package?\nSECRETARY ROSS: Well, as I understand it, there will be some word on the tax reform package from the people who are working on it, so it would be better to address that question to them.\nQ: While we have you, Mr. Secretary -- (laughter) -- of 3 percent GDP growth, is that a fair assessment? Is that something that is realistic? Do you believe it's realistic?\nSECRETARY ROSS: Well, I would hope that the growth could, over time, get to be better than that. President Obama is the only President in many, many, many, many that didn't have at least one year of 3 percent growth. And with all the initiatives that we're doing -- the regulatory reform, the trade reform, the tax reform hopefully -- and unleashing energy, there's no reason we shouldn't be able at least to have that if not beat it.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, you mentioned cars. Who is dumping cars to the United States? Which countries --\nSECRETARY ROSS: No, I just used that as a figure of speech.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, finally --\nQ: Who's dumping cars to the United States?\nQ: He said it was a figure of speech.\nSECRETARY ROSS: I just said, it was a figure of speech.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, what happened between the press conference with Prime Minister Trudeau, when the President said he would only be \"tweaking\" the relationship, and this decision on softwood lumber? What changed?\nSECRETARY ROSS: Well, first of all, this is not a presidential decision to do the softwood lumber. This was a decision that arose from a trade case that was underway. So it was a normal decision. So I don't think it has anything to do with the personal relationship between Mr. Trudeau and the President.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, finally, if you or the President have any faith or trust in WTO?\nSECRETARY ROSS: Well, WTO is a whole different subject matter. We do have some questions and some concerns about it. There will be a WTO meeting coming up in the next several weeks, and what will come out of that will come out of that.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, thank you. In your view, should the U.S. stay in the Paris climate agreement or withdraw from it?\nSECRETARY ROSS: Well, now you're really getting outside my area. (Laughter.)\nQ: You're a participant in those discussions.\nSECRETARY ROSS: It's really outside my area. I'm having enough difficulty dealing with the trade issues rather than poaching on other people's territory.\nYes, miss.\nQ: Are you concerned about the negotiations of FTA with South Korea?\nSECRETARY ROSS: Well, the fifth anniversary of the South Korean arrangement, the so-called KORUS, comes up I believe on May 4th or May 5th, something like that. So that would be a logical time to think through whether there was something to be done or not.\nQ: And do you think softwood lumber might get Michael Flynn's name off the front pages?\nSECRETARY ROSS: Is Michael Flynn now a trade issue? I wasn't aware that he was. (Laughter.)\nMR. SPICER: Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, here's one more way out of the box for you.\nSECRETARY ROSS: Oh, well, thank you for that.\nQ: If, in fact, the next president elected is Marine Le Pen in France, who is not at all for continuing the EU, how would that affect the relationship with France and the EU?\nSECRETARY ROSS: That's such a hypothetical question that I find it very difficult --\nQ: Well, it's either she or Monsieur Macron.\nSECRETARY ROSS: Well, I think let's wait for the French run-off election. Let's see who's elected. Let's see what actions they take. And then we'll be in a position to make a reasoned response to the question.\nMR. SPICER: Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\nQ: Come back any time.\nQ: You're always welcome.\nMR. SPICER: That doesn't make me feel too good.\nSECRETARY ROSS: What did they say?\nMR. SPICER: They said come back anytime.\nQ: You're always welcome, Mr. Secretary.\nMR. SPICER: He is always welcome.\nQ: It was a pleasure.\nSECRETARY ROSS: I'm glad you're out of questions because I'm out of answers. (Laughter.)\nMR. SPICER: Now that the Secretary has exhausted you all. (Laughter.) So up on the screens -- I know we had a little bit of discussion about this yesterday -- this is the landing page for the content of the website that we launched late last night on the President's busy first 100 days. I know that many of you have noted the robust pace that the President has kept during these first 100 days, so it's just a glimpse of some of the action that he's taken and some of the key priorities that he made to the American people.\nDespite the historic obstruction by Senate Democrats, he's worked with Congress to pass more legislation in his first 100 days than any President since Truman. And these bills deliver on some of his most significant promises to the American people.\nHe signed a historic 13 Congressional Review Acts to clear unnecessary regulations and keep government out of the way of the American people. He's extended the Veteran's Choice program, giving our nation's heroes the peace of mind they deserve while this administration continues to work with Congress to enact comprehensive reform and modernization at the VA. He's refocused NASA's mission to dream big for American space exploration again, and promoted programs dedicated to encouraging women to pursue careers in STEM fields.\nAll told, he has signed 28 pieces of legislation. And it's not just through legislation that the President has made serious progress on his top priorities. The President promised to enforce our nation's borders. His Attorney General, Homeland Security, and their staffs have been working around the clock to fulfill that promise. He has directed a halt of federal funding to jurisdictions that do not comply with federal immigration laws.\nHe has ordered the hiring of 10,000 immigration and customs enforcement officers and agents, and 5,000 Custom and Border Patrol agents. And it's working. Illegal alien border crossings have plummeted more than 61 percent since January of this year.\nThe world is responding to the leadership that the President is bringing under this -- bringing to Washington. In all, during his first 100 days, the President has made 68 calls with 38 different world leaders, and hosted a total of 16 bilateral meetings. The President has rebuilt America's standing in the world. And these meetings and calls have led to real action. NATO Secretary General was here a few weeks ago, and he directly credited the President for his tough talk that was fair but tough as a candidate, and now as a President, for helping to put pressure on the counties -- excuse me, on the countries that are not contributing their fair share to the Alliance.\nJust last week, Aya Hijazi finally came home after the President personally addressed her situation with\nPresident el-Sisi. And China continues to take positive steps, both at the U.N. and in other arenas to help us combat the threat posed by North Korea.\nThe President has also turned his words into action here at home. For too many years, the hardworking men and women of this country were poorly served and with a government that wasn't working for them, but itself and special interests. As the President said during his inaugural speech, those forgotten men and women are not going to be forgotten by a Trump administration.\nFrom the moment he took office, the President has been taking action and putting America back to work by putting the people back into the government. Unleashing the American economy by slashing overly burdensome and unnecessary federal regulations, welcoming union representatives, top business leaders and small-business owners into the White House to personally hear directly from them about the policies that prevent them from creating and maintaining well-paying jobs.\nHe's reinvigorating our domestic energy sector, reviving private infrastructure investment that helps us become more energy independent. And today, he's signing an executive order setting up a task force that will produce a 180-day review of the regulations, policy and legislation that unnecessarily hinders economic growth in the agriculture sector. That task force will be led by our newly sworn-in Secretary of Agriculture, former Governor Sonny Perdue. Secretary Perdue, who was sworn in earlier this morning, along with many other Cabinet members, will be traveling outside Washington this entire week to share these tremendous achievements with the American people.\nSmall Business Administrator Linda McMahon is in Orlando for multiple events, including a roundtable with Hispanic small business owners. Tomorrow, Secretary Carson will be in Columbus, Ohio, for the fourth stop of his listening tour where he'll speak to the Ohio Housing Council and meet with local leaders and residents of public housing developments. And Secretary Perdue is getting right to work, traveling to Kansas City, Missouri, Thursday and Friday to visit agricultural facilities and meet with Governor Greitens.\nThe President and his extraordinary, qualified Cabinet have made incredible progress in just these first 100 days, but this is just the beginning. We look forward to even more prosperity as consumer and CEO confidence continues to rise in the wake of these pro-growth policies; an even safer world from destroying ISIS and other forms of radical Islamic terrorism that threaten our entire globe; to keeping our smallest communities safe for American families; and a government that serves the people, not the special interests or personal political alliances.\nFinally before I take your questions, I just want to proudly announce that on May 4th, the President will speak aboard the USS Intrepid in New York City to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Coral Sea, a major naval battle during World War II in which the United States joined with Australia to halt the advance of enemy forces.\nThat same day, at the museum, the President will hold a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia. The President looks forward to meeting the Prime Minister and to showcasing the enduring bonds, deep friendship, and close alliance the United States has with Australia.\nAnd with that, let's go. John Roberts.\nQ: Sean, does the White House believe that Lieutenant General Michael Flynn broke any laws in filling out his Standard Form-86 disclosure? And furthermore, why is the White House apparently stonewalling the committee on oversight and government reform on its request for some of the documents that should be in the White House's possession on Mr. Flynn?\nMR. SPICER: I will correct you on that. The committee sent a form letter to several agencies, including the White House, asking to find those documents. The documents in question the Department of Defense possessed and sent over to them. The documents that occurred before he worked here would be up to him to turn over. So my understanding is the committee has the documents that they were looking for.\nQ: Well, in the letter that Marc Short -- and I know that SF-86 was referred to the DIA, and apparently --\nMR. SPICER: It wasn't just referred to them. That's where it --\nQ: Well, I know -- but they were referred to the DIA for the SF-86, and apparently they have gained access to that document. But there were other documents that should be in the White House's possession that Marc Short, in the letter to the committee, said the White House can't provide because of its sensitive nature. It also said that there were no documents that were available prior to the 20th.\nMR. SPICER: Right.\nQ: But I also ask the question: Does the White House believe that Lieutenant General Flynn might have broken the law when he filled out the SF-86?\nMR. SPICER: I don't -- that would be a question for him and a law enforcement agency whether or not he filled -- I don't know what he filled out and what he did or did not do. That all happened -- he filled that form out prior to coming here, and so it would be up to the committee and other authorities to look at that. I don't know.\nBut with respect to the letter, they asked for three things -- the SF-86, which you properly point out was in the possession of the DIA. My understanding through reports is that they have obtained that, then they ask for documents prior to January 20th. As you know through the Constitution, we didn't assume the White House until January 20th at noon, so we don't have the documents prior to assuming the White House. And then the third would be they listed for every call and contact made, which is an extraordinary number that -- that's a very unwieldy request.\nQ: So was it the sheer volume of it, or --\nMR. SPICER: Well, to say we want the National Security Advisor, whose job it is to talk with foreign counterparts on a daily basis, to document every call that he may or may not have made is not exactly a request that will be filled. But every document that they asked for my understanding is that they've gotten.\nQ: Sean, is it your position that during the transition, the Trump transition has no custodial possession of any of these documents that Flynn filled out as part of a process to become the President's National Security Advisor? I mean, what you seem to be suggesting is an arms' length relationship.\nMR. SPICER: There's two issues. He had an SF86, which is a security clearance form that was filled out during the Obama administration. He had a reinvestigation in 2016. That was done under the last administration. And again, those are not documents that the White House would ever possess on any employee. They would come from the requesting authority.\nQ: Okay. So --\nMR. SPICER: So, in that case -- again, remember, they sent out a form letter to I think five or six agencies requesting the same documents. The place for the documents that they had questioned did fulfill that request.\nQ: Right. I'm just trying to find out from your perspective, is there no obligation either from the transition or the White House to do anything more than you have done or has been done in this matter?\nMR. SPICER: Everything that the White House has been asked to do we have -- the only documents that were made available to them that they asked for were the ones that the Department of Defense had.\nQ: How about these calls made when he was working during the transition on behalf of a future President Trump? Aren't those things that you should have some either responsibility or obligation to provide if you can?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think again, it's a question of if you can. When you ask for every call --\nQ: -- that you can --\nMR. SPICER: No, but I think that's a pretty -- there is -- to ask for every call or contact that the a National Security Advisor made is pretty outlandish, if you will -- to say that we want to have a list of every -- there is no --\nQ: Those calls were made on behalf of the Trump transition, were they not?\nMR. SPICER: When?\nQ: When he was in the -- I mean --\nMR. SPICER: He did not -- we started this administration on January 20th. All the information that they are talking about occurred prior to him being at the White House.\nQ: Yes, but he was working for the transition. And I'm saying, is there any obligation you have --\nMR. SPICER: Not at the White House. Everything that is being questioned occurred prior to January 20th.\nQ: -- the delivery of those documents?\nQ: But you're acting as if you had no custodial responsibility of your own transition. That's all I'm trying to --\nMR. SPICER: And I guess the question is, is that what --\nQ: He wasn't making calls as a private citizen. He was making them as a future National Security Advisor.\nMR. SPICER: I understand that. And right now, to ask the White House for these documents that were not in possession of the White House is ridiculous.\nJohn.\nQ: Two weeks ago, when General Flynn's attorney wrote to the Senate Intelligence Committee suggesting some sort of immunity deal for General Flynn, I asked you a question about whether the White House would be invoking executive privilege, and your response at that time was, no, we have no problem with General Flynn testifying, he's free to do so, we won't be invoking any type of privilege. Does that also apply to any documents that the White House may have related to General Flynn's service, the short service as the National Security Advisor to the President, and the time in which he served in the transition period as an advisor to the President-elect?\nMR. SPICER: I think, look, when you asked -- I know that when Chaffetz was asked whether or not what he is looking into here at the White House, my understanding is he was very clear that had to do with his time prior to that. So talking about what his role was at the White House seems not germane to any of the questions that are being asked.\nQ: What about prior to his service at the White House?\nMR. SPICER: For that, again, it would have to go to General Flynn. There's nothing that is being asked for with respect to his service here at the White House. The documents that Major was referring to rest within the Department of Defense. My understanding is that they were provided.\nQ: And the overall issue of privilege, would you be open to --\nMR. SPICER: I'm not at this time -- to answer that question, I don't know the answer. There's nothing that I'm responding to on that particular matter.\nQ: Sean, generally speaking, within the Trump administration, how important is it for the President that everyone working for this administration is honest on their security clearance forms?\nMR. SPICER: Very. And so -- and if they don't, then they're going to be investigated. But you assume -- look, everybody fills out forms all the time. All of us in some point we sign our name and swear under oath that everything is in there. So I think each and every one of us in different ways signs our names and agrees to abide by the information that we provide.\nQ: Do you know if the President is aware of the comments that were made by the House Oversight Chairman today? And does he agree at all with the assertion that it seems as though General Flynn was not in compliance with the law?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not -- and again, that's not -- that would be a matter for them to look into, not for us.\nKaitlin.\nQ: Does the White House consider Mike Flynn's payment from Russia today to be a payment from a foreign government?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know. That was -- again, all of that occurred prior to his service --\nQ: Your White House, does this White House consider a payment from Russia today to be a payment from a foreign government?\nMR. SPICER: I understand, but what I'm saying is everything that he did was prior to coming to this White House. So for us to determine someone else's thing as a consultant --\nQ: If it was to happen today, do you consider that to be a payment from a foreign government?\nMR. SPICER: I'm sorry, if what?\nQ: If someone took money from Russia today -- today --\nMR. SPICER: If they were an employee of the White House, absolutely. But, I mean, again, I don't know the exact circumstances. Everything that's being discussed occurred prior to his employment at the White House, occurred as a consultant. So whatever he did, as long as he did it in compliance with the law, as every one of us as a citizen has the right to do -- that's up to an individual to do -- and then comply with the law.\nQ: To follow up on that, why didn't he -- why wasn't he more closely vetted during the transition period?\nMR. SPICER: Well, again, you fill out forms and --\nQ: -- the White House and the Trump transition team should have known about this before they were having him come to the White House.\nMR. SPICER: Well, again, you fill out the forms, you do an investigation, and you do a background check. Every employee gets that background check done, and they have a security clearance and they fill it out, and that's how -- everyone operates under the same guise.\nQ: I have two questions, but I want to follow up on that. So you're saying that it's a problem with the process of vetting -- the vetting process, and not --\nMR. SPICER: I'm not saying it's a problem with the vetting. I'm saying that every single person who comes to work in here at a certain level is required to fill out the same form, an SF-86. And that background check is adjudicated. You rely on that person when they sign their name, and then investigators pick it up. But there's always going to be, in the case of people who had a prior clearance, that between the time that they filled it out and had it adjudicated they could have engaged in something. And whether or not they updated that or not is always the onus is on the individual.\nQ: I do want ask you really quickly about the wall. Yesterday, President Trump reportedly said that he's going to delay pushing the wall through. And so can you just clarify what the status of that is -- what's happening, when?\nMR. SPICER: The President made it very clear -- I think he tweeted about this earlier -- his priorities have not changed. There will be a wall built. It's important to prevent human trafficking, gangs like MS-13 from coming into the country, the flow of illegal drugs, illegal immigration. There is a national economic and safety issue by having a wall that ensures our country's safety, and there's plenty of planning that can be done in FY17. We're going to continue -- our priorities are clear going into FY17, the remainder of budgeting for that. And we'll continue to ask for more in FY18.\nQ: So it's delayed for now?\nMR. SPICER: No, no. I never -- no one said delayed. No, no -- there's two budget processes. Right now we're going to end FY17 this week. We hope to continue to get funding in that, as the President laid out, for both border security and homeland security and national defense, as we've always maintained. And then when we come to FY18, that starts at the beginning of October, the end of September, and that next budget will go for the next group of money.\nQ: So use that partial funding --\nMR. SPICER: We've made our priorities very clear as we continue to negotiate, and I think nothing has changed on the President's priorities.\nQ: Can I ask a follow-up on healthcare? The President has threatened to withhold cost-sharing payments from insurance companies. So is that still the case?\nMR. SPICER: I think we've made it very clear that we want to repeal and replace Obamacare. And I think we continue to see -- there's a prop-up right now, and that's why we need to act as soon as possible to get an insurance plan in place -- a new insurance plan -- system in place that will protect people's insurance and not have these skyrocketing costs. But we have an artificially propped-up insurance system right now because of these payments. And I think that we've got to make sure that we do everything we can, as quick as we can, to put a system in place that will solve that.\nJonathan.\nQ: So just to follow up on the two, three topics -- the wall and on -- first, on the wall, I just want to be clear -- so is the President no longer insisting that there is money for the wall in this current appropriations bill?\nMR. SPICER: The President's priorities are clear for FY17. There's a lot of things that we can do in the remaining months, up until the end of September, for planning and making sure that we get everything that we need, funding that we need for that aspect of things. And then as we go into FY18, we'll continue to ask for more. I don't think anything has changed.\nQ: So the President is not insisting that he has money for actual construction of the wall in this current bill?\nMR. SPICER: We are still in discussions with the House and Senate leadership, but I think the President has been very clear that he wants a wall; he wants it done as soon as we can do it. There are things that we need to do to protect our country -- like human trafficking, the flow of illegal drugs and gangs -- that are going to make sure that while we've achieved a significant drop in illegal alien border crossings -- down 61 percent since January -- that this is something that's in our country's long-term national security interest.\nQ: And the actual construction can wait until the fall?\nMR. SPICER: No, it's not a question of wait until the fall. I think there's a lot of things that have to happen. It's like any construction.\nQ: Before you start construction.\nMR. SPICER: Well, you got to start doing some planning and things. And so we will take the first steps now and then we will continue to seek funding through the FY18 and further budget to make sure that the actual -- that it is completed.\nQ: And on Michael Flynn, does the President feel that he was misled by General Flynn?\nMR. SPICER: I think the President made a decision a while ago because General Flynn was not straight with the Vice President at the time and let him go. I think he stands by that decision, and it's up to others to review all this information that's coming out.\nQ: But does he now feel that he also wasn't straight with him in the beginning during --\nMR. SPICER: I don't -- a lot of the facts are still coming out, Jonathan. I know the President made a decision a couple months ago. It was the right decision, and we've moved on. And we continue to stay focused on --\nQ: At the time he made that decision, he said he was the victim of a media witch hunt and said he was a good man that had been a victim of --\nMR. SPICER: Right, so let's --\nQ: -- a witch hunt. Does he still feel that? Or is --\nMR. SPICER: I think all the facts are still coming out on that. Let's see where they come. I think he made a decision a few months ago. He stands by the decision.\nJohn.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Two questions: Last night the President said -- and some have reported it -- some pretty sensational charges about the Iran treaty. We know he's called it the worst agreement in history, and the worst he ever saw himself. But he also said that at the time of the treaty, the government in Iran was on the verge of collapsing. And that is something I don't believe that has ever been reported before. He also said that the unfrozen assets -- the billions were not used to fund terrorists, but they were in Swiss bank accounts. Is this based on intelligence reports he's received or other information?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to get into what the President knows, but there is a reason that we are undergoing an interagency process right now to look at the deal.\nYes, Jessica.\nQ: I had a second question.\nMR. SPICER: Sure.\nQ: Okay. On General Flynn, anyone who is at his level and some levels below undergoes an investigation by the FBI with a final report. Was the President ever given a final security report by the FBI on General Flynn?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know. He had -- he was the head of the Department -- of the Defense Intelligence Agency. He had an existing clearance.\nJessica.\nQ: If you could just talk a little bit more about the overall efforts that the administration is making. We note the United Nations meetings yesterday. Now you've got an upcoming meeting with Congress. Are you as an administration trying to get a coalition together to build a stronger diplomatic case around actions against Pyongyang?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think you saw Ambassador Haley yesterday in the discussion that -- the other ambassadors who visited the White House engaged in a very robust discussion with respect to North Korea, both as a group, and then with the President. So obviously, the more that we can solve this diplomatically and continue to apply pressure on China and other countries to use the political and economic tools that they have to achieve a goal in stabilization in the region, but also to tamp down the threat that North Korea faces, I think that is something that we all share.\nQ: How would you characterize the administration's overall strategy on the DPRK?\nMR. SPICER: I think we're -- it's ongoing. And I think -- but I think we've seen very positive signs with respect to a nation like China. The relationship the President built with President Xi down in Mar-a-Lago is definitely paying off dividends. And this President's relationships that he's building with heads of government is clearly reestablishing America's place in the world and getting results for this country.\nKayla.\nQ: -- strategy on Wednesday when you have the meeting with the senators?\nMR. SPICER: I'm sorry?\nQ: Will you be able to articulate that strategy and put a finer point on it for the senators?\nMR. SPICER: Just to be clear, that meeting is a Senate meeting led by Leader McConnell just utilizing our space. So that is their meeting, so we're not there to talk strategy. There are going to be briefed by the --\nQ: Well, you --\nMR. SPICER: Can I answer her question? Major, I --\nQ: -- it's your administration --\nMR. SPICER: Do you want to come on up? (Laughter.) I mean I'll -- I understand there around four -- hold on --\nQ: -- characterize it as you presenting your strategy to the U.S. Senate?\nMR. SPICER: There are four briefers that are coming up to talk about the situation in North Korea. They will be briefed by -- this is a Senate-led meeting that they are getting; those four briefers will share to them the current situation in North Korea.\nQ: -- the strategy will be articulated then?\nMR. SPICER: What?\nQ: So the senators should not expect --\nMR. SPICER: Well, no, obviously the Secretary of State and others are going to talk about our posture and the activities that we're undergoing. And Chairman Dunford will lay out some of the military actions and the way that they see the lay of the land. They're going to answer questions, as they routinely do on a situation like this.\nKayla.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. How long would you reasonably expect the government to take to be fully staffed with essential personnel to draft, negotiate, and implement complicated policies like tax reform, and put forward something that's a little bit more meaty than just broad principles?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think we're going to -- we'll have something to share with you tomorrow. And then we're going to continue to work with allies and individuals who want to be part of this process. That conversation has really kicked off in earnest with members of the House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee, the leadership. And so we will continue to engage in that discussion and outside stakeholders to try to get a plan really put together and details laid out in the next several weeks once me make the announcement tomorrow.\nQ: But what progress have agencies been able to make in carrying out the executive orders that the President has put forward? Because today is actually the deadline for the regulatory reform offices to be in place. How many of those are there?\nMR. SPICER: I don't have a number on that. I can look at -- talk to our personnel office and get back to you. But I think we have been able to work with, in many cases -- and I think I went over this early on in the process -- but we installed what we called beachhead teams during the transition process. We put 400-plus individuals into these departments that, in most cases, transformed into Schedule C employees. So we have been able to be up and running in almost every one of these in a very, very early process when you look at the totality of how we handled the transition of government.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Staying on taxes for a minute, can you give us a sense -- the President said he's going to present this plan tomorrow. Can you give us a sense of what we're going to see and when we're going to see it?\nMR. SPICER: No. I'm going to wait until tomorrow. I think we'll have plenty of time to talk about that tomorrow.\nQ: Just a bit of color. The President, on Friday, when he announced that it was going to happen on Wednesday, aides here at the White House and over at Treasury seemed a little bit surprised to find out that this was coming as early as Wednesday. Can you tell us who inside the White House and at Treasury the President told he was going to announce this on Wednesday before he made the announcement?\nMR. SPICER: I think tomorrow, we'll have a great plan for you to see.\nAdam.\nQ: The Secretary of Treasury actually said that the goal on tax reform is to spur growth of 3 percent of more, but already people are worried about deficits and that's -- Taxpayers For Common Sense put out a statement saying that growth -- \"Hogwash. Growth is the magic pixie dust policymakers throw on economic plans to make them appear fiscally sound when they are not.\" What would you say to Republicans on Capitol Hill who are worried about this being a tax reform that would blow a hole in the deficit and the debt?\nMR. SPICER: I will wait until tomorrow. You can see the plan. But I think, obviously, we've got to do everything we can to get economic growth going and job creation going. The President has made tremendous headway on the regulatory front, and he's going to do everything he can on the tax front.\nBut we've talked about this before. I mean, if you look at the corporate side in particular, we have become largely uncompetitive because of our rates. And I think the more we can do to make our country, our businesses, our manufacturers in particular, more competitive, that's good for American workers, it's good for our economy, it's good for economic growth.\nAnd I think the President -- as I noted, I mean, when you look at the regulatory side of what he has done, it has really helped a lot of industries start to see light. And that why I think you see the confidence levels in so many surveys so strong under this President, because he's achieved real results already.\nSo I will see you guys tomorrow. We'll talk about the tax plan. Thanks.\nEND 2:55 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2017-04-25", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross"}
{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "note": "The President spoke at 11:30 a.m. in the Rotunda at the U.S. Capitol. In his remarks, he referred to New York City resident Steven Springfield and his brother Peter; and Scottsdale, AZ, resident Gerda Weissmann Klein.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123824", "text": "Thank you very much. Thank you. Friends, Members of Congress, Ambassadors, veterans, and most especially, to the survivors here with us today: It's an honor to join you on this very, very solemn occasion. I am deeply moved to stand before those who survived history's darkest hour. Your cherished presence transforms this place into a sacred gathering.\nThank you, Tom Bernstein, Allan Holt, Sara Bloomfield, and everyone at the Holocaust Memorial Council and Museum for your vital work and tireless contributions.\nWe are privileged to be joined by Israel's Ambassador to the United States, friend of mine—he's done a great job and said some wonderful words—Ron Dermer. The State of Israel is an eternal monument to the undying strength of the Jewish people. The fervent dream that burned in the hearts of the oppressed is now filled with the breath of life, and the Star of David waves atop a great nation arisen from the desert.\nTo those in the audience who have served America in uniform, our country eternally thanks you. We are proud and grateful to be joined today by veterans of the Second World War who liberated survivors from the camps. Your sacrifice helped save freedom for the world, for the entire world.\nSadly, this year marks the first Day of Remembrance since the passing of Elie Wiesel, a great person, a great man. His absence leaves an empty space in our hearts, but his spirit fills this room. It is the kind of gentle spirit of an angel who lived through hell and whose courage still lights the path from darkness. Though Elie's story is well known by so many people, it's always worth repeating. He suffered the unthinkable horrors of the Holocaust. His mother and sister perished in Auschwitz. He watched his father slowly dying before his own young eyes in Buchenwald. He lived through an endless nightmare of murder and death, and he inscribed on our collective conscience the duty we have to remember that long, dark night so as never to again repeat it.\nThe survivors in this hall, through their testimony, fulfill the righteous duty to never forget and engrave into the world's memory the Nazi genocide of the Jewish people. Your witnessed evil and what you saw is beyond description, beyond any description. Many of you lost your entire family, everything and everyone you loved, gone. You saw mothers and children led to mass slaughter. You saw the starvation and the torture. You saw the organized attempt at the extermination of an entire people—and great people, I must add. You survived the ghettos, the concentration camps and the death camps. And you persevered to tell your stories. You tell of these living nightmares because, despite your great pain, you believe in Elie's famous plea, that \"For the dead and the living, we must bear witness.\"\nThat is why we are here today: to remember and to bear witness. To make sure that humanity never, ever forgets. The Nazis massacred 6 million Jews. Two out of every three Jews in Europe were murdered in the genocide. Millions more innocent people were imprisoned and executed by the Nazis without mercy, without even a sign of mercy.\nYet, even today, there are those who want to forget the past. Worse still, there are even those filled with such hate—total hate—that they want to erase the Holocaust from history. Those who deny the Holocaust are an accomplice to this horrible evil. And we'll never be silent—we just won't—we will never, ever be silent in the face of evil again.\nDenying the Holocaust is only one of many forms of dangerous anti-Semitism that continues all around the world. We've seen anti-Semitism on university campuses, in the public square, and in threats against Jewish citizens. Even worse, it's been on display in the most sinister manner when terrorists attack Jewish communities or when aggressors threaten Israel with total and complete destruction.\nThis is my pledge to you: We will confront anti-Semitism. [Applause] Thank you. We will stamp out prejudice. We will condemn hatred. We will bear witness. And we will act. As President of the United States, I will always stand with the Jewish people, and I will always stand with our great friend and partner, the State of Israel.\nSo today we remember the 6 million Jewish men, women, and children whose lives and dreams were stolen from this Earth. We remember the millions of other innocent victims the Nazis so brutally targeted and so brutally killed. We remember the survivors who bore more than we can imagine. We remember the hatred and evil that sought to extinguish human life, dignity, and freedom.\nBut we also remember the light that shone through the darkness. We remember sisters and brothers who gave everything to those they loved—survivors like Steven Springfield, who, in the long death march, carried his brother on his back. As he said, \"I just couldn't give in.\"\nWe remember the brave souls who banded together to save the lives of their neighbors, even at the risk of their own life. And we remember those first hopeful moments of liberation, when at long last the American soldiers arrived in camps and cities throughout occupied Europe, waving the same beautiful flags before us today, speaking those three glorious words: \"You are free.\"\nIt is this love of freedom, this embrace of human dignity, this call to courage in the face of evil that the survivors here today have helped to write onto our hearts. The Jewish people have endured oppression, persecution, and those who have sought and planned their destruction. Yet, through the suffering, they have persevered. They have thrived. And they have enlightened the world. We stand in awe of the unbreakable spirit of the Jewish people.\nI want to close with a story enshrined in the museum that captures the moment of liberation in the final days of the war. It is the story of Gerda Klein, a young Jewish woman from Poland. Some of you know her. Gerda's family was murdered by the Nazis. She spent 3 years imprisoned in labor camps and the last 4 months of the war on a terrible death march. She assumed it was over. At the end, on the eve of her 21st birthday, her hair had lost all of its color, and she weighed a mere 68 pounds. Yet she had the will to live another day. It was tough.\nGerda later recalled the moment she realized that her long-awaited deliverance had arrived. She saw a car coming towards her. Many cars had driven up before, but this one was different. On its hood, in place of that wretched swastika, was a bright, beautiful, gleaming white star. Two American soldiers got out. One walked up to her. The first thing Gerda said was what she had been trained to say: \"We are Jewish, you know.\" \"We are Jewish.\" And then, he said, \"So am I.\" It was a beautiful moment after so much darkness, after so much evil. As Gerda took this solider to see other prisoners, the American did something she had long forgotten to even expect: He opened the door for her. In Gerda's words, \"that was the moment of restoration of humanity, of humanness, of dignity, and of freedom.\"\nBut the story does not end there. Because, as some of you know, that young American soldier who liberated her and who showed her such decency would soon become her husband. A year later, they were married. In her words, \"He opened not only the door for me, but the door to my life and to my future.\"\nGerda has since spent her life telling the world of what she witnessed. She, like those survivors who are among us today, has dedicated her life to shining a light of hope through the dark of night.\nYour courage strengthens us. Your voices inspire us. And your stories remind us that we must never, ever shrink away from telling the truth about evil in our time. Evil is always seeking to wage war against the innocent and to destroy all that is good and beautiful about our common humanity. But evil can only thrive in darkness. And what you have brought us today is so much more powerful than evil. You have brought us hope, hope that love will conquer hatred, that right will defeat wrong, and that peace will rise from the ashes of war.\nEach survivor here today is a beacon of light, and it only takes one light to illuminate even the darkest space. Just like it takes only one truth to crush a thousand lies and one hero to change the course of history. We know that in the end, good will triumph over evil and that as long as we refuse to close our eyes or to silence our voices, we know that justice will ultimately prevail.\nSo today we mourn. We remember. We pray. And we pledge: Never again.\nThank you. God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you very much.

We had a very busy day, but a good day. We're doing well, very well. And things are turning around. I know they're turning around for you folks, so I just want to welcome you very much to the White House—special place—America's farmers and ranchers.\nI especially want to congratulate Secretary—now I can say, Secretary—[laughter]— Sonny Perdue, who was just sworn in as the Secretary of Agriculture and—[applause]—sworn in by Justice Thomas. And he was—it was a beautiful ceremony, and we're going to celebrate a little bit later, and that's great. We're very happy. And you had a good vote too.\nSecretary of Agriculture George E. \"Sonny\" Perdue. Yes, sir.\nThe President. You didn't have one of those 51-49 votes. [Laughter] He had a very big vote, so thank Justice Thomas too, great man, great person. We appreciate it.\nAmerica's noble farming tradition stretches back to its earliest days. Farmers led the way across the Great Plains and put down roots from coast to coast. Today, America's farmers feed not only our Nation, but millions of people around the world, and we're going to open that up much more for you folks, because as you know, it's not totally open, to put it mildly. We learned that yesterday, frankly, with Canada, where the dairy farmers up in Wisconsin, Upstate New York, different places—a lot of border States in particular—are not able to sell their dairy products into Canada. And this has been going on for a while, and we're not going to put up with it.\nAnd separately, we put a very big tax—we will be putting a very big tariff on lumber—timber coming into this country. People don't realize Canada has been very rough on the United States. Everyone thinks of Canada as being wonderful, and so do I. I love Canada. But they've outsmarted our politicians for many years, and you people understand that. So we did institute a very big tariff; we announced it yesterday. And we're going to take care of our dairy farmers in Wisconsin, and Upstate New York, and lots of other places. So I think you people all probably agree with that, right? Would you agree with that?\nNational Future Farmers of America Central Region Vice President Valerie Earley. I would.\nThe President. You'd better believe it.\nOur farmers deserve a Government that serves their interest and empowers them to do the hard work that they love to do so much. And that's what today's Executive order is all about. With this order, I'm directing Secretary Perdue to work with other members of my Cabinet to identify and eliminate unnecessary regulations that hurt our Nation's farmers and rural communities.\nNow, Sonny, I've already signed a lot of regulations and terminations that really help the farmer a lot. You know what I'm talking about. But we have some left, and you'll identify them.\nSecretary Perdue. We will. The President. But we've really gotten rid of some of the biggest ones.\nSecretary Perdue. Absolutely.\nThe President. And that was a big help, right? You were all ready. I mean, they won't tell you about it, but they're big numbers, and it's going to mean a lot to the farmers.\nThis order also establishes the Interagency Task Force on Agriculture and Rural Prosperity, to be led by Secretary Perdue. I just want to tell you that it's an honor to be with you because, among many other things, with this order, we continue a very relentless effort to make life better for hard-working Americans, and that includes the farmers and all of the people gathered around this table, including our ranchers, our rural community folks. We're having a very, very big impact. It's already started. Sonny is going to now identify additional areas where we can get rid of unnecessary regulations, and you people are going to be so prosperous, and you're going to hire so many more people than currently work for you, and that's going to make me very happy, okay? [Laughter]\nSo I want to thank you very much. So do we have the Executive order, please?\n[At this point, White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter handed the President the Executive order.]\nThanks, Rob.\nSo this is promoting agriculture and rural prosperity in America. And now, there's a lot of words; I won't bother reading everything. [Laughter] But agriculture and rural prosperity in America, that's what we want. And we don't want to be taken advantage of by other countries, and that's stopping, and that's stopping fast. Okay, thank you.\n[The President signed the Executive order.]\nWell, perhaps I should give this pen to Sonny Perdue. What do you think? [Laughter]\nAnd thank you very much, everybody.\nCanada-U.S. Trade Relations\nQ. Mr. President, do you fear a trade war with Canada, sir?\nThe President. No, not at all.\nQ. Why not?\nThe President. They have a tremendous surplus with the United States. Whenever they have a surplus, I have no fear. By the way, virtually every country has a surplus with the United States. We have massive trade deficits. So when we're the country with the deficits, we have no fear.\nBorder Security/Immigration\nQ. Will you sign a CR if it doesn't include funding for the wall?\nThe President. Say it?\nQ. Will you sign a CR to continue funding the Government if it doesn't include——\nThe President. The wall is going to get built, by the way. Just in case anybody has any question: The wall is going to get built, and the wall is going to stop drugs, and it's going to stop a lot of people from coming in that shouldn't be here, and it's going to have a huge effect on human trafficking, which is a tremendous problem in this world—a problem that nobody talks about—but it's a problem that's probably worse than any time in the history of this world. Human trafficking, what's going on.\nThe wall is going to get built, and we're setting record numbers in terms of stopping people from coming in, and stopping drugs from coming in. You see the numbers down 73, 74 percent. I will say, Secretary Kelly—formerly General Kelly—is doing an incredible job. And I was just with him a little while ago, and he said we definitely, desperately need the wall. And we're going to have the wall built. I mean, I don't know why people are talking. I watch these shows, and the pundits in the morning; they don't know what they're talking about. The wall gets built—100 percent. Thank you very much.\nQ. When will the wall get built?\nThe President. Soon. We're already preparing. We're doing plans. We're doing specifications. We're doing a lot of work on the wall, and the wall gets built. The wall is very, very important.\nQ. In your first term?\nThe President. Well, it's certainly going to—yes, yes, sure.\nQ. In your first term?\nThe President. We have plenty of time, got a lot of time.\nThank you.", "timestamp": "2017-04-25", "title": "Remarks on Signing an Executive Order on Promoting Agricultural and Rural Prosperity in America and an Exchange With Reporters"}

I'm a senior Department of Education official. I'm just going to read a brief statement about the President's executive order, and then I'll take a few questions.\nSo, today, the President is signing an executive order that delivers on his commitment to ensure education decisions are made by those closest to students. Since our founding, education was intended to be under state and local control. In recent years, however, too many in Washington have advanced top-down mandates that take away autonomy and limit the options available to educators, administrators, and parents.\nToday's executive order puts an end to this overreach, ensuring that states and localities are free to make educational decisions as required by law. This executive order makes certain that local leaders will be making the decisions about what happens in the classroom. Parents will no longer have to worry about the federal government enacting overreaching mandates or requiring states to adopt a federal curriculum at the expense of local education innovation.\nThis EO takes the next needed step toward identifying and eliminating D.C.-driven regulations that attempt to control what students are or aren't taught. Over the next 300 days, this executive order directs Secretary DeVos to review and, if necessary, modify and repeal regulations and guidance issued by the Department of Education with a clear mandate to identify places where D.C. has overstepped its legal authority.\nThe Department's regulatory review task force will manage this process, among other critical regulatory issues, and work with the public to help determine which regulations are inconsistent with federal law. One-size-fits-all policies never work, especially for individual students with individual and unique needs. Supporting local control means supporting education better tailored to the students the school serves. States should have the freedom and flexibility to advance creative and innovative ideas to determine the best ways to provide the highest-quality education possible to every student.\nWith this executive order, President Trump has reaffirmed his commitment to getting the federal government out of the way and to returning control over education back where it belongs, at the state and local level.\nWhen communities and parents make the educational choices, students win. Today's executive order puts us firmly on that track.\nWith that, I'll take a few questions regarding the executive order.\nQ: Hi, this is Allison at Education Week. Can you remind me exactly how this executive order would, I guess, change anything? Because obviously the (inaudible) already included a lot of prohibitions on the Secretary's role. Can you walk me through how this is different from (inaudible)?\nMR. GOAD: Sure, yeah. Well, I think this executive order goes a step beyond (inaudible) by having a comprehensive review of all of the guidance and regulations issued by the previous administration, and then identifying anything that may or may not be consistent with federal law.\nQ: And how long did you say the Secretary will have to do this?\nMR. GOAD: Three-hundred days.\nQ: Three-hundred days. And will there be a public report issued at the end? Or how will the findings be made public?\nMR. GOAD: They will go to the White House, and then, I believe, there will be a public report.\nQ: I'm wondering if this is focused just on K-12, or if this will go into sort of the pre-K and higher-ed spaces as well.\nMR. GOAD: It's just focused on K-12.\nQ: I'm sorry, I couldn't hear your answer to the question about the process. Can you go through that again?\nMR. GOAD: In regards to the process for --\nQ: The report.\nMR. GOAD: So there's going to be a regulatory review task force that will be reviewing the regulations and guidance issued by the previous administration to confirm if they're consistent or inconsistent with federal law. And then there will be a report at the end of 300 days.\nQ: And on that regulatory review task force, will those be Ed Department employees? Or who will be on that task force.\nMR. GOAD: Yes, it's the same task force that is doing the regulatory review at the Department of Education, which I believe was announced yesterday. Bob Eitel will be leading that effort.\nQ: I'm sorry, can you say the name again? Who's leading the effort?\nMR. GOAD: Bob Eitel.\nQ: You said at the top that this executive order would empower the Secretary to modify or get rid of any regulations that don't comply with law. How will that process work?\nMR. GOAD: So I think at the end of 300 days, and after we have produced a report, we will make those decisions once the report has concluded.\nQ: So is she empowered to modify the regulations as needed, or is that going to be a separate process entirely?\nMR. GOAD: The executive order gives her -- empowers her to modify anything that is inconsistent with federal law.\nQ: Isn't she already empowered to do those things? This executive order doesn't give her those powers, right?\nMR. GOAD: That's right. I got time for one more.\nOkay. That's it, guys. Thanks so much.\nEND 10:58 A.M.

SPICER: Never thought so many people would be turning out for the Antiquities Act, but thank you all for being here. Obviously today we're here to talk about the President's effort to provide tax relief to both our corporations that will help grow jobs, and to middle Americans. Two people here to explain it, the Director of our National Economic Council, Gary Cohn, is going to walk through why we're doing what we're doing and then the personal side of the tax. Then Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin will walk through the business side and the corporate side of what the President is doing to bring jobs back to this country, to make our businesses more competitive and help our economy grow.\nAt the end, they'd be glad to take questions on this. You are being provided a one-page right not that provides the top level aspects of the plan. And then both the Director and Secretary will go into further detail and take your questions.\nSo without any further ado, Director Gary Cohn.\nDIRECTOR COHN: Thank you, Sean. And good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for being here. This is quite an historic day for us and one that we've been looking forward to for a long time and one we're very excited about.\nWe have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to do something really big. President Trump has made tax reform a priority, and we have a Republican Congress that wants to get it done. And this is something that, quite honestly, I hope the Democrats would support, too, because it's good for the American people. The President is going to seize this opportunity by leading the most significant tax reform legislation since 1986, and one of the biggest tax cuts in the American history.\nWe've been working on this for a long time. We've had great meetings. We had a great meeting last night with the leadership of the House and the Senate. We have agreed on many of the important principles of tax reform. We look forward to working together with the House and the Senate, very closely, in the weeks ahead.\nThe President has focused on three things since his campaign -- job creation, economic growth, and helping the low- and middle-income families who have been left behind by this economy. He understands there are a lot of people in this country that feel like they work hard and they just cannot get ahead. They are sick of turning their paychecks over to Washington and having no idea of how those dollars are spent. They are frustrated by a tax code that is so complicated they can't even do their own taxes.\nThat's why tax reform is such a big priority to this President. He cares about making the economy work better for all American people.\nHere's a little history. When President Kennedy cut taxes in early 1960, the top rate of personal income was over 90 percent and there was rampant tax avoidance. And then, 20 years later, President Reagan took rates down to 28 percent for individuals. Since then, rates have been creeping back up and more loopholes and special interest tax breaks have made their way back into the tax code, disadvantaging average Americans.\nAnd then, on the business side, when President Reagan left office in 1988, the corporate tax rate was 34 percent, and it hasn't changed much since. For the last 25 years, other countries have been aggressively cutting their tax rates and moving to a territorial system in order to attract business. And the U.S. has done none of that. In 2017, we are still stuck with a 1988 corporate tax. That's why we're now one of the least competitive countries in the developed world when it comes to corporate tax.\nSo tax reform is long overdue. We are going to cut taxes for businesses to make them competitive, and we're going to cut taxes for the American people, especially low- and middle-income families.\nToday I'm going to outline the principles we have put in place for personal tax reform, and then I'm going to hand it over to Secretary Mnuchin to talk about the business side.\nFirst, here are a few statistics for you on the individual side. In 1935, we had a one-page tax form consisting of 34 lines with two pages of instructions. Today the basic 1040 form has 79 lines and 211 pages of instructions. Instead of a single form, the IRS now has 199 tax forms on the individual side of our tax code. Taxpayers spend nearly 7 billion hours complying with these tax codes every year. And nearly 90 percent of taxpayers need some help in filing their taxes.\nWe are going to cut taxes and simplify the tax code by taking the current seven tax brackets we have today and reducing them to only three brackets -- a 10 percent bracket, a 25 percent bracket, and a 35 percent bracket. We're going to double the standard deduction so that a married couple won't pay any taxes on the first $24,000 of income they earn. So, in essence, we are creating a zero tax rate -- yes, a zero tax rate -- for the first $24,000 that a couple earns.\nThe largest standard deduction also leads to simplification because far fewer taxpayers will need to itemize, which means their tax form can go back -- yes -- to that one simple page that I talked about earlier.\nFamilies in this country will also benefit from tax relief to help them with child and dependent care expenses. We are going to repeal the alternative minimum tax. The AMT creates significant complications and burdens which require taxpayers to do their taxes twice to see which is higher. That makes no sense, and we should have one simple tax code.\nAs we all know, job creation and economic growth is the top priority of the administration. Nothing drives economic growth like capital investment. Therefore, we are going to return the top capital gains tax rate and dividend rate to 20 percent, repealing the harmful 3.8 percent Obamacare tax on dividends and capital gains. That tax has been a direct hit on investment income and small business owners.\nWe're going to repeal the death tax. The threat of being hit by the death tax leaves small business owners and farmers in this country to waste countless hours and resources on complicated estate planning to make sure their children aren't hit with a huge tax when they die. No one wants to see their children have to sell the family business to pay an unfair tax.\nWe're going to eliminate most of the tax breaks that are mainly benefits to high-income individuals. Homeownership, charitable giving and retirement savings will be protected. But other tax benefits will be eliminated.\nThis isn't going to be easy. Doing big things never is. We will be attacked from the left and we will be attacked from the right. But one thing is certain: I would never, ever bet against this President. He will get this done for the American people.\nWith that, I'm going to turn it over to Secretary Mnuchin to go through the business tax plan, and then we will both come back and take some questions.\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Thank you, Gary.\nSo as Gary said, we've been working on this plan for a very considerable period of time. And our objective is to make U.S. businesses the most competitive in the world. Right now, we have a 35 percent corporate rate on worldwide income and deferral. It is perhaps the most complicated and uncompetitive business rate in the world. Not a surprise that companies leave trillions of dollars offshore.\nUnder the Trump plan, we will have a massive tax cut for businesses and massive tax reform and simplification. As the President said during the campaign, we will lower the business rate to 15 percent. We will make it a territorial system. We will have a one-time tax on overseas profits, which will bring back trillions of dollars that are offshore to be invested here in the United States to purchase capital and to create jobs.\nThe President is determined to unleash economic growth for businesses. This is not just about large corporations. Small and medium-size businesses will be eligible for the business rate as well.\nAs Gary said, we have had very productive meetings with the House and Senate, working weekly, to get this done. We will continue to do that. We are determined to move this as fast as we can and get this done this year.\nI would also just comment that we will hold listening sessions. One thing this President has done very well is listen. We've had hundreds of business leaders here from all different types of areas -- manufacturers, retail, airlines, community banks, big banks. We are listening and we have been taking feedback.\nFinally, I would just add, the President's objective is creating economic growth. And as we've said before, we believe we can get back to 3 percent or higher GDP that is sustainable in this country. The overall economic plan consists of massive tax cuts and tax reform, regulatory relief, and renegotiating trade deals. And with that, we will unlock the economic growth that's been held back for too long in this country.\nAnd with that, we'd be both happy to take a few questions.\nQ: Thank you, Mr. Secretary. When you talk about the individual tax rates you're also talking about eliminating some of the tax breaks. Are you talking about eliminating tax deductions? And which ones are you talking about eliminating, and which ones are you talking about keeping?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Correct, we are going to eliminate on the personal side all tax deductions other than mortgage interest and charitable deductions. We think that will be sweeping reform.\nQ: Thank you, Secretary. When you talk about lowering dividends and capital gains taxes, how does that mesh with what you said this morning about protecting the middle class from the very, very wealthy who might be able to take advantage of -- I don't know a better word than loopholes, but that would give them a lower tax rate?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Well, again, what we've said is that the business rate is going to be available for small and medium-size businesses as well as corporations. However, we will make sure that there are rules in place so that wealthy people can't create pass-throughs and use that as a mechanism to avoid paying the tax rate that they should be on the personal side.\nAnd I would just say, on the dividend rate, we believe that restoring the 20 percent capital gains rate is critical to investment in this country.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, I have a similar question about your pass-throughs. The initial plan that the President as a candidate outlined also included freelance or contract workers in that 15 percent. I'm wondering if that's the same. What's your rate on repatriation funds overseas?\nAnd, Gary Cohn, what about the marriage penalty? The President promised he would eliminate that.\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Again, I'd comment on the rate of repatriation. We're working with the House and Senate on that, but I will say it will be a very competitive rate that will bring back trillions of dollars. And as it relates to the definition of contractors and things along those lines, those will be the details we will be working with Congress on as we turn this into a bill that will get signed by the President.\nDIRECTOR COHN: So as Secretary Mnuchin said, we are working very diligently with the House and the Senate on coming up with final details of the bill. You're going into very micro-details on some of these --\nQ: And very important ones.\nDIRECTOR COHN: We agree, very important. Our basic premise here is to simplify the tax system, lower rates, and make it easy. We don't want to penalize people. We want to make the system very fair. That is one of the things on our list that we're going to work on, just as Secretary Mnuchin said. We will get back to you with definitive answers on all these details.\nQ: On the 10, 25, and 35 percent rates, do you have income brackets established that you're going to propose?\nDIRECTOR COHN: Again, we are in constant dialogue with the House and the Senate. As the Secretary said, we're holding a bunch of listening groups right now. We have outlines; we have a broad-brush view of where they're going to be. We're running an enormous amount of data on the proposals right now. We will be back to you with very firm details. We're very confident to where they're going to be, we just wanted to get out and give you a broad-brush overview where we are.\nThe President very much believes in taking input, as the Secretary said. Over the next month, we've got a lot of discussions going with a lot of different groups very interested.\nQ: When you said deductions, does that also mean state and local income taxes being eliminated -- those should be eliminated? And how about healthcare?\nDIRECTOR COHN: Yes.\nQ: How about healthcare?\nQ: Mr. Secretary, thank you. And, Mr. Cohn, either one of you -- so when you talk about repealing the 3.8 percent Obamacare tax that hits small business and investment income, is this your first attempt -- official first attempt, I guess, with this to start to pulling back on Obamacare? And also, what do you say to your fellow Republicans who say that this tax reform package is more about corporations versus cutting the deficit?\nDIRECTOR COHN: This tax reform package is about growing the economy, creating jobs. It's about the economy. As I started, President Trump comes in every day and talks to the two of us about economic growth, economic prosperity, and jobs, and what are we doing to stimulate economic growth. That's how we're looking at this plan.\nThe 3.8 percent tax on capital gains, dividends and interest -- the President looks at that very seriously as being a tax on capital being spent to stimulate economic growth, people putting investment capital to work, or people being taxed on their personal businesses. So we're trying to get rid of that to be more stimulative, to have capital go back into the economy to create more jobs.\nQ: So it's more business than Obamacare -- is it more business than a tax on Obamacare?\nDIRECTOR COHN: It's business. It's to stimulate business investment. We are trying to stimulate business investment.\nQ: So on this, first of all, does it pay for itself? Is this plan revenue-neutral? And secondly, what in here is non-negotiable? When this goes over to Congress, Congress comes back with a 20 percent corporate tax rate or -- will the President refuse to sign that?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Well, let me just say again, the core principles of this -- we've been meeting with the House and Senate and they agree a hundred percent. The core business is make business rates competitive, bring back trillions of dollars to create jobs, simplify personal taxes, create a middle-income tax cut. So those core principle are non-negotiable. And that's something that we all feel strongly about.\nAs it relates to will it pay for itself, again, I think as we've said, we're working on lots of details as to this. We have over 100 people in the Treasury that have been working on tax and scoring lots of different scenarios. This will pay for itself with growth and with reduced -- reduction of different deductions and closing loopholes.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, if it turns out that congressional estimates, when this has been scored -- if it turns out that it actually won't be paid for by growth, it won't keep deficits in check, is the President comfortable with that? Will he sign something?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Well, let me just say again, when we look at the deficits, and the deficit has gone from $10 trillion to $20 trillion in the last administration, that is a problem and the President is concerned about that. This plan is going to lower the debt-to-GDP. The economic plan under Trump will grow the economy and will create massive amounts of revenues, trillions of dollars in additional revenues.\nLet's go in the back.\nQ: If you don't replace some of the revenue with the border adjustment tax, how will you make up for the deficit caused by the reduction in the corporate tax rate?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Well, again, today we're putting out the core principles, which include rates because we think that's a very important part of the plan. We will be working very closely, as I said, with the House and the Senate to turn this into a bill that can be passed and the President can sign. And there's lots and lots of details that we're going into how that will pay for itself.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, territorial tax system -- is that a border adjustment tax? Is it tariffs? What is it?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: A territorial tax system means that U.S. companies will pay income on income related to the U.S. So it's territorial -- U.S. companies would not be subject to worldwide income, which has made them uncompetitive.\nQ: Are you concerned that perhaps the Republicans might not go along with this just like they didn't fully go along with the Obamacare repeal --\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Again, I think that there is a lot of desire from everybody to pass tax reform. As Gary said, we are at an historic moment, and Republicans and Democrats want to create jobs and want to help the American people. And as I said, the core principles of this we have agreement on and we will work forward on the details.\nQ: Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Quick question. You bring up repeal of the death tax, the estate tax. This is an issue that's been going on for decades. And it used to be they were always talking about phasing out the death tax over a period of years. Groups such as Jim Martin's 60-Plus Seniors Association said they wouldn't accept it and wanted immediate killing of the death tax. Is that what this is going to be? Or is it going to be a phase-out measure again?\nDIRECTOR COHN: Right now our initial proposal is to immediately phase out -- when this proposal becomes effective -- to phase out the death tax immediately.\nQ: You say \"phase\" and \"immediate.\"\nDIRECTOR COHN: With the implementation of the new tax, the death tax would disappear.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, two questions. One, this is obviously a statement of core principles -- it's just one page. Obviously tax reform would be much more complicated. When will we see the details? When will we see the actual plan?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: We are moving as quickly as we can. So we are working with the House and Senate on all the details. And this is -- everybody has an agreement we are going to move this as fast as we can. And when we have an agreement we will release the details and go through it with all of you.\nQ: And my second question is, will the President release his tax returns so that --\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: The President has no intention -- the President has released plenty of information and I think has given more financial disclosure than anybody else. I think the American population has plenty of information on this --\nQ: Mr. Secretary --\nQ: Mr. Secretary --\nQ: Don't the American people have a right to know how it will affect -- how this tax reform will affect him personally?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Excuse me, other people would like to ask questions.\nQ: My question is to either you, Mr. Secretary, or to Director Cohn. You mentioned middle-class tax cuts -- middle-class families watching this tonight on the news -- a family of four, median income $60,000, what does it mean for them?\nDIRECTOR COHN: It's going to be a tax cut.\nQ: How much?\nDIRECTOR COHN: Going to be a tax cut. You're asking the same question that got asked over here. We will let you know the specific details at the appropriate moment. We are in very robust discussions with the Senate and with the House leadership. They are progressing very quickly. And we will continue to give you more details as we have them.\nQ: -- exactly a year ago then candidate Trump was asked if he believes in raising taxes on the wealthy. He said, I do, I do, including myself, I do. So my question is, why isn't he doing that? And will the President end up paying more or less taxes as a result of this plan?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Let me just comment -- I can't comment on the President's tax situation since I don't have access to that, okay? But I would comment that our objective, okay, is the reduction in taxes will be offset by significant reduction of deductions in other items so that the effective tax rate is what we're focused on.\nWhy don't we take one more question right here.\nQ: You might not have seen the President's tax returns, but according to our estimations, by his 2005 returns that are out there, getting rid of the alternative minimum tax would save him $5.3 -- he would only have to pay $5.3 million in federal income taxes. So your response to those critics who say a lot of what you presented here today could save the President or benefit his own businesses?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Again, let me just comment, what this is about is creating jobs and creating economic growth. And that's what massive tax cuts and massive tax reform and simplifying the system is what we're going to do. The AMT is just another example of a third, complicated set of rules.\nAnyway, thank you, everybody. We appreciate you guys being here.\nEND 2:00 P.M.

EDT\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: Hi, everybody. this is my first briefing, so I'm glad to see you all. Tomorrow, the President is going to be coming over to VA in the afternoon and is going to be signing an executive order that is entitled \"Improving Accountability and Whistleblower Protection.\"\nAs you know, accountability is an important issue to us at VA and something that we're focusing on to make sure that we have employees who work and are committed to the mission of serving our veterans. And when we find employees that have deviated from those values, we want to make sure that we can move them outside the VA and not have them working at VA.\nThe House has passed a bill already on accountability. The Senate is working hard to do the same. The President is committed to this issue and so, therefore, will sign an executive order.\nWhat this Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Office does is it establishes a specific office with an executive in charge that will report directly to me as Secretary so that we can identify barriers that are preventing us from moving employees and people that we have identified that should no longer be working as VA, and make sure that we can do that expeditiously. And that's an important part of one of our priorities in accomplishing the mission that we have to take care of our countries veterans.\nBe glad to take any questions on that issue. Donovan Slack, from USA Today.\nQ: I just want to thank you --\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: I've always wanted to do that. (Laughter.)\nQ: How does this office differ from the Office of Accountability Review?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: The Office of Accountability Review is an office that was set up after our 2014 issue that deals with our senior executives so that we've taken those decision away from the field, so that the central office -- our senior executives can have a special office that reviews their performance and makes recommendations to the department. This is a broader office that will be taking a look at all of our employees.\nQ: So going all the way down?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: Going all the way down, making sure that we identify systemic barriers that prevent us from making the right decisions, and also make sure that we're honoring the communities that we have to our whistleblowers who have come forth and identified issues so that there's not retaliation against them.\nQ: And then, last one, how does this jive with the White House hotline for VA complaints and then the other task force to investigate fraud and abuse?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: Okay, so these are all three efforts that are important for us to identify issues that are preventing us from doing the very best job that we can. So we're keeping our employees and our executives accountable to the values, to be able to work at the VA. We are soliciting input from veterans who feel that they have issues that they want to share with us, and that's what the hotline will be doing. And we are announcing tomorrow a task force for fraud, waste, and abuse to make sure that we are aggressively investigating any issues that might lead to the waste of taxpayer dollars.\nYes, sir.\nQ: Secretary, the VA obviously has had problems with protecting whistleblowers in the past, and this sounds like, potentially, a lot of internal investigations that could be going on to ferret out who said what about whom, who did what. Have you thought about how much -- this office -- to operate is going to cost? How many staff it will have?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: There will be an additional cost to this. This is an important responsibility that we have to make sure that we protect those employees who come forth and tell us about issues, and we don't want retaliation.\nPart of the President's executive order is requiring us to take a look at what resources we already currently have dedicated to these types of activities, and make sure that we're not duplicating our resources, and making sure that when we implement an office like this that it's done in the most efficient way. But this is an important responsibility. Our employees have to feel safe, when they see something, to tell us about it.\nQ: Are you talking about a ballpark figure yet for how much this office will cost to run?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: I don't have the exact figure for that, but these are -- at a department the size that we have, these are not small amounts. This is going to be a substantial commitment.\nQ: Can you talk about staffing for the office? Are you going to have to draw staff for this office from existing VA employees, or will you hire specifically for this office? And if you are drawing staff from people who currently work at VA, is that a concerns given shortages at the department?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: Well, one of the things that we're doing right now is we are looking at our current structure in our corporate setting. We think that the staffing has gotten too large at our corporate offices and we want to make sure that our resources are out into the field where we can be helping with direct service to veterans.\nSo as we look through our modernization efforts, we're looking to take the current staff and move them into new organizations like this. So I am not anticipating that we're looking at adding new staff, but we're looking at using our current staff in a more efficient way.\nQ: So as you mentioned, so the House has passed a bill that would really clear the path for you to be able to terminate people who have been accused of misconduct. So what -- I'm not clear where the responsibilities of the staff of this new office fall. And do you need Congress -- I mean, why have Congress passed a bill if you have this office? And what is -- what can't you -- you, the VA -- manage the VA now to fire someone who has been incompetent or whatever, that this office gives you the power to do?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: Well, I think that what you're seeing now is the President's commitment to making sure that we stay on track with this and that we're moving aggressively. And so he's asking through his executive order for the VA to do everything that it can internally. But we know that that's not going to be enough to get done what I want to get done, which is to be able to, once we identify people that need to leave the organization, to get them out quickly.\nSo I do need legislative help as well. So the House has passed a bill. The Senate is working on one. We need them to come to agreement to be able to give the President a bill to sign. It will be that combination of a legislative solution with an office in the VA that we will stand up because of the executive order. But I think what is necessary to make sure that we are moving people out of the VA when it is identified to be appropriate to take that action.\nQ: Okay, but in the absence of legislation, what powers do you have now, by standing up this office, that you don't have right now, if there's employee who has -- watch porn, or you know, done whatever -- wasted money, stolen money, whatever?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: I think what this is doing is it's elevating the office directly under me so that this is a direct report to the Secretary. So it's taking accountability up to the highest level.\nSecondly, it's asking us to do the internal review to make sure that our current efforts aren't duplicative. That they are the most efficient possible. And if do identify that there are resources requirements needed, that we address those and that we make sure that there's an immediate focus on on this issue.\nQ: How you are going to convince the whistleblowers that they are safe? You know how things work in the government offices. How are you going to assure them that if they come forward, they are covered?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: Well, once again, this office is going to have a direct report to me. And we will be in investigating any issues related to retaliation. And the message is clear that we will not tolerate whistleblower retaliation in the Department of Veteran Affairs. And we will take actions if we do determine that retaliation has been imposed upon an employee who has come forth with an issue.\nQ: The OAR, did it not report to the Secretary before?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: No, it reports through our office of legal counsel.\nQ: And will that office still exist?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: Yes, it will.\nQ: This office is on top of that?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: Yes. And one of the issues that the President has asked us to do in the executive order is take a look at areas that are duplications. So if there is overlap, we will look at that and potentially address that. But right now, this OAR office, Office of Accountability and Review, is focused on our senior executives.\nQ: Just a quick one from the personnel -- a friend of mine who was in Maine and was in Japan, came back and most of the time he complains that he goes to the VA hospital, that even at -- the problem is at the reception. The receptionist is talking on the phone, or he has given his address change twice. It didn't change. So what are you going to do about those frontline -- they first meet them and they are really disappointed?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: Right. Well, this is different than an accountability action. What you're talking about is poor customer service and poor focus and attention and poor training.\nAnd so what we are doing is focusing on creating a culture where that doesn't exist. I can't tell you today that with 360,000 employees that people don't on occasion experience that. What we're working hard to do is to make sure that everybody who works in the VA understands that their mission is to serve and to serve our veterans. And when we find behaviors like that, we had to address them from a management perspective, not necessarily an accountability perspective.\nQ: Two quick questions for you. One, will this office address the time that it's often taken the IG to do investigations on personnel when an issue does come up? I believe that's been a challenge for you all in the past.\nAnd then, two, how does this office differ from the Central Whistleblower Office that I think you all were supposed -- or are standing up with the NEAA?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: So in regards to IG investigations, no, this will not address that. The IG is an independent body, and this will not be addressed in that. But I've already said that we will not be waiting for the IG to finish their investigations if we have enough evidence to be able to take an action on accountability and on the status of employment.\nOn the Whistleblower Office, yes, these are similar. We have been asked through a piece of legislation to stand up a Whistleblower Office, and that will be part of this office. We will not duplicate that.\nQ: Can you give us an update on the Washington, D.C. medical center?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: Yes. The Washington, D.C. medical center, as people may know, experienced a problem with their inventory control system. The IG issued an interim report that I found concerning enough that I made a change in management.\nWe have put in a new acting director that was hand-selected by me who has been there day and night. The inventory control system, which was not in place was put in place and has been in place since 48 hours after we discovered the issue. Patient safety is not at all compromised. There has not been any patient harm that we are aware of, of this. And we are continuing our investigation as to the actions that will result from the management perspective.\nQ: Can I ask one more thing? You said I think said recently publicly there was some -- an employee accused of watching pornography or something like that?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: Yes.\nQ: And you said something to the effect of, well, I can't fire that person, or it's difficult for me.\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: Yes.\nQ: So what is this new antidote going to do to enhance your ability to move forward with something like that?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: That was a situation where we found a physician that had been watching pornography in the setting with a patient. Because that was raised to my attention, I made the decision personally to propose the removal of that employee. And that was done immediately.\nThis is the type of action that this office is going to allow, when there is outrageous behavior that's not acceptable to us, it is going to raise it to the visibility of this office that will report directly to me so that we can make sure those decisions are made quickly and decisively.\nQ: But will appeal rights for civil servants be changed? You can't do that without legislation, right?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: Yes, this will not change the process. And if there is any change to the process, to the due process, that would need to be done legislatively.\nQ: Thank you.\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: Thank you very much, everybody.\nEND 6:34 P.M.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123850", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n3:30 P.M. EDT\nAIDE: I'm here to introduce a senior administration official, well known to you all, I'm sure. This is off the record and off camera, and he will remain a senior administration official. I know that's disappointing, but that's the way it is.\nQ: On background?\nAIDE: Background, sorry.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: All right, good to see you. So what I'm here to talk about is really the actions of the national security team here and the events and initiatives and efforts to advance and protect U.S. interests in the area of national security over the first 100 days of the Trump presidency.\nI do believe this has been a period of time in which the national security team has worked extremely well together to provide options for the President to deal with some of our most vexing, difficult issues, problems, and also in an effort to take advantage of opportunities to advance and protect U.S. interests.\nAs you know, there have been a number of events in the world that demanded a U.S. response. Those include the Syrian regime's use of chemical weapons against its own people, and a pattern of murderous activity on the part of that regime, with many of those actions involving weapons of mass destruction, chemical weapons.\nAnd then, also, we've been engaged in efforts to establish and maintain strong relationships with key allies and partners, and to forge some new relationships that will allow us to identify areas of cooperation. I think that that characterizes the summit with President Xi of China. And, of course, as you've all been reporting on, we have the problem set of North Korea and North Korea's development of nuclear weapons and a ballistic missile program that poses a grave threat to our partners and everyone in the region, but also represents a potential threat to the U.S. homeland.\nThere's no shortage of things, of course, to talk about in terms of the ongoing campaign against ISIS -- a campaign that has been centered, really, in Iraq and in Syria, but, as you know, reaches far beyond that into other regions and into Afghanistan, the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region, for example, and then into North Africa, the Maghreb, and so forth.\nSo I could try to summarize these, but I think what I'd really like to do is hear what's on your minds, what questions you have, what you'd like me to discuss.\nQ: I was wondering if putting North Korea back on the state sponsor of terrorism list, one of the major priorities that this administration is pushing for, especially with the meeting of senators now, and what are some other options that you put on the table?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: That is one of the things we're considering. We're looking at a broad range of options, obviously, across all elements of national power and multinational power in connection with North Korea. And so what the President has done is he's made a decision for us to pursue a certain course, and that course obviously has a number of options associated with it, depending on how the situation develops in the future.\nSo I think that what you've seen is really an integrated effort to prioritize diplomatic and informational aspects of national power, but also what you'll see soon is using the economic dimension of national power, as well as the military preparations that are underway.\nQ: Do you have a timeline?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, we have timelines in mind for what we would like to see changed, but it's mainly event-driven. It depends on the actions of North Korea. It depends on the actions of others whose help we're looking for in resolving this problem and moving toward the goal of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\nI'll go to the far back, the gentleman with the mustache there.\nQ: Thank you, all. You recently visited India, Afghanistan and Pakistan. We haven't heard from you what your meetings were, especially with the Indians. When is the Afghanistan review coming out?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, we're in the midst of a policy review, so I don't really want to foreclose on any of the discussions we're going to have with the national security team and with the President. What we've been able to do, though, is take a fresh look at a problem that we've been engaged with for 15 years, and identify, really, how that -- and understand better how that conflict has evolved in Afghanistan and evolved in Pakistan, as well.\nAnd what we're determined to do is to take a regional perspective, a regional look at the problem, and to make sure that we're integrating again all of our efforts. And what we found is that often what's been consistent, I think, in recent years is that we've often done just enough in Afghanistan to avoid failure, but maybe not done enough. And when I say \"enough,\" I don't mean scale of effort as much of integration of our efforts to succeed.\nAnd I think the other critical thing that we've looked at is that our approach to regional aspects of the problem has to change, because we've taken a consistent approach, for example, to the regional dimensions of the problem, and haven't really seen improvements in assistance from others and efforts to address the problem in Afghanistan more effectively.\nSo what we've done is really looked at opportunities to better connect what we're doing militarily in Afghanistan, which, as you know, involves a very significant counterterrorism effort that was highlighted by recent operations against ISIS Khorasan in the far eastern part of the country, in Nangarhar Province. Very effective operations that have resulted in the destruction of a large percentage of that enemy force, and an enemy that is an ISIS enemy, but we've identified, really, overlap with Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan groups, as well as Lashkar-e-Taiba and other groups there. So it's a counterterrorism effort, certainly.\nBut the other aspect, the military effort, is to advise and assist the Afghan security forces. And you saw the very serious attacks against those forces this past week, which highlights the need for us to work with the Afghan government, to strengthen those security forces, which you know have been fighting and making tremendous sacrifices to defend their nation and their people against the Taliban, the Haqqani Network, as well as these transnational terrorist organizations that were seeking the safe haven and support base in Afghanistan.\nBut, oftentimes, what hasn't happened is a connection -- very strong connection between that military effort and political efforts and diplomatic efforts, and so forth. And so that's what we're endeavoring to do with this review, is to create options that produce a better integrated effort and a more effective effort.\nQ: Can you tell us a little bit about what the briefing with the senators is all about?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: What we wanted to highlight obviously -- and of course the Senate asked for a hearing, essentially, and the President offered to host it here at the White House -- to communicate the seriousness of the threat from North Korea and to allow the senators to ask questions of the national security team and understand better the nature of the threat, but also what our response to that threat has been and how we're proceeding to protect the American people and our partners in the region from this very grave threat represented by what we know is a brutal regime, what we know is an unpredictable regime, what we know is a capable regime in terms of conventional military capabilities, and a regime that holds at risk a large portion of the population of South Korea.\nBut, now, really a new level of threat from North Korea associated with the unacceptable and erratic and unlawful behavior of the Kim regime -- Kim Jong-un's regime -- are represented by the murder of his brother using a nerve agent in a public place, in an airport, but also the increasing capability for destruction that that regime possesses in the form of a nuclear program and the ballistic missile program. So it's about the seriousness, and it's about a discussion of a strategy and approach that's developed a broad range of options to remove this threat not only to the American people, but to our allies and partners in the region.\nQ: Sorry, I just had a follow-up on that.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I'll just go to Kim.\nQ: I would like to ask, are they getting a list of options, but also, what do you assess is the risk of a miscalculation by North Korea. If there is a U.S. preemptive strike of some sort, do you assume that they will launch some sort of an attack on South Korea or Japan?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, what we've done is taken a very systematic look at this, and obviously everything begins with our intelligence community and their assessments.\nBut then even as we take certain actions as we put into place elements of these integrated -- of this integrated strategy, we ask the intelligence community to help us anticipate reactions to our actions. And then if there's risk associated with that, we build into the strategy efforts to mitigate risk.\nObviously nothing is risk-free, and certainly this situation is not risk-free. But the team has done everything that we can to try to anticipate reactions and then mitigate any risk associated with those.\nQ: What is the state of play with North Korea? Are they -- do they seem to be on the brink of another nuclear test? Or are they about to test another ballistic missile?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, what we have seen in recent weeks are indications that they were preparing these kind of activities. We've seen a pattern of activities, right, over recent years. And what we saw instead was a conventional firepower demonstrated associated with army day on the 25th. But we're remaining vigilant to identify any indicators of another nuclear test or of a ballistic missile test or certainly an intercontinental ballistic missile test; and are prepared to respond to any of those provocations.\nLet's go in the far back with the -- the plaid shirt.\nQ: Thank you.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Actually, it was the man behind you, but I'll take the plaid tie, followed by the plaid shirt. How about that?\nQ: Thank you. Did I hear you correctly at the top saying that the North Korean strategy is evolving, where there will be -- soon there will be an economic dimension, as well as military preparations? That's obviously going to get a lot of attention. Can you flesh that out a little bit for us? What kinds of preparations are we talking about? Are they going to be visible to the North Koreans?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, so, of course, some of the economic actions take time to develop. And what we're endeavoring to do is to work with partners in the region and others to isolate the North Korean ballistic missile program and the nuclear program from any sort of external support.\nIf you just look at the images, right, of the big parade there recently and look at the complexity of that equipment, those components, even the tires, right, are not made in North Korea. So it's clear that all of us have a lot more to do to isolate the regime from its access to the kind of materials and technologies and components it needs to advance those two very dangerous programs.\nQ: The military preparations that you mentioned, sir? The military preparations.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, those -- I don't think we're going to describe those in any detail.\nQ: Thank you. We've seen a broader view of the President's foreign policy. Last night Chief of Staff Reince Priebus offered us a first draft of what he would define the Trump doctrine as. I was hoping you might be able to put a finer point on what you believe now -- here in the 100 days -- what is the Trump doctrine?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, what I would say a couple of observations you could make -- whether it's actually a component of the Trump doctrine or not, that's up to the President. And we're working on that. Dr. Nadia Schadlow is here. She's working on the national security strategy, working with the President's team and the President to get his guidance and to formulate that national security strategy -- the congressionally mandated national security strategy.\nBut I think what you've seen is that the President obviously weighs the risk of any action that he's anticipating. But what he's also done in these first few weeks is weigh the risk of inaction. And whereas, considering the risk only of action could have the tendency to paralyze a leader, I think what he's done is he's recognized that there is a cost associated with inaction. And I think the obvious example of this is the response to the mass murder of civilians with chemical weapons in Syria.\nAnd so the actions that he's taken, though, I would say -- and this is another element of how we've seen the President lead, is that he doesn't just look at a discreet event and react to that event. He tries to use that event and the U.S. response to it to make progress toward objectives that are related to the security and prosperity of the American people.\nThe other thing I would say an element of the Trump doctrine is, it's not doctrinaire at all. (Laughter.) It's very pragmatic. It's based on the President's consultation with his advisers and his national security team, for whom he has a great deal of trust. So I think that there's some sort of top-level observations you can make about what is the Trump doctrine. But there will be more about that in the coming months.\nGentleman right here.\nQ: Thank you very much. Moving back to ISIS, again, early on, during the campaign, the President said over and over again that one of his hopes was to get along with Russia and to work with Russia to defeat ISIS. Obviously, the situation is not the same as it was during the campaign between the two countries. But what if any efforts can we expect to reach out to the Russian government and try to work together on this one issue where our interests most definitely align?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, I think Secretary Tillerson has been really clear about this that while we are going to confront what we regard as Russian inappropriate and regretful and support for the Assad regime, for example, that we'll continue to look for ways to cooperate with Russia.\nWhile we will not back off from our support for our European allies and for partners in Southern and Central Europe that have been subjected to a sophisticated campaign of subversion and disinformation, or we're not going to back away from our NATO allies and their efforts to stand up to a very sophisticated Russian approach to try to undermine the alliance, what we are looking for are areas and opportunities and places to cooperate with Russia.\nAnd there are areas where our interests overlap. You mentioned one of those, which is the defeat of ISIS and the denial of ISIS control of territory and populations in Syria, for example.\nBut we have to also recognize that it's Russia's support for the Assad regime, along with their Iranian allies, that helps perpetuate the cycle of sectarian violence there, and the chaotic environment that perpetuates human suffering and obstructs really a sustainable end to the civil war there.\nSo the simple answer to your question is while we will compete with Russia where we think that our interests are at odds with them, we are looking for areas that we can cooperate.\nQ: And those areas, what kind of outreach has there been?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, you saw Secretary Tillerson's visit to Russia, and then there will be follow up from that. And he's the best person to ask about that. He certainly has the lead.\nYes.\nQ: Can I just follow in the conversation about the DPRK? Obviously there has been a lot of discussion by President Trump about his relationship with President Xi. Can you talk about what you realistically believe that Beijing can accomplish given the fact that even over the weekend, we've seen a war of words between Pyongyang and Beijing. They're not exactly seeing eye-to-eye all the time these days. What is a realistic expectation? And are you encouraging them to have a carrot as well as a stick with respect to economic incentives, not just denials?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, what the President said is, we'll see, right? And he has certainly established a very close, personal relationship with President Xi, and there are areas, as you know, where our interests overlap. And I think what's different about how China is viewing the problem in North Korea today is that China is viewing that problem as a threat not only to U.S. interests and security, or South Korea and/or Japanese interests and security, but also a threat to Chinese interests and security. And so I think that is a big shift in and of itself.\nThe second thing is the willingness to support -- or at least not block the United Nations' and international community's sanction of Syria for the use of weapons of mass destruction. I think that indicated another area that we can work together.\nYou have seen some early indications of China doing a better job enforcing existing U.N. sanctions on North Korea, as well as I think you see in the Chinese press and in other areas really a clear effort to communicate to North Korea that its behavior, its provocative behavior, the nuclear test, missile tests, the existence of these programs can't be tolerated.\nAnd so I think you've seen two things -- and acknowledgement of the threat to China, but I think you've also seen a willingness for China to take this problem on in new ways. And I think we ought to suspend judgment until we see how this develops in the coming days, months, so forth.\nAll right, thanks. I will just say one last thing just in conclusion, and I'll just say that I think it is -- you've seen that the team has really come together well around these complex issues. And if you think about the pace of events and the degree of concurrent activity that we have going on, you can I think recognize that we are achieving a degree of strategic competence here by being able to view events and what's happening day-to-day in context with what we're trying to achieve overall.\nAnd one of the things that the President has asked us to do is to get the White House out of tactical details day-to-day. He trusts his national security team to implement. And so what you have now is a focus on the part of the National Security Council on identifying what are the biggest problems and dangers and threats to our national security, but also what are the biggest opportunities?\nAnd now what we're doing is organizing our efforts around framing some of these problems and opportunities, viewing them through the lens of U.S. vital interests, and primarily obviously the security of the American people, and then establishing clear objectives, and then working together at a very senior level to identify how we can integrate efforts across the elements of national power, diplomatically, informationally, militarily, economically, law enforcement, intelligence and so forth to advance towards those objectives.\nAnd, of course, none of these problems and opportunities are going to be easy to either capitalize on or to solve, but the team I think has the right focus, has come together. And I think we have really the ability now to not just respond to events, but to understand how events fit in to what we'd like to achieve at a larger level of generality.\nSo, thank you.\nEND 3:41 P.M.

It's my great honor, on behalf of the President and the First Lady, to welcome you all to the White House. This is a distinguished group of American leaders, governors and members of Congress, and members of our Cabinet, and we're grateful to have you all here.\nYou know, for nearly 100 days, President Trump has been delivering on the promises that he made to the American people. The President has been fighting for American jobs every single day since he was elected, putting renewed emphasis on American energy, cutting through a mountain range of red tape from the last administration. And today, the administration outlined the President's vision for tax reform which will include one of the largest tax cuts for individuals and businesses in the history of this country. (Applause.)\nThanks to the President Trump's leadership, more than 500,000 jobs have been created in 2017 alone. Businesses and consumers are more confident than they have been in years, and by some measure, for decades. It is truly extraordinary.\nIn a word, President Trump has simply been in the promise-keeping business since Inauguration Day. He signed 28 bills into law, the most of any President since 1947, and he'll have signed some 30 executive orders in his first 100 days, including the action today.\nAnd today the President is actually delivering on one more of his promises to the American people. Since day one, President Trump has been working tirelessly to uphold the Constitution and restore the proper balance between the states and the federal government. And that's been especially true with the President's focus on education.\nNow as a former governor myself, I've always believed, as the President does, that education is a state and local function, and that decisions in education are best made by parents and teachers and local administrators. The decisions over our children's school should be made by parents and local administrators, not by politicians or unelected bureaucrats in a far, distant capital.\nThe President believes the same thing, and the efforts that he will take today through this executive order will continue that process of empowering our families, empowering our states to ensure that every child in America has access to a world-class education.\nAnd so with a grateful heart, I say, on behalf of the 45th President of the United States and on behalf of all those gathered here today, it is my high honor and distinct privilege to introduce to you the President of the United States, President Donald Trump.

Murkowski of Alaska; and Secretary of the Interior Ryan K. Zinke.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123833", "text": "The President. Thank you, Mike. He's been a great Vice President, a great help. And everybody loves Mike Pence. So I just want to thank you for your service. Been incredible.\nIt's a real pleasure to be at the Department of Interior, where you help preserve the splendor and the beauty of America's natural resources. And I can tell you, the group that's in here right now, they're really doing the job. Right, Lisa? They're doing a good job. We're going to take care of Alaska too. Don't worry about it. [Laughter] And they protect the ability of the people to access and utilize the land which truly belongs to them and belongs to all of us.\nSecretary Ryan Zinke is doing an incredible job, and he never overlooks the details. He's a detail person. Soon after he was confirmed, we had a snowstorm, big one, and he was out there on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial shoveling the snow all by himself. And he's a strong guy. He did a good job. [Laughter] He did a very, very good job. But we're proud of him.\nIn the first 100 days, we have taken historic action to eliminate wasteful regulations. They're being eliminated like nobody has ever seen before. There has never been anything like it. Sometimes, I look at some of the things I'm signing, I say maybe people won't like it, but I'm doing the right thing. And no regular politician is going do it. [Laughter] I don't know if you folks would do—I will tell you literally some politicians have said: \"You're doing the right thing. I don't know if I would have had the courage to do some of these things.\" But we're doing them because it's the right thing to do. And it's for the good of the Nation.\nWe're returning power back to the people. We've eliminated job-destroying regulations on farmers, ranchers, and coal miners, on autoworkers, and so many other American workers and businesses.\nToday I am signing a new executive order to end another egregious abuse of Federal power and to give that power back to the States and to the people, where it belongs. The previous administration used a 100-year-old law known as the Antiquities Act to unilaterally put millions of acres of land and water under strict Federal control—have you heard about that?—[laughter]—eliminating the ability of the people who actually live in those States to decide how best to use that land. Today we are putting the States back in charge. It's a big thing.\nI am pleased to be joined by so many Members of Congress and Governors who have been waiting for this moment, including Governor Herbert of Utah. Thank you, thank you, Governor. Governor LePage of Maine, who, by the way, has lost a lot of weight. [Laughter] I knew him when he was heavy, and now I know him when he's thin, and I like him both ways, okay? [Laughter] Done a great job. Governor Calvo of Guam. Thank you. Governor Torres from the Northern Mariana Islands. Thank you, thank you, Governor.\nI also want to recognize Senator Orrin Hatch, who—believe me, he's tough. He would call me and call me and say, \"You've got to do this.\" Is that right, Orrin?\nSenator Orrin G. Hatch. That's right. The President. You didn't stop. He doesn't give up. And he's shocked that I'm doing it, but I'm doing it because it's the right thing to do. But I really have to point you out; you didn't stop.\nAnd, Mike, the same thing. So many people feel—Mike Lee—so many people feel so strongly about this, and so I appreciate your support and your prodding, and your never-ending prodding, I should say, because we're now getting something done that many people thought would never ever get done, and I'm very proud to be doing it in honor of you guys, okay? Thank you.\nAltogether, the previous administration bypassed the States to place over 265 million acres—that's a lot of land, million acres. Think of it: 265 million acres of land and water under Federal control through the abuse of the monuments designation. That's larger than the entire State of Texas.\nIn December of last year alone, the Federal Government asserted this power over 1.35 million acres of land in Utah, known as Bears Ears—I've heard a lot about Bears Ears, and I hear it's beautiful—over the profound objections of the citizens of Utah. The Antiquities Act does not give the Federal Government unlimited power to lock up millions of acres of land and water, and it's time we ended this abusive practice.\nI've spoken with many State and local leaders—a number of them here today—who care very much about preserving our land and who are gravely concerned about this massive Federal land grab. And it's gotten worse and worse and worse, and now we're going to free it up, which is what should have happened in the first place. This should never have happened.\nThat's why today I am signing this order and directing Secretary Zinke to end these abuses and return control to the people: the people of Utah, the people of all of the States, the people of the United States.\nEvery day, we are going to continue pushing ahead with our reform agenda to put the American people back in charge of their Government and their lives.\nAnd again, I want to congratulate the Secretary. I want to congratulate Orrin and Mike and all of the people that worked so hard on bringing it to this point. And tremendously positive things are going to happen on that incredible land, the likes of which there is nothing more beautiful anywhere in the world. But now tremendously positive things will happen.\nSo I want to thank you. I want to thank everybody for being here. God bless you all and God bless America. Thank you. Thank you very much. So I'll sign. This is a big one. [Laughter]\nAre you ready? I think we have to maybe give him the pen. [Laughter] What do you think?\nSen. Hatch. I would treasure it. I'll tell you that.\n[At this point, the President signed the Executive order.]\nThe President. Thank you very much. It's a great honor. Thank you.\nRuling by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on the President's Executive Order Titled \"Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States\"\nQ. Mr. Trump, are you surprised about this new Ninth Circuit ruling? The President. I'm never surprised by the Ninth Circuit. [Laughter] As I said, we'll see them in the Supreme Court.

Policy. Designations of national monuments under the Antiquities Act of 1906, recently recodified at sections 320301 to 320303 of title 54, United States Code (the \"Antiquities Act\" or \"Act\"), have a substantial impact on the management of Federal lands and the use and enjoyment of neighboring lands. Such designations are a means of stewarding America's natural resources, protecting America's natural beauty, and preserving America's historic places. Monument designations that result from a lack of public outreach and proper coordination with State, tribal, and local officials and other relevant stakeholders may also create barriers to achieving energy independence, restrict public access to and use of Federal lands, burden State, tribal, and local governments, and otherwise curtail economic growth. Designations should be made in accordance with the requirements and original objectives of the Act and appropriately balance the protection of landmarks, structures, and objects against the appropriate use of Federal lands and the effects on surrounding lands and communities.\nSec. 2. Review of National Monument Designations. (a) The Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) shall conduct a review of all Presidential designations or expansions of designations under the Antiquities Act made since January 1, 1996, where the designation covers more than 100,000 acres, where the designation after expansion covers more than 100,000 acres, or where the Secretary determines that the designation or expansion was made without adequate public outreach and coordination with relevant stakeholders, to determine whether each designation or expansion conforms to the policy set forth in section 1 of this order. In making those determinations, the Secretary shall consider:\n(i) the requirements and original objectives of the Act, including the Act's requirement that reservations of land not exceed \"the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected\";\n(ii) whether designated lands are appropriately classified under the Act as \"historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, [or] other objects of historic or scientific interest\";\n(iii) the effects of a designation on the available uses of designated Federal lands, including consideration of the multiple-use policy of section 102(a)(7) of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (43 U.S.C. 1701(a)(7)), as well as the effects on the available uses of Federal lands beyond the monument boundaries;\n(iv) the effects of a designation on the use and enjoyment of non-Federal lands within or beyond monument boundaries;\n(v) concerns of State, tribal, and local governments affected by a designation, including the economic development and fiscal condition of affected States, tribes, and localities;\n(vi) the availability of Federal resources to properly manage designated areas; and (vii) such other factors as the Secretary deems appropriate.\n(b) In conducting the review described in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall consult and coordinate with, as appropriate, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the heads of any other executive departments or agencies concerned with areas designated under the Act.\n(c) In conducting the review described in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall, as appropriate, consult and coordinate with the Governors of States affected by monument designations or other relevant officials of affected State, tribal, and local governments.\n(d) Within 45 days of the date of this order, the Secretary shall provide an interim report to the President, through the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, and the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality, summarizing the findings of the review described in subsection (a) of this section with respect to Proclamation 9558 of December 28, 2016 (Establishment of the Bears Ears National Monument), and such other designations as the Secretary determines to be appropriate for inclusion in the interim report. For those designations, the interim report shall include recommendations for such Presidential actions, legislative proposals, or other actions consistent with law as the Secretary may consider appropriate to carry out the policy set forth in section 1 of this order.\n(e) Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Secretary shall provide a final report to the President, through the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, and the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality, summarizing the findings of the review described in subsection (a) of this section. The final report shall include recommendations for such Presidential actions, legislative proposals, or other actions consistent with law as the Secretary may consider appropriate to carry out the policy set forth in section 1 of this order.\nSec. 3. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nDONALD J.

We very much appreciate it.\nAnd I want to thank also Education Secretary Betsy DeVos for spearheading our effort to restore State and local control of our schools. Thank you very much, Betsy. With her help, we are empowering those who know our students best—I would say, by far, the best, right, Betsy?—their parents and the teachers so that every child has the chance to succeed.\nIn fact, we're proud to have some of those wonderful teachers here with us today, and we'd like to welcome all of them to the White House. It's a great honor. [Applause] I also—thank you. Thank you very much.\nI also want to thank Members of Congress, local leaders, and Governors for joining us here today, including Governor Ivey of Alabama, a new and great Governor. She will be fantastic. I've been hearing about you for years in the positive way, so I'm not surprised that you're Governor of Alabama. Congratulations.\nGovernor Kay E. Ivey of Alabama. Thank you so much, Mr. President.\nThe President. Tremendous.\nGovernor Branstad, who is soon going to be heading out, I suspect, to a place called China. [Laughter] They love him, I will tell you. They really love the soon-to-be Ambassador, but he also loves China. So it was a good combination. I was very happy to put it together. They're looking forward to seeing you. Very much so.\nGovernor Terry E. Branstad of Iowa. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\nThe President. Thank you. Thank you, Governor.\nGovernor LePage of Maine, Governor Sandoval of Nevada, Governor Herbert of Utah, Governor Mead of Wyoming—we want to thank you all and everyone else for being with us. It's really an honor to have you in the White House.\nFor too long, the Federal Government has imposed its will on State and local governments. The result has been education that spends more and achieves far, far, far less. My administration has been working to reverse this Federal power grab and give power back to families, cities, States—give power back to localities.\nBefore this administration, only one time in our Nation's history had a President signed a bill that used the Congressional Review Act to cancel a Federal regulation. In less than 100 days, I have signed 13 bills such congressional resolutions to cancel Federal regulations and give power back to the people, and I'm very honored to have done so. I've also—[applause]. Thank you.\nRepresentative Virginia A. Foxx . Five of those have come from my committee.\nThe President. That's true. As you said, five have come from your committee, that's exactly right. Rep. Foxx. Five came from the Education and the Workforce Committee.\nThe President. Good job. [Laughter] I think she's done a good job.\nI've also signed over a dozen executive actions that reverse Federal intrusion and empower local communities.\nThe Executive order I'm signing today is another critical step to restoring local control, which is so important. This Executive order directs Secretary DeVos to review current Federal regulations and ensure that they don't obstruct the ability of States, local governments, teachers, and most importantly, parents, to make the best decision for their students and, in many cases, for their children.\nPrevious administrations have wrongfully forced States and schools to comply with Federal whims and dictate what our kids are taught. But we know that local communities do it best and know it best. The time has come to empower parents and teachers to make the decisions that help their students achieve success. That's what this Executive order is all about. So important.\nThomas Jefferson put it best when he said, \"I believe the States can best govern our home concerns.\" With this Executive order and the many actions we have taken in less than 100 days, we are providing our States and communities with control over the matters that are most important to them. Together, we are going to fight to give our children the bright and beautiful future they deserve.\nSo I want to thank you all. As you know, I'm heading over to a Senate meeting. That's a very important meeting. So I'll be leaving now, but I just wanted to introduce our really exceptional Education Secretary. She's caught on—you wouldn't believe it, all of the great things I'm hearing about you, Betsy. I'm very proud. So Secretary Betsy DeVos. Thank you very much. Thank you.\nHealth Care Reform Legislation\nQ. Mr. President, would you like to see a health care vote by the end of this week? Would you like to see that, sir?\nThe President. Always.\nQ. Always?\nQ. Mr. President, what will you tell the Senators that without your approval——\nQ. Mr. President, can you promise the American people that your tax bill will not balloon the deficit?\nSecretary of Education Elisabeth P. DeVos. So it has been all of our experience, that those closest to the problem are best equipped to solve it. That means empowering parents, teachers, State and local leaders, not the Federal Government. Time and time again, we've seen that one-size-fits-all policies and mandates from Washington simply don't work. We can't have a cookie-cutter approach to education. Each State and each school have different challenges, and each individual student has unique needs.\nOur solutions should be as varied as the students we serve. The Every Student Succeeds Act was a good step in this direction, giving flexibility to States to best meet the needs of their communities. We're going to implement this law as Congress intended, not how the previous administration dictated. When we give decision-making power back to states and communities, students benefit. This Executive order puts us on that track.\nSo I thank the President for signing this Executive order and for his commitment to an education policy that puts students first. It's my honor now to introduce the Governor of the great State of Nevada, Brian Sandoval.\nGovernor Brian E. Sandoval of Nevada. Thank you Madam Secretary and Mr. President.\nThe President. Oh, it's going to be a short speech because I—I just felt I had to stay here. [Laughter] I know—[laughter].\nGov. Sandoval. It just got shorter, Mr. President. [Laughter] Yes.\nMr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Governors, Representatives, teachers, educators: It really is a privilege and honor to be with you all today. You know, in my home State of Nevada, I often say that what happens in our schools today will determine the future of our great State. And Mr. President, I know that your action today will empower every State to improve our delivery of education. Most importantly, it will allow Governors across the Nation to ensure that all States serve all students from all backgrounds.\nNow, as the incoming chair of the National Governors Association, I know that the Governors will collectively continue to act as the national voice on federalism. And as the leaders of education in our States, we look forward to working with this administration to ensure our role is reflected in Federal policy.\nNow, over time, the Department of Education's obligations have grown beyond its initial charge, and many well-intended acts resulted in States feeling more and more constrained by Federal rules. Today, Mr. President, you're signing of this Executive order will place the States back in the driver's seat. Thank you, sir.\nSo, Mr. President, again, I'm going skip a page—[laughter]. Because your standing—[laughter].\nThe President. Thank you. It's education for North Korea. [Laughter] I like education.\nGov. Sandoval. This is even better than I hoped for, Mr. President. [Laughter] The Every Student Succeeds Act embodies the vision you have for education and the limited role of the Federal Government.\nMr. President, you have changed the game for the better in the United States, and for that I thank you for your leadership. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.\nThe President. This is a good one, right? Enforcing Statutory Prohibitions on Federal Control of Education. Doesn't get better than that, right?\n[At this point, the President signed the Executive order.]\nThe President. All right, so who should get this pen?\nParticipant. Virginia Foxx.\nParticipant. Or a teacher from Virginia.\nThe President. You want to do that?\nRep. Foxx. One of the teachers, absolutely.\nThe President. Come on. Tax Reform\nQ. Mr. President, can you say to the American people that your tax plan will not balloon the deficit?\nThe President. It's a great plan.

[Laughter] I also want to congratulate the Council of Chief State School Officers on their 65th year recognizing America's outstanding teachers. These are the greatest there are. Nobody better. So I want to congratulate you all. That's amazing.\nEach of you has dedicated yourself to inspiring young minds and to putting our children on a path to happiness and success, lots of success. There are 55 Teachers of the Year who are here with us and from every State—every State in the Union—is that right? Every single State.\nSo let's see, who's from Alabama? What a great State.

{"author": "Sean Spicer", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123846", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:30 P.M. EDT\nMR. SPICER: Good afternoon. It's a little bit of different room than this morning. I'm sure you all know that I was up here earlier this morning, off camera, with some of your kids. It was a pleasure to be able to share a little bit of the White House experience with them, and I hope they enjoyed it. I think some of you have trained them very well. I hope they enjoyed their visit, and I'm glad they got an opportunity to visit with the President and the Vice President today.\nWe have a bunch to talk about today about what the President has been doing, and he's got an executive order coming up, so I'm going to try to get through it all.\nThis morning, the President welcomed the President and Mrs. Macri of Argentina for an official visit. As you know, the President and First Lady of Argentina just left, so we will have a readout for you very shortly on that. At 2:00 p.m., the President will be signing a memorandum on aluminum imports and threats to national security, so we'll try to keep this briefing on time.\nI know Secretary Ross spoke about the memo that the President signed yesterday, but I want to reiterate that the American aluminum industry is in trouble, having declined down to the lowest levels of aluminum that we've produced since 1952. It is critical for our national defenses -- the Army ground vehicles and the Air Force jets, the Navy warships. But American companies are producing less aluminum than before, especially in the high-purity aluminum that's used to build things like the F-35, the F-18, and the C-17s.\nThe Secretary of Commerce has initiated an investigation to determine what effect our reliance on imported aluminum has on both national and economic security. The memo the President will sign today, similar to the memo he signed on steel, elevates this investigation and directs the Secretary to prioritize its completion. This memo, combined with similar action on steel, is an important step towards fulfilling the President's promise to \"put American steel and aluminum back into the backbone of our country.\"\nThe President has been speaking about revitalizing the American manufacturing industry for quite a long time. Another one of the President's most significant pledges has been to ensure that the men and women who have served this nation in our military have the care, treatment, and support they so greatly deserve. So, later this afternoon, the President will go to the Department of Veterans Affairs, where he will sign an executive order that will take serious action to fix the broken VA system through the establishment of the new VA Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection, which will remove and discipline federal employees and managers who have violated the public's trust, while protecting employees that speak out about wrongdoing.\nThe President will be joined at the VA by several veterans and their spouses who have experienced or witnessed firsthand the poor quality of treatment that, unfortunately, too many of these heroes have received at VA facilities -- including Sergeant Michael Verardo, who lost his leg and arm when he stepped on an IED in Afghanistan in 2010, and his devoted wife and caregiver, Sarah. The President is making it clear that the delays and improper care experienced by these veterans is unacceptable.\nThe President's action today comes on top of the signing of the Veterans Choice Improvement Act last week, which gives more veterans the option of seeing the doctor of their choice without traveling long distance or waiting for VA care. These actions, which are only the beginning of his plans to modernize the VA, the President is making it clear that the Trump administration will not accept anything but the best for those who have served our nation.\nToday, as with every day this week, as we approach the 100th day in office for this President, he is continuing to follow through on some of the biggest promises that he made to the American people. On Monday, he hosted a working lunch with members of the United Nations Security Council, reiterating his dedication to making America a leader in the world. On Tuesday, he prioritized the protection of the farmers and ranchers of America's heartland by establishing the Interagency Task Force on Agriculture and Rural Prosperity. Today, he took several important steps to review massive federal land grab by the previous administration under the Antiquities Act, an egregious federal overreach. That was yesterday, actually. And today, as I mentioned, he's taking action on trade and veterans.\nAs we speak of trade, I know last night you saw a readout of the President's call with President Peсa Nieto and Prime Minister Trudeau. As the President just said, the President and the Prime Minister called him and asked him to renegotiate NAFTA rather than terminate it. The President has a great deal of respect for these two countries and their leaders, and he said that he would hold on the termination while we negotiate a better and fairer deal for America and its workers. But the President also made it clear that if the parties are unable to agree on a deal that is fair for American workers and companies, after renegotiation -- giving renegotiation a good shot, he will move forward with termination.\nAnd with that, I'll take some questions.\nQ: Sean, what changes in NAFTA does the President hope to achieve through renegotiation?\nMR. SPICER: I think when you look at the various sectors -- it's obviously being a multilateral agreement -- there are areas in Canada, sectors where there's agriculture, manufacturing, services -- that we look on both of them, where I think there's both a modernization, recognizing the world has changed, and also some trade imbalances and issues that have come up, and also, frankly, some areas that fall outside the scope of NAFTA as it was negotiated at the beginning that I think we want to look at it.\nObviously, the issue of dairy came up. So that's an area that we want to look at, as well. And so part of this is to look at not just the existing agreement, but areas and sectors and industries that have fallen outside, or because over the last couple decades have not kept up with the promises and the commitments that were made. But that's -- we've got a ways to go.\nMatt.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. As you know, under both the Reagan and Bush administrations, concerns about tax cuts-fueled deficits were dismissed with promises of growth, and we're hearing that same sort of rhetoric now. The deficit increased a great deal under both those administrations after the tax cuts. What's different about the President's plan that won't lead to the same sort of ballooning of the deficit?\nMR. SPICER: There's a few things. Number one, we outlined those principles yesterday. We've got a lot of work to do with Congress, and I think it's moving in a very positive direction. There's a lot of pay-fors, as they call them, in this proposal that will continue to be refined as we move forward in negotiating with Congress. So there's a lot of things.\nBut I think the President laid out a plan that achieves -- or seeks to achieve three basic things. One is economic growth and job creation. Two is a simplification so that the American people can actually file their taxes in a rather normal process that doesn't require a ton of money and time. And three is to do stuff that makes -- create a better business climate that makes sure that manufacturing and job creation, people want to hire here and that we help the middle class. Those are the three guiding principles that the President has.\nAs we do that, one of the things that you recognize through a lot of the models here is you're going to achieve greater economic growth. It's something that we saw both following the tax cuts in the Kennedy administration and the Reagan administration. I think that we can achieve greater growth, economic prosperity and job creation under the plan that the President laid out.\nJohn.\nQ: Thanks a lot, Sean. You may have seen the news about the Office of the Inspector General announcing that it's launched an investigation into the payment that the former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn received prior to becoming the National Security Advisor from RT -- Russia Today -- which is an entity of the Russian government. What's your reaction to that, first of all?\nMR. SPICER: I think that's appropriate. If they think that there's wrongdoing then the department's Inspector General should look into that.\nQ: Are you satisfied with the vetting that was done of General Flynn by the transition team before he came on board as the National Security Advisor?\nMR. SPICER: So that's a great question. I appreciate you bringing it up. Let's walk through that for a second. General Flynn was a career military officer who maintained a high-level security clearance throughout his career in the military. His clearance was last reissued by the Obama administration in 2016 with full knowledge of his activities that occurred in 2015, as you point out. So the issue is -- he was issued a security clearance under the Obama administration in the spring of 2016. The trip and transactions that you're referring to occurred in December of 2015, from what I understand.\nSo obviously there's an issue that, as you point out, the Department of Defense Inspector General is looking into. We welcome that. But all of that clearance was made by the -- during the Obama administration and, apparently, with knowledge of the trip that he took. So that's how the process works. And I welcome the Department of Defense's IG's review.\nJordan.\nQ: If he wasn't fired by the President for lying to the Vice President, would he still have a job today, right here at the White House?\nMR. SPICER: I will just say that I think the President made the right call at the right time, and it's clearly paid off.\nJordan.\nQ: Given the progress that congressional Republicans have made on the healthcare talks, does the President want a vote on that bill this week?\nMR. SPICER: He wants a vote when they have 216 votes. And I feel very good about the progress that's being made to get to that number. And I think Speaker Ryan's comments this morning indicate that it's moving in the right direction, and that should be good news for everyone in America as we move towards a system that creates a healthcare system that serves us, and that makes sure that premiums don't skyrocket like they are now, and that we're able to see the doctors that we want to see and have plans that have competition in them.\nEamon.\nQ: If there's no vote, does that mean the President won't be disappointed?\nMR. SPICER: I think the President wants a vote and wants a healthcare system as soon as possible. But that's going to be dictated by the Speaker and the Majority Leader and the Majority Whip in the House when they feel they have the votes. That being said, as we've now maintained for the last several days, we feel very positive about the work that's being done to get to that and the reaction that we're having. As you recall, there was a lot of members that initially had some problems, and we're very pleased with the reaction -- the public reaction that they are having to what is currently been negotiated. And I think it's only getting bigger, and that's welcome news.\nEamon.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. The President's tax plan, we're getting a little bit of mixed signals here on exactly what his vision is in terms of retirement savings. Can you lay out what the President's vision is for 401{k}s, and particularly tax deductions surrounding those? Does the President imagine removing those deductions entirely along with the other deductions, or is he going to protect those?\nMR. SPICER: So the Secretary of the Treasury and Director Cohn yesterday both talked about that the current plan right now both protects charitable giving and mortgage interest, and that's it. As we move forward with negotiations in the House and Senate, that plan will continue to flesh out.\nBut one of the benefits of the tax plan on the individual side, in particular, is by expanding the standard deduction to $24,000 for a married couple. The really effectively creates a bracket of zero taxes for many, many Americans. And that's good news. We're going to see more and more Americans get some relief that they so desperately need.\nQ: These tax deductions, though, of course, comes with its own group, its own lobby, its own interest group.\nMR. SPICER: Yes.\nQ: They fight very hard for these things. Are you guys prepared for a battle on all those tax deductions, eliminating all of those? I mean, politically, that's a big lift.\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think the one interest that the President is going to fight for are the American people and the American worker. That's what he made his entire campaign about, is putting America first, and he's going to fight hard. His special interest is the American people, and making sure that whether it's putting more money in their pocket, or making sure that they economic growth leads to more jobs and greater manufacturing, that's the one interest that he's fighting for every day.\nSo we'll do battle with whoever we have to, to achieve a greater outcome for Americans and American workers.\nZeke.\nQ: Just one more. Gary Cohn told us the retirement savings was protected.\nQ: Two on General Flynn. First, you said the Obama administration had reissued his clearance last year?\nMR. SPICER: Yes.\nQ: So is the implication there that should be taken that if the Trump administration was the one adjudicating his clearance, this year he would not have been issued that clearance, now that the White House knows everything that there is about General Flynn?\nMR. SPICER: No, I think I'm just making sure people understand the process and how it works. And the way a process works is that if you have a top security clearance, you fill out a form. There's an investigation done. You are reinvestigated every five years if you are able to maintain that clearance. And then whoever owns that clearance, whether it's the FBI or the Department of Defense, goes out, does the investigation. In between that period, you're responsible for updating the information that you provided in accordance with the agency that issued that.\nMy only point is, is that when General Flynn came into the White House, he had an active security clearance that was issued during the Obama administration with all of the information that's being discussed that occurred in 2015. So I'm just -- I guess my only point is to explain how the process works and who adjudicated that.\nQ: You're not implying wrongdoing in the part of --\nMR. SPICER: No, that's why the Department of Defense Inspector General is looking into this to see how that process works. But I think it's important for folks to understand that when someone applies for a clearance, they get that clearance; it's issued at the top security clearance level for five years; and that the person who has been issued it then has a legal obligation to update the issuing agency any variances in what they supplied as information.\nQ: Finally, when you were here on February 14th, the morning after General Flynn was fired by the President, you said that the President asked him to leave the White House -- the situation regarding the phone call with the Russian ambassador and the Vice President.\nMR. SPICER: Right.\nQ: But also \"a series of other questionable instances.\" I was hoping now you can provide some more information now that more -- some of his financial dealings, in particular, now have come to light. Is that what led to his termination at the White House?\nMR. SPICER: Look, I think we addressed it at the time, and I think as --\nQ: Not this --\nMR. SPICER: No, no, but -- that's right. And I don't -- I think the President made the right decision at the right time, and he continues to stand by it.\nMajor.\nQ: To follow on a couple of things that have been brought up to you today. John's question -- not the process, but your own vet, meaning the transition -- are you satisfied that that met the standard that should have been met with Michael Flynn? And then if there are any regrets that this White House has about bringing him in, knowing what you know about him now and seeing a behavior that would be plainly inconsistent with the standard that candidate Trump set during the campaign?\nMR. SPICER: Well, with respect, you're saying \"our process.\" The process is every government employee who is eligible for a clearance goes through the same process. So it's not -- we don't have a unique process.\nQ: But that's not the only question you asked Michael Flynn -- it couldn't possibly be the only you asked him.\nMR. SPICER: When someone comes in, the question is do they have a clearance. If not, they apply for one. And if they have one, then the clearance is made available from the issuing agency. That's -- you can't -- the whole reason you have a clearance is so that someone is found whether or not they're --\nQ: As you just said to Zeke, it was not just the episode with the Russian ambassador, it was other instances. Those things have come to light. Any regret about bringing him in --\nMR. SPICER: Look, I'll just say the President --\nQ: -- to have this done and knowing what you know now did you miss something and you regret Michael Flynn in?\nMR. SPICER: I think the President made the right decision at the right time, and it's been pretty clear that --\nQ: He regrets bringing him in?\nMR. SPICER: No, I'm just saying he made the right decision. And I think we've moved forward from that decision, and the decision stands.\nQ: On the question about -- Gary Cohn and the Treasury Secretary left us with the implication yesterday when asked about retirement savings that they were protected. What you just said has indicated they might not be. Can you help us understand?\nMR. SPICER: I can't. Let me get back to you on that. I was not clear on that distinction. I will have the Treasury folks read that out for you.\nQ: So General Flynn came in with just the Obama administration vetting, is that right, Sean?\nMR. SPICER: That's how everyone -- okay --\nQ: Because that's the impression you're giving.\nMR. SPICER: It is.\nQ: General Flynn came in and he walked through the door with just the clearance that was conducted by the Obama administration? That doesn't make any sense.\nMR. SPICER: Sure it does. The same way that when you applied for a credential to the White House Press Briefing Room, when you were here --\nQ: I'm not the National Security Advisor.\nMR. SPICER: Hold on. Just let -- hold on. Let me explain the answer to you, Jim. Calm down. The kids have gone --\nQ: That's a serious question.\nMR. SPICER: And I'm trying to answer it, Major. This is the answer. When you apply -- hold on, listen -- when you applied to come here to this briefing room as a member of the press, you apply and you fill out certain forms with the Secret Service to have your background run. When I came in here in January 20th, the people that had been cleared the day before were cleared on the 20th and 21st, et cetera. We didn't rerun your background. We trust that when you were cleared the first time, if you were cleared on December 15th or January 20th, that you were still -- that your background check still cleared.\nEvery individual who came into this White House either applied for a security clearance or had one. Everyone in the government goes through the same SF-86 process -- every single person. And so why would you re-run a background check on someone who was the head of the department -- the Defense Intelligence Agency that had and did maintain a high-level security clearance? That's it.\nThere's no difference between administrations -- when you come in from one, they rerun it. The reason they grant them for five years is that it's a very extensive background where they check your contacts, your places of residence, your employment. They go out into the field, they do a lot of that work, and then you're required to maintain updates to that clearance. They re-adjudicate it every five years. That occurred in this case. And now the Department of Defense's Inspector General is looking into it. That's how --\nQ: And when Congressman Cummings accuses this White House of a cover-up, you say what?\nMR. SPICER: I say that's -- I was, frankly, taken back by his comments todays because they're, frankly, not true. The Department of Defense was the issuing agency for General Flynn's SF-86. We referred them to the Department of Defense, who owns and issued his security clearance, and they got a copy of it. That's how the system works. The documents that he requested he received.\nSo with all due respect, he got the documents that he requested. Our job -- they sent a form letter to multiple agencies asking for a copy of this. What we did was properly refer him to the issuing agency and department, and said, this is where you got. And he got it.\nQ: Are there no other documents that you have at this point that could be turned over to this committee that would be relevant to this investigation?\nMR. SPICER: Not that I'm aware of at this point. What they sent to us -- they asked for the SF-86. That, we referred them to the Department of Defense -- that's great. Two, is they asked for a contract -- all copies of his speaking engagements from the Speakers Bureau. I believe he was referred to the Speakers Bureau for those contracts. And three is they asked for all foreign contacts that he may or may not have had.\nSince the incident occurred that they're questioning before his employment to the White House, I think we've complied with every document that they've looked for.\nKaitlan.\nQ: Thank you. Two questions. One, does the President still feel that Mike Flynn should seek immunity?\nMR. SPICER: I think Mike Flynn should do what his counsel advises him best to do.\nQ: But does the President?\nMR. SPICER: I don't -- I have not asked him. But I believe that General Flynn should do what his counsel advises him to do.\nQ: And secondly, the President said he wants to start renegotiating NAFTA as soon as today. Has he notified Congress about that yet?\nMR. SPICER: We've been in communication with Congress for a while on this.\nYes, Adam.\nQ: The President tweeted this morning about Puerto Rico -- begin to default on their debt May 1st, pending some kind of solution. There are millions of investors in the United States\n-- senior citizens -- who may not be aware that they hold funds within munibond mutual funds that expose them to a default in Puerto Rico. Is there anything the White House should do or the administration can do, one, to safeguard those senior citizens and their investments; and two, to prevent an increase in cost to states and municipalities that may have to pay more to borrow when they access the munibond market if Puerto Rico defaults?\nMR. SPICER: I think the issue itself is extremely complicated in the sense that the President's tweet and the President's discussion revolves around the continuing resolution to fund our government. Our government needs to get -- there needs to be a continuing resolution effective this Friday. The President has done everything possible, worked extremely hard to with Congress to ensure that we maintain the government -- keep the government open.\nThe Democrats at the last minute have come in and thrown a lot of monkey wrenches into the ability for this to get done, despite the President doing everything that he can to show good faith to keep this going.\nSo it's not just a question of -- they keep moving the goal post. And the issue right now is to make sure that we do what's in the best interest of this country and our people by keeping the government open. That's the issue at hand right now; not a question of whether or not that can be dealt with. There are ways that that issue can be dealt with. But throwing it in in the last minute, and trying to gum up keeping the government open is probably not the most effective way.\nQ: I understand that the CR is different. But if Puerto Rico defaults with or without the CR -- is the administration working with Puerto Rico?\nMR. SPICER: Again -- and I think that that is a separate issue that needs to be addressed by Congress in terms of how it gets done. I think that the method right now is to make sure that we do everything in our power to keep the government open effective Friday.\nGeorge.\nQ: As the tax plan evolves and we start to get details, do you believe it is a fair question for anyone to ask how that plan personally affects the President and his family?\nMR. SPICER: I think the President's plan right now is something that every American should worry, hopefully, about how it affects them. And I think when you look at the ways that this is going to benefit middle-class Americans, middle-income, working Americans grow businesses, that should be -- and I think, frankly, that is the concern of most Americans out there. They're worried about their job. They're worried about whether their company is growing and expanding. They're worried about whether or not they're saving enough money and how much they're paying in taxes. And I think what the President's number-one goal right now is, is to provide middle-income and lower-income tax relief to Americans. And that's what his goal is, and I think that's, frankly, what most Americans' goal is.\nQ: But is it a fair question to ask?\nMR. SPICER: That's up to every individual to ask. But I would guess that most Americans would applaud what the President is doing to spur economic growth and job creation in this country.\nCecilia.\nQ: -- if middle-income Americans should feel empowered to ask how this plan affects them, why is it that Secretary Mnuchin today could not guarantee that no one in the middle class would pay more under this proposal?\nMR. SPICER: I think everyone in the middle class should know that this President's plan is going to make sure that they have more in their pocket.\nQ: So there is a guarantee from the White House? That's the position of the White House right now -- that middle-class American should not --\nMR. SPICER: The position of the White House is that the goal of this President's tax plan is to provide them and lower-income people with more money in their pocket and a tax cut, yes.\nThank you, guys, very much. I look forward to seeing you at the signing.\nEND 1:54 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2017-04-27", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer"}

And who would have thought this was going to happen——\nPresident Macri. Nobody.\nPresident Trump. ——for both of us.\nPresident Macri. Yes.\nPresident Trump. But this is a great, wonderful person, and he will be a great President of Argentina, I have absolutely no doubt. Absolutely no doubt.\nArgentina-U.S. Relations\nQ. Mr. Trump, what do you want to achieve with our country, with Argentina?\nPresident Trump. We're just going to be great friends, better than ever before. And we're off to a wonderful start, because I've known Mauricio for so many years, and I know the kind of person he is. He's a great person, and he's a great leader. He will do a fantastic job for Argentina. And I feel very comfortable backing him, because they need certain things from the United States. I feel very comfortable backing him because I know what I'm backing. I'm backing a man who loves his people and loves his country.\nArgentina-U.S. Trade Relations\nQ. If he's such a good friend, Mr. President, are you going to let the lemons—the Argentine lemons—in, in your country? They are very good. [Laughter]\nPresident Trump. We are thinking about it.\nQ. People will love you if you let them in.\nPresident Trump. Well, I know about all the lemons. And believe it or not, the lemon business is a big, big business.\nQ. Just say yes! [Laughter] You can say yes now.\nPresident Trump. But we are going to give that very serious consideration. One of the reasons he's here is about lemons—[laughter]—and I'll tell him about North Korea, and he'll tell me about lemons. [Laughter]\nQ. Are you going to talk——\nPresident Trump. But I think that we're going to be very favorably disposed. We're going to be talking about it.\nVenezuela\nQ. What about Venezuela, Mr. President? What do you think about Venezuela, the decision to—— The President. Venezuela is a mess. Venezuela is a mess.\nNorth American Free Trade Agreement\nQ. [Inaudible]—the agreement, Mr. President, on renegotiating NAFTA, tell me how you came about the decision—[inaudible]?\nPresident Trump. Well, I was going to terminate NAFTA as of 2 or 3 days from now. The President of Mexico, who I have a very, very good relationship, called me, and also the Prime Minister of Canada, who I have a very good relationship. And I like both of these gentlemen very much. They called me, and they said, rather than terminating NAFTA, could you please renegotiate? I like them very much. I respect their countries very much. The relationship is very special. And I said, I will hold on the termination; let's see if we can make it a fair deal. Because NAFTA has been a horrible deal for the United States. It's been very good for Canada, it's been very good for Mexico, but it's been horrible for the United States.\nAnd if you check my campaign—any of my speeches—I said I'll either renegotiate or I'll terminate. So they asked me to renegotiate; I will. And I think we'll be successful in the renegotiation, which, frankly, would be good, because it would be simpler. But we have to make a deal that's fair for the United States. They understand that. And so I decided, rather than terminating NAFTA, which would be a pretty big shock to the system, we will renegotiate.\nNow, if I'm unable to make a fair deal, if I'm unable to make a fair deal for the United States, meaning a fair deal for our workers and our companies, I will terminate NAFTA. But we're going to give renegotiation a good, strong shot.\nThank you very much, everybody. Thank you very much.\nVenezuela\nQ. What about Venezuela, Mr. President? Mr. President, about Venezuela, what is your position?\nPresident Trump. Well, I'm very sad for Venezuela. I'm very sad to see what's happened in Venezuela.\nQ.

Trump hosted President Mauricio Macri of Argentina today to discuss ways to deepen the close partnership between the United States and Argentina. President Trump welcomed Argentina's growing leadership role on the world stage and the political and economic reforms recently implemented by the Argentine Government, which have improved the environment for investment, trade, and long term economic development. President Trump offered his support to President Macri as Argentina prepares to host the World Trade Organization Ministerial and assume the G-20 Presidency.\nThe two leaders underscored their continuing commitment to expanding trade and investment between the United States and Argentina. Recognizing the importance of trade in agricultural products to the United States-Argentina bilateral economic relationship, the Presidents directed their Cabinets to expeditiously chart a path forward to resolve pending bilateral agricultural issues, based on scientific principles and international standards. The leaders further expressed their desire to see significant future growth in two-way trade of agricultural and industrial products to the benefit of producers and consumers in both countries.\nThey also pledged to strengthen our partnership to combat narcotics trafficking, money laundering, terrorist financing, corruption, and other illicit finance activities through the newly established Argentina-United States Dialogue on Illicit Finance. Recognizing the benefits and risks of our increasing dependence on networked information, the leaders discussed the increased importance of cooperation on cyber policy. They agreed to launch a new bilateral Cyber Working Group, which will protect the security and economic interests of both countries, companies, and Internet users.\nThe two Presidents raised their strong concern over the deteriorating situation in Venezuela, and they agreed to work closely together to preserve democratic institutions in that country.\nPresident Trump told President Macri that the United States will launch the Global Entry Trusted Travelers Program in Argentina in May, facilitating the expedited entry of pre-vetted, low-risk Argentine travelers through United States ports of entry. Argentina will be just the tenth country in the world admitted to this special program, which facilitates rising business and tourism ties while allowing United States border security personnel to focus resources on other potential risks.\nFinally, at President Macri's request, President Trump delivered a large tranche of declassified documents relating to human rights abuses in Argentina during its military dictatorship.", "timestamp": "2017-04-27", "title": "Joint Statement by President Trump and President Mauricio Macri of Argentina"}

And, Mike, you've been so magnificent as our Vice President that we very much appreciate it. Thank you very much.\nI'm pleased to be here. And we're joined by so many Members of Congress. It's been really a fantastic period of time for me. And I'm honored also to be at the Department of Veteran Affairs, because I will tell you this has been something, right from the beginning of the campaign—does not get any more important for me than making life really great for our phenomenal veterans. That I can say.\nSo we're sharing the stage with a lot of great people, a lot of great friends. A couple of my friends are out in the audience today: Ike Perlmutter, Laurie Perlmutter. Where are they? Where are they? Where are they? These are incredible people, incredibly successful people. And they just have an affinity for helping the veterans and for helping David. And I want to thank them. Unbelievable. Thank you. Dr. Moskowitz also.\nAnd we're going to protect those who protect. And we're going to protect the people that are protecting us. First of all, Secretary Shulkin—and I call him the 100-to-nothing man, because in a totally obstructionist group of Democrats—we say that with affection—[laughter]—he got not only the Republicans, but he got all of the Democrat votes. And he won at a 100-to-nothing clip. So I guess—boy, do they know. I hope they're right, you know. [Laughter] I hope they're right about you.\nBut David is doing a phenomenal job. He was voted unanimously out of the United States Senate, and he's worked ever since then, day and night, to reform and improve the VA.\nI'm also pleased that we're joined by so many Members of Congress. We have with us Senators Ernst—where's Joni Ernst? Where is Joni? What a tremendous woman. And right from the beginning, she has been—[applause]—and she knows more about veterans than anybody. Thanks, Joni. We really appreciate it.\nSenator Isakson, Moran—thank you, Senator. Thank you very much. Senator Moran and Senator Tester. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, all. Thank you. Along with Congressmen Arrington, Bergman, Bridenstine, Dent, Roe, and Wenstrup. I look forward to serving our veterans with all of you.\nAnd I can tell you, this group, whether they're Democrat or Republican, they're here to help. And we're going to help, and we're going to make this so good, it's going to be one of our crown jewels. And it's happening already.\nAs part of that process, Secretary Shulkin has carried out a really thorough review—and he had some very inside understanding of the VA because he's been here—but a thorough review of the VA to uncover all of the problems and challenges that we inherited, of which there are so many. Based on those findings, we're putting plans into place to fix those problems and give our veterans the health care they need and the health care they deserve.\nAnd they were so for me during this recent election, and I can promise them—and they know it's going to happen—we're not going to let them down. We have a team the likes of which has never, ever been assembled. And that includes outside people who are so brilliant and so good, like Ike and Laurie. And they're helping us. And they don't fail.\nMuch work lies ahead, but we will not rest until this job is totally done. During these first 100 days—which, as you know, I've been saying there's a very extreme emphasis placed on these 100 days, Joni. It's not quite as big as they're saying. But we have really laid a foundation. We've had a lot of legislation passed, which nobody understands. I think it's 28 bills as of this moment. Somebody said, by the time it ends, it's 32 bills. And tremendous legislation. But we've already made huge strides to improve the VA and the VA services.\nWe've imposed new standards of accountability and transparency, including a new website that publishes wait times at every VA hospital. And this is a website that works. This is not the $5 billion Obamacare website. Do we remember that? Nobody remembers that. Does anybody remember the $5 billion website? No, I don't think so. We don't have to remember it anymore.\nWe've implemented same-day mental health services at all 168 VA medical centers so that the veterans in crisis can find help at the VA, without any delay.\nLast week, I signed the Veterans Choice Improvement Act—very proud of that—so that more veterans can see the doctor of their choice and don't have to travel long distances or wait forever for VA care. They were waiting on lines for 7 days, 8 days, 9 days, 2 weeks. Some instances were horrible. They we're waiting so long, they had a very curable problem, and they die before they got to see the doctor. It's not going to happen any longer.\nAlready this year, using the Choice Program, veterans have received 42 percent more approvals to see the doctor of their choosing. But that's just the very beginning of what we have planned. So much more is coming.\nToday we're taking another bold step forward. I'm signing an Executive order to create an Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection at the Department of Veterans Affairs. This Executive order makes it clear that we will never, ever tolerate substandard care for our great veterans. With the creation of this office, we are sending a strong message: Those who fail our veterans will be held, for the first time, accountable.\nAt the same time, we will reward and retain the many VA employees who do a fantastic job, of which we have many. And I will tell you, some of the doctors in the VA—I've heard it from so many people—they're the finest in the world. These are great, great people. We have to get our vets to those doctors. But we have some of the finest doctors in the world.\nWe have also some of the most honest employees, and some of them expose wrongdoing, and we will make sure that they're protected.\nWe're also calling on the Senate to pass legislation to give the Secretary the authority he needs to ensure all VA employees are held accountable for how they treat our veterans.\nToday's action is historic, but it is only the start of our reforms. Our veterans have secured this Nation with their blood, sweat, and tears, and we will not let them down. These are our great, great people. We will always stand with those who stood for freedom and who stood for us. They protected us. They've made it all possible, and now we're going to protect and take care of them.\nSo I'd like to thank David and his family and all of the people that are working so hard at the VA. They haven't had enthusiasm—David was just telling me—like this for many, many years. And the veterans see what's happening, because I'm getting so many different messages through all forms of communication, of which we now have many. But they're very, very happy, very pleased with what's going on.\nSo, David, we want to—God bless you and your family. We want to wish you a lot of luck. You have a lot of talent, but you have a big job ahead.\nI want to wish everybody Godspeed. And we will do a fantastic job at the VA, rest assured. Thank you very much. And we're going to sign right now. Thank you very much. Thank you.\nIke. Come over here, Ike and Laurie, please. They may not let you through for security purposes, but I'm not worried with you, Ike.[Laughter] I'll give Ike the pen, I think.\nSo this is improving accountability at the VA. Such important steps are being taken. Hi, Laurie.\n[At this point, the President signed the Executive order.]\nThank you everybody very much.

Policy. Core industries such as steel, aluminum, vehicles, aircraft, shipbuilding, and semiconductors are critical elements of our manufacturing and defense industrial bases, which we must defend against unfair trade practices and other abuses. In the case of aluminum, both the United States and global markets for aluminum products are distorted by large volumes of excess capacity—much of which results from foreign government subsidies and other unfair practices. Efforts to work with other countries to reduce excess global overcapacity have not succeeded.\nThe artificially low prices caused by excess capacity and unfairly traded imports suppress profits in the American aluminum industry, which discourages long-term investment in the industry and hinders efforts by American aluminum producers to research and develop new and better grades of aluminum. If the present situation continues, it may place the American aluminum industry at risk by undermining the ability of American aluminum producers to continue investment, research, and development, and by reducing or eliminating the jobs needed to maintain a pool of skilled workers essential for the continued development of advanced aluminum manufacturing.\nSec. 2. Investigation. The Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) has initiated an investigation under section 232(b)(1)(A) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (the \"Act\") (19 U.S.C. 1862(b)(1)(A)) to determine the effects on national security of aluminum imports. In conducting this investigation, and in accordance with section 232(d) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1862(d)), the Secretary shall, as appropriate and consistent with law:\n(a) consider the domestic production of aluminum needed for projected national defense requirements; the capacity of domestic industries to meet such requirements; the existing and anticipated availabilities of the human resources, products, raw materials, and other supplies and services essential to the national defense; the requirements of growth of such industries and such supplies and services, including the investment, exploration, and development necessary to assure such growth; and the importation of goods in terms of their quantities, availabilities, character, and use as those affect such industries and the capacity of the United States to meet national security requirements;\n(b) recognize the close relation of the Nation's economic welfare to our national security, and consider the effect of foreign competition in the aluminum industry on the economic welfare of domestic industries;\n(c) consider any substantial unemployment, decrease in government revenues, loss of skills or investment, or other serious effects resulting from the displacement of any domestic products by excessive aluminum imports; and (d) consider the status and likely effectiveness of efforts of the United States to negotiate a reduction in the levels of excess aluminum capacity worldwide.\nSec. 3. Submit Report and Provide Recommendations. (a) The Secretary shall, consistent with applicable law, proceed expeditiously in conducting the investigation described in section 2 of this memorandum and shall submit to the President a report on the findings.\n(b) Pursuant to section 232(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1862(b)), if the Secretary finds that aluminum is being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security, the Secretary shall, in the report submitted under subsection (a) of this section, recommend actions and steps that should be taken to adjust aluminum imports so that they will not threaten to impair the national security.\nSec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nDONALD J.

The President is going to be speaking later, so I'll try to keep this short and let his words carry the day.\nBefore we left, the President signed an executive order on offshore energy development. I know the President made a statement on this order. And during the signing ceremony, Secretary Zinke gave you a little detail during that briefing that occurred last night. The main takeaway is that the order maintains our responsibility as stewards of the environment while moving us forward towards energy security. Combined with the President's previous actions reducing regulations and promoting clean and safe energy development, we are on the right track toward American energy independence.\nAs you guys know, we're on our way to Atlanta, where the President will speak to the National Rifle Association's Leadership Forum. It's a great way to end an incredible week leading up to the President's official 100th day in office, which is tomorrow.

I know the NRA is glad to have a justice in that seat who will be such a staunch defender of our Constitution.\nThe President is going to speak again tomorrow about Judge Gorsuch: his unprecedented regulatory reforms under the Congressional Review Act, renegotiating trade deals that are unfair for American workers, and the rest of his incredible accomplishments. I'll let him and the record for his action-packed first 100 days speak for itself on that. As I've mentioned before, we've got the website up at WhiteHouse.gov/100Days that really details all that. And he looks forward to a really exciting event tomorrow.\nWith that, I'm glad to --\nQ: can you confirm that Senator Ted Cruz is on the plane?\nMR. SPICER: Yes. Wow, that was a good one.\nSteve.\nQ: What's he doing?\nMR. SPICER: I believe Senator Cruz is also addressing the NRA.\nQ: Sean, what's the status of the healthcare effort?\nMR. SPICER: There was a great discussion this morning. I think Whip Scalise was at the White House for the signing and had a chance to catch up with the President. I think there's continued progress that is being made. Speaker Ryan noted that yesterday.\nI don't want to get too far ahead of where this thing is headed, but we feel very good and we continue to have -- hold on tight.\nQ: There's no vote --\nMR. SPICER: No, no, no, there is not.\nQ: Sean, obviously, the President tomorrow night is holding this rally during the Correspondents' Dinner. Is there any message he's trying to send with those two things happening concurrently?\nMR. SPICER: Well, respectfully, it's also his 100th day in office. So I respectfully suggest that it's not just about the Correspondents' Dinner, it's rather an opportunity for him to talk to voters that elected him and what he's been able to accomplish in the first 100 days.\nSo I think it's a sharp contrast, obviously, between what's going to be happening on his first 100 days, and talking to voters about what he's been able to do and how much more there is to do, and how committed he is to seeing the next 100 days and the 100 days after that produce real results for Americans.\nQ: Can you give us an update on where things are with the spending plan? I know there was a bill for one week. But what about the long-term progress?\nMR. SPICER: I think, obviously, as you noted, my understanding is the Senate has passed the House spending plan that's a one-week extension, and I feel really good that next week we're really close to -- we feel very good about making sure that the next thing will be the five-month extension to get us through the end of the fiscal year\nQ: When we talked to him last night about South Korea, he mentioned the THAAD missile system. Is he going to ask the South Koreans to pay for that?\nMR. SPICER: I think we'll have more on that for you at some point. Obviously, the President has talked a lot during the campaign about our national security and what we're doing as a country in making sure that our taxpayers and our funding is -- that we've got a lot of work to do at home, that we're spending a lot of money on other places, and we want to discuss, whether it's NATO or other places, where we're spending a lot of money and make sure that other countries are contributing equally as well.\nQ: Can you give us an update on -- there was a meeting yesterday about the Paris agreement, where things stand. What's the state-of-play in the White House on that?\nMR. SPICER: It was a good discussion. So part of the PC, Principals Committee, is for the different stakeholders to be able to provide input for the decision-making process for the President. It was chaired by NEC Director Cohn. And the participants gave him feedback in the different areas -- diplomatic. Secretary Perry had some energy issues. Administrator Pruitt was there.\nSo again, a lot of this is an opportunity for the key stakeholders in this arena to share their ideas, opinions, and do further work on areas that need some follow-up before presenting to the President with various options.\nQ: When will they do that?\nMR. SPICER: We should have an answer before we leave for Europe.\nQ: Can you talk more about the NRA and the speech? About the NRA, about the forum, about his relationship with the NRA or about firearms policy, about guns? Anything?\nMR. SPICER: He'll talk about that in the speech. He'll talk about his commitment to the Second Amendment. This is the first time -- I think he'll mention it in the speech -- I think it's 1983 since a sitting President.\nBut, look, they came out and supported him based on his strong commitment to the Second Amendment. He's going to reiterate his commitment to the Second Amendment today and to the Constitution today.\nQ: Is he going to thank -- that kind of speech, where he's thanking --\nMR. SPICER: I mean, he talks about his commitment to the Second Amendment. He'll talk about where he's going, where he wants to take this country, some of the accomplishments that he's had. But he'll also talk about -- I think he mentions -- I've got a -- sorry, I read it like an hour ago.\nQ: Conceal and carry?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know that he gets into that detail. I'll have to look at it again. But you'll get it soon enough. We'll try to get you a copy of it.\nQ: -- his own views about guns? His sons are hunters.\nMR. SPICER: He'll mention, yeah.\nQ: Sean, what about the trip to Israel? Is that something that you guys can firm up?\nMR. SPICER: No, not yet. Obviously, as you know, I can't confirm that we had -- we have an advance team that's look at that as one option while we go abroad. But we're looking at a couple options, including Rome, as we've mentioned. Hope to have some additional updates on travel.\nQ: And what are the other options? Rome, Israel, Saudi?\nMR. SPICER: We'll see.\nQ: (Inaudible) some things about FEMA director. Is that coming soon?\nMR. SPICER: I can follow up. We've got the PPO guys, one of them onboard. And I'll ask. All right, we'll catch up with you guys.\nEND 1:15 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2017-04-28", "title": "Press Gaggle by Press Secretary Sean Spicer"}

{"author": "Mike Pence", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123869", "text": "THE VICE PRESIDENT: On behalf of the President of the United States, it is my honor to welcome you all today to the Office of the Vice President here at the White House complex for a very important moment in the life of this administration and in our national life, as I administer the oath of office to the 27th Secretary of Labor for the United States of America, Alexander Acosta. (Applause.)\nWe're fortunate to be joined today by his father, Rene, his wife, Jan, and their beautiful and charming daughters, Delia and Rosie. Would you welcome them as well? (Applause.)\nI also want to thank all of our distinguished guests who have joined us for this important moment, especially Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and all the Hispanic business and community leaders who are here with us today. Thank you for being here on this historic day.\nThis Saturday marks the end of President Trump's first 100 days in office, and as this period draws to a close, it's worth reflecting for just a moment on the optimism and the progress that is sweeping across America, thanks to the leadership of President Donald Trump.\nFor nearly 100 days, President Trump has been delivering on the promises that he made to the American people, one after another. He picked a world-class Cabinet, which we're adding to today, which is working around the clock to implement an agenda to make America great again. In Justice Neil Gorsuch, President Trump kept his promise to nominate a Supreme Court justice in the mold of the late and great Justice Antonin Scalia.\nPresident Trump has been putting America first -- rebuilding our military, restoring the arsenal of democracy, and he's signing legislation to give our veterans the care that they deserve. In fact, in now just short of 100 days, President Trump has signed 28 bills into law, 30 executive orders -- historic numbers that show that not only is President Trump a man of his word, President Trump is a man of action. (Applause.)\nAnd since day one, the President has taken decisive action to get our economy moving again and restore opportunity and prosperity for every American family. President Trump, I always like to say, has a three-part agenda: Jobs, jobs, and jobs. And to kick-start jobs and growth, the President has been slashing through mountains of red tape. He's renewed focus even earlier today on American energy and American energy independence. And just a few short days ago, the President put forward a plan for the biggest tax cut for individuals and businesses in American history. (Applause.)\nAnd the result? More than 500,000 new jobs have been created so far this year. Small-business confidence has skyrocketed to its highest level in decades, and for manufacturers, the highest level in two decades. And company after company is announcing plans to invest in our country for the benefit of American workers, American jobs, and America's future.\nThe fact is that President Trump's leadership has been making a difference every single day, and we're just getting started. And with our new Secretary of Labor, Alex Acosta, the President and I are confident that we will accomplish even more for working Americans and job creators all across this nation. (Applause.)\nAlex Acosta is the right man at the right time to lead the Department of Labor. Born the son of two Cuban refugees, Alex showed his potential from his earliest days, earning both his undergraduate and law degrees from Harvard University. He went on to clerk for Justice Samuel Alito on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, and after a few years in private practice and as a professor at George Mason University School of Law, he entered into the noble path of public service.\nIn 2002, President George W. Bush appointed Alex to serve as a member of the National Labor Relations Board. Only one year later, President Bush appointed him to be the Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice, and two years after that, he became the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida.\nAlex, I know you've tried to retire from public service more than once. (Laughter.) In 2009, you did it when you became dean of Florida International University College of Law. But President Trump has now called you back -- called you back to public service, to bring you character, your intellect, and your ability to serve the country. And we couldn't be more grateful.\nYour service, past, present, and future, is truly a testament to the American Dream and to your own character and your own abilities. I want to thank you again. Thank you for stepping up to serve our country and to serve working Americans at such a time as this. Given your long and distinguished record, your integrity and your leadership, the President and I are absolutely confident that as -- with you as our new Secretary of Labor, we will continue to restore opportunity, prosperity and growth for working Americans now and for generations to come. (Applause.)\nAnd so, on behalf of President Trump, it is my great privilege to administer to you the oath of office. Step aside and we'll make it official.\n(The oath is administered.) (Applause.)\nSECRETARY ACOSTA: I want to thank President Trump, Vice President Pence, and the members of the Senate for the privilege of serving as Secretary of Labor. I want to thank my wife, Jan. Her unyielding support and her heartfelt love means the world to me. It's amazing to be loved, and I love her back more than words can really say. And so, thank you. (Applause.)\nMy daughters, Delia and Rosalia, are amazing. They have followed this process in their own way. When President Trump nominated me, I had to sit down and explain to them that we were, if confirmed, moving to Washington, and they wanted to know why. And so I sort of took a pause and I tried to explain what being Secretary of Labor means in words that a four- and then six-year-old could understand. And this is what I said. I said, Daddy helps his students find good jobs, and so the President has asked Daddy to help people all over America find good jobs too. (Applause.)\nAnd then it struck me: Explaining the responsibilities of the Secretary of Labor to a four- and a six-year-old really helped me encapsulate so many of the responsibilities of the Department of Labor. Because, as the Vice President said, it is about finding and helping and supporting jobs and job growth.\nMy parents fled a Cuban dictatorship in search of freedom. They met in high school. They fell in love, and they married young. Neither attended college. What an amazing nation this is that the son of refugees who forwent an education to support a family could be standing here in this room, taking this oath, administered by the Vice President of the United States. That is what America is about. (Applause.)\nMy parents' experience is part of who I am and frames my perspectives that I will bring to the important responsibilities of the Department of Labor. We have a lot of work to do. Too many Americans have seen jobs go overseas. Too many Americans have seen jobs filled by foreign workers. And too many Americans see that jobs are available, but that they don't have the skills or the experience to fill those jobs. The skills gap is real and needs to be addressed.\nSupporting Americans' ability to find good jobs, safe jobs is a priority for President Trump, for Vice President Pence, and for me. I am honored and I am profoundly humbled to be called in service of this important effort. Thank you very much.

Trump\nAMERICA'S ENERGY RESOURCES ARE LOCKED AWAY: Under the previous administrations, America's offshore resources were blocked from responsible development.\n* Ninety-four percent of the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf's (OCS's) 1.7 billion acres are either off-limits to or not considered for oil and gas exploration and development under the current (2017-2022) leasing program.\n* Days before leaving office on January 17, 2017, the Obama Administration approved the latest schedule for oil and gas lease sales that would last for five years until 2022.\n* There are hundreds of millions of acres of federal waters in the Arctic Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, and Gulf of Mexico.\n* The OCS is expected to contain 90 billion barrels of undiscovered technically recoverable oil and 327 trillion cubic feet of undiscovered technically recoverable natural gas.\n* In FY 2016, Federal revenues from the OCS were $2.8 billion; the actual sales value of the oil and gas resources was $26 billion and generated $55 billion in total spending in the economy. These expenditures supported approximately 315,000 American jobs.\n* Alaska has seen a number of nearby OCS areas closed off to development and now has the second highest unemployment in the country, as its resource sectors, particularly oil and gas, have lost thousands of jobs.\n* At least one energy company has announced it would withdraw from all but one of its OCS leases in Alaska because of uncertain federal regulations.\n* Revenue to the Federal Government from leasing the OCS has fallen by over 80 percent, from $18 billion in 2008 to $2.8 billion in 2016. On average, OCS energy development generates $10-12 billion annually.\nFREEING AMERICA'S ENERGY POTENTIAL: President Donald J. Trump is removing restrictions on the OCS that locked away America's energy potential.\n* President Trump signed an Executive Order today to direct the Secretary of Interior and Secretary of Commerce to take action on OCS restrictions.\n* The Secretary of the Interior will review areas closed off by the current five-year plan for sale of oil and gas leases in the OCS, without disrupting scheduled lease sales. These planning areas include:\n* Western and Central Gulf of Mexico\n* Chukchi Sea\n* Beaufort Sea\n* Cook Inlet\n* Mid and South Atlantic\n* The Secretary of the Interior will review four rules and regulations put in place last year that could reduce exploration and development in the OCS. These include:\n* Notice to Lessees and Operators of Federal Oil and Gas, and Sulfur Leases, and Holders of Pipeline Right-of-Way and Right-of-Use and Easement Grants in the Outer Continental Shelf\n* Oil and Gas and Sulfur Operations in the Outer Continental Shelf-Blowout Preventer Systems and Well Control\n* Air Quality Control, Reporting, and Compliance\n* Oil and Gas and Sulfur Operations on the Outer Continental Shelf—Requirements for Exploratory Drilling on the Arctic Outer Continental Shelf\n* The Secretary of Commerce is directed to refrain from designating or expanding National Marine Sanctuaries unless the proposal includes \"a timely, full accounting from the Department of the Interior of any energy or mineral resource potential\"—including offshore energy from wind, oil, natural gas, and other sources—within the designated area and the potential impact the proposed designation or expansion will have on the development of those resources.\n* The Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Interior will work together to develop a streamlined permitting approach for privately funded seismic data research and collection to expeditiously determine the offshore resource potential of the United States.\nFOLLOWING THROUGH ON HIS PROMISE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE: President Trump is following through on the energy development policies he promised to the American people.\n* Then-Candidate Trump:\n* \"We need an America-First energy plan. This means opening Federal lands for oil and gas production; opening offshore areas; and revoking policies that are imposing unnecessary restrictions on innovative new exploration technologies.\"", "timestamp": "2017-04-28", "title": "Press Release - President Donald J.

Most importantly, we're bringing back jobs. You asked the people of Michigan; you ask the people of Ohio; you can ask the people of Pennsylvania. See what's happening. See the car companies come roaring back in. They don't want to leave. They want to stay here. They want a piece of the action.\nOur country is going up, and it's going up fast. Our companies are doing better—they just announced fantastic profits—all because of what's happened in this rather short period of time. And that's just the beginning. We're putting in a massive tax cut for the middle class and for business. It's going to have an enormous effect.\nThe massive Keystone Pipeline, the Dakota Pipeline—tens of thousands of jobs right there. And so many other businesses. We're really proud of what we're doing.\nThe F-35 fighter jet program, it was way over budget. I've saved $725 million plus, just by getting involved in the negotiation. We're cutting costs, and we're going to have a truly competitive and great country again.\nIn just 14 weeks, my administration has brought profound change to Washington. The most fundamental change can be found in the relationship between the people and their government. For too long, politicians cared more about special interests than they did about a very successful future for all Americans. They took our taxpayers' money and sent their jobs and wealth to other countries.\nNot anymore. From the first day of my administration, I have governed by a simple idea: My only allegiance is to you, our wonderful citizens. Together, we are seeing that great achievements are possible when we put American people first.\nThat is why I withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. That day was a turning point for our Nation. It put the countries of this world on notice that the sellout of the American worker was over.\nIn the following weeks, I took unprecedented actions to reverse Federal overreach and unleash job creation. We have slashed burdensome regulations and imposed a policy that for each new regulation, two regulations must be erased from the books.\nWe've done it all while moving quickly to restore the most basic protection for all citizens, the rule of law. A truly great judge, Neil Gorsuch, now sits on the United States Supreme Court. Justice Gorsuch is deeply devoted to our Constitution. My administration is the first in modern political era to confirm a new Supreme Court Justice in the first 100 days; the last time it happened was 136 years ago in 1881.\nDefending the rule of law is a priority, not just in the courts, but also on the streets and on the border. We've told the incredible police of our Nation that they have our full support as they work to bring down violent crime rates. We've taken bold action to go after criminal cartels and made it a top priority to prosecute anyone who targets law enforcement. This has been the work of my administration: fighting for the American worker, defending the rule of law, and returning the power to the American people. Since my Inauguration, economic confidence has soared, reaching higher than any time in 9 years. Optimism among manufacturers is at a record high. And small-business confidence has seen its largest increase in nearly four decades.\nPerhaps the greatest change of all is the renewal of the American spirit. As long as we have faith in each other and trust in God, then the Sun will always shine on our very glorious republic.\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless America.", "timestamp": "2017-04-28", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}

And I want to get them immediately back over there because I know they're going to be voting on lots of different things, right? So we can't spend too much time talking about drilling in the Arctic, right? [Laughter] But we're opening it up.\nThis is a great day for American workers and families, and today we're unleashing American energy and clearing the way for thousands and thousands of high-paying American energy jobs. Our country is blessed with incredible natural resources, including abundant offshore oil and natural gas reserves. But the Federal Government has kept 94 percent of these offshore areas closed for exploration and production. And when they say closed, they mean closed.\nThis deprives our country of potentially thousands and thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in wealth. I pledged to take action, and today I am keeping that promise.\nThis Executive order starts the process of opening offshore areas to job-creating energy exploration. It reverses the previous administration's Arctic leasing ban. So hear that: It reverses the previous administration's Arctic leasing ban and directs Secretary Zinke to allow responsible development of offshore areas that will bring revenue to our Treasury and jobs to our workers. In addition, Secretary Zinke will be reconsidering burdensome regulations that slow job creation.\nFinally, this order will enable better scientific study of our offshore resources and research that has blocked everything from happening for far too long. You notice it doesn't get blocked for other nations. It only gets blocked for our Nation.\nRenewed offshore energy production will reduce the cost of energy, create countless new jobs, and make America more secure and far more energy independent. This action is another historic step toward future development and future—with a future, a real future. And I have to say that's a real future with greater prosperity and security for all Americans, which is what we want.\nSo I'm very proud of the people standing behind me. I'm far less proud of the people standing in front of me—[laughter]—the media. But I have to tell you that this is a very important day, and I want to congratulate Wilbur and Ryan and all of the people that have worked so hard to get this put together so quickly. And it's going to lead to a lot of great wealth for our country and a lot of great jobs for our country.\nSo God bless America. Thank you very much.\nThe President. The question is, who's going to get this pen? I don't know. [Laughter]\nSenator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. \"North to the Future\" is what we say in Alaska. The President. Thank you. We love Alaska.\n[At this point, the President signed the Executive order.]\nThe President. Who gets this pen? Tell me. Who gets it? I'll give it to——\nParticipants. Lisa.\n[The President handed the pen to Sen. Murkowski. Then, a reporter asked a question as follows.]\nThe President's First 100 Days in Office\nQ. Mr. President, day 99. What's made this job harder than you thought?\nThe President. Well, we're moving awfully well. We're getting a lot of things done. We are—I don't think there's ever been anything like this. It's a false standard, a hundred days, but I have to tell you, I don't think anybody has done what we did over the a hundred days. So we're very happy.", "timestamp": "2017-04-28", "title": "Remarks on Signing an Executive Order on Implementing an America-First Offshore Energy Strategy"}
{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "note": "This Executive order was published in the  Federal Register  on May 3.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123867", "text": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq., and in order to maintain global leadership in energy innovation, exploration, and production, it is hereby ordered as follows:\nSection 1. Findings. America must put the energy needs of American families and businesses first and continue implementing a plan that ensures energy security and economic vitality for decades to come. The energy and minerals produced from lands and waters under Federal management are important to a vibrant economy and to our national security. Increased domestic energy production on Federal lands and waters strengthens the Nation's security and reduces reliance on imported energy. Moreover, low energy prices, driven by an increased American energy supply, will benefit American families and help reinvigorate American manufacturing and job growth. Finally, because the Department of Defense is one of the largest consumers of energy in the United States, domestic energy production also improves our Nation's military readiness.\nSec. 2. Policy. It shall be the policy of the United States to encourage energy exploration and production, including on the Outer Continental Shelf, in order to maintain the Nation's position as a global energy leader and foster energy security and resilience for the benefit of the American people, while ensuring that any such activity is safe and environmentally responsible.\nSec. 3. Implementing an America-First Offshore Energy Strategy. To carry out the policy set forth in section 2 of this order, the Secretary of the Interior shall:\n(a) as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, including the procedures set forth in section 1344 of title 43, United States Code, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, give full consideration to revising the schedule of proposed oil and gas lease sales, as described in that section, so that it includes, but is not limited to, annual lease sales, to the maximum extent permitted by law, in each of the following Outer Continental Shelf Planning Areas, as designated by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) (Planning Areas): Western Gulf of Mexico, Central Gulf of Mexico, Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea, Cook Inlet, Mid-Atlantic, and South Atlantic;\n(b) ensure that any revisions made pursuant to subsection (a) of this section do not hinder or affect ongoing lease sales currently scheduled as part of the 2017-2022 Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Proposed Final Program, as published on November 18, 2016; and\n(c) develop and implement, in coordination with the Secretary of Commerce and to the maximum extent permitted by law, a streamlined permitting approach for privately funded seismic data research and collection aimed at expeditiously determining the offshore energy resource potential of the United States within the Planning Areas.\nSec. 4. Responsible Planning for Future Offshore Energy Potential. (a) The Secretary of Commerce shall, unless expressly required otherwise, refrain from designating or expanding any National Marine Sanctuary under the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, 16 U.S.C. 1431 et seq., unless the sanctuary designation or expansion proposal includes a timely, full accounting from the Department of the Interior of any energy or mineral resource potential within the designated area—including offshore energy from wind, oil, natural gas, methane hydrates, and any other sources that the Secretary of Commerce deems appropriate—and the potential impact the proposed designation or expansion will have on the development of those resources. The Secretary of the Interior shall provide any such accounting within 60 days of receiving a notification of intent to propose any such National Marine Sanctuary designation or expansion from the Secretary of Commerce.\n(b) The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall conduct a review of all designations and expansions of National Marine Sanctuaries, and of all designations and expansions of Marine National Monuments under the Antiquities Act of 1906, recently recodified at sections 320301 to 320303 of title 54, United States Code, designated or expanded within the 10-year period prior to the date of this order.\n(i) The review under this subsection shall include:\n(A) an analysis of the acreage affected and an analysis of the budgetary impacts of the costs of managing each National Marine Sanctuary or Marine National Monument designation or expansion;\n(B) an analysis of the adequacy of any required Federal, State, and tribal consultations conducted before the designations or expansions; and\n(C) the opportunity costs associated with potential energy and mineral exploration and production from the Outer Continental Shelf, in addition to any impacts on production in the adjacent region.\n(ii) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Interior, shall report the results of the review under this subsection to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality, and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy.\n(c) To further streamline existing regulatory authorities, Executive Order 13754 of December 9, 2016 (Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience), is hereby revoked.\nSec. 5. Modification of the Withdrawal of Areas of the Outer Continental Shelf from Leasing Disposition. The body text in each of the memoranda of withdrawal from disposition by leasing of the United States Outer Continental Shelf issued on December 20, 2016, January 27, 2015, and July 14, 2008, is modified to read, in its entirety, as follows:\n\"Under the authority vested in me as President of the United States, including section 12(a) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. 1341(a), I hereby withdraw from disposition by leasing, for a time period without specific expiration, those areas of the Outer Continental Shelf designated as of July 14, 2008, as Marine Sanctuaries under the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, 16 U.S.C. 1431-1434, 33 U.S.C. 1401 et seq.\"\nNothing in the withdrawal under this section affects any rights under existing leases in the affected areas. Sec. 6. Reconsideration of Notice to Lessees and Financial Assurance Regulatory Review. The Secretary of the Interior shall direct the Director of BOEM to take all necessary steps consistent with law to review BOEM's Notice to Lessees No. 2016-N01 of September 12, 2016 (Notice to Lessees and Operators of Federal Oil and Gas, and Sulfur Leases, and Holders of Pipeline Right-of-Way and Right-of-Use and Easement Grants in the Outer Continental Shelf), and determine whether modifications are necessary, and if so, to what extent, to ensure operator compliance with lease terms while minimizing unnecessary regulatory burdens. The Secretary of the Interior shall also review BOEM's financial assurance regulatory policy to determine the extent to which additional regulation is necessary.\nSec. 7. Reconsideration of Well Control Rule. The Secretary of the Interior shall review the Final Rule of the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) entitled \"Oil and Gas and Sulfur Operations in the Outer Continental Shelf-Blowout Preventer Systems and Well Control,\" 81 Fed. Reg. 25888 (April 29, 2016), for consistency with the policy set forth in section 2 of this order, and shall publish for notice and comment a proposed rule revising that rule, if appropriate and as consistent with law. The Secretary of the Interior shall also take all appropriate action to lawfully revise any related rules and guidance for consistency with the policy set forth in section 2 of this order. Additionally, the Secretary of the Interior shall review BSEE's regulatory regime for offshore operators to determine the extent to which additional regulation is necessary.\nSec. 8. Reconsideration of Proposed Offshore Air Rule. The Secretary of the Interior shall take all steps necessary to review BOEM's Proposed Rule entitled \"Air Quality Control, Reporting, and Compliance,\" 81 Fed. Reg. 19718 (April 5, 2016), along with any related rules and guidance, and, if appropriate, shall, as soon as practicable and consistent with law, consider whether the proposed rule, and any related rules and guidance, should be revised or withdrawn.\nSec. 9. Expedited Consideration of Incidental Harassment Authorizations, Incidental-Take, and Seismic Survey Permits. The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce shall, to the maximum extent permitted by law, expedite all stages of consideration of Incidental Take Authorization requests, including Incidental Harassment Authorizations and Letters of Authorization, and Seismic Survey permit applications under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq., and the Marine Mammal Protection Act, 16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.\nSec. 10. Review of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Technical Memorandum NMFS-OPR-55. The Secretary of Commerce shall review NOAA's Technical Memorandum NMFS-OPR-55 of July 2016 (Technical Guidance for Assessing the Effects of Anthropogenic Sound on Marine Mammal Hearing) for consistency with the policy set forth in section 2 of this order and, after consultation with the appropriate Federal agencies, take all steps permitted by law to rescind or revise that guidance, if appropriate.\nSec. 11. Review of Offshore Arctic Drilling Rule. The Secretary of the Interior shall immediately take all steps necessary to review the Final Rule entitled \"Oil and Gas and Sulfur Operations on the Outer Continental Shelf—Requirements for Exploratory Drilling on the Arctic Outer Continental Shelf,\" 81 Fed. Reg. 46478 (July 15, 2016), and, if appropriate, shall, as soon as practicable and consistent with law, publish for notice and comment a proposed rule suspending, revising, or rescinding this rule.\nSec. 12. Definition. As used in this order, \"Outer Continental Shelf Planning Areas, as designated by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management\" means those areas delineated in the\ndiagrams on pages S-5 and S-8 of the 2017-2022 Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Draft Proposed Program, as published by the BOEM in January 2015, with the exception of any buffer zones included in such planning documents.\nSec. 13. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nDONALD J.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "note": "The President spoke at 2:06 p.m. at the Georgia World Congress Center. In his remarks, he referred to Chris W. Cox, executive director, and Wayne R. LaPierre, Jr., executive vice president, National Rifle Association; former Georgia Secretary of State Karen C. Handel, in her capacity as a Republican congressional candidate; Democratic congressional candidate Jon Ossoff; musician Melvin Lee Greenwood; Sen. Elizabeth Warren; Leonard A. Leo, executive vice president, the Federalist Society; and former Sen. James W. DeMint, in his capacity as president of the Heritage Foundation. * White House correction.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123871", "text": "Thank you, Chris, for that kind introduction and for your tremendous work on behalf of our Second Amendment. Thank you very much. I want to also thank Wayne LaPierre for his unflinching leadership in the fight for freedom. Wayne, thank you very much. Great.\nI'd also like to congratulate Karen Handel on her incredible fight in Georgia Six. The election takes place on June 20. And by the way, on primaries, let's not have 11 Republicans running for the same position, okay? [Laughter] It's too nerve-shattering. She's totally for the NRA, and she's totally for the Second Amendment. So get out and vote. She's running against someone who's going to raise your taxes to the sky, destroy your health care, and he's for open borders—lots of crime—and he's not even able to vote in the district that he's running in. Other than that, I think he's doing a fantastic job, right? [Laughter] So get out and vote for Karen.\nAlso, my friend—he's become a friend—because there's nobody that does it like Lee Greenwood. Wow. [Laughter] Lee's anthem is the perfect description of the renewed spirit sweeping across our country. And it really is, indeed, sweeping across our country. So, Lee, I know I speak for everyone in this arena when I say, we are all very proud indeed to be an American. Thank you very much, Lee.\nNo one was more proud to be American than the beloved patriot—and you know who I'm talking about—we remember on gatherings like today, your former five-term President, the late Charlton Heston. How good was Charlton? And I remember Charlton; he was out there fighting when maybe a lot of people didn't want to be fighting. He was out there for a long time. He was a great guy.\nAnd it's truly wonderful to be back in Atlanta and back with my friends at the NRA. You are my friends, believe me. Perhaps some of you remember the last time we were all together. Remember that? [Laughter] We had a big crowd then too. So we knew something was happening. But it was in the middle of a historic political year and in the middle of a truly historic election. What fun that was: November 8. Wasn't that a great evening? Do you remember that evening? Remember that?\nRemember they were saying, \"We have breaking news: Donald Trump has won the State of Michigan.\" They go, \"Michigan? How did that\"—\"Donald Trump has won the State of Wisconsin, whoa.\" But earlier in the evening, remember: Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, all the way up—we ran up the East Coast. And you know, the Republicans have a tremendous disadvantage in the electoral college; you know that. And tremendous disadvantage. And to run the whole East Coast, and then you go with Iowa and Ohio, and all of the different States. It was a great evening, one that a lot people will never forget—a lot of people. [Laughter] Not going to forget that evening.\nAnd remember they said, \"There is no path to 270.\" For months, I was hearing that. You know, they're trying to suppress the vote. So they keep saying it; so people say, you know, I really like Trump, he loves the Second Amendment, he loves the NRA; I love him, but let's go to the movie, because he can't win. Because they're trying to suppress the vote.\nBut they'd say—I mean, hundreds of times I heard—there is no—there's no route. They'd say it, \"There is no route to 270.\" And we ended up with 306. So they were right: not 270, 306. That was some evening. Big sports fans said that was the single most exciting event they've ever seen. That includes Super Bowls and World Series and boxing matches. That was an exciting evening for all of us, and it meant a lot.\nOnly one candidate in the general election came to speak to you, and that candidate is now the President of the United States, standing before you again. I have a feeling that in the next election you're going to be swamped with candidates, but you're not going to be wasting your time. [Laughter] You'll have plenty of those Democrats coming over, and you're going to say, no, sir, no thank you—no, ma'am. Perhaps ma'am. It may be Pocahontas, remember that. [Laughter] And she is not big for the NRA, that I can tell you.\nBut you came through for me, and I am going to come through for you. I was proud to receive the NRA's earliest endorsement in the history of the organization. And today I am also proud to be the first sitting President to address the NRA Leadership Forum since our wonderful Ronald Reagan in 1983. And I want to thank each and every one of you, not only for your help electing true friends of the Second Amendment, but for everything you do to defend our flag and our freedom.\nWith your activism, you helped to safeguard the freedoms of our soldiers who have bled and died for us on the battlefields. And I know we have many veterans in the audience today, and we want to give them a big, big beautiful round of applause.\nAnd like I promised, we are doing a really top job already—99 days—but already, with the Veterans Administration, people are seeing a big difference. We are working really hard at the VA, and you're going to see it, and you're already seeing it. And it's my honor. I've been telling you we're going to do it, and we're doing it. Thank you.\nThe NRA protects in our capitols and legislative houses the freedoms that our servicemembers have won for us on those incredible battlefields. And it's been a tough fight against those who would go so far as to ban private gun ownership entirely. But I am here to deliver you good news. And I can tell you that Wayne and Chris have been fighting with me long and hard to make sure that we were with you today, not somebody else with an empty podium. Because believe me, the podium would have been empty. They fought long and hard, and I think you folks cannot thank them enough. They were with us all the way, right from the beginning.\nBut we have news that you've been waiting for for a long time: The 8-year assault on your Second Amendment freedoms has come to a crashing end. You have a true friend and champion in the White House. No longer will Federal agencies be coming after law-abiding gun owners. No longer will the Government be trying to undermine your rights and your freedoms as Americans. Instead, we will work with you, by your side. We will work with the NRA to promote responsible gun ownership, to protect our wonderful hunters and their access to the very beautiful outdoors. You met my son; I can tell you, both sons, they love the outdoors. Frankly, I think they love the outdoors more than they love, by a long shot, Fifth Avenue. But that's okay. And we want to ensure you of the sacred right of self-defense for all of our citizens.\nWhen I spoke to this forum last year, our Nation was still mourning the loss of a giant, a great defender of the Constitution: Justice Antonin Scalia. I promised that if elected, I would nominate a Justice who would be faithful and loyal to the Constitution. I even went one step further and publicly presented a list of 20 judges from which I would make my selection, and that's exactly what we did.\nAnd by the way, I want to thank, really, Heritage. And I want to thank also all of the people that worked with us. Where's Leo? Is Leo around here? Where is he? He's got to be here. Where is he? He has been so good. But from—and also from Heritage, Jim DeMint. It's been amazing. I mean, those people have been fantastic. They've been real friends. The Federalist people, where are they? Are they around here someplace? They really helped us out. I kept my promise, and now, with your help, our brandnew Justice—and he is really something very special—Neil Gorsuch, sits on the Bench of the United States Supreme Court. For the first time in the modern political era, we have confirmed a new Justice in the first 100 days. The last time that happened was 136 years ago, in 1881. Now, we won't get any credit for this, but don't worry about it; the credit is in the audience, right? The credit is in the audience. All of those people. They won't give us credit, but it's been a long time, and we're very honored.\nWe've also taken action to stand up for America's sportsmen. On their very last full day in office, the previous administration issued an 11th-hour rule to restrict the use of lead ammunition on certain Federal lands. Have you heard about that, folks? I'm shocked to hear that. You've all heard about that. Huh? You've heard about that. On his first day as Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke eliminated the previous administration's ammunition ban. He's going to be great. Ryan is going to be great.\nWe've also moved very quickly to restore something gun owners care about very, very much. It's called the rule of law. We have made clear that our administration will always stand with the incredible men and women of law enforcement. In fact, countless members of law enforcement are also members of the NRA, because our police know that responsible gun ownership saves lives and that the right of self-defense is essential to public safety. Do we all agree with that?\nOur police and sheriffs also know that when you ban guns, only the criminals will be armed. For too long, Washington has gone after law-abiding gun owners while making life easier for criminals, drug dealers, traffickers, and gang members. MS-13—you know about MS-13? It's not pleasant for them anymore, folks. It's not pleasant for them anymore. That's a bad group. Not pleasant for MS-13. Get them the hell out of here, right? Get them out.\nWe are protecting the freedoms of law-abiding Americans, and we are going after the criminal gangs and cartels that prey on our innocent citizens. And we are really going after them.\nAs members of the NRA know well, some of the most important decisions a President can make are appointments, and I've appointed people who believe in law, order, and justice. That is why I have selected as your Attorney General, number one, a really fine person, a really good man, a man who has spent his entire career fighting crime, supporting the police, and defending the Second Amendment. For the first time in a long time, you now have a pro-Second Amendment, tough-on-crime Attorney General, and his name is Jeff Sessions.\nAnd Attorney General Sessions is putting our priorities into action. He's going after the drug dealers who are peddling their poison all over our streets and destroying our youth. He's going after the gang members who threaten our children. And he's fully enforcing our immigration laws in all 50 States. And you know what? It's about time.\nHeading up the effort to secure America's borders is a great military general, a man of action: Homeland Security Director [Secretary]* John Kelly. Secretary Kelly, who used to be General Kelly, is following through on my pledge to protect the borders, remove criminal aliens, and stop the drugs from pouring into our country. We've already seen—listen to this; it's never happened before, people can't even believe it. And by the way, we will build the wall no matter how low this number gets or how high this goes. Don't even think about it. Don't even think about it.\nYou know, they're trying to use this number against us because we've done so unbelievably at the borders already. They're trying to use it against us. But you need that wall to stop the human trafficking, to stop the drugs, to stop the wrong people. You need the wall. But listen to this: We've already seen a 73 percent decrease—never happened before—in illegal immigration on the southern border since my election—73 percent.\nYou see what they're doing, right? So why do you need a wall? We need a wall.\nAudience member. Build the wall!\nThe President. We'll build the wall. Don't even think about it. Don't even think about it. Don't even think about it. That's an easy one. We're going to build the wall. We need the wall.\nI said to General Kelly, how important is it? He said, very important. It's that final element. We need the wall. And it's a wall in certain areas. You, obviously—where you have these massive physical structures, you don't need, and where you have certain big rivers and all. But we need a wall, and we're going to get that wall.\nAnd the world is getting the message. They know that our border is no longer open to illegal immigration and that if you try to break in, you'll be caught, and you'll be returned to your home. You're not staying any longer. And if you keep coming back illegally after deportation, you will be arrested, prosecuted, and you will put behind bars. Otherwise, it will never end.\nLet's also remember that immigration security is national security. We've seen the attacks from 9/11 to Boston to San Bernardino. Hundreds of individuals from other countries have been charged with terrorism-related offenses in the United States.\nWe spend billions and billions of dollars on security all over the world, but then we allow radical Islamic terrorists to enter right through our front door. That's not going to happen anymore. It's time to get tough. It's time we finally got smart. And yes, it's also time to put America first.\nAnd perhaps—I see all of those beautiful red and white hats-—but we will never forget our favorite slogan of them all: Make America Great Again. All right?\nKeeping our communities safe and protecting our freedoms also requires the cooperation of our State leaders. We have some incredible pro-Second Amendment Governors here at the NRA conference, including Governor Scott of Florida. Where is Governor Scott? Where is he? Great guy, doing a great job. Governor Bryant of Mississippi. What a wonderful place. Governor Bryant is here. Thank you. Governor Deal of Georgia. And we're also joined by two people that—well, one I loved right from the beginning; the other one I really liked, didn't like, and now like a lot again. [Laughter] Does that make sense? Senator David Perdue—he was from the beginning—and Senator Ted Cruz—like, dislike, like. Where are they? Good guys. Good guys. Smart cookies.\nEach of these leaders knows that public officials must serve under the Constitution, not above it. We all took an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, and that means defending the Second Amendment.\nSo let me make a simple promise to every one of the freedom-loving Americans in the audience today: As your President, I will never, ever infringe on the right of the people to keep and bear arms. Never ever. Freedom is not a gift from government, freedom is a gift from God.\nIt was this conviction that stirred the heart of a great American patriot on that day, April, 242 years ago. It was the day that Paul Revere spread his Lexington alarm, the famous warning that \"the British are coming, the British are coming.\" Right? You've all heard that, right? The British are coming.\nNow we have other people trying to come, but believe me, they're not going to be successful. That I can tell you. Nothing changes, right, folks? Nothing changes. They are not going to be successful. There will be serious hurt on them, not on us. Next, came the shot heard around the world and then a ragtag army of God-fearing farmers, frontiersmen, shopkeepers, merchants that stood up to the most powerful army at that time on Earth. The most powerful army on Earth. But we sometimes forget what inspired those everyday farmers and workers in that great War for Independence.\nMany years after the war, a young man asked Captain Levi Preston, aged 91, why he fought alongside his neighbors at Concord. Was it the Stamp Act? Was it the tea tax? Was it a work of philosophy? \"No,\" the old veteran replied. \"Then why?\" he was asked. \"Young man,\" the captain said, \"what we meant in going for those Redcoats was this: We always had governed ourselves, and we always meant to\" govern ourselves.\nCaptain Preston's words are a reminder of what this organization and my administration are all about: the right of a sovereign people to govern their own affairs and govern them properly. We don't want any longer to be ruled by the bureaucrats in Washington or in any other country, for that matter. In America, we are ruled by our citizens. We are ruled by each and every one of you.\nBut we can't be complacent. These are dangerous times. These are horrible times for certain obvious reasons. But we're going to make them great times again. Every day, we are up against those who would take away our freedoms, restrict our liberties, and even those who want to abolish the Second Amendment. We must be vigilant. And I know you are all up to the task.\nSince the first generation of Americans stood strong at Concord, each generation to follow has answered the call to defend freedom in their time. That is why we are here today: To defend freedom for our children. To defend the liberty of all Americans. And to defend the right of a free and sovereign people to keep and bear arms.\nI greatly appreciated your support on November 8, in what will, hopefully, be one of the most important and positive elections for the United States of all time. And to the NRA, I can proudly say I will never, ever let you down.\nThank you. God Bless you. God Bless our Constitution, and God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2017-04-28", "title": "Remarks at the National Rifle Association Leadership Forum in Atlanta, Georgia"}

They are leading researchers in science, medicine, and technology; dedicated teachers to our Nation's children; innovative farmers and ranchers; and distinguished lawyers and government leaders.\nDr. Sammy Lee, a Korean American who passed away last December, exemplified the spirit of this month. Dr. Lee was the first Asian American man to win an Olympic gold medal, becoming a platform diving champion at the 1948 London Olympics only 1 year after graduating from medical school. To fulfill his dreams, Dr. Lee overcame several obstacles, including his local childhood pool's policy of opening to minorities only once per week. Later in life he was subject to housing discrimination (even after 8 years of military service). Dr. Lee nevertheless tirelessly served his country and community, including by representing the United States at the Olympic Games, on behalf of several Presidents.\nKatherine Sui Fun Cheung also embodied the spirit of this month. In 1932, she became the first Chinese American woman to earn a pilot license. At the time, only about 1 percent of pilots in the United States were women.

The small band of Dutch Jews who first immigrated in 1654, seeking refuge and religious liberty, brought with them their families, their religion, and their cherished customs, which they have passed on from generation to generation. The moral and ethical code of the Jewish people is inspired by their spiritual vocation of \"tikkun olam\"—the charge to repair the world. Through that vocation, the Jewish people have left an indelible mark on American culture. Today, it is manifested in the towering success Jewish people have achieved in America through a unique synthesis of respect for heritage and love of country.\nEscaping religious persecution and ethnic violence and seeking political freedom and economic opportunity, American Jews, over centuries, have held firm in the belief that the United States was \"Di Goldene Medina\"—the Golden Country. Those who moved here built houses and gardens, raised families, and launched businesses. They have pursued education to advance their mission to make the world a better place. In every aspect of the country's cultural, spiritual, economic, and civic life, American Jews have stood at the forefront of the struggles for human freedom, equality, and dignity, helping to shine a light of hope to people around the globe.\nThe achievements of American Jews are felt throughout American society and culture, in every field and in every profession. American Jews have built institutions of higher learning, hospitals, and manifold cultural and philanthropic organizations. American Jews have even brought us our greatest superheroes—Captain America, Superman, and Batman. American Jews have composed some of our defining national hymns like God Bless America, timeless musicals like The Sound of Music, and even famous Christmas songs. From Admiral Hyman G. Rickover to Albert Einstein, Richard Rodgers to Irving Berlin, Jerry Siegel to Bill Finger, Mel Brooks to Don Rickles, and Levi Strauss to Elie Wiesel, American Jews have transformed all aspects of American life and continue to enrich the American spirit.\nThis month, I celebrate with my family—including my daughter, Ivanka, my son-in-law, Jared, my grandchildren, and our extended family—the deep spiritual connection that binds, and will always bind, the Jewish people to the United States and its founding principles. We recognize the faith and optimism exemplified by American Jews is what truly makes America \"The Golden Country,\" and we express our Nation's gratitude for this great, strong, prosperous, and loving people.\nNow, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2017 as Jewish American Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to celebrate the heritage and contributions of American Jews and to observe this month with appropriate programs, activities, and ceremonies.

In the last year alone, America's foster families opened their homes and hearts to more than 300,000 young people.\nBut we can do more. Every child deserves a safe and supportive family. Ensuring that children grow up with the opportunity to reach their full potential is a top priority of my Administration. For thousands of children whose biological families are unable to support them, foster families provide a secure and nurturing environment that is essential for a successful start in life.\nFoster families serve young people from all walks of life, from infants awaiting adoption, to children seeking reunification with their families and teens in need of safe havens from negative influences. In many cases, they offer our Nation's most at-risk children a second chance at the American Dream.\nA tremendous demand exists for foster parents and families across the country. Together as a Nation, we must raise awareness about this need and inspire volunteers to step forward and invest in the lives of our Nation's youth through our foster care system.\nNow, Therefore, I, Donald J.

We also highlight the close relationship between sports and physical fitness and the benefits related to participation in sports, including disease prevention, lessons in teamwork and leadership, and the practice of overcoming adversity. In addition to their physical health benefits, sports promote positive mentoring, discipline, and structure for young Americans.\nIn 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower formed the President's Council on Youth Fitness, demonstrating a national commitment to improving health and physical fitness. President Eisenhower's legacy lives on today in the form of the President's Council on Fitness, Sports, and Nutrition, which advises me on health and fitness and engages with communities across the country to improve youth fitness and empower Americans to adopt healthy lifestyles that include regular physical activity and good nutrition. My Administration will continue this tradition, with a particular focus on promoting sports and physical fitness among our youth.\nAs we each work to maintain our own physical fitness, we play a part in building a stronger and healthier America. Failure to engage in physical activity contributes to serious negative health outcomes, including obesity and diseases such as type 2 diabetes, and an increased risk of heart disease, the number one cause of death in America. Complications from these health problems often impact quality of life and frequently lead to other related and debilitating conditions.\nAs we celebrate National Physical Fitness and Sports Month, let us commit ourselves to celebrating active lifestyles, promoting physical fitness, and tackling public health issues together by making healthier choices. Let us rededicate ourselves each day to childhood obesity prevention, and recognize the role that sports can play in our Nation's health and well-being. Throughout May, I encourage all Americans to eat nutritious food, to take more time each day to be active, and to inspire friends, family, peers, and loved ones to do the same.\nFinally, the Americans who serve our Nation's youth through sports and other physical activities deserve our collective appreciation. Whether through coaching, driving kids to and from practice, or organizing the leagues and events that make sport competitions possible, these Americans make countless unseen sacrifices that merit special recognition.\nNow, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2017, as National Physical Fitness and Sports Month.

Some of today's grandparents and great-grandparents were born during the Great Depression, lived through the Second World War, witnessed the rise and fall of Communism, fought in Korea and Vietnam, marched with Martin Luther King, Jr., and watched the first man walk on the Moon. Now, they surf the internet and share family photos on their phones in a world that is richer and freer than the one into which they were born. Listening to the stories of our older citizens allows younger Americans to appreciate the country they inherited and gain the wisdom necessary to make it even better for their children and grandchildren.\nAs we celebrate Older Americans Month, we take the opportunity to thank our seniors and recognize the enormous contributions they make to the Nation. Indeed, one of modern life's greatest blessings are the medical advancements that make it possible for older people to remain healthy and active well into the later stages of life. We are blessed to have their presence, their love, and their unmatched perspective for our families.\nOur elders also have an unprecedented opportunity to make a difference in our communities by sharing their talents, wisdom, and time. America's seniors give back in a myriad of ways, working with children in our schools, providing assistance to the sick and shut-in, and inventing new and innovative products. They have made our Nation stronger through their experience, knowledge, and willingness to share with others.\nFinally, during this month we also recognize that, as we age, many of us will need more assistance from our friends and family. We therefore recommit ourselves to ensuring that older Americans are not neglected or abused, receive the best healthcare available, live in suitable homes, have adequate income and economic opportunities, and enjoy freedom and independence in their golden years.

We recognize the successful public charter schools across the country and the families, teachers, administrators, and communities who continue to invest in our Nation's most precious resource our children.\nMore than 25 years ago, an idea took root: educators free of restrictive processes and policies, and empowered to experiment with new teaching methods, would generate better outcomes for students. Charter schools are built around this idea. Like traditional public schools, they are tuition-free, but they operate independently from traditional school boards and, in exchange, are held accountable by local authorizers to standards that are often more demanding.\nEducation is the foundation for success, and educational opportunity should not be limited or defined by status, income, or residence. All children deserve access to a quality education. When our children receive a rigorous education and are held to high standards, they can achieve their goals, rise out of poverty, and actively engage in our democracy.\nFor too long, however, students across this country have been trapped in failing or underperforming schools simply because of their zip code. The Washington one-size-fits-all approach has not worked for far too many of our children. Fortunately, we have seen how allowing families the freedom to choose other schooling options including charter schools delivers life-changing results.\nToday, 44 States and the District of Columbia have laws that allow for charter schools, which enroll more than 3 million students. The demand for charter schools only continues to grow: a recent study showed that at least 70 percent of parents favor opening a charter school in their neighborhood. This is because charter schools work. According to Stanford University's Center for Research on Education Outcomes study, students in urban charter schools, on average, achieve significantly greater outcomes in both reading and math. This is why I have called upon the Congress to increase funding for charter schools as well as school choice programs for disadvantaged youth, which would include millions of African American and Latino children. Under the leadership of Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, we will expand charter school options for students throughout the United States.\nAs Americans, we have an abiding conviction that our next generation's future should be even brighter than ours. Education provides the staircase out of poverty, toward a fulfilling life of work and service, and a true shot at the American Dream. We want every student from New Orleans to Kansas City, from Houston to Detroit, and every city and town in between to rise to success. Charter schools have tremendous potential to offer students around the country the priceless gift of possibility. As a Nation, we should support the continued success of charter schools and hold our students up to the high standards they are all capable of achieving. Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 30 through May 6, 2017, as National Charter Schools Week. I commend our Nation's successful public charter schools, teachers, and administrators, and I call on States and communities to empower parents and families by supporting high-quality charter schools as an important school choice option.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nDONALD J.

Small business owners embody the American pioneering spirit and remind us that determination can turn aspiration into achievement. This week, we affirm our commitment to removing government barriers to the success of American small businesses.\nSmall businesses are an economic force in this country, and have grown by nearly 40 percent since 1982 despite often facing regulatory headwinds. They employ almost 58 million Americans, accounting for about 50 percent of all private-sector jobs in the United States. Our communities depend on the success of small businesses. More than 99 percent of all employer firms in the country are small businesses and in recent years, too many of them have been crushed by overwhelming Federal regulations. At the beginning of my Administration, I met with small business owners who continue to struggle under too many burdensome regulations. I have already signed legislation disapproving many excessive and unreasonable regulations and issued several Executive Orders to address other overreaching rules. These actions will free our Nation's entrepreneurs to spend more time creating jobs and less time navigating the Federal bureaucracy.\nMy Administration is also working to ensure our Nation's trade deals establish favorable conditions for small businesses to export their goods and services. With a level playing field on the international stage, America's small businesses will lead an export revival that brings jobs and wealth back to our country.\nOur Nation also deserves a tax system that works for not against small business owners. One of the biggest problems facing our small businesses is an unduly complicated, and often unfair, tax system. Tax reform will unleash a new wave of investment, innovation, and entrepreneurship in our country. Americans will keep more money in their pockets, leaving them with the resources they need to expand their businesses and hire more workers.\nAmerica's small business owners transform ideas into reality. They are a strong testament to the opportunities a market economy affords. During this week, we recognize the incredible contributions small businesses make to our country and pledge to foster the conditions that enable them to prosper and thrive.\nNow, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 30 through May 6, 2017, as Small Business Week.

(Applause.)\nSenator Donnelly, Congressman Scott, members of the Virginia delegation, members of the Indiana General Assembly who are with us here today, it is a real joy for me to be with you. As I served as governor of the state of Indiana, I learned of this extraordinary boat, but I could not have well imagined that I would be standing before you today in this moment with the great privilege to be at this christening. And I thank you all for being here and for the work that you have done to arrive at this moment. Christening the new USS Indiana just one day shy of the 75th anniversary of the dedication and christening of the last USS Indiana that feels providential to me. (Applause.)\nSo to Matt Mulherin, to Jeff Geiger, to Mike Petters, to Samuel Brandon, to the extraordinary craftsmen of Newport News Shipbuilding, let's give these great builders a round of applause. This is impressive work. (Applause.)\nToday marks the 100th day since President Donald Trump took his oath of office and I took mine. And he sent me here today on this historic occasion as a sign of his deep commitment to the Armed Forces of the United States of America -- and to his commitment to make the strongest fighting force in the world even stronger still. (Applause.)\nIt is the greatest privilege of my life to serve as Vice President to a President who is so dedicated to the men and women of our armed forces, to their families, to our veterans, and to the brave Americans who work tirelessly every day to support our military.\nAnd that really includes all the shipbuilders that we just applauded a few moments ago.\nFor more than 120 years, the men and women gathered here -- many of you second-, and third-, and fourth-generation shipbuilders -- have built from the bottom up the American fleets that have fostered security and prosperity on the high seas and between our land and distant others.\nKnow today that you have the gratitude -- all the builders gathered here, you have the gratitude of our Commander-in-Chief for your unwavering commitment to your country, your patriotism, your craftsmanship, and rest assured President Trump will honor your commitment with historic investments in our national defense. (Applause.)\nIn just his first 100 days in office, President Trump has already taken decisive action to end an era of budget cuts to America's military and to America's security.\nThe President has actually submitted a budget which will rebuild our military, restore the arsenal of democracy. And we will move in the next year one of the largest increases in defense spending since the days of President Ronald Reagan. (Applause.)\nAnd just next week, with President Trump's leadership, and the strong support of the members of Congress gathered here today, Congress will pass a spending bill with long-overdue investments in our military readiness even before this fiscal year ends. That's what leadership looks like.\nAt a time of mounting threats across the globe, President Trump has made it clear America's national security is this President's highest priority now and always. (Applause.)\nRest assured, President Trump will make the strongest fighting force in the world stronger still. For as history attests, when America is strong, the world is safe. And the USS Indiana will bear witness to this truth.\nIt really is deeply humbling for this son of Indiana to be here today at the christening of this mighty and majestic boat, the Virginia-class nuclear submarine, the USS Indiana. I have to tell you it's more than a little bit emotional to me to be standing here in Newport News, seeing the Indiana flag fluttering just below the American flag behind you all. It makes me feel like I'm back home.\nThis boat bears the name, I can promise you, of one of the most patriotic states in America. And I truly believe that she reflects the unmatchable courage and the unwavering spirit of those Hoosiers past and present who have stood up and stepped forward to defend the flame of freedom.\nFor generations, stretching back into the mists of American history, the sons and daughters of Indiana have donned the uniform to serve our nation, and they have done so with distinction and with courage.\nOur history books are filled with proof.\nIn the wake of World War Two, no less an authority than the United States Navy declared Indiana's representation in the Navy was \"extraordinary in quality,\" with three of the seven admirals in 1944 hailing from the Hoosier State. The 12 stars they had between them shone bright not just on the Wabash, but on waves all across the world.\nAnd the Navy's recognition of Indiana's service and sacrifice goes back even further.\nThe boat that sits beside me today is not the first to bear the name of USS Indiana, as we heard many times from this podium. Captain Zimbauer, you and the men and women who you will lead are the heirs of a long and proud tradition that reaches back to the 19th century.\nOne-hundred and twenty-six years ago, tomorrow, in 1891, the keel of the first USS Indiana was laid down in Philadelphia. Less than two years later, she steamed out of dry dock and into American history.\nIn the Spanish-American War, the USS Indiana joined the blockade of Santiago, where she helped sink two Spanish vessels and eliminated an entire fleet.\nThe second ship to bear the name was even more impressive. From 1939 to 1941, this very shipyard built and launched a second battleship emblazoned with USS Indiana on her seal.\nFrom the Solomon Islands to Iwo Jima, she served on the frontlines of freedom and helped establish the foundation of peace and prosperity that reins in the Asia Pacific to this very day.\nAnd I am humbled to say that these 14 members of that very crew are here with us today -- including I'm told two of her plank owners who were there at her commissioning -- Ozen Carrier and John Wright. Would you all mind giving a standing ovation one more time to the extraordinary crew of the USS Indiana and to those two plank holders who are with us today? (Applause.)\nMen, I never saw your ship in all her glory, but she still lives on in the hearts and minds of Hoosiers, more than just memory. I can tell you the teak planks from her main deck were actually made into a beautiful desk that every Indiana governor has sat behind since 1964, me included. It was always very humbling for me to come to work every day at the Indiana State House and rest my elbows on the deck of a battleship. (Laughter.)\nAnd now we turn the page to another chapter in the Hoosier history, and it will be just as proud. This USS Indiana -- the third to bear the name, and the first submarine -- is a worthy inheritor of the name and legacy of our state. And already she bears the mark of Indiana -- not just in her name, but from bow to stern.\nMore than 100 Hoosier businesses have contributed to this boat's creation in one way or another. At least two members of her crew and four of her shipbuilders hail from our great state, and so many of volunteers for the commissioning committee call Indiana home. Would you mind giving all the Hoosiers who are here a big, big round of applause, especially those two on the crew? (Applause.)\nI am personally grateful to everyone who has lent their talent, their time, and their treasure to the USS Indiana, and I know that President Trump is thankful as well.\nThis submarine is the most advanced to ever serve America. The steel within her skeleton -- all 7,600 tons -- and the steel in the hearts of her crew form the unbreakable, unshakeable backbone of American freedom.\nWhen the USS Indiana goes to sea in just a few short weeks, she'll give witness to our country's strength of will and to our strength of arms. And as her sailors begin to fulfill their duty, they'll do so, as the saying goes, \"not for self, but for country\" -- proving through their service and their sacrifice that those that stand before us in those emblazoned white uniforms, they are from the rest of us -- but they are the best of us. (Applause.)\nWe know they're ready. We pray that they never feel the heat of battle. But we're grateful that the USS Indiana will be ready, will be there beneath the waves, the hidden chariot of the \"Silent Victors,\" faithfully guarding our freedom, faithfully guarding our way of life.\nAnd so, on behalf of the Commander-in-Chief, President Donald Trump, we christen the USS Indiana. Today this humbled son of Indiana is truly grateful to have the opportunity to be with you today to see my beloved state and all of her people so aptly embodied in this extraordinary boat.\nFrom this day forward, the spirit and the service of the Hoosier State will find a home on the seven seas in this majestic and mighty submarine, and in the proud crew who walk her decks. And only a few short months from now, when she completes her maiden voyage, the world will take note. For the USS Indiana signifies the enduring strength and leadership of the United States, a beacon of freedom in these stormy and uncertain times.\nKnow today that under President Donald Trump that beacon will shine bright, brighter than ever before. And with this President's leadership, the United States I believe is entering a new era of security, prosperity, and strength.\nAnd so I close with a word of confidence that with your help, with God's help, with the USS Indiana at sea, and the great Armed Forces of the United States of America, and the valor and vigilance of all those who serve, that today we go forth to meet a glorious future together.\nMay God bless and protect the USS Indiana and all who serve aboard her every day beneath our seven seas. My God bless Indiana and may God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)", "timestamp": "2017-04-29", "title": "Remarks by the Vice President at the Christening of the U.S.S.

Thank you, everybody, very much. I appreciate you being here today. Great people outside, you can see that. These are great, great Americans and unbelievable workers. Nobody has better than what we have.\nAnd it's wonderful to be at Ames, an incredible company with a rich, rich history and a long history. Centuries ago, before our country was even founded—you can believe that one—this company produced the tools that helped to build our Nation. Later, Ames Tools would be used at the Statue of Liberty, the Empire State Building, the Hoover Dam, just to name a few of the monuments within our country.\nWe believe in \"Made in the U.S.A.,\" and it's coming back stronger and better and faster than even I thought. You can see that by our great, great workers throughout the plant and plenty of other plants. But for a long time, our Government has sacrificed American companies and workers to unfair foreign competition.\nToday I'm signing two orders to help keep jobs and wealth in our country. First, in fulfillment of a very, very important and major campaign promise I made not far from here last June, I'm directing the Secretary of Commerce, who's with us—Wilbur, where's Wilbur?\nSecretary of Commerce Wilbur L. Ross, Jr. Right here, Mr. President. [Laughter]\nThe President. Wilbur, a legend—to identify every violation and abuse of our trade agreements and to use every available measure under the law to end these abuses against our workers and our companies. And if they don't get cleared up, Wilbur will end the trade agreement. Do you agree with that?\nSecretary Ross. Yes, sir.\nThe President. Second, I'm establishing the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy within the White House. Its mission will be to defend American workers and companies from those who would steal our jobs and threaten our manufacturing base. [Applause] Thank you. Peter Navarro, one of the greats trying to protect our jobs. Right, Peter?\nDirector of the National Trade Council Peter Navarro. I'm honored, sir.\nThe President. Thank you, Peter. Appreciate it.\nWe're only 100 days in. It's been a lot of work, but we've loved it. We've loved doing it. You know, when you love something, it's really easy. And we love it. And we're helping people. We're helping our workers. And already, we've created nearly 150,000 new manufacturing and construction jobs, and over 600,000 jobs have already been created. The National Manufacturers' survey found the highest level of optimism in the history of a very, very old survey. It's been around for a long time. It just last week hit the highest point it's ever hit in the history of the survey. That means they're looking for action. And we love that.\nWe've taken unprecedented action to bring back American jobs, American wealth, and American dreams. And we are just getting started. So I want to thank everybody. Thank you.\nSo this is addressing trade agreement violations and abuses. Very powerful. [At this point, cheering could be heard in a different area, off camera.]\nThey're shouting back there because they know exactly what I'm saying. [Laughter] They know better than anybody else, believe me.\n[The President signed an Executive order titled \"Addressing Trade Agreement Violations and Abuses.\"]\nAnd this is the establishment of the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy right out of the White House. And it's going to have a huge impact on jobs.\n[The President signed an Executive order titled \"Establishment of Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy.\"]\nSo, Wilbur, with your permission, I think what I'm going to do is give this pen to Peter Navarro. Is that okay?\nSecretary Ross. Sure. Surely, sir.\nThe President. Peter, come on over here. Peter Navarro has fought against trade abuse for a long time. And, Peter, this is the first time you're seeing something happen, all those decades you've been fighting.\nDirector Navarro. It's been a great a hundred days, and we've got lots more to go.\nThe President. Thank you, Peter. Great job.

Policy. Every trade agreement and investment agreement entered into by the United States, and all trade relations and trade preference programs of the United States, should enhance our economic growth, contribute favorably to our balance of trade, and strengthen the American manufacturing base. Many United States free trade agreements, investment agreements, and trade relations have failed, in whole or in part, to meet these criteria. The result has been large and persistent trade deficits, a lack of reciprocal treatment of American goods and investment, the offshoring of factories and jobs, the loss of American intellectual property and reduced technological innovation, downward pressure on wage and income growth, and an impaired tax base. It is the policy of the United States to negotiate new trade agreements, investment agreements, and trade relations that benefit American workers and domestic manufacturers, farmers, and ranchers; protect our intellectual property; and encourage domestic research and development. It is also the policy of the United States to renegotiate or terminate any existing trade agreement, investment agreement, or trade relation that, on net, harms the United States economy, United States businesses, United States intellectual property rights and innovation rate, or the American people.\nSec. 2. Conduct Performance Reviews. The Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative (USTR), in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General, and the Director of the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, shall conduct comprehensive performance reviews of:\n(a) all bilateral, plurilateral, and multilateral trade agreements and investment agreements to which the United States is a party; and\n(b) all trade relations with countries governed by the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO) with which the United States does not have free trade agreements but with which the United States runs significant trade deficits in goods.\nSec. 3. Report of Violations and Abuses. (a) Each performance review shall be submitted to the President by the Secretary of Commerce and the USTR within 180 days of the date of this order and shall identify:\n(i) those violations or abuses of any United States trade agreement, investment agreement, WTO rule governing any trade relation under the WTO, or trade preference program that are harming American workers or domestic manufacturers, farmers, or ranchers; harming our intellectual property rights; reducing our rate of innovation; or impairing domestic research and development;\n(ii) unfair treatment by trade and investment partners that is harming American workers or domestic manufacturers, farmers, or ranchers; harming our intellectual property rights; reducing our rate of innovation; or impairing domestic research and development; (iii) instances where a trade agreement, investment agreement, trade relation, or trade preference program has failed with regard to such factors as predicted new jobs created, favorable effects on the trade balance, expanded market access, lowered trade barriers, or increased United States exports; and\n(iv) lawful and appropriate actions to remedy or correct deficiencies identified pursuant to subsections (a)(i) through (a)(iii) of this section.\n(b) The findings of the performance reviews required by this order shall help guide United States trade policy and trade negotiations.\nSec. 4. Remedy of Trade Violations and Abuses. The Secretary of Commerce, the USTR, and other heads of executive departments and agencies, as appropriate, shall take every appropriate and lawful action to address violations of trade law, abuses of trade law, or instances of unfair treatment.\nSec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nDONALD J.

Thank you.\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nThe President. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, it is truly great to be back in the wonderful, beautiful State of Pennsylvania. I love this State, and I love the people of this State. It's special, and it carried us through a big, beautiful victory on November 8.\nI want to recognize some of our friends that have helped us so much. Congressman Scott Perry. G.T. Thompson. A couple of my originals, Mike Kelly—who I watched on television. He was great. Where's Mike Kelly? Where is Mike Kelly? He's here someplace. Where is he? Boy, were you great on television this morning. [Laughter] And, of course, one of our other originals, Congressman Tom Marino. Right? Thank you. Thank you, Mike. Thank you, Tom.\nAs you may know, there's another big gathering taking place tonight in Washington, DC. Did you hear about it?\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. A large group of Hollywood actors——\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. —— and Washington media——\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. ——are consoling each other in a hotel ballroom in our Nation's Capital right now. [Laughter] They are gathered together for the White House Correspondents' Dinner without the President. And I could not possibly be more thrilled than to be more than 100 miles away from Washington swamp, spending my evening with all of you, and with a much, much larger crowd and much better people. Right? Right?\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nThe President. And look at the media back there. They would actually rather be here, I have to tell you.\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. That's right.\nAudience members. CNN sucks! CNN sucks! CNN sucks!\nThe President. Media outlets like CNN and MSNBC are fake news. Fake news. And they're sitting and they're wishing in Washington—they're watching right now, they're watching. And they would love to be with us right here tonight.\nBut they're trapped at the dinner, which will be very, very boring. [Laughter] But next year, maybe we'll make it more exciting for them in Washington, and we'll show up. But we have a good chance of showing up here again next year too. The truth is, there is no place I'd rather be than right here in Pennsylvania to celebrate our 100-day milestone, to reflect on an incredible journey together, and to get ready for the great, great battles to come, and that we will win in every case, okay? We will win. Because make no mistake, we are just beginning in our fight to make America great again.\nNow, before we talk about my first 100 days, which has been very exciting and very productive, let's rate the media's 100 days. Should we do that?\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. Should we do it? Because, as you know, they are a disgrace. [Laughter] According to a Morning Consult poll, more than half of Americans say the media \"is out of touch with everyday Americans.\" And they've proven that. According to Media Research Center, 89 percent of the media's coverage of our administration has been negative—and purposely negative.\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. And perhaps that's because, according to the Center for Public Integrity, 96 percent of journalists who made donations in the last election, gave them to our opponent. Does anybody remember who our opponent was? Huh?\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. That was some opponent. Finally, according to a poll last year from the Associated Press, only 6 percent of Americans have a lot of confidence in America. That's very bad. That's much lower than Congress, by the way.\nBut I'll give you an example of something really incredible.\n[At this point, there was a disruption in the audience.]\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. That's right, get them out of here. Get them out.\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nThe President. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\nDo we love our law enforcement, or what?\nAnd I want to thank the fire marshals. They have a lot of people standing outside. We really maxed out. We broke the alltime record for this arena. How old is this arena? This is not a—we broke the alltime record. And I don't have a guitar, which is pretty tough.\nSo just as an example of media, take the totally failing New York Times.\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. Pretty soon they'll only be on the internet. The paper is getting smaller and smaller. You haven't noticed? It's starting to look like a comic book, it's getting—[laughter]. But I will tell you, because I watched, and I used to be in the real estate business. They sold their beautiful New York Times building in Manhattan—a cathedral to journalism, such a beautiful, beautiful building—for around $130 million. And a group that bought it later sold it for approximately $500 million. And now they live in a very ugly office building in a crummy location. [Laughter] Next, they buy the Boston Globe newspaper, with losses, for $1.3 billion, invest millions and millions and millions of dollars to get it going. And in the end, they sell it for zero; they give it away. And then, they write nasty editorials and op-eds telling me how I should be handling world events and our country. Tell me.\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. But that's what we have. They're incompetent, dishonest people, who, after an election, had to apologize, because they covered it, us, me, but all of us—they covered it so badly that they felt they were forced to apologize, because their predictions were so bad. You remember their predictions? They lost a lot of people because of the way they covered.\nSo here's the story. If the media's job is to be honest and tell the truth, then I think we would all agree the media deserves a very, very, big fat failing grade.\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. Very dishonest people. And not all of them. You know, we call it the \"fake news.\" Not all of them. You notice now, they're using—everybody is using the word fake news. Where did you hear it first, folks? By contrast, for the last 100 days, my administration has been delivering every single day for the great citizens of our country. Whether it's putting our coal miners back to work, protecting America's steel and aluminum workers—we love that steel and aluminum—or eliminating job-killing regulations, we are keeping one promise after another. And frankly, the people are really happy about it. They see what's happening.\nBut to understand the historic progress that we've made, we must speak honestly about the situation that we and I inherited. Because believe me, the previous administration gave us a mess.\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. For decades, our country has lived through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. You people know it better than anybody, in Pennsylvania. Our factories were shuttered, our steel mills closed down, and our jobs were stolen away and shipped far away to other countries, some of which you've never even heard of. Politicians sent troops to protect the borders of foreign nations, but left America's borders wide open for all to violate.\nWe've spent billions and billions of dollars on one global project after another, and yet, as gangs flooded into our country, we couldn't even provide safety for our own people.\nOur Government rushed to join international agreements where the United States pays the costs and bears the burdens, while other countries get the benefit and pay nothing.\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. This includes deals like the one-sided Paris climate accord, where the United States pays billions of dollars, while China, Russia, and India have contributed and will contribute nothing.\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. Does that remind you of the Iran deal? How about that beauty, right?\nOn top of all of that, it's estimated that full compliance with the agreement could ultimately shrink America's GDP by $2.5 trillion over a 10-year period. That means factories and plants closing all over our country. Here we go again. Not with me, folks. Those are the facts, whether we like them or not. The dishonest media won't print them, won't report them, because the Washington media is part of the problem: their priorities are not my priorities and they're not your priorities, believe me. Their agenda is not your agenda. And I'll be making a big decision on the Paris accord over the next 2 weeks. And we will see what happens.\nBut they're all part of a broken system that has profited from this global theft and plunder of American wealth at the expense of the American worker. We are not going to let other countries take advantage of us anymore. Because, from now on, it's going to be America first.\nAnd I have to——\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nThe President. And I have to just interject, because, as you know, I've been a big critic of China, and I've been talking about currency manipulation for a long time. But I have to tell you that, during the election, number one, they stopped. But more importantly, just to show you the dishonesty—so we have currency manipulation by China, but China is helping us possibly, or probably, with the North Korean situation, okay? Which is a great thing. Great thing.\nAnd I met with the President of China at great length in Florida, and we had long, long talks, hours and hours and hours. He's a good man. Now, he's representing China. He's not representing us. But he's a good man. And I believe he wants to get that situation taken care of. They have tremendous power, and we'll see what happens.\nBut the media said, Donald Trump refuses to name China a currency manipulator. Now, think of this, think of this. Right? Now, we have to have a little flexibility. So I meet with the President of China, and I say, could you help us out with North Korea? You know, you give them 93 percent of their different materials that they need and their food and—you have a lot of power. We have a great relationship. And then the media said, why didn't he call Donald Trump, and why didn't Donald Trump, at a meeting, say you're a currency manipulator?\nSo here's the story. \"Listen, Mr. President, will you help us out with North Korea? But by the way, you're manipulating your currency.\" It doesn't work, right? [Laughter] So instead of—you understand. So instead of saying that, let's see what happens. I honestly believe that he's trying very hard. Not an easy situation for China, believe me. Not an easy situation. But we have somebody there who's causing a lot of trouble for the world. We have China, who is really trying to help us. You've seen—they've sent back vast amounts of coal coming out of North Korea. So let's see what happens. And I think it's not exactly the right time to call China a currency manipulator right now. Do we agree with that? But they never say that. They say, why didn't he do it.\nSo I promised you in my Inaugural Address, 100 days ago, that now arrives the hour of action. And we've, believe me, started from day one. And that is what we've delivered: 100 days of action. In fact, those people and others are exhausted. They've never seen anything like that. They've never seen anything like this.\nWe are ending the offshoring and bringing back our beautiful, wonderful, great American jobs. We are eradicating the criminal gangs and cartels that have infiltrated our country. You're reading about them all the time. Some of you have big problems with them. Thank you for that sign: \"Blacks for Trump.\" I love that guy. \"Blacks for Trump.\" Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, man. That's great. That's really cool. I appreciate it. And we're taking steps to renegotiate or cancel any agreement that fails to protect American interests. Here are just some of our great achievements from the first 100 days. And I will tell you, in addition to that, we have built such strong foundations with the leaders of foreign countries. And we're set to rock. But we have great relationships with Germany and Japan and China and so many others, the U.K. Such great relationships. That's part of the process.\nWe've appointed and confirmed a brand new Justice of the United States Supreme Court, Justice Neil Gorsuch, who will uphold the Constitution and the right of Americans to govern their own affairs. And the last time a new Supreme Court Justice was confirmed in the first 100 days was 136 years ago, in 1881. And I was devastated to hear that, because I thought I'd be the only to have done that. [Laughter] A long time ago.\nTo protect our jobs and our economic freedom, I immediately withdrew the United States from the horrible, disastrous, would have been another NAFTA but worse, Trans-Pacific Partnership. That would have taken your jobs in Pennsylvania—that I can tell you. That was a total hoax. The TPP would have been a tremendous disaster for our country, and we are not going to surrender Pennsylvania jobs ever again. We've done that once before. It's not going to happen.\nWe've just launched an investigation into foreign steel dumping and aluminum dumping throughout our country. We are reviewing every single trade deal, and wherever there is cheating, we will take immediate action and there will be penalties. And we have with us tonight, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, and one of the great, great people on fair trade and good trade, Mr. Peter Navarro. Thank you. Thank you.\nAnd we will renegotiate NAFTA. And if we don't get a good deal and a fair deal for our country—and I've been saying for a long time, we'll either renegotiate or we'll terminate. I announced the other day, we were going to terminate. Everybody said we'll terminate. Two people that I like very much—the President of Mexico, Prime Minister of Canada—they called up. They said, could we negotiate? I said, yes, we can renegotiate. So we'll start a renegotiation, and hopefully, it will be fair for everybody. And if it's not a fair deal for our country—because you have to understand, we have been on the wrong side of the NAFTA deal with Canada and with Mexico for many, many years, many decades. We can't allow it to happen. So we're going to renegotiate. And if we can't make a fair deal for our companies and our workers, we will terminate NAFTA, okay?\nOur directives will put brand new Pennsylvania steel into the spine of America. We've ordered billions and billions of dollars in unpaid duties to be collected at the border from countries that break the rules. And that just started. It's going to be a lot coming in. We just want fairness. And I've followed through on my promise and issued a new Government directive to buy American and hire American.\nIn just these first few months, we've created 99,000 new construction jobs, 49,000 new manufacturing jobs, and 27,000 new mining jobs. Who are the miners here? The miners—finally, we're taking care of our miners. We love our miners. And we have over 600,000 new jobs. And, by the way, the stock market, since our election, is through the roof. I believe, from the point of the election, isn't it too bad that the Obama administration gets a lot of credit for those couple of months, but——\nAudience members. Boo! The President. It's all right. Because we're doing fine, but they get credit for that because people started going wild with the stock. But I believe we have a record, from the time we got elected—from November 8—we have a record, an alltime record, for the biggest increase in the stock market. So I'm very happy about that.\nWe've removed the shackles on energy exploration imposed by the last administration, lifting the restrictions on the production of oil, shale, and natural gas. And, very importantly for Pennsylvania, we have ended the war on beautiful, clean coal, and we are putting our great coal miners back to work. We love our miners.\nI am also very pleased to say that we have finally cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines—48,000 new jobs. They couldn't get their approvals. We got them their approvals in 24 hours—1 day. And I want to tell you, the heads of those two companies, they didn't know what the hell happened. They said, how did this happen? They should go to bed and say their prayers. But that's going to be approximately 48,000 jobs.\nMy administration has also scrapped a job-killing regulation that was threatening our auto workers. We want more cars made in the U.S.A. And that's going to happen. We've created a new rule which requires that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated.\nAnd we have signed massive Executive orders, clearing up the environmental bureaucracy. We're going to have jobs, and you're seeing them already. We've also been very busy on the legislative front, which we have gotten no credit for, and yet I am signing away. I've signed 29 new bills—a record not surpassed since the Truman administration. This includes 13 resolutions to eliminate intrusive Federal regulations—the most ever signed in our history.\nIn keeping our promise to our veterans, I've signed legislation to extend Veterans Choice. And David, the head of the Veterans Administration, is here with us tonight. David Shulkin. He's done an incredible job. And we've increased by, 42 percent, the approval for veterans using the Choice program. I've also created an Office of Accountability at the VA. Our message to Federal workers is clear: If you fail our veterans, you will be held accountable. First time.\nTo create accountability across Government, I've issued a 5-year ban on Federal officials becoming lobbyists after they leave Government service. Good? I've got a lot of people in my staff who are not exactly happy with that one, but that's okay. And I've issued a lifetime ban on Federal officials becoming lobbyists for a foreign government. I've imposed these bans for a simple reason: It is time to drain the swamp. And that's what we're doing in Washington, DC.\nPerhaps in no area have past Governments sold out special interests and foreign lobbyists more than on the issue of immigration. Year after year, you pleaded for Washington to enforce our laws as illegal immigration surged, refugees flooded in, and lax vetting threatened your family's safety and security.\nYour pleas have finally been——\nAudience member. Build the wall!\nThe President. Oh, don't worry, we're going to have the wall. Don't worry about it.\nAudience members. Build that wall! Build that wall! Build that wall! The President. You know, we've done so well at the border, a lot of people are saying, oh, wow, maybe the President doesn't need the wall. We need the wall to stop the drugs and the human trafficking. We need the wall.\nIn just 100 days, we have taken historic steps to secure our border, impose needed immigration control like you've never seen before—is that true?—and properly screen and vet those seeking admission into our country. They are going to come in because they love our country. We're not taking them otherwise.\nWe are operating on a very simple principle: that our immigration system should put the needs of American workers, American families, American companies, and American citizens first. I appointed a great military general, John Kelly, to lead the Department of Homeland Security.\nSince my election, we've already achieved an unprecedented 73 percent reduction in illegal crossings on our southern border; the greatest reduction in the history of our country. And we just started.\nThe world is getting the message: If you try to illegally enter the United States, you will be caught, detained, deported, or put in prison, and it will happen.\nAs I campaigned across the Nation, I met with the grieving mothers and fathers of children who had been killed—viciously killed, violently killed—by illegal immigrants. And I made them a promise: We will protect American lives. Your family member will not have died in vain.\nLast week, we opened an office to support the victims of immigration crime, called VOICE, to make sure that no American victim is ever again ignored by their Government. Not going to happen anymore. And many people are now talking, as I just said, and using this tremendous early progress on the border to say we don't need the kind of safety that we really do need, including the wall. We need safety. We need cameras. We need all of the things that we're going to be putting in, and we need the wall. And we will build a wall as sure as you are standing there tonight. We need the wall.\nAudience members. Build that wall! Build that wall! Build that wall!\nThe President. We'll build the wall, folks. Don't even worry about it. Go to sleep. Go home, go to sleep. Rest assured. That's the final thing—we need it. We need it. And if the Democrats knew what the hell they were doing, they'd approve it so easy, because we want to stop crime in our country. Obviously, they don't mind illegals coming in. They don't mind drugs pouring in. They don't mind——\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. ——excuse me, MS-13 coming in. We're getting them all out of here.\nMembers of Congress who will be voting on border security have a simple choice. They can either vote to help drug cartels and criminal aliens trying to enter the United States, like, frankly, the Democrats are doing. Or they can vote to help American citizens and American families be safe. That's the choice. Who do you want to represent you?\nUnfortunately, Democrats in Congress have no leadership. They're rudderless. Senator Schumer is a bad leader.\nAudience members. Boo! The President. I've known him a long time. Senator Schumer is a bad leader, not a natural leader at all. He works hard to study leadership. When you have to study leadership, you've got problems. [Laughter] And his policies are hurting innocent Americans and making it easier for drug dealers to enter our country. Schumer is weak on crime and wants to raise your taxes through the roof.\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. He is a poor leader—known him a long time—and he's leading the Democrats to doom. It's sad to see for our country what's happening to the Democrat Party.\nAt the heart of my administration's efforts to restore the rule of law has been a nationwide crackdown on criminal gangs. And that means taking the fight to the sanctuary cities that shield these dangerous criminals from removal.\nThe last, very weak administration allowed thousands and thousands of gang members to cross our borders and enter into our communities where they wreaked havoc on our citizens. As you know, the bloodthirsty cartel, known as MS-13, has infiltrated our schools, threatening innocent children. We've seen the horrible assaults and many killings all over Long Island, where I grew up. We have seen the vicious spread of transnational gangs into all 50 States and the human suffering they bring with them. I've been with the parents; I've seen the parents. It's devastation.\nA very respected general recently told me that MS-13 are the equivalent in their meanness to Al Qaida. My administration will not rest until we have dismantled these violent gangs, and we're doing it rapidly, and we're sending them the hell out of our country. We're sending them back home where they belong.\nOne by one, we're finding the illegal immigrant drug dealers, gang members, and killers, and removing them from our country. And once they are gone, folks—you see what we're doing—they will not let them back in. They're not coming back.\nIn this effort to restore safety to our country, we are going to strongly support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. I just signed an Executive order directing Attorney General Jeff Sessions to combat crimes of violence against our police, and the Department of Justice is now prioritizing the prosecution of criminals who attack officers of the law.\nAnd we are also working around the clock to keep our Nation safe from terrorism. My administration has taken historic steps to improve screening and vetting for those seeking visas to enter the United States. We have seen the attacks, from 9/11 to Boston to San Bernardino. We have seen the bloodshed overseas. You look at what's happening in other countries.\nWe already have enough problems to worry about in the United States, which we love so much. We don't need to be admitting people who want to oppress, hurt, or kill innocent Americans. They're not coming in.\nSo let me state this as clearly as I possibly can: We are going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country.\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nThe President. So I have a question for you. You've been to a lot of rallies, you've seen a lot of rallies. First of all, is there any place like a Trump rally? In all fairness. Right? So I did this a little bit during the rally. Haven't done it in a long time. Who has heard the poem called \"The Snake\"? So I have it. Does anybody want to hear it again?\nAudience members. Yes!\nThe President. You sure? Are you sure?\nAudience members. Yes!\nThe President. Okay. So let's dedicate this to General Kelly, the Border Patrol, and the ICE agents for doing such an incredible job. Right? This was written by Al Wilson a long time ago. And I thought of it having to do with our borders and people coming in. And we know that we're going to have—we're going to have problems. We have to very, very carefully vet. We have to be smart. We have to be vigilant.\nSo here it is, \"The Snake.\" It's called \"The Snake\":\nOn her way to work one morning, down the path along the lake,\nA tender-hearted woman saw a poor, half-frozen snake.\nHis pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew.\n\"Poor thing!\" she cried. \"I'll take you in, and I'll take care of you.\"\nThe border. [Laughter]\n\"Take me in, oh, tender woman. Take me in for heaven's sake.\nTake me in, oh, tender woman,\" sighed the vicious snake.\nShe wrapped him up all cozy in a comforter of silk,\nAnd laid him by her fireside with some honey and some milk.\nShe hurried home from work that night, and as soon as she arrived,\nShe found that pretty snake she'd taken in had been revived.\n\"Take me in, oh, tender woman. Take me in for heaven's sake.\nTake me in, oh, tender woman,\" sighed that vicious snake.\nShe clutched him to her bosom, \"You're so beautiful,\" she cried.\n\"But if I hadn't brought you in by now, oh, heavens you would have died.\"\nShe stroked his pretty skin again and kissed him and held him tight.\nBut instead of saying, \"thank you,\" that snake gave her a vicious bite!\n\"Take me in, oh, tender woman. Take me in for heaven's sake.\nTake me in, oh, tender woman,\" sighed the vicious snake.\n\"I have saved you,\" cried the woman. \"And you've bitten me, heavens why?\nYou know your bite is poisonous, and now I'm going to die.\"\n\"Oh, shut up, silly woman,\" said the reptile with a grin.\n\"You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.\"\nDoes that explain it, folks? Does that explain it?\nKeeping America safe also means rebuilding our defenses. Under the leadership of General \"Mad Dog\" Mattis—[applause]—and he is doing great, he is doing great. And, by the way, he is the man that recommended General Kelly. I said, Mad Dog, you got to give me a great general for the border. He gave me a great general, General Kelly. We have begun the process of rebuilding our military and restoring full readiness.\nWe are also protecting taxpayer dollars. I've already saved more than $725 million on a simple order of F-35 planes. I got involved in the negotiation. And there's billions of dollars to be saved on that and many other things. We've also stepped up the fight against ISIS, and we will not stop until ISIS has been destroyed. At the same time, we've strengthened our friendships and alliances all around the world. For instance, we were very proud to quietly work with the Egyptian Government last week to ensure that an American citizen, a beautiful young woman named Aya, came home after being in an Egyptian prison for the past 3 years. She was going to be there for another 28 years. President Obama worked diligently for 3 years; didn't get them out. I met with President Elsisi, and it worked out quickly, and he was great. He was great about it. And not only did the court system in Egypt and President Elsisi let her out, but they let out her husband, and they let out a total of eight people that were innocent. And they're all back here right now. Now, they won't include that in the hundred days, but I'm very proud to have done it. And she's a happy, young woman, believe me. She's very happy.\nI said, \"How tough, Aya, was it in that prison?\" She said, you don't want to know. That was a tough prison.\nWe're also getting NATO countries to finally step up and contribute their fair share. They've begun to increase their contributions by billions of dollars, but we are not going to be satisfied until everyone pays what they owe. And I've been complaining about that for a long time. And it's a lot different now, but they still a lot of money.\nOver the last 8 years, America's average military and defense spending was double what all other NATO countries spent, combined. Not fair. As we work to get other countries to pay their fair share abroad, we will continue our rebuilding at home. We're rebuilding everything, including, by the way, our great military. We will have the finest military that we've ever had at any time in the history of our country.\nLast week, my economic team outlined one of the biggest tax cuts in American history, even bigger than that of Ronald Reagan. We are proposing major tax relief for the middle class and lowering the business tax from 35 percent all the way down to 15 percent. Now, you will see companies expand, companies come back into our country, companies not leave our country anymore because taxes and regulations are so onerous. You will see what happens.\nLet me also be very clear in saying that we are going to save Americans' health care and repeal and replace that disaster known as Obamacare, which is dying, dying, dying. Obamacare is dead anyway, folks. You know, they always like to compare—well, what about Obama—Obamacare is dead. It's gone. The increases were massive last year, they're going to be bigger this year, and the insurance companies are fleeing. One of the top people in the insurance industry said Obamacare is in a death spiral, there's nothing they can do.\nSo they can't compare something to it because it won't be there very long. Believe me—can't be there very long. It's not working. It's been a failure. Under Obamacare, we have seen double- and triple-digit hikes in premiums, and many Americans left with only a single insurer to choose from. And now, many of those insurers are fleeing also. You have places like the great State of Tennessee, where I left 2 weeks ago, where half of the State already has no insurance carrier. And many others.\nSo Obamacare is a catastrophe created exclusively by the Democrats in Congress. And they know it's no good. They know it's not working. And by the way, we're going to get something great. We're going to get the premiums down. We're going to get the deductibles way down. We're going to take care of every single need you're going to want to have taken care of. But it's not going to cost that kind of money. We're going to bring it down. You're going to see it. Premiums down. We will repeal and replace Obamacare. You watch. We're going to give Americans the freedom to purchase the health care plans they want, not the health care forced on them by the Government. And I'll be so angry at Congressman Kelly and Congressman Marino and all of our Congressmen in this room if we don't get that damn thing passed quickly. They'll get it done. We know them. They'll get it done.\nIn all things, we are returning power to the people where it belongs. We're going to defend the Second Amendment and your right to keep and bear arms. We are going to bring education local, and we are going to end Common Core. We are going to stop Federal overreach and defend the God-given rights of every American family.\nJust imagine what we could accomplish if we all started working together to rebuild this Nation, the Nation that we so dearly love. Our jobs will come back home, our dying factories will come roaring back to life. It will be a beautiful thing to watch. And this is what's going to happen in the United States of America, and it's going to happen soon. And it's actually already happening.\nCities small and large will see a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity. America's children will be taught to love their country and take pride in our great American flag. And other countries—and you see that happening—will finally treat America and our citizens with the respect that our country and our citizens deserve.\nIt's time for all of us to remember that we are one people with one great American destiny, and that whether we are Black or Brown or White, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots. And we all share the same glorious freedoms of our magnificent country. We are all made by the same Almighty God.\nAs long as we remember these truths, we will not fail. We will never fail. We are Americans, and the future belongs to us. The future belongs to all of you. So with hope in our souls and patriotism in our hearts, I say these words to you tonight, on 100 days of devotion, hard work, and love for our great country: Together, we will make America strong again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America prosper again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again!\nThank you. God bless you. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2017-04-29", "title": "Remarks at a \"Make America Great Again\" Rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania"}
