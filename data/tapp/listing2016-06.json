Bernie Sanders told a news conference on Wednesday he favors a nationwide ban on fracking and warned that it would be \"disastrous\" to let oil and gas companies use fracking to exploit oil and gas reserves along California's continental shelf.\nThe U.S. Department of the Interior on Friday released two reports that could clear the way for underwater ocean fracking. \"Make no mistake: this was a very bad decision by the federal government that will not be allowed to stand if I have anything to say about it,\" Sanders told a news conference here near Monterey Bay. \"Offshore fracking has the potential to pollute the ocean with toxic fluid, hurt the environment and harm our beautiful beaches. That risk to me is unacceptable.\"\nSanders is a co-sponsor of legislation in the U.S. Senate with Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon and California's Sen. Barbara Boxer to end the extraction of all fossil fuels on public lands, including in federal waters. If passed, the bill would stop the fracking approved by the administration last week.\nSanders favors a nationwide ban on hydraulic fracturing because it endangers water supplies and because burning fossil fuels emits greenhouse gases that cause climate change. Hillary Clinton, his rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, does not support a nationwide ban.\n\"Secretary Clinton in one way or another wants to quote unquote 'regulate' fracking. I think it is too late for regulating. I think fracking has got to be banned in America,\" Sanders said. He also noted that Clinton promoted the dangerous technology around the world when she was secretary of state.\nThe toxic chemicals used in fracking can cause cancer and birth defects. Both the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Academy of Sciences have shown clear evidence that fracking can lead to a contaminated water supply. The pollution from fracking causes nausea, nosebleeds, headaches and high rates of asthma and other respiratory illness.\nThe threat of Methane emissions from fracking also presents a profound danger to our climate. Methane traps more than 86 times the heat of carbon dioxide in the short term. A report published last week by Environment America found that \"newly fracked wells released 2.4 million metric tons of methane in 2014 — equivalent to the annual greenhouse gas emissions of 22 coal-fired power plants.\"\nThe growing body of evidence finds that fracking is a huge danger to the water supply - a precious resource in the Golden State. It takes 160,000 gallons of clean water to frack just one well. With California in the midst of a five-year drought, it makes no sense to allow fracking in California.\nMonterey County voters will consider a local ballot initiative in November to ban fracking and all new oil drilling. Santa Cruz, San Benito and Mendocino counties already have banned fracking. Sanders' home state of Vermont was the first state in the nation to ban fracking in 2012.\n\"In my view, if we are serious about safe and clean drinking water; if we are serious about clean air; if we are serious about protecting the health of our children and families; and if we are serious about combatting climate change, we need to put an end to fracking all over this country,\" Sanders said.\nTo read Sanders' plan to stop the worst effects of climate change, click here.", "timestamp": "2016-06-01", "title": "Press Release - Offshore Fracking in California 'Disastrous,' Sanders Says'"}

Bernie Sanders on Wednesday applauded President Barack Obama's support for expanding Social Security by asking the \"wealthiest Americans to contribute a little bit more.\"\nSanders urged Hillary Clinton to back legislation endorsed by leading Democrats and seniors' advocates to strengthen the retirement program.\n\"I applaud President Obama for making it clear that it is time to expand Social Security benefits,\" Sanders said. \"Millions of seniors, disabled veterans and people with disabilities are falling further and further behind on $10,000 or $11,000 a year Social Security,\" he added.\nLegislation Sanders introduced in the U.S. Senate would expand Social Security benefits and extend the life of the program for 58 years. In a speech in Indiana, Obama suggested that the retirement system should be strengthened by making the wealthy pay more, a position the president first advocated during his 2008 White House campaign. Sanders' bill would lift the cap on taxable Social Security income and asking the very wealthy to pay more.\n\"Our legislation is supported by millions of senior citizens organizations,\" Sanders said, \"and I hope Secretary Clinton will come on board.\"\nSanders' proposal calls for making the wealthiest Americans who make more than $250,000 a year pay the same share of their income into the retirement system as everyone else. Current law now caps the amount of income subject to payroll taxes at $118,500.\nUnder Sanders' plan, a senior making less than $16,000 a year would see income go up by more than $1,300 a year.\nThe measure also would increase cost-of-living adjustments. This year, for only the third time in four decades, seniors on Social Security did not receive a cost-of-living increase. Sanders' legislation would increase COLAs by more accurately measuring the spending patterns of seniors. Under current law, the consumer price index used to calculate annual benefit adjustments does not accurately reflect how inflation in health care costs and prescription drug prices impact seniors.\nThe proposal to lift the cap would raise taxes only on the wealthiest 1.5 percent of Americans.\nAccording to the most recent estimates from the Social Security Administration, Sanders' plan would extend the solvency of Social Security until the year 2074.\nIn California, where Sanders was campaigning ahead of next Tuesday's presidential primary, more than 5.5 million seniors and disabled people receive Social Security benefits. The average benefit is less than $14,500 a year. Social Security lifted nearly 2 million Californians out of poverty in 2013. Without Social Security, more than 37 percent of California's seniors would be living in poverty. With Social Security, the senior poverty rate in California is less than 10 percent.", "timestamp": "2016-06-01", "title": "Press Release - Sanders Applauds Obama Support for Expanding Social Security"}

EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. It looks like you're all ready. It's been a while since I've walked back here and everybody was standing up.\nListen, I'll be brief at the top. I want to commend to your attention the excerpts that we released about an hour and a half ago. That should give you a good sense of the argument that the President is looking forward to making here in Elkhart. Obviously the backdrop of this speech is not just the broader political debate that's going on across the country today but, frankly, a political argument that's been going on across the country for the last couple of decades about the most effective way to strengthen our economy and about the most effective way to advocate for the middle class in Washington, D.C.\nSo the President is looking forward to making this argument and he is also looking forward to the opportunity that he'll have later today to interact directly with some Elkhart citizens and, hopefully, advance the discussion there, too.\nSo with that, why don't we just go straight to your questions.\nQ: So beyond talking about Elkhart, how much is he going to be specific about Donald Trump, the campaign, the differences between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, et cetera, et cetera?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, let me just observe that over the last couple of months there has been a tendency, understandably, that so much of the argument that the President is seeking to advance is portrayed as a contrast to the presumptive Republican nominee for President. And the thing that I would encourage you to do as you listen to the President's remarks today is to remember that the arguments that President Obama is seeking to advance and the arguments that have been made by Republicans both predate the presumptive Republican nominee's appearance on the national stage. Many of the things that you will hear the President describe in today's speech are similar to the themes that he included in his speech to the Democratic National Convention in 2004 and were a continuing theme through his presidential campaign in 2007 and 2008.\nSo I understand that there is a general election that will start soon, and it is certainly understandable that every political debate is viewed through the frame of that election. But some of the arguments are diluted if we don't appreciate the decades-long context in which they're taking place; that the arguments that Republicans have bene making -- and including Republicans up and down the ballot in 2016 -- are consistent with the kinds of arguments that Republicans have been making for decades. The same is true of the kind of argument that President Obama is seeking to advance as well.\nQ: But I guess I don't understand -- what's the point then? I mean, are you making -- what are you trying to get us to see by saying that? I mean, so okay, the arguments have been the same -- I mean, frankly, the arguments have been the same for decades no matter what President is in office. That doesn't mean that they're not part of -- or that he's not attempting to cast them in a new light, given the general election that's about to start. I guess I don't get it.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think it's relevant for a variety of reasons, one of which is that there certainly has been a concerted effort by -- well, let me just -- there certainly has been a concerted effort by some Republicans to try to differentiate themselves from the presumptive Republican nominee. So certainly what you just observed would raise some questions about whether or not that's an accurate thing to do.\nBut let me also say that the reason that it's particularly important is the reason that we're having this conversation in Elkhart. If we want to acknowledge the progress that our country has made in the last seven years, then we have to go back and look to examine what policies made this progress possible. And we have to have an honest debate about that because this is not the last time that a President and a Congress will be faced with some consequential decisions about how best to advance our economy.\nAnd so if we acknowledge and recognize that we've made progress in the last seven years -- and no community in the country is a better illustration of that than Elkhart -- then we should take a look at what policies made that progress possible. And that's why it's important to not allow the debate to be reduced to what, admittedly, is a significant election. But it's important for us to recognize the broader historical context, because that's the kind of debate that we believe the country should be having.\nQ: Is the President frustrated with the current debate as it's been playing out during the election?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I haven't heard him evince that frustration. And I think, primarily, in fact, the President has actually made I think the opposite argument, which is that he's been pleased -- this is the argument the President made in his news conference in Japan -- the President has been pleased that even in the context of a vigorous Democratic Primary, and while the two candidates have significant stylistic differences, they're rooted in basically the same values. That there is a commitment to fighting for the middle class; that there is a commitment to making sure that Wall Street -- that taxpayers aren't on the hook for bailing out big banks for making risky bets on Wall Street; a commitment to expanding access to quality, affordable health insurance; a commitment to things like job training and education and ensuring that the next generation of American workers can compete and win in a 21st-century global economy. That the values on the Democratic side are remarkably similar, even in candidates that demonstrate some pretty different political styles. The same could not be said on the Republican side. I'll leave it at that.\nQ: Josh, Governor Pence is out with an editorial this morning in the local paper saying, basically, we've recovered in spite of the President's policies and basically look what Indiana and its people have been able to do despite onerous regulations and taxes and stuff. So how do you that this rebound that we're all excited about is the result of the President's policies and not in spite of them?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me -- I think there are a couple of things that we can point to, particularly in Elkhart, where this is resonant. One of the most difficult decisions that the President faced in the first several weeks that he was in office was to rescue the American auto industry. The community in Elkhart is reliant on the manufacturing sector, particularly as it relates to recreational vehicles.\nThe Elkhart manufacturing sector benefitted significantly from the decision that the President made to make a bet on American auto workers and on the American auto industry. That had a pronounced impact on the Elkhart economy, and that is a bet that paid off not just for auto workers, but for the broader economy and the industrial Midwest. Some economists have indicated that that decision saved about a million American jobs. The President promised at the time that the American auto industry would come back stronger than ever, and we saw that last year the American auto industry manufactured more cars and sold more cars than ever before. So I think that's one specific example.\nI think the other thing that we can all acknowledge is true is that if the economy in Elkhart had somehow gotten worse early in the President's tenure, that Republicans in Indiana would be blaming the President for the worsening economy. And now that the economy has improved significantly, they're not willing to give the President any credit. So that may be an indication that the political debate is not entirely on the level.\nBut look, I think the other thing that the people of Indiana have benefitted from -- and I'm prepared to give Governor Pence credit for this -- is the decision to expand Medicaid. Governor Pence did work with the Obama administration to extend Medicaid coverage to some 300,000 Hoosiers. That had a positive impact on the economy. It certainly had a positive impact on the finances of the state, and it made a difference in the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in Indiana. And that was only possible because of a law that President Obama signed into law, over the objection of Republicans, and the President's willingness to compromise with the Republican governor of Indiana to implement it effectively.\nSo the President will have quite a bit more to say on that line of argument in his speech. So I've touched on just a couple of I think relevant arguments to make here, but the President will have more to say on this.\nQ: Josh, you framed the argument as one about building on progress or reversing the progress that we've seen over the last eight years. But we've seen, even in the Democratic Primary, some real questions about whether that progress has been sort of broad-based enough, whether the middle class has benefitted. In Indiana, I think 80 percent of voters were still concerned about the economy in the Democratic Primary and more than a third wanted more liberal policies than what the President has talked about. Is there an element of his message today that's going to be targeted to Democrats, in particular, beyond the broader electorate?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, I think the President's speech is directed at Americans from both parties, and particularly those Americans that don't affiliate with a political party. I think the President would include himself in the category of Americans who believe that there is a lot more work that we need to do to strengthen our economy. And let's face it, there's a lot more that we would have done to strengthen our economy if Republicans hadn't opposed investments in infrastructure, raising the minimum wage, and further investments in research and development, and other things that we know are likely to contribute to the long-term strength of our economy.\nSo the President will have more to say about that as well. I think the thing that I would -- the only thing I would add is, one of the reasons the President believes it's important for him to engage in the debate about who the next President of the United States will be is that the strength of our economy will depend on the policies implemented by the next President and the next Congress.\nThe remarkable progress that our economy has made in the last seven years is important but fragile. That progress is reversible. And if we go back to tax cuts that are dedicated only to the wealthy, policies that are focused on benefitting the rich and expecting it to trickle down on everybody else, that will set back our economy and that will put at grave risk the progress that our economy has made over the last seven years. And it will be middle-class families that have to pay the tab, and the President is concerned about that.\nQ: Josh, just a minor fact-checking question. You guys have been calling this his first trip in 2009, but I remember him going to I think it was Maryland --\nQ: Williamsburg.\nQ: -- Or Williamsburg for the Democratic Caucus meeting. Wouldn't that have been his first trip, before that?\nMR. EARNEST: The President traveled to Williamsburg to visit with House Democrats, I believe, was the purpose of that trip. So that was the President's first trip outside of Washington. But in terms of the President's first trip to go and engage with citizens and go and spend time talking to people in a community, the President's trip to Elkhart was the first. So maybe we'd get a Pinocchio and a half on that one? (Laughter.)\nQ: I just remember being on the plane, so it surprised me when you guys said that.\nMR. EARNEST: I mean, you'll recall from that trip that the President got off the plane, went straight to a resort, spent time talking to House Democrats, got back on the plane and came back. So, yes, that was officially the President's first trip I guess outside of the Beltway, if you will. But in terms of the President making a trip to go and visit with people in their own community as President of the United States, Elkhart was the first community where he did that.\nQ: Senators Kaine and Murphy, both Democrats who support the Iran ideal, have introduced legislation that would extend sanctions against Iran past 2016, the idea being that there would still be a snapback in place if there was a violation of the Iran deal. I'm wondering if you can first say whether that kind of legislation is permissible under the Joint Plan of Action, and secondly, if the White House is supportive of their efforts.\nMR. EARNEST: Justin, I have to admit that I have not been briefed on the details of that legislation, so let me see if I can consult with one of my colleagues back at the White House who knows more about what they've proposed and see if we can get you a specific response.\nQ: Josh, I wanted to ask you about the baby that was born in New Jersey with Zika-related defects. How closely is the White House watching that situation? Does that signal a new level of alarm for you?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Josh, what I do know is that our public health experts at the CDC are in close touch with public health professionals in the state of New Jersey to monitor the situation. There still is more that we have to learn. My understanding about what's been made public thus far is that this is a child who was born with microcephaly. They are still working to determine the link between the potential that the mother had the Zika virus and this particular birth defect, so there's still some more work that needs to be done.\nBut what I will say is we need Congress to act on the funding that our public health professionals say that they need to protect the American people from the Zika virus. And it's unclear at this point whether or not it would have made a difference in this particular situation. But to the extent that it may remind people that we have a looming threat out there, then hopefully it will prompt Republicans to reconsider their approach thus far, which is to basically deny that there is a problem.\nRepublicans have suggested that somehow the government already has the resources that are necessary to deal with this. That's not what our public health professionals say. That's not what the governor of Louisiana said today when he wrote a letter to the congressional delegation from Louisiana, urging them to support funding for the Zika virus. It's also not what the Republican governor of Florida said, who basically called on the Obama administration to expedite every available resource to begin dealing with the Zika virus.\nSo it is clear that Republicans outside of Washington, D.C. recognize that there's more that should be done to support local efforts to fight Zika, and we hope that Republicans in Congress will finally get the message.\nQ: Can I follow on Rick Scott? You mentioned him -- he wrote a letter to the President today, basically outlining a list of demands that they sent the federal government earlier and say remain unfulfilled and are needed immediately to fight the Zika virus. Are those things that you're going to be able to address, using the diverted funds that you have already moved forward, or is your message to him, hey, we need Congress to pass more money to be able to deal with this?\nMR. EARNEST: Our message to Governor Scott is that in order to do everything that our public health professionals say we need to do to protect the American people and the people of Florida from the Zika virus, we need Congress to appropriate additional funds. So we certainly do intend to use the funds that we've reprogrammed to augment our highest priorities in fighting Zika, but there's a lot more that we could be doing.\nQ: But that's not his question. The question was specifically on that list of things that Scott wants and whether or not you'll be able to address some or all of those.\nMR. EARNEST: So I'd refer you to CDC in terms of what specific steps -- how they will use the money that we have available, and how that overlaps with what Governor Scott requested. What I'm confident in is that, while I certainly respect Governor Scott and his expertise in health care because I know that there's a lot there to consider, the President is relying on the advice of our public health professionals in terms of what is necessary to fight the Zika virus. And what they say is that there is more money that can be appropriated by Congress to do everything necessary to fight the Zika virus and protect the American people.\nQ: Josh, there's a report that came out Tuesday that I think a thousand migrants have died in the Mediterranean Sea since May 21st. The administration -- there was a big story in The New York Times about how you still remain far off-base for the 10,000 refugees that the President wants to admit by the end of the year. Is there anything that you're doing, in addition to the steps that you've already taken, to try to expedite the number of migrants coming into the U.S.?\nMR. EARNEST: The short answer to that is, yes. I know that the Department of Homeland Security has been working with our intelligence community and other relevant agencies to try to add bandwidth to the ongoing effort to process potential refugees. Now, the President has been very clear that he set a higher goal for a higher number of Syrian refugees to be admitted to the United States, but the President made clear that we needed to do that without taking any shortcuts on security.\nRefugees, after all, are subjected to more vetting and screening than anybody else that attempts to enter the United States. The President believes that we need to maintain that standard while also admitting more Syrians who have applied. That's why additional capacity is needed, and I know that the Department of Homeland Security and other relevant agencies have been working to expand the capacity that they have to process potential Syrian refugees.\nAs it relates to the situation in the Mediterranean, it's tragic. And this was a subject of some discussion when President Obama was in Germany last month meeting with some of our European allies. Obviously their countries are on the frontlines of this. There's an expertise that the Department of Homeland Security has that they can offer to European officials as they work to secure their borders and as they work to crack down on human traffickers. The United States has been supportive of the coordination underway between Turkey and the EU to deal with the flows of migrants.\nSo there's a lot of important work that's been done in Europe. The United States has been strongly supportive of our European allies as they've undertaken that effort to try to prevent further tragic loss of life.\nQ: Josh, can you tell us a little bit about the President's speech tomorrow in Colorado Springs? And does he plan to use it to reflect on the status of our military engagements overseas?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Josh, I'll see if I can get you a little more of a detailed preview tonight of what the President is planning to discuss. But, obviously, this will be the final time that the President will address one of our service academies as the Commander-in-Chief. And I think you can expect to hear the President reiterate his view that his highest professional honor was being the Commander-in-Chief of the greatest fighting force that the world has ever known.\nSo the President is looking forward to the opportunity that he has to address the graduates at the Air Force Academy. It will be an opportunity for him to talk to those graduates about the security challenges that are facing the United States and the important role that the next generation of American servicemen and women will face as they protect the country.\nQ: Can I ask you about the gorilla?\nMR. EARNEST: You may.\nQ: Does the White House --\nMR. EARNEST: Whoever had Mike Shear on the Bingo card -- (laughter) -- should collect their fee after the gaggle.\nQ: Does the White House have a view on the situation with the gorilla in the Cincinnati Zoo, and what happened, and what should happen, and whether there's anything that the federal government could do, I guess?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, it's --\nQ: Have you talked to the President about it? Has he commented on it? It's a much-commented-around-the-water-cooler kind of thing in the country.\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any official position that I can articulate from the White House on this matter. Obviously there are many people across the country that have their own personal opinion about what may have contributed to what I think can legitimately be described as a tragedy. What happened at the Cincinnati Zoo is sad, but it's not clear to me that there's any federal role. I think there are many people around the White House and around the country that have their own personal views on this, but nothing official that I have to convey.\nQ: You haven't heard the President comment on it?\nMR. EARNEST: I have not.\nQ: About the commencements -- the President's two commencements so far have been rather thoughtful, very personal, even feisty at times. Have you observed anything different from your point of view about his commencement speeches this year or his writing process for them that's been different than in past years?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I don't think so. I think the President has always viewed the opportunity to deliver a commencement address as a unique opportunity. And he's not constrained by a particular setting in terms of making an argument. And also a commencement ceremony is something that is naturally forward-looking, and the people who are attending are either graduates or loved ones of the graduates, who are feeling optimistic about the future and have aspirations about what they hope to accomplish in the future. And that typically provides a setting for the President to talk about how those graduates and our country can confront that future with optimism. And I think that has been the common theme throughout commencement addresses that the President has given since his first year in office. And I would expect you to hear the President reiterate some of that optimism in his speech tomorrow.\nBut I have not detected any difference, either in process or in content, when it comes to the commencement addresses that the President has given this year.\nQ: There was CDC data that was released yesterday that showed for the first time during the President's eight years in office the death rate in America has actually increased, and that was driven in large part by lethal drug overdoses. Is there concern that the opioid crisis and some of these other things are erasing the progress in health outcomes that you guys have seen through the Affordable Care Act, I think you would say, or that we've seen generally?\nMR. EARNEST: The short answer to that question is, yes, there is a concern that the rapid expansion of heroin addiction and overdoses is having a significantly negative impact on the health of the country. That's why one of the things that the President and other public health experts have indicated is that for so long opioid addiction and heroin addiction has been treated as a law enforcement matter and as a crime. And the point that our experts have made is that's only partially true; this is also a public health problem.\nAnd I think what we've now seen is a public health epidemic that is having a tangible impact on the lifespan of Americans in communities, large and small, all across the country. And I think that's the other notable characteristic of this proliferation of the opioid problem, is that this is not something that is affecting just one community or one specific demographic but rather is something that we're seeing have an impact on communities, large and small, and on Americans, young and old. And it's something that is worthy of our focused attention.\nAnd I'll just point out that we've seen a lot of lip service paid to this issue by Republicans, including in Republicans in Congress, but not a willingness on the part of Republicans in Congress to actually provide additional resources to begin dealing with this problem, to expand the number of public health professionals that could be dedicated to treatment, to expanding the number of beds that are available in treatment centers so that more Americans can get help with their addiction challenges.\nAnd so the President put forward a very specific plan -- more than a billion dollars in his budget that could be used to address this problem and would have a profound impact on the many lives that have been touched by this problem. But as you'll recall, Justin, Republicans refused to even have a hearing on the President's budget. For the first time in 40 years, that hearing was not granted by Republicans. And I think it's indicative of Republican approach that has fallen far short of what is necessary to deal with a problem that many Americans are struggling with.\nQ: Are there any lawmakers onboard?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't believe there are any lawmakers onboard, but there are some lawmakers who are planning to greet the President on arrival in Indiana, and we'll have those names for you when we get there.\nThanks, everybody.\nEND 1:49 P.M.

Welcome! Welcome to the White House as we award the 2016 National Medals for Museum and Library Service.\nI want to start by thanking Kathryn for that wonderful introduction and for her extraordinary leadership, as well as everyone from the Institute of Museum and Library Services. I know she gave out all the accolades before I came out, but I want to join in and thank everyone for their hard work, their continuous hard work, their dedication and their passion for this issue.\nAnd of course, I want to recognize our 10 incredible awardees and community members who have come here today from all across the country. You all are doing such inspiring, innovative and impactful work, and we are incredibly proud of everything you all have been doing. So enjoy this moment -- and don't be nervous. (Laughter.) I know it's hard to be in this room and hear that, but -- they're all like, yeah, yeah. (Laughter.) You can do it. You're going to make it up these stairs just fine. (Laughter.)\nAnd I have to tell you, as someone who lives in a museum and whose husband will soon be opening a library himself, as you all have heard, I've been thinking a lot about what you all do. And I've celebrated this event with you a number of times over the years, and altogether, since 2009, IMLS has recognized 80 museums and libraries in 32 states. And as we honor your accomplishments today during my family's last year in the White House, when we're just beginning to reflect back on our time here, I am struck by how important your work has been for so many of our efforts these past seven and a half years.\nAs I've said time and time again, when we first got to the White House, one of our goals was to make sure that we opened up the doors to this house as wide as possible to folks from all different backgrounds, particularly to young people who wouldn't normally have the chance to come into a space like this. And we've tried to showcase as many great American art forms and cultural legacies as possible, if you've been keeping up.\nOver the years, we've hosted performances and workshops on everything from Broadway musicals -- this room has been converted in so many ways. (Laughter.) We've had a Broadway stage here with kids and performers singing and dancing -- everything to jazz and country music, to spoken word poetry. Not just \"Hamilton.\" Yes, they performed right here -- (laughter) -- but other spoken-word artists as well.\nAnd the fact is that your work and the work of libraries and museums across the country has actually helped make so many of these events possible whether you understand how you've done that or not. Time and time again, it's our nation's libraries and museums who have sparked the imaginations and encouraged the interests of so many of our nation's most accomplished authors and performers. And I'm thinking of the great writers who basically took up residence in their library when they were growing up, or the great artists who were inspired by an amazing exhibit they saw when they were a kid.\nAnd this isn't just true for the kinds of folks who perform at the White House. We've heard this from so many people whose lives have been affected by a great book, or a powerful piece of art -- mine included -- that has transformed the way they see the world and the way they see themselves. That's how we know that in so many communities our libraries and museums don't just preserve and promote our cultural treasures, they also enrich and enlarge our lives. And that's really one of the most powerful things that you all do each and every day.\nThis year's incredible awardees are a testament to that truth. Just take the example of Lynn Meadows Discovery Center for Children in Gulfport, Mississippi. I understand that when local leaders and community members came together almost 20 years ago to create their state's very first children's museum, they were determined to directly engage every kid and family in the region. So they restored a vacant school building, and after they opened the exhibits, they also set up summer acting camps and music workshops and family cooking classes, and anything that would bring the community in.\nAnd when Hurricane Katrina washed away the entire first floor, they didn't get discouraged, because they knew that their community needed them more than ever. Instead, they rolled up their sleeves and they cleaned up the damage, and reopened, even more determined to carry out that mission. And if you want to know the kind of impact they're having on young people in their community, I just want you to consider the story of a young man who I just met briefly, Brandon Spann. Brandon, where are you? There you are, you're right before my very eyes. (Laughter.)\nThe handsome young Brandon first showed up to the Discovery Center as part of a summer Boys and Girls Club program. And he was a shy, I understand, sixth grader who wasn't that excited about school at the time. But then they got him on stage and everything changed. All of a sudden you couldn't help but notice Brandon, because he was a star in the theater. I wish you were performing today, but we're not going to force you to do that. (Laughter.) And then he turned that stardom into being a star in the classroom too.\nAnd last week, Brandon became the first member of his family to graduate from high school. Congratulations. (Applause.) And he's going to be the first member of his family to attend college as he pursues a degree in drama. (Applause.) I just love those stories. And there's a story like that with every one of these awardees. That's the kind of impact our museums can have, and that's the story of so many of our libraries as well.\nAnother one of today's awardees, the Brooklyn Public Library, is a perfect example. They're one of the largest library systems in America, with 60 branches, almost 4 million books and periodicals, and nearly 9 million guests last year alone. And they have hosted tens of thousands of public events to reach folks at local senior centers and homeless shelters, to provide literacy programs for new readers and young children, and to mobilize a network of 2,000 volunteers who provide everything from computer courses to citizenship classes.\nNow, some of us might not think of a library as a place to take a course on citizenship. But luckily, for a woman named Kim Best, someone else who I met -- very giggly -- Kim, right there -- (laughter) -- that's exactly how the Brooklyn library system worked for her. See, Kim's family arrived in this country from Guyana in 1981 -- the year I went to college -- but it took over 30 years for her to realize that even after her mother was naturalized, Kim wasn't a citizen herself.\nFortunately, Kim had grown up in the Brooklyn Public Library system, so as soon as she found out they offered classes, she signed right up. She spent weeks drilling the questions with her teacher and classmates, and last October, Kim became one of our newest Americans. And she is here with us today. (Applause.) Kim is also the mother of a 10-year-old son named Ibraheem, who wants to be an engineer when he grows up, I understand. And Kim knows that he can achieve that because -- these are her words, this is what she said -- she said, \"I know the library is here for him, just like it's always been there for me.\" Good stuff.\nDay after day, year after year, our nation's libraries and museums are here for our communities. And at the end of the day, you all don't measure your impact by the number of books on your shelves or pieces in your exhibits, but by the young people you inspire, the lives you transform, and the impact you have every single day on your communities.\nSo to all of our awardees here today, and to libraries and museums across the country, I again, and for the last time in this official role, I thank you all. I thank you all so very much for everything you do. I am proud of you all individually. I'm proud of the work that these institutions do in our country. And I can't wait to see everything else you continue to achieve in the years ahead. So don't get tired. (Laughter.) We need you working.\nSo with that, let's get to the awards. Thank you all so much, and God bless. (Applause.)", "timestamp": "2016-06-01", "title": "Remarks by the First Lady at the National Medal for Museum and Library Service Awards"}

Hello, everybody! Hello, hello, hello! Can everybody please give Kelly a big round of applause for the great introduction?\nOh, it is good to be back in Elkhart. Great to be back at Concord High School. Go Minutemen! I brought a couple of friends of with me: Your Senator, Joe Donnelly, is here; your mayor, Tim Neese, is here. I wanted to congratulate everyone graduating tomorrow. I just met a couple of the valedictorians, who seemed like outstanding young ladies. My older daughter Malia graduates next week. So if there are any parents here, I hope you can give me some pointers on how not to cry too much at the ceremony and embarrass her. [Laughter]\nAudience member. Carry some tissues!\nThe President. That's what I'm going to do! If you've got a chair, sit down. Relax. I'm going to—I've got some stuff to say here. I—[applause].\nYes, so I'm not going to talk about the fact that my daughter leaving me is just breaking my heart. I'm not here to talk about that. I'm here to talk about the economy.\nI don't know that—if you've noticed, but this is an election year. [Laughter] And it's a more colorful election season than most. It's been a little unusual.\nAudience member. One more term!\nThe President. No, I can't do that. [Laughter] The Constitution prohibits it, but more importantly, Michelle prohibits it. [Laughter]\nNow, one of the reasons we're told this has been an unusual election year is because people are anxious and uncertain about the economy. And our politics are a natural place to channel that frustration. So I wanted to come to the heartland, to the Midwest, back to close to my hometown to talk about that anxiety, that economic anxiety, and what I think it means. And what I've got to say really boils down to two points, although I'm going to take a long time making these two points. [Laughter]\nNumber one, America's economy is not just better than it was 8 years ago, it is the strongest, most durable economy in the world. That's point number one.\nPoint number two: We can make it even stronger and expand opportunity for even more people. But to do that, we have to be honest about what our real challenges are, and we've got to make some smart decisions going forward.\nNow, Elkhart is a good place to have this conversation, because some of you remember, this was the first city I visited as President. I had been in office just 3 weeks when I came here. We were just a few months into what turned out to be the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes. Our businesses were losing 800,000 jobs a month. Our auto industry was about to go under. Our families were losing their savings and their health insurance, and as Kelly pointed out, they were in danger of losing their homes. And Elkhart was hit harder than most. Unemployment here would peak at 19.6 percent. That means nearly one in five people here were out of work. And I told you then that I was going to have your back and we were going to work hard to bring this economy back. So what's happened since then? Unemployment in Elkhart has fallen to around 4 percent. At the peak of the crisis, nearly 1 in 10 homeowners in the State of Indiana were either behind on their mortgages or in foreclosure; today, it's 1 in 30. Back then, only 75 percent of your kids graduated from high school; tomorrow 90 percent of them will. The auto industry just had its best year ever. And the \"RV Capital of the World\" is doing its part. The industry is set to ship nearly 400,000 RVs this year, which will be an alltime record.\nSo that's progress. And it's thanks to you: to the hard work you put in and the sacrifices you made for your families and the way that you looked out for each other. But we also wouldn't have come this far, Elkhart would not have come this far, if we hadn't made a series of smart decisions—my administration, a cooperative Congress—decisions we made together early on in my administration.\nWe decided to help the auto industry to restructure, and we helped families refinance their homes.\nAudience member. Yes, you did!\nThe President. We decided to invest in job training so that folks who lost their jobs could retool. We decided to invest in things like high-tech manufacturing and clean energy and infrastructure so that entrepreneurs wouldn't just bring back the jobs that we had lost, but create new and better jobs, and folks who had lost work from the construction industry because the housing market had collapsed could go back to work rebuilding America.\nAnd we can see the results not just here in Elkhart, but across the Nation. By almost every economic measure, America is better off than when I came here at the beginning of my Presidency. That's the truth. [Applause] That's true. It's true. It's true. Over the past 6 years, our businesses have created more than 14 million new jobs. That's the longest stretch of consecutive private sector job growth in our history. We've seen the first sustained manufacturing growth since the 1990s. We cut unemployment in half, years before a lot of economists thought we could. We've cut the oil that we buy from foreign countries by more than half, doubled the clean energy that we produce. For the first time ever, more than 90 percent of the country has health insurance. So—[applause].\nIn fact, a poll that was out just last week says that two out of three Americans think their own family's financial situation is in pretty good shape. But we know a lot of people are still feeling stressed about their economic future. The pundits, they say one of the reasons the Republican Party has picked the candidate that it has——\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. No, no booing. We're voting, we're not booing.\nBut if you watch the talking heads on TV, they'll say, the reason that folks are angry is because nobody has paid enough attention to the plight of working Americans in communities like these. That's what they say.\nNow, look, I'm the first to admit my Presidency hasn't fixed everything. We've had setbacks. We've had false starts. We've, frankly, been stuck with a Congress recently that's opposed pretty much everything that we've tried to do. But I also know that I've spent every single day of my Presidency focused on what I can do to grow the middle class and increase jobs and boost wages and make sure every kid in America gets the same kind of opportunities Michelle and I did. I know that. I know that communities haven't been—communities like Elkhart haven't been forgotten in my White House. And the results prove that our focus has paid off. Elkhart proves it.\nNow, where we haven't finished the job, where folks have good reason to feel anxious, is addressing some of the longer term trends in the economy—that started long before I was elected—that make working families feel less secure. These are trends that have been happening for decades now and that we've got to do more to reverse. Let me be clear about what those are.\nDespite the drop in unemployment, wages are still growing too slowly, and that makes it harder to pay for college or save for retirement. Inequality is still too high. The gap between rich and poor is bigger now than it's been just about any time since the 1920s. The rise of global competition and automation of more and more jobs; the race of technology—all these trends have left many workers behind, and they've let a few at the top collect extraordinary wealth and influence like never before. And that kind of changes our politics. So all these trends make it easy for people to feel that somehow the system is rigged and that the American Dream is increasingly hard to reach for ordinary folks. And there are plenty of politicians that are preying on that frustration for headlines and for votes.\nNow, I am a politician for another 6 months or so, but I'm not running again.\nAudience members. Aww.\nThe President. Yes. [Laughter]\nAudience members. Four more years!\nThe President. Besides—no, look. Besides, while I may have won the State of Indiana just barely in 2008, I know I lost the vote in Elkhart. [Laughter] I definitely got whupped here in 2012. I know I don't poll all that well in this county. So I'm not here looking for votes.\nI am here because I care deeply, as a citizen, about making sure we sustain and build on all the work that communities like yours have done to bring America back over these last 7½ years. And I came here precisely because this county votes Republican. [Laughter] That's one of the reasons I came here. Because if the economy is really what's driving this election, then it's going to be voters like you that have to decide between two very different visions of what's going to help strengthen our middle class. You're going to have to make that decision.\nSo let me be as straight as I can be about the choice of economic policies that you are going to face. And I'm going to start with the story that not every Republican, but most Republican candidates up and down the ticket are telling. And it goes something like this—and I think this is pretty fair, and if you don't, then you can look it up. So their basic story is: America's working class, America's middle class—families like yours—have been victimized by a big, bloated Federal Government run by a bunch of left-wing elitists like me. And the Government is taking your hard-earned tax dollars, and it's giving them to freeloaders and welfare cheats. And we're strangling business with endless regulations. And this Federal Government is letting immigrants and foreigners steal whatever jobs Obamacare hasn't killed yet. [Laughter]\nAudience member. Don't believe it!\nThe President. No, no, look, I'm being serious here. I mean, that's the story that's been told. And I haven't turned on Fox News or listened to conservative talk radio yet today, but I've turned them on enough over these past 7½ years to know I'm not exaggerating in terms of their story. That's the story they tell. You can hear it from just about every Member of Congress on the other side of the aisle. And instead of telling you what they're for, they've defined their economic agenda by what they're against, and that's mainly being against me. And it's—and their basic message is antigovernment, anti-immigrant, antitrade, and, let's face it, it's antichange.\nAudience member. Come on now!\nThe President. And look, a lot of people believe it. And if what they were saying were true, I suppose it would make sense to run on a platform of just rolling back everything we've done over these past 7½ years, and happy days would be here again. [Laughter] If what they were saying was true, then just being against whatever it is that we've done might make sense. But what they're saying isn't true. And if we're going to fix what's really wrong with the economy, we've got to understand that.\nSo let me just do some quick myth busting. [Laughter] And I'm going to start with the biggest myth, which is that the Federal Government keeps growing and growing and growing and wasting your money and giving your tax dollars to people who don't deserve it.\nNow, here's the truth—you can look it up; these journalists here, they can do some fact checking—as a share of the economy, we spend less on domestic priorities outside of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid—we spend less than we did when Ronald Reagan was President. When President Reagan or George W. Bush held this job, our deficits got bigger. When Bill Clinton and I have held this job, deficits have gotten smaller. Our deficits have not grown these past 7½ years, we've actually cut the deficit by almost 75 percent.\nMoreover, there are fewer families on welfare than in the 1990s. Funding has been frozen for two decades. So there's not a whole bunch of giveaways going on right now. Aside from our obligation to care for the elderly and Americans with disabilities, the vast majority of people who get help from the Federal Government are families of all backgrounds who are working, striving to get back on their feet, striving to get back into the middle class. And sometimes, yes, their kids need temporary help from food stamps when mom and dad are between jobs. But look, these kids didn't cause the financial crisis. These kids aren't spending us into bankruptcy. They're not what's holding back the middle class. And by the way, neither is Obamacare.\nLet's look at the numbers. Again, I just want to—I'm just giving facts here. I will have some opinions later, but right now I'm just giving facts. [Laughter] I signed the Affordable Care Act into law over 6 years ago. Since then, our businesses have created jobs every single month. We did this while covering 20 million Americans who didn't have health insurance; ending discrimination against preexisting conditions for everybody, including those who had health insurance; dramatically—[applause]—and dramatically slowing the rate at which health care costs were going up.\nIn the decade before Obamacare, employer-based premiums grew by an average of 8 percent a year. That meant you were paying that much more every year for health insurance. Last year, they grew by 4 percent, half as fast as they were growing. That doesn't mean you're happy about the 4 percent, but it wasn't 8. [Laughter] Today, the average family's health insurance premium is $2,600 less than it would have been if premiums had kept on going up at the pace before Obamacare. And by the way, just for folks here in Indiana, last year, most Hoosiers who shopped around for Obamacare on healthcare.gov found plans that cost 75 bucks a month or less. For the millions of Americans who buy on healthcare.gov—they get tax credits to help them pay for it—the average price increase this year has been four bucks a month. It hasn't been a double-digit percentage hike. Four bucks a month.\nBut my bigger point is to bust this myth of crazy, liberal, Government spending. Government spending is not what is squeezing the middle class.\nMyth number two is the notion that my administration has killed jobs through overregulation. And back in the sixties and the seventies, Government was adding all kinds of regulations: rules protecting workers' rights, rules protecting the environment. And these regulations to improve public health and safety, they didn't crush the economic growth that took place back in the sixties and the seventies, and they're not crushing economic growth now.\nI've issued fewer regulations than my predecessor. I've issued fewer Executive orders than any two-term President since Ulysses S. Grant. That's a long time ago. The regulations that we have issued—rules to protect our air and our water, rules to keep families from getting cheated when buying a house or investing their savings—those rules have benefited our economy a lot more than they've cost. They've helped families, they've helped the middle class; they haven't hurt them.\nHere's myth number three: Other countries are killing us on trade. Now, it is true that a lot of supporters of trade deals in the past sometimes oversold all the good that it was going to do for the economy. The truth is, the benefits of trade are usually widely spread. It's one of the reasons why you can buy that big, flat-screen TV for a couple hundred bucks—[laughter]—and why the costs of a lot of basic necessities have gone down. Some parts of the economy, like the agricultural sector or the tech sector have really done well with trade. Some sectors and communities have been hurt by foreign competition.\nAnd what's also true is, sometimes the pain of a plant closing here in America is magnified when you know that other countries are cheating. They're keeping American goods out of their markets; they're unfairly subsidizing their businesses to undercut our businesses. And a lot of the worst violators, they don't even have trade deals with us at all.\nSo what—here's what we've done. Over the past 7 years, we've brought more trade cases against other countries for cheating than anybody else. Every case that's been decided, America has won. That's what we've done: making sure that we've got a level playing field.\nBut the truth is, trade has helped our country a lot more than it's hurt us. Exports helped lead us out of the recession. Companies that export pay workers higher wages than folks who don't export. And anybody who says that somehow shutting ourselves off from trade is going to bring jobs back, they're just not telling the truth.\nIn fact, most of the manufacturing jobs that we lost over the past decade, they weren't the result of trade deals. They were the result of technology and automation that lets businesses make more stuff with fewer workers. If you go into an auto plant these days, used to need several thousand workers, now they need a thousand workers to produce the same number of cars, just because there are robots and there are machines that have replaced a lot of the work. That's true in offices too, by the way. Think about bank tellers, the last time you dealt with one of those, because now you got ATM machines.\nSo we can't put technology back in a box any more than we can cut ourselves off from the global supply chain. All the RVs that are manufactured right here, I guarantee you, some of those parts came from someplace else. And then, we sell them back to other places—other parts of the world. And no matter how many tariffs we're threatening to slap on other countries' goods, no matter how many trade wars we start saying we're going to put in place, that's not going to help middle class families here. In fact, independent economists say a trade war would trigger another recession and cost millions of jobs. So when you hear somebody threatening to cut off trade and saying that that's standing up for American workers, that's just not true.\nHere's the fourth myth: that immigrants are taking all of our jobs. Now I want to look—let's look at the numbers. Right now the number of people trying to cross our border illegally is near its lowest level in 40 years. [Applause] It's near its lowest level in 40 years. It's lower than when I came into office—than it was before I came into office, it's lower than during Ronald Reagan's time. It's true that new immigrants sometimes compete for service and construction jobs. But they also start about 30 percent of all new businesses in America.\nAudience member. Yes!\nThe President. Everybody thinks that immigrants come here and then they're getting all this stuff from the government. Immigrants pay a lot more in taxes than they receive in services.\nBut most importantly, immigrants are not the main reason wages haven't gone up for middle class families. Those decisions are made in the boardrooms of companies where top CEOs are getting paid more than 300 times the income of the average worker. So deporting 11 million immigrants—not only is that a fantasy that would cost taxpayers billions of dollars and tear families apart and just, logistically, would be impossible. Even if it were possible, it wouldn't do anything to seriously help the middle class.\nAudience member. The Donald is crazy! [Laughter]\nThe President. Mixing—so, so—now, what would help is if we fixed our immigration system the way I've proposed so that everybody plays by the rules, so that we've got strong border security. But we also are making sure that families who have been here, like, 10 years, 20 years, that they're out of the shadows, they're paying taxes, they're going through a background check. That would grow our economy faster. That would shrink our deficits further. We just need a Congress that's willing to make it happen.\nAudience member. [Inaudible]\nThe President. We need a Congress that's willing to make it happen.\nSo look, the—here's my main point: The primary story that Republicans have been telling about the economy is not supported by the facts. It's just not. They repeat it a lot—[laughter]—but it's not supported by the facts. But they say it anyway. Now, why is that? It's because it has worked to get them votes, at least at the congressional level.\nBecause—and here, look, I'm just being blunt with you. By telling hard-working, middle class families that the reason they're getting squeezed is because of some moochers at the bottom of the income ladder, because of minorities or because of immigrants or because of public employees or because of feminists—[laughter]—or because of—because poor folks who aren't willing to work, they've been able to promote policies that protect powerful special interests and those who are at the very top of the economic pyramid. That's just the truth.\nI hope you don't mind me being blunt about this, but I've been listening to this stuff for a while now. [Laughter] And I'm concerned when I watch the direction of our politics. I mean, we have been hearing this story for decades: tales about welfare queens, talking about takers, talking about the \"47 percent.\" It's the story that is broadcast every day on some cable news stations, on right-wing radio, it's pumped into cars and bars and VFW halls all across America and right here in Elkhart.\nAnd if you're hearing that story all the time, you start believing it. It's no wonder people think big Government is the problem. No wonder public support for unions is so low. No wonder that people think that the deficit has gone up under my Presidency when it's actually gone down. No wonder that—they did a survey, a lot of White Americans think reverse discrimination is as big a problem as discrimination against minorities, even though Black unemployment is twice as high as White unemployment. And the typical Hispanic woman makes 55 cents for every dollar a White man earns, and there are only a handful of women running Fortune 500 companies.\nBut that's the story that's been told. And I'm here to say, Elkhart, 7½ years since I first came here, we've got to challenge the assumptions behind this economic story. And the reason is, it has ended up dividing Americans who actually have common economic interests and should be working together for a better deal from the people who serve them. And it's made people cynical about government, and it's kept working families from pushing our political system to actually address our economic challenges in a realistic way. Families of all races and all backgrounds deserve higher wages. Families of all races and all backgrounds deserve quality health care and decent retirement savings. Every child in this country deserves an education that lets them dream bigger than the circumstances in which they're born.\nAudience member. We love you, Obama!\nThe President. You know, look, look—[laughter]. In today's economy, we can't put up walls around America. We're not going to round up 11 million people. We're not going to put technology back in the box. We're not going to rip away hard-earned rights of women and minorities and Americans with disabilities so that they're able to more fairly and fully participate in the workplace. These are permanent fixtures in our economy. And rolling them back will not help folks in Elkhart or anyplace else.\nAnd if we're going to transform our politics so that they're actually responsive to working families and are actually growing the middle class, then we've got to stop pitting working Americans against each other. We're going to have to come together and choose a vision of America where everybody gets a fair shot and everybody does their fair share and everybody plays by the same set of rules. And that's the vision that made progress possible over these last 7 years. And that's what's going to lead us forward now.\nNow, this isn't a State of the Union Address; I already gave my last one. [Laughter] But in the time remaining, I do want to offer some suggestions that I think would actually help give everybody who works hard a fair shot at opportunity and security in today's economy. Yes—and you've heard some of these things before, but it's worth repeating because they're true.\nNumber one: Let's get wages rising faster. Now, here's the good news: Wages are actually growing at a rate of about 3 percent so far this year. That's the good news. Working Americans are finally getting a little bigger piece of the pie. But we've got to accelerate that. That's why, for example, my administration recently took new action to help millions of workers finally collect the overtime pay that they have earned. That's going to help. But we should also raise the minimum wage high enough so that if somebody is working full time, they're not living in poverty. Some States, some cities have done it, but we need a national law. We should make sure women get equal pay for equal work. That's something we should all agree on. [Applause] That shouldn't be a partisan issue. That shouldn't be a partisan issue. Republicans got daughters too. [Laughter] They shouldn't want them to get paid less than somebody's boy for doing the same job. If you care about working families getting a bigger paycheck, then that's a clear choice for you right there.\nWe also need to give workers a bigger voice in the economy. Now, one of the reasons that wages have not grown faster over the last couple of decades is because some politicians, some businesses, some laws have undermined the ability of workers to bargain for a better deal, and that needs to change. We always talk about—folks talking about the good old days. Well, let me tell you something, in the good old days, 50 years ago, more than one in four American workers belonged to a union—one in four.\nThe reason all those manufacturing jobs that everybody wants to get back, the reason they paid well was because folks were unionized in those plants. And they not only negotiated for good benefits—good wages, but also good benefits, and they had a pension plan that they could count on. So it used to be one in four were members of unions. Today, it's about 1 in 10. And it's not a coincidence that as union membership shrank, inequality grew, and wages stagnated, and workers got a smaller share of the economic pie.\nSo I just want everybody to remember this: A lot of those good jobs people miss, a lot of those good manufacturing jobs that everybody is always talking about, those were union jobs. And when I—it's great to get all riled up about low wages and lousy workers' standards in others' countries, but let's get riled up about that stuff here too. America should not be changing our laws to make it harder for workers to organize, we should be changing our laws to make it easier and encourage new forms of worker organizations that can give them more of a voice and more of a say in the economy.\nAnd by the way, I want to be clear: There are a lot of terrific business leaders who have figured out that doing right by their workers isn't just good for their workers, it's good for their bottom line, because that means they've got more customers. It means their communities are doing better. There are plenty of business owners right here in Elkhart who exhibited that spirit throughout the recession. So we should lift up good corporate citizens like that so that more businesses across America follow their lead. But that's priority number one: getting wages to grow faster.\nPriority number two: We need to better prepare our children and our workers for the high-tech, high-wage jobs of tomorrow. Now, we actually know what works here, we just don't do it. We know early childhood education works. And we should invest in smart ways of doing it across the country, especially because childcare costs take up a huge share of a family budget. We know that we have to make college more affordable and job training more available. And one way to do that is to provide 2 years of community college for free for every responsible student. There are mayors and there are Governors who are already doing good work on these issues across party lines. They've shown the way. Now we need Congress to do the same.\nNumber three, one of the reasons wages grew so quickly in the fifties and the sixties and the seventies is because we had a Government that put people to work building highways and building bridges and building airports and exploring new frontiers in space and science and investing in research and development. And it led to countless new discoveries and innovations, and it educated a new generation of workers with public colleges where tuition was low, and a GI bill. And I just have to say, too often, Republicans in Congress are blocking investments like these for no other reason than this cult of small government that they keep repeating. But you know what, it's been a drag on the economy. It made us recover slower than we should have. It's been a drag on jobs. It's been a drag on wages. And it's penny wise and pound foolish, because if the economy is growing slower, you take in less tax dollars. You'd be better off putting people back to work. Then, they're paying taxes, the economy is getting stronger, and deficits can actually go down. We should be making smart investments that help us all succeed.\nFourth, in the new economy, we've got to make it easier for working Americans to save for retirement or bounce back from a lost job. Because let's be honest, most Americans don't have the same benefits package or job security as their Member of Congress.—[Laughter]—I'm just saying. They've got a pretty good deal.\nThat was part of what Obamacare is all about, right? What it did was fill in the gaps so that if you lost your job or you went back to school or you decided to start a new business, that you could go and compare and buy quality, affordable coverage and get a tax credit for it. And despite the predictions, it's working. And by the way, it would work ever better if we had more Governors and legislators willing to do what Mike Pence did, to his credit, and expand Medicaid. That was a decision that helped more than 300,000 Hoosiers.\nSo we need fewer folks in Congress who side with the special interests. We need more who are willing to work with us to lower health care costs, give us the funding we need to fight public health challenges like Zika and the opioid epidemic. Joe Donnelly is working on that diligently. You know? So those are things we could get done that would relieve a lot of worry for a lot of families.\nAnd then, we have to tackle retirement security. It—that's something that keeps a lot of people up at night. That's why we've taken actions already to make it easier for more workers to save through their jobs, to make sure that when you do save, you're getting advice that's not in Wall Street's best interest, but in your best interest.\nBut look, let's face it, a lot of Americans don't have retirement savings. Even if they've got an account set up, they just don't have enough money at the end of the month to save as much as they'd like because they're just barely paying the bills. Fewer and fewer people have pensions they can really count on, which is why Social Security is more important than ever. We can't afford to weaken Social Security, we should be strengthening Social Security. And not only do we need to strengthen its long-term health, it's time we finally made Social Security more generous and increased its benefits so that today's retirees and future generations get the dignified retirement that they've earned. And we could start paying for it by asking the wealthiest Americans to contribute a little bit more. They can afford it. I can afford it.\nA fifth way to make the new economy work for everybody is actually to make sure trade works for us and not against us. Again, walling ourselves off from other countries, that's not going to do it. A lot of tough talk that doesn't mean anything is not going to do it. Here's what will make a difference: Making sure other countries raise their labor standards, raise their environmental standards to levels that we set. And that's what we did with this trade deal we call Trans-Pacific Partnership. We negotiated with 11 other countries. If you don't like NAFTA, this TPP trade deal overhauls NAFTA with enforceable, much stronger labor and environmental standards, which means that they won't undercut us as easily.\nIf you don't want China to set the rules for the 21st century—and they're trying—then TPP makes sure that we set the rules. So the choice is simple: If you want to help China, then you shouldn't pass this trade deal that we negotiated. If you want to help America, you need to pass it. Because it's going to cut taxes that other countries put on our products. It raises other countries' standards to ours. That's how we're going to help middle class families. That's how we secure better wages for our workers. And that's how we compete on a level playing field, and when we're on a level playing field, America wins every time—every time.\nI'm going to make one last suggestion, and that is making sure the economy works for everybody by strengthening, and not weakening, the rules that keep Wall Street in check and goes after folks who avoid paying their fair share of taxes.\nNow, after the financial crisis, we passed the toughest Wall Street reforms in history. We passed the toughest Wall Street reforms in history, and by the way, the bank bailout that everybody was mad about? They had to pay back every dime, and they did, with interest. And then, we passed laws to make sure we didn't have something like that happen again. And they're making a difference. The biggest banks have to carry twice the amount of capital that they did before the crisis. That makes another crisis less likely. We've got new tools to guard against another \"too big to fail\" situation. We've put in place a new consumer watchdog that has already secured more than $10 billion for families who were cheated by irresponsible lenders or irresponsible credit card practices.\nAnd guess what? Since—ever since we passed this thing, the big banks—working with a lot of Members of Congress on the other side of the aisle—they have teamed up to try to roll back these rules every single year. Every year, they've been trying to roll them back. And the Republican nominee for President has already said he'd dismantle all these rules that we passed. That is crazy. [Laughter] Have we—let it—no, look, I mean, sometimes—I'll be honest with you, sometimes, I just don't get it. [Laughter] How it is that somebody could propose that we weaken regulations on Wall Street? Have we really forgotten what just happened 8 years ago? It hasn't been that long ago. And because of their reckless behavior, you got hurt. And the notion that you would vote for anybody who would now allow them to go back to doing the same stuff that almost broke our economy's back makes no sense.\nI don't care whether you're a Republican or a Democrat or an Independent, why would you do that? Less oversight on Wall Street would only make another crisis more likely. Letting credit card companies write their own rules, that's only going to hurt working families. It sure as heck wouldn't make the middle class more secure. How can you say you're for the middle class and then you want to tear down these rules?\nWe've also been cracking down on tax loopholes, then—like the ones that allow corporations to change their addresses; they say they're an overseas company, even though they're all located here, so that they don't have to pay taxes in America. We've cracked down on tax cheats who are trying to hide their wealth in offshore accounts. You don't get to avoid paying your taxes. Why should they?\nBut I've got to say, the folks on the other side of the aisle have opposed our efforts to close these loopholes. How do they explain it? When big corporations and wealthy individuals don't pay their fair share of taxes—and by the way, a lot of people do, so I'm not painting with a broad brush here, but there are a lot of folks who don't—when they don't pay their fair share of taxes, it means either you're paying more or it means we don't have enough revenue to support things like rebuilding our roads or funding our public universities, which means tuition goes up, and then you're trying to figure out how to pay for your kid's college education. We should have closed these loopholes a long time ago, and Lord knows, I have tried every year in my budget. We should have used some of the savings that we get from them paying their fair share to give tax breaks that would actually help working families pay for childcare or would help you send your kids to college or would help you save for retirement.\nThe point is, if we want a strong middle class, our Tax Code should reflect that. My first term, we cut taxes by $3,600 for the typical middle class family. Middle class families have paid lower Federal income tax rates during my Presidency than during any other time since the 1950s—that's this big-spending, liberal, tax-and-spend Democrat. That's the truth. Look it up.\nBut the wealthiest Americans are still paying far lower rates than they used to. When I ran for office, I said we'd reverse the tax cuts that had been put in place by the previous President and Congress on—for wealthy individuals, and we did that. We asked them to pay the top rate they did under Bill Clinton, when the economy, by the way, was booming and we ran a surplus. They all said, this is going to be a disaster, and we're going to go into a recession. And we didn't.\nBut today, even as the top 1 percent is doing better than ever for all the reasons I talked about earlier, the Republican nominee for President's tax plan would give the top one-tenth of 1 percent—not the top 1 percent, the top one-tenth of 1 percent—a bigger tax cut than the 120 million American households at the bottom. It would explode our deficits by nearly $10 trillion. I'm not making this up. [Laughter] You can look at the math. That will not bring jobs back. That is not fighting for the American middle class. That will not help us win. That is not going to make your lives better. That will help people like him. That's the truth.\nSo you have a choice to make, Elkhart. You do: between more or less inequality, between stacking the deck for the folks who are already doing great or making sure everybody has a chance to succeed. That's the economic choice you face. That's what's at stake in this election: two very different visions for our economy. I hope I've broken it down for you.\nAudience members. You have!\nThe President. Now, let me say this: I understand that not everybody votes based on their economic interests. Not everybody votes just based on the economy. We're more than just a matter of dollars and cents. Some folks care deeply about our Second Amendment rights. Some folks care about marriage equality. Some folks care about abortion. Some folks are going to vote based on national security or their worries about terrorism. They may think that we haven't done the right thing on any of those issues and that the Republicans have a better answer. We can have that debate. That's fine. Those are all issues very worthy of debate.\nBut if what you care about in this election is your pocketbook—[laughter]—if what you're concerned about is who will look out for the interests of working people and grow the middle class, if that's what you're concerned about——\nAudience member. Michelle for President! [Laughter]\nThe President. ——then the debate—then, if that's what you're concerned about—the economy—the debate is not even close. One path would lead to lower wages. It would eliminate worker protections. It would cut investments in things like education. It would weaken the safety net. It would kick people off health insurance. It would let China write the rules for the global economy. It would let Big Oil weaken rules that protect our air and water. It would let big banks weaken rules that protect families from getting cheated. It would cut taxes for the wealthiest Americans to historic lows. Those are the facts. And I know it sounds like a strange agenda for politicians who are claiming to care about you and working families. But those are their plans. You can find it on their websites. And when I hear working families thinking about voting for those plans, then I want to have an intervention. [Laughter] I want you to just take a look at what you're talking about here.\nAnd if you tell me, you know what, Mr. President, you may be right, but I just disapprove of what Democrats stand for on gay rights or on going after ISIL, then I'm fine. Okay, I hear you. The economy is not everything. If you tell me, you know what, you may be right, but I just believe as a matter of principle that government should be small and the wealthy, they work harder than everybody else and so they should be able to keep what they got—all right, well, that's—you're making a philosophical argument. I've got you.\nBut don't think that actually—that this agenda is going to help you. It's not designed to help you. And the evidence of the last 30 years, not to mention common sense, should tell you that their answers to our challenges are no answers at all.\nFortunately, there's another path that leads to more jobs and higher wages and better benefits and a stronger safety net and a fairer Tax Code and a bigger voice for workers and trade on our terms. And it will make a real difference for the prospects of working families and will grow the middle class.\nSo that's the choice you face, Elkhart. The ideas I've laid out today, I want to be clear: They're not going to solve every problem. They're not going to make everybody financially secure overnight. We're still going to be facing global competition. Trying to make sure that all our kids are prepared for the 21st century workforce, that's a 20-year project, that's not a 2-year project. We're still going to have to make sure that we're paying for Social Security and Medicaid and Medicare as our populations get older. There are still going to be a bunch of issues out there.\nBut the agenda I'm putting forward will point us in the right direction. And the one thing I can promise you is if we turn against each other based on divisions of race or religion, if we fall for a bunch of okey-doke—[laughter]—just because it sounds funny or the tweets are provocative—[laughter]—then we're not going to build on the progress that we've started. If we get cynical and just vote our fears, or if we don't vote at all, we won't build on the progress that we've started.\nWe've got to come together around our common values: our faith in hard work, our faith in responsibility, our belief in opportunity for everybody. We've got to assume the best in each other, not the worst. We've got to remember that sometimes, we all fall on hard times, and it's part of our job as a community of Americans to help folks up when they fall. Because whatever our differences, we all love this country. We all care about our children's futures. That's what makes us great. That's what makes us progress and become better versions of ourselves: because we believe in each other.\nThat's what's going to get us through our toughest moments. That's how we know something better is around the bend. There's going to be some setbacks along the way, but we know that our journey is not finished, and we know that with steady, persistent, collective effort, we're going to deliver a brighter day for our children and our children's children. That's what you proved, Elkhart, over these last 7 years. That's what you've shown America. Let's keep on showing it.\nThank you very much, everybody. God bless you.", "timestamp": "2016-06-01", "title": "Remarks in Elkhart, Indiana"}

Good evening. And welcome to Elkhart, Indiana, as we sit down with President Obama and the residents of this community to discuss their concerns, look back on his time in office, and assess the feverish campaign to succeed him.\nThis marks the President's fifth visit to the once, and again, \"RV Capital of the World,\" a small city where the unemployment rate hit 19.6 percent his first year in office and now has dropped to about 4 percent. But this White House isn't getting any credit for that turnaround. Residents here voted for Ted Cruz in this year's primaries and Mitt Romney by two to one in 2012. Even when President Obama won Indiana in 2008, just as the economy was crashing, Elkhart went with John McCain. So what gives? We've asked some of the people who live here to join us on the stage of the beautiful Lerner Theater here downtown for an intimate conversation.\nBut first, the President of the United States, Barack Obama.\nThe President. All right. Thank you. Hi, guys. How are you?\nMs. Ifill. Hi, Mr. President.\nThe President. Good to see you.\nMs. Ifill. Thank you.\nThe President. Good. Thank you. Thank you, guys.\nMs. Ifill. Our residents have been waiting faithfully, patiently, and eagerly to see you today.\nThe President. Well, I'm eager to see them. [Laughter] And this is a beautiful theater——\nMs. Ifill. It is beautiful.\nThe President.——which got converted. And congratulations on a wonderful venue.\nMs. Ifill. Some of them voted for you; some of them didn't. We will talk about that in a moment.\nThe President. Well, that's what we would expect.\nNational Economy/2016 Presidential Election\nMs. Ifill. I first want to ask by talking to you a little bit about this campaign. What do you think it means when you hear the words \"Let's make America great again\"?\nThe President. I think America is pretty great. And it's interesting, I do a lot of commencement speeches this time of year. In fact, tomorrow I'm going to be going to the Air Force Academy to deliver a commencement for the second time there. And I always remind young people that despite all the challenges that we face right now, if you had the choice to be born in any one period of time in our history, and you didn't know ahead of time whether you were going to be rich or poor, Black or White, male or female, you just had to guess on what moment do you have a best chance of succeeding, it would actually be now; that America is the strongest country on Earth, its economy is the most durable on Earth. We are a country that has incredible diversity. People are striving, working hard, creating businesses. We've got the best universities in the world, the best scientists.\nSo we've got some challenges, and we've just come through a very rough stretch as a consequence of the financial crisis. But overall, not only are we recovered from the crisis that we had, but we're well positioned to do extraordinarily well going forward as long as we make some good decisions.\nMs. Ifill. And yet many people, including probably some folks in this room, think the deficits have gone up and the jobless rate has gone up and, in fact, that their lives have not improved. How—in fact, we have the nominee for—the presumptive nominee for the Republican Party saying—Donald Trump saying this—America is a third-world nation. How do you persuade, or, I suppose, how does your likely Democratic successor—possible—persuade anybody that's not true?\nThe President. Well, it's important you said my successor, because Michelle would be very upset if she thought I was running again. [Laughter]\nThe—look, you just look at the evidence here in Elkhart. As you mentioned in the introduction, when I took office, this was the first city I came to, and unemployment about a month after I took office—month and a half after I took office—was almost 20 percent. One out of 10 people were behind on their mortgage or in foreclosure. Today, the unemployment rate is around 4 percent. It's only about 1 in 30 people who are behind on their mortgage. The RV industry, which is central to Elkhart, is on track to break records in terms of sales.\nAnd so that doesn't mean that folks aren't struggling in some circumstances. And one of the things that I've emphasized is that there are some long-term trends in the economy that we have to tackle in terms of wages not going up as fast as they used to, some big costs—like college costs or health care costs—that are still a challenge, people still worrying about retirement. And so we're going to have to make sure that we make some good decisions going forward. But the notion that somehow America is in decline is just not borne out by the facts.\nMs. Ifill. But it resonates. It resonates among a lot of aggrieved people who are voting in big numbers for Donald Trump.\nThe President. Well, look, I think that what has always been true in American politics is that when we've gone through a tough time—and we went through the worst financial crisis of our lifetimes; I'm looking around, and I think it's safe to say that it's been the worst in the lifetimes or memories of most people here—then you feel nervous. People lost homes. People lost savings. People were worried about whether or not they could make ends meet. And so we're—even though we've recovered, people feel like the ground under their feet isn't quite as solid.\nAnd in those circumstances, a lot of times, it's easy for somebody to come up and say, you know what, if we deport all the immigrants and build a wall, or if we cut off trade with China, or if we do X or Y or Z, that there's some simple answer, and suddenly, everything is going to feel secure. And——\nMs. Ifill. Why don't you mention Donald Trump by name? The President. You know, he seems to do a good job mentioning his own name. [Laughter] So I figure, I'll let him do his advertising for him.\nMs. Ifill. Do you consider at all that any of the support for him is backlash against you personally?\nThe President. Well, here's one thing I would say, and I just spoke about this at the local high school: I think Trump is a more colorful character than some of the other Republican elected officials, but a lot of the story that he's telling is entirely consistent with what folks have been saying about me or the general story they've been telling about the economy for the last 7½, the last 10, the 20, the last 30 years.\nAnd you can actually describe the story fairly concisely, right? The basic story they tell is that the problems that the middle class working families are experiencing has to do with a big, bloated Government that taxes the heck out of people and then gives that money to undeserving folks—welfare cheats or the 47 percent who are takers or whatever phrase they use—that businesses are being strangled by overregulation, that Obamacare has killed jobs.\nAnd the fact of the matter is, when you look at it, the Government as a proportion of our overall economy is actually smaller now under my Presidency than it was under Ronald Reagan.\nMs. Ifill. Let me read you something that Bill Clinton said though.\nThe President. I have—but let me finish, Gwen.\nMs. Ifill. Okay.\nThe President. The—we have fewer Federal employees today. The health care costs since I signed Obamacare have actually gone up slower than they were before I signed it. Twenty million more people have health insurance. So the arguments they're making just are not borne out by the facts.\nBut what is true is that if people are feeling secure—feeling insecure and they're offered a simple reason for how they can feel more secure, people are going to be tempted by it, particularly if they're hearing that same story over and over again.\nNational Economy\nMs. Ifill. Perception. So Bill Clinton said, \"Millions and millions and millions of people look at that pretty picture of America he painted,\" which you just described, \"and they cannot find themselves in it to save their lives.\"\nThe President. The pretty picture that——\nMs. Ifill. The pretty picture of the—all the things that have gone well. Why is there a disconnect between—that he's describing here?\nThe President. Well, look, here's what has changed in the economy over the last 20 to 30 years. Right after World War II, America was ascendant. It was dominant around the world because Europe was blown up, Japan was digging itself out of the rubble, China was still a backwater, the—Eastern Europe was behind the Iron Curtain. There wasn't much competition. We were the only folks who were seriously making cars and trucks and appliances and you name it. We had strong unionization, which meant that workers had leverage so that they could get a good share of the—a growing pie. And people saw, each year and each generation, their standards of living going up pretty rapidly.\nAnd what started happening is, you started seeing foreign competition. Unions started getting busted, so workers had less leverage, which meant their wages didn't go up quite as fast. You started seeing the end of defined benefit pension plans. In terms of health care programs, if you had health care on your job, suddenly, you were paying a lot of deductibles and premiums. College costs started going up because the public university system, which used to be generously funded by State governments so that tuition was low, suddenly, State governments were spending more money on prisons than they were on universities, which meant tuition went up.\nYou add all those things together, and people then start feeling more stressed. Now, the answer to that is how do we get wages up? How do we make sure that you can save for retirement? How can you make sure that your kid can afford to get a higher education to compete for the jobs of the future? And the question then is, what is actually going to get that done?\nTo me, if we raise the minimum wage; if we make it easier, not harder, for people to unionize; if we negotiate trade deals that raise labor standards and environmental standards in other countries, instead of letting them sell here and we can't sell there; if we make sure that we're rebuilding our roads and our bridges and our infrastructure to put a bunch of folks in hardhats back to work; if we make Social Security stronger rather than cutting it—if we do those things, then we are going to see wages go up, labor markets tighten, and we will relieve a lot of the stress that people feel.\nBut if you look at the arguments that are being made by the Republicans and the actions that have been taken by those Members of Congress, it's hard to see how cutting taxes for the wealthiest Americans, deregulating Wall Street again, is somehow going to benefit middle class families.\nMs. Ifill. Well, let's turn to the audience and see what they think. We're going to open this conversation up. I have a lot more questions, but they do too. And we're going to be right back in just a moment with that.\n[At this point, the town hall was interrupted for a station break and then continued as follows.]\nMs. Ifill. So, Mr. President, we are back with a few questions for you from our invited audience here. They are anxious to get started, and so am I.\nYou're a small-businessman here in Elkhart.\nQ. Yes, I am.\nMs. Ifill. What's your name?\nQ. Bill Kercher.\nMs. Ifill. What's your question for the President?\nFamily Farms/Health Care Reform/Government Regulations\nQ. Mr. President, I am a fifth-generation fruit and vegetable grower here in Elkhart County. And over the last 6 years, we've seen a dramatic increase in the number of regulations that touch all aspects of our business, from the Food Safety Modernization Act to Obamacare and many others. Now, large farms are able to comply with these regulations more easily, and small family farms we've seen actually exiting the industry. At what point are we overregulated, if not now? And how can we encourage younger growers to either stay or enter an industry when the barriers to entry are higher than ever? Thank you.\nThe President. Well, it's a great question. And first of all, my administration's policy has been to encourage family farming rather than big agribusiness, because not only is that sort of a model of farming that built this country, but as Michelle will tell you, it actually produces food that's better for you, as she reminds me constantly. [Laughter] So we want you to succeed.\nNow, if you look at the trend lines in terms of small family farms, the problem generally has been actually family farms getting bought up by larger agricultural operations. It's been you guys not always getting good prices for the products that you put together.\nI don't doubt that some elements of the regulations I've put in place have probably put a burden on you. So let's take health care, for example. It may be that previously you weren't able—you didn't think you were able to provide health insurance for your employees. The problem is, is if they're not getting health insurance through you, then that means that they're relying on the emergency room and they're relying on taxpayers, like everybody else, to cover those costs if they get in an accident or if they get sick.\nAnd so it has always been our view that if we can put something together where people can buy health insurance through a pool—it's subsidized if they're not making enough money to pay for their own health insurance—that that overall is going to be a more efficient way to do it. And in fact, health care inflation, the rate at which health care costs have gone up for small businesses as well as large businesses, has been significantly slower since I passed the law than it was beforehand.\nNow, what I would say is that there are a bunch of regulations that have been put in place in the past that may have been well intentioned, but didn't work. Sometimes, they're outdated. And so what I've told my administration to do is to go back and look at all the regulations that are there. If there's not a good reason for them, or if they're outdated, or if we can redesign them to put less of a burden on businesses, we should do so. I'm not interested in regulating just for the sake of regulating. But there are some things—like making sure we've got clean air and clean water, making sure that folks have health insurance, making sure that worker safety is a priority—that I do think is part of our overall obligation as a—as not a third-world country, but as an advanced nation, to make sure that we're doing the right thing.\nAnd I would hope that as a consequence of the overall economy doing better, you've also been doing better as well. And anybody who is running a business would rather not have any regulations, just as a general rule, and certainly, you don't want a situation where you feel like you're being regulated and your competitor is not. But what we've tried to do is to be very fair in terms of looking at what regulations make a difference. If you're a really small business of, like, 25 people or less, typically, you are exempted from those regulations—a lot of the Federal regulations. If you get to a certain size, then it's part of the cost of doing business. But what it also does is, it makes sure that we as a society are looking out for workers, we're protecting our families, and people are getting decent wages, and they've got health care so they're not going to the emergency room when they get sick.\nMs. Ifill. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. Kercher.\nAs you may have been—may have noticed, following this election, Donald Trump came to Indiana and talked a lot about what happened with the Carrier Corporation and shipping their jobs out of State. Here is someone who worked for Carrier, and he has a question for you. Q. How are you doing, Mr. President?\nThe President. How are you?\nManufacturing/Outsourcing/Job Training\nQ. My name is Eric Cottingham. And I'm representing the Steelworkers Union, Local 1999. And I'm trying to find out what do we have left as far as all of our jobs are leaving Indianapolis. Right? And I see here, you're doing a lot of things, but in Indianapolis, there's nothing there for us. I mean, what's next? I mean, what can we look forward to in the future as far as jobs, employment, whatever? Because all of our jobs has left or in the process of leaving, sir.\nThe President. Well, in fact, we've seen more manufacturing jobs created since I've been President than any time since the 1990s. That's a fact. And if you look at just the auto industry as an example, they've had record sales, and they've hired back more people over the last 5 years than they had for a very long, long time. We actually make more stuff, have a bigger manufacturing base today than we've had in most of our history. The problems have been—part of the problems have had to do with jobs going overseas. And this is one of the reasons why I've been trying to negotiate trade deals to raise wages and environmental standards in other countries so that they're not undercutting us.\nBut frankly, part of it has had to do with automation. You go into an auto factory today and—that used to have 10,000, and now they've got a thousand people making the same number of cars or more. And so what that means is, even though we're making the same amount of stuff in our manufacturing sector, we're employing fewer people.\nNow, the good news is that there are entire new industries that are starting to pop up and you're actually seeing some manufacturers coming back to the United States because they're starting to realize, you know what, energy prices are lower here, workers are better here, this is our biggest market, and so even though we offshored and went someplace else before, now it turns out, we're better off going ahead and manufacturing here.\nBut for those folks who've lost their job right now because a plant went down to Mexico, that isn't going to make you feel better. And so what we have to do is to make sure that folks are trained for the jobs that are coming in now, because some of those jobs of the past are just not going to come back. And when somebody says—like the person you just mentioned who I'm not going to advertise for—that he's going to bring all these jobs back, well, how exactly are you going to do that? What are you going to do? There's no answer to it. He just says, well, I'm going to negotiate a better deal. Well, what—how exactly are you going to negotiate that? What magic wand do you have? And usually, the answer is he doesn't have an answer.\nSo what I've tried to do, what my administration has tried to do is let's grow those manufacturing sectors—like clean energy, like some of these new technologies that are coming up—let's focus on those. We've set up, for example, manufacturing hubs where we work with universities, local businesses, local governments to create research labs that can take something like 3-D printing or nanotechnology or all kinds of stuff that I can't really explain, because the scientists and really smart people know all about it—[laughter]—and said, let's invest in this so that when the new jobs come, they're coming here.\nBut I've got to tell you that the days when you just being able to—you just being willing to work hard and you can now walk into a plant and suddenly there's going to be a job for you for 30 years or 40 years, that's just not going to be there for our kids, because, more and more, that stuff is going to be automated. And if you go into a factory, that kid is going to need to know computers or is going to need to know some science and some math, because they're not even going to be picking anything up, they're just going to be working on a keyboard.\nAnd that's why we've put so much emphasis on job training, community colleges. That's why I've proposed making the first 2 years of community college free so that we know that every young person, they're going to be able to—if they're not going for a full 4-year degree, at least they're going to be getting the technical training they need for those jobs of the future.\nBut you cannot look backwards. And that doesn't make folks feel good sometimes, especially if it's a town that was reliant on a couple of big manufacturers. But they're going to have to retrain for the jobs of the future, not the jobs of the past.\nMs. Ifill. Well, you mentioned education, you touched on education. We have a question here about that. What's your name?\nQ. Vanessa Corredera. Hi, Mr. President.\nThe President. How are you, Vanessa?\nHigher Education/College Costs/Student Loans\nQ. Fine, thank you.\nThe President. Good.\nQ. You've addressed the crushing student debt, especially for higher education, and you've cited initiatives with community colleges, the STEM disciplines, and technology as potential responses. Many of my friends and especially my students are still struggling with this issue. So my question for you is, how do you continue to address this issue your final months in office? And how can you do so in a way that perhaps includes the humanities and liberal arts education as a whole when, frankly, those are often very much under attack?\nThe President. What do you teach?\nQ. I teach English at Andrews University over in Michigan.\nThe President. I thought you were a student. [Laughter]\nQ. Thank you.\nThe President. I'm getting old, I'm telling you. [Laughter] All the teachers look like students now. [Laughter]\nThe—well, first of all, let me just say that I am—I have been emphasizing STEM education—that's science, technology, engineering, and math—not because I think the humanities are unimportant, but because we generally are—have not been producing as many engineers and as many scientists as—and people with those kinds of technological skills as compared to China, for example. And we send a lot of people into banking and folks like me, who become lawyers, but the truth of the matter is, is that we have to make sure that we continue to have a strong base in the sciences and engineering if we're going to remain the most innovative economy in the world. But as somebody who studied humanities himself, I think it's extremely important as well.\nThe broader issue of financing education, as I mentioned, the reason that college is so much more expensive for this generation as it was for my generation, and even better for the previous generation, really had to do with government spending. It used to be that most State universities were heavily subsidized by the State so they kept tuition really, really low.\nWhat happened around the eighties, nineties was, State legislators started saying, we've got to build more prisons. In fairness to them, they also started feeling more pressure because of Medicaid spending, because health care costs were going up. And so they started cutting higher education budgets, and they made up for it with higher tuition. And that's why, at least at public colleges and universities, the costs have gone up a lot.\nNow, here's what we've done. The first thing I did when I came into office was, we reformed the student loan program. Because what was happening was on federally subsidized student loans, it was all run through the banks, and the banks were getting billions of dollars of profits for managing these loans to students, even though the loans were guaranteed by the Federal Government so they weren't taking any risk. And we said let's cut the middle man out, let's loan directly to students. So that saved us tens of billions of dollars; that allowed us to expand the Pell grant program and to lower or cap interest on student loans.\nBut just because we give more loans or more grants, that doesn't always help with the rising cost. And that's why I've proposed this 2-year free college—community college, because what that does is that allows a young person, who is strapped for cash and whose parents are doing everything they can, but can only do so much, to say, I'll get my first 2 years for free; I'll transfer those credits to a 4-year public college or university, and I've now just potentially cut the amount of loans that I've got in half.\nAnd for some people who decide they don't need a 4-year college education—they want to be a graphic designer, they want to go into a trade—now they can get the training they need without incurring any debt. So these are all proposals that are—we know work. There are some States and cities that are already doing this to—free community college proposal, and it's working, and it's really helping to reduce costs.\nAnd the last thing, we're also trying to work with the universities just to figure out ways that they can reduce costs using, for example, online learning, making—putting out reports so that parents and students are better consumers so that they know, well, let me not sign up for that 4-year college where the graduation rates are low, and it's got great dorms and great gyms and nice food, but I'm going to be $50,000 worth of debt, and I may not get a job.\nMs. Ifill. Thank you, Mr. President.\nSir, your name?\nQ. Arvis Dawson.\nMs. Ifill. And your question?\nQ. First of all, I want to thank you, President, for your service to our country.\nThe President. Thank you, sir.\nQ. And despite the polls, there's a lot of love for you here in Elkhart. [Laughter]\nThe President. Oh, I appreciate that. You know, I actually—[applause]—one thing is, after 7½ years, you don't worry about the polls no more. [Laughter] You really don't.\nTransgender Rights Q. My question to you, Mr. President: I'm a strong believer in equal rights for everyone, a very strong believer in that. I was wondering, though, with all the pressing issues that you have before you right now, why is the issue of which bathroom a person uses such an issue?\nThe President. Well, I—you know what, it's a great question. Somehow, people think I made it an issue. I didn't make it an issue. There are a lot of things that are more pressing, you're absolutely right. What happened, and what continues to happen, is you have transgender kids in schools, and they get bullied, and they get ostracized, and it's tough for them. And we're of a generation where that stuff was all out of sight and out of mind, and so people suffered silently. But now they're out in the open.\nAnd the question then is, schools are asking us, the Department of Education, for guidance, how should we deal with this? And my answer is that we should deal with this issue the same way we'd want it dealt with if it was our child. And that is to try to create an environment of some dignity and kindness for these kids. And that's sort of the bottom line. I have to just say what's in my heart, but I also have to look at what's the law. And my best interpretation of what our laws and our obligations are is that we should try to accommodate these kids so that they are not in a vulnerable situation.\nNow, I understand that people, for religious beliefs or just general discomfort, might disagree. And I'm not the one who's making a big issue of it, but if the school districts around the country ask me, what do you think we should do, then what we're going to do is tell them, let's find a way to accommodate them in a way that makes sure that these kids are not excluded and ostracized.\nMs. Ifill. Let me ask Mr. Dawson whether he's satisfied with the answer to that question, and what is it about this that bothers you?\nQ. Mainly, it's my religious belief. Yes, I'm satisfied with the answer to the question. Coming from the church background that I come from, I believe in equal rights for all.\nThe President. I know.\nQ. But I think, too, wherever you were going to the bathroom before, continue to go to the bathroom there. I don't have a problem with that.\nThe President. Well, but—right, and the problem is, is just for a lot of these kids, they might not even feel comfortable going to the bathroom, which is a tough situation if you're a kid. And look, I have profound respect for everybody's religious beliefs on this, but if you're at a public school, the question is, how do we just make sure that children are treated with kindness? That's all. And my reading of Scripture tells me that that Golden Rule is pretty high up there in terms of my Christian belief. That doesn't mean somebody else has to interpret it the same way; it does mean, as President of the United States, those are the values that I think are important.\nNow, this is going to be settled by the courts, ultimately. There have been lawsuits everywhere. I just want to emphasize to you, though, this—it's not like I woke up one day and I said, man, you know what we really need to do is let's start working on high school bathrooms. [Laughter] That—I was thinking about ISIL—[laughter]—and I was thinking about the economy, and I'm thinking about jobs. But one of the things that, as President, you learn is that you don't choose the issues all the time, issues come to you. And then, you have to make your best judgment about what you think is right. And I've expressed what I think is the best judgment that is consistent with our traditions and our laws. Ms. Ifill. Have another issue to come to you here, Mr. President. What's your name?\nQ. Nancy Wirt.\nMs. Ifill. And what do you have—your question for the President?\n2016 Presidential Election/Civility in Politics/Gerrymandering\nQ. Mr. President, I, like many Americans, politically, I'm in the center; I'm not too right, I'm not too left.\nThe President. Right.\nQ. So I spent a lot of time watching the debates, both parties, trying to get a sense of who is my candidate. So I watched a lot this year, and what I came back with at the end was, I found that there was a lot of lack of civility; that people were speaking—candidates were speaking over one another, shouting, calling each other names. There was a lot of inappropriate comments. I was pretty saddened by the whole situation. I'm curious what your thoughts are on the tone of the debates overall.\nMs. Ifill. Were you watching the debates, Mr. President?\nThe President. You know, I confess, I didn't. [Laughter] But I'm really glad you did. I don't watch them because I'm just steeped in this stuff, so I could probably make all the arguments for all the candidates, including the Republican side, just because I've heard them a lot in my day-to-day work. But I think it's really important that you took the time to do what every citizen should do, which is try to get informed.\nThis whole issue of civility is—you're right to be distressed by it. Now, I think it's important not to romanticize what politics used to be like. If you read accounts of what, like, Tom Jefferson said about John Adams or what folks said about Lincoln—I mean, they called them monkeys; they said they were illegitimate children. They said, you know—I mean, this was some rough stuff. [Laughter] It wasn't on TV, because they didn't have TVs, but it was rough.\nBut I do think what has happened is that some of the boundaries that used to be there for how you debated ideas have broken down. And no offense against Gwen, because she works for PBS, which is all about civility——\nMs. Ifill. Absolutely. [Laughter]\nThe President. ——but I do think that the TV culture, the reality culture contributes to this. Because what happens at—talk radio culture—what happens is that politicians get the most attention the more outrageous they sound. And so if you're civil and quiet and polite, nobody covers you. But if you say something crazy or rude, you're all over the news. And that has fed, I think, this kind of arms race of insults and controversy that doesn't shine a lot of light, even though it generates a lot of heat.\nThe other thing that contributes to this is, we—and a lot of times, we blame politicians, but part of it is what's happened in terms of our voting patterns. And there are a couple of reasons for this. One is political gerrymandering, which is that the way district lines are drawn are—now they use computers. They're so precise that whoever is in power, whether it's Democrats in a State or Republicans in a State—and both parties do this—they will draw these lines so precise so that every district, they know this is going to be a Republican district, this is going to be a Democratic district. And so out of the 435 seats in the House of Representatives, maybe 10 percent of them are actually competitive, and the rest of them, no matter what happens, are going to be either Republican or Democrat.\nWell, what happens when that exists? It means, you don't—if you're a Republican, you don't have to worry about what the Democrat is saying, you don't have to go to the center. You just have to make sure that the Tea Party Republican to your right doesn't say something more outlandish than you do. Same thing on the left. The Democrat is only worried about what the person on the farthest left is going to say. And that drives people into opposite directions.\nSo the one thing I would say is, first of all, don't get discouraged. Get out there and vote. But what I would say is that every voter here, Democrat or Republican, if you want more civility, than you vote for folks who are civil and who are making arguments and using logic and presenting evidence and not just somebody who is popping off. And that's true whether it's on the left or the right.\nAnd if you are voting for somebody who is just being controversial for the sake of it or helping you vent, then you only have yourself to blame if it turns out that the political debate starts getting more and more crass.\n2016 Presidential Election\nMs. Ifill. Since we're talking politics, Mr. President, I do want to ask you this. The primary season is almost over. Well, you've talked a lot about what Republicans are and are not doing in this campaign. And I wonder when we can expect you to get involved in the Democratic race. Are we going to see an endorsement soon? Bernie Sanders, perhaps? [Laughter]\nThe President. Well, I think that there's been a healthy debate in the Democratic Party. And it's almost over. We've got—on Tuesday, you'll have some big States, California and New Jersey, where the votes will take place. What I've tried to do is to make sure that voters, rather than me big-footing the situation, are deciding the outcome.\nI think we'll probably have a pretty good sense next week of who the nominee will end up being. I think both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton are good people. I think that they broadly share the goals that I have. There are some tactical differences within the Democratic Party about how do you get stuff done. But there's going to be plenty of time for me to step in and campaign.\nMs. Ifill. I notice you don't mind using their names.\nThe President. Well, they—as I said, they're not as good at marketing. [Laughter]\nMs. Ifill. I have another question for you here.\nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act\nQ. Mr. Obama, in regards to Obamacare, I've been receiving my health insurance through the marketplace.\nThe President. Yes.\nQ. And the first year, the subsidy was very high, and my premium was very low, and I was very happy. Now, beginning in January of '16, the subsidy was lower, and my premium went up dramatically, and my income was nearly the same. In fact, in—for this year, I'm paying 22 percent of my income for health care. So that's my concern and my complaint. The second part of my question is, what's going to happen to Obamacare in 2017 and beyond?\nThe President. Yes. Well, I don't know your particular circumstance. Your subsidy should not have gone down if your income is more or less the same, unless there was some significant difference in your tax status. So I'd—I'll try to find out about that.\nWhat is true is that some of the premiums went up because essentially, in the first year of a startup program, a lot of insurance companies didn't quite know how to price things, and so they priced substantially lower than people expected. And now things are kind of evening out, which means that some folks who overpriced, they've dropped their prices; some have gone up. But on average, what we're seeing is that the average increase is about 4 bucks per month for somebody who is signed up.\nSome markets are different. One of the big problems that we've had is making sure that there's enough competition, enough insurers who are bidding for your business in rural communities, because some areas just don't have as many providers and as many insurance companies, and so you only get one or two, and they start thinking, well, maybe we can jack up prices a little bit higher. Now, technically, your State insurance commissioner is able to—has to approve any hikes, and those that are not justified economically, those should be stopped.\nBut what I would say generally is that—and we're monitoring this very carefully, I promise, since, obviously, everybody has been predicting disaster and apocalypse on this thing for a long time—is, generally speaking, premiums have been lower than people expected originally. In some markets, they've gone up faster; some markets slower. They're still cheaper than you would be able to get outside of the marketplace. But there are some things that we've got to do to lower health care costs generally, particularly drug prices.\nAnd part of Obamacare that's not talked about a lot is us trying to improve the health care delivery system so we—there's not as much waste: so that you're not taking multiple tests, so that you're not readmitted into a hospital because they didn't take care of business the first time. And that's part of the reason why, overall, health care inflation has actually gone down—has gone up at about half the rate that it did before the law passed.\nFor the average person here, your premiums are about $2,600 lower than they would have been if health care inflation had kept on going up at the same pace as it did before Obamacare was passed. Now, the fact that they're still going up makes you feel bad. You'd feel worse if they'd gone up faster. So this is still an issue of challenge to policymakers and to families. I'm happy, after this town hall, to get some details about your situation, because if your income didn't go up much, at least the subsidies should not change that much.\nMs. Ifill. Another question for you over here, Mr. President. Your name?\nSyrian Refugees/Homelessness Among Veterans\nQ. My name is Gerald Sparks. I'm a member of Local 1118, Painters and Allied Trades Union.\nThe President. Good to see you.\nQ. And I've got a two-part question for you. First, with over 79,000 Syrian refugees already coming into the States, and tens of thousands more coming in, how can you guarantee that there's none that have been radicalized? And, two, don't you feel that that money would be better spent taking care of the tens of thousands of homeless veterans we have sleeping on the streets every night, some with children, and the ones committing suicide daily? Thank you, Mr. President.\nThe President. Yes. Well, first, let me say, sir, that we don't have tens of thousands of Syrian refugees coming in. I—we're trying to get—trying to admit several thousand. So far, I think, we've been able to admit about 2,500. In contrast, Canada has taken in 25,000, and we're a much bigger country. Germany has taken in half a million. There's a tragedy going on there, and people are homeless and dying. And we're the biggest, wealthiest country on Earth, and we have some obligation to help, just like we'd expect people to help if Americans were in trouble.\nAnd so I think it's really important to understand, we're not spending a lot of money on bringing in and housing refugees. And this is what I mean about making sure that when we're deciding about elections and voting, that we look at the facts. I'm trying to get more refugees admitted. It's not close to the kinds of numbers you were talking about. We just can't. But—and the reason is, is because refugees are actually admitted on a much stricter standard than the average tourist who's coming in on a visa. They have to go through a full background check—FBI, our intelligence agencies check through every single person who comes in. It's, like, a month-long process.\nBut if you are somebody from France, you don't even need a visa; you just hop on the plane and you're here in the United States. And if you're a member of ISIL that happens to be a citizen of France or Germany, you come on in. Much more risk is involved in terms of just ordinary tourists or, for that matter, American citizens who have gotten brainwashed by ISIL on the computer, like they did in San Bernardino, and suddenly, they just go to the local gun store, where, by the way, because the Republicans have blocked it, we can't even put them on a list to prevent them from buying weapons. That's a much bigger danger than the Syrian refugees.\nNow, the second point you made about veterans' homelessness, one of the things that I did when I came into office is I said, if somebody has put on the uniform of this country and fought for our freedom, they cannot be homeless, and our goal should be zero homelessness, zero tolerance for homelessness. And we have cut veterans homelessness since I've been in office by about a third. Tens of thousands of veterans who used to be homeless are now housed.\nBut one is too many. So we've got some cities where they've set a goal of zero homeless veterans and they've actually achieved it. We're going to keep on working as long as we have to, to get this done. And we have budgeted the dollars to make sure that every veteran is put in place.\nBut I just want to say that the reason that we've got veterans' homelessness is not because of Syrian refugees. It's not because of undeserving folks on welfare. It's because we've had a Congress that for too long talks tough about patriotism and looking out for our troops, and orders folks—are fine with us sending 180,000 people into war, but then, when it came down to the actual veterans' budget, it wasn't there. And I increased the veterans' budget more—the VA budget more than any President in history, increased it 11 percent my first year. But we've still got work to do on it.\nMs. Ifill. Mr. President, I'm going to try to squeeze in another question——\nThe President. Thank you for the question though. Are you a veteran yourself? Q. No, but I support our troops.\nThe President. All right. I appreciate your service.\nMs. Ifill. Yes, hi. What's your name?\nQ. Marianne Neufeldt.\nMs. Ifill. Okay. What's your question for the President?\nPresidency/2008-2009 Recession/Libya\nQ. Mr. President, what is the one thing you would go back and change during your Presidency, and how would you change it?\nThe President. Other than dyeing my hair? [Laughter] I have to tell you, every day, I make some mistake. Fortunately, most of them aren't that big. Sometimes, you just make—you use your best judgment because you're working with probabilities. You don't know the perfect answer. If something is easy, it does not reach my desk. [Laughter] By definition, somebody else has solved it. If something is easy to solve, I don't even see it. Somebody else has solved it a long time ago.\nSo most of the time, I'm dealing with probabilities. If I'm making a decision about are we going to take a strike against bin Laden, I don't even know if bin Laden is there, and I've got young men and women—young men who are at risk when I send them there—I'm operating on probabilities. When we decided to bail out the auto industry—you were talking about polls earlier—that polled at about 10 percent, even in Michigan. Because people were so mad about the bank bailouts, they thought, no more bailouts. And we weren't positive the thing was going to work, but we knew that if we didn't do it, you'd lose a million jobs all across the Midwest, including here in Indiana. So we made that bet, and it worked.\nIf I were to talk about domestic policy, I think the thing I would have probably done differently is, I would have tried to describe earlier to the American people how serious the recession was going to be, which is—which would have, hopefully, allowed us to have an even bigger response than we did. Our—the Recovery Act, our response to the recession, was actually bigger than the New Deal. It—that's how a lot of teachers kept their jobs. That's how a lot of construction workers stayed on the job and projects kept on going. That's how a lot of States met their budget. That's why we didn't end up having 30 percent unemployment.\nBut I—in the balance of trying to reassure people, I maybe didn't indicate to them that, look, this is probably going to be a 2-, 3-, 4-year process of us digging out of this hole so that we could have staged some of that recovery money over a longer period of time and possibly accelerated the recovery.\nIn terms of foreign policy—I've said this before—we decided to go in as part of a broader coalition to—into Libya to make sure that this guy Qadhafi, who had been a State sponsor of terrorism, didn't go in and start slaughtering his own people. We succeeded and probably saved tens of thousands of lives. But I did a little too much counting on other countries to then stabilize and help support government formation, and now it's kind of a mess.\nI could give you a long list. [Laughter]\nMs. Ifill. But now, Mr.——\nThe President. But I tell you, I mean, the one thing I can say is, every day, when I wake up, I'm focused on how can I make your lives better, how can I protect the American people, how can I increase their prosperity. At the end of the day, I can always say honestly that I did my best. And hopefully, what I'm also usually trying to do is to admit that if something is not working as well as it should be, let's see if we can improve it. That's where we need a Congress that is not about yelling and is more about solving problems.\nMs. Ifill. Mr. President, we will prevail on you to come back and give us the rest of that list at another time, because we're out of time for now.\nThe President. Okay.\nMs. Ifill. Thank you very much for joining us. Thank you very much, the good people of Elkhart, Indiana, for joining us. We really appreciate it. We hope you will keep tuning into the PBS NewsHour and at our website at pbs.org/newshour for more on all of the issues and more raised tonight.\nFrom all of us here in the Hoosier State today, thank you to the President and to the people of Elkhart. Goodnight.\n[Following the broadcast portion of the town hall, the President continued to take questions from audience members as follows.]\nU.S. Servicemembers\nQ. [Inaudible]—our first responders and all their families for everything that they do and have done to try and keep us safe.\nThe President. I appreciate that. I appreciate that. I will tell you, one of the great honors of this job is serving as Commander in Chief, because the quality of people in our military today, the excellence of how they do their jobs, from the lowest private to the members of the Joint Chiefs, the fact that they're really serious about understanding the costs of war so that they don't go around making arguments just on the basis of ideology or politics, but it's all about getting the job done—I couldn't be more impressed.\nGun Control\nQ. I think we're all aware that gun control and our Second Amendment rights are going to be a hot topic in the upcoming election this fall. And I think we're aware that Trump and Hillary—if she doesn't get charged by the FBI—are on opposite ends of the issue. Knowing that we apply common sense to other issues in our society, specifically, like holding irresponsible people accountable for their actions when they drink and drive and kill somebody or when they text on a cell phone and drive and kill somebody——\nMs. Ifill. So what's your question, sir?\nQ. ——and we do that without restricting control of cars and cell phones to the rest of us, the good guys, why then do you and Hillary want to control and restrict and limit gun manufacturers, gun owners, and responsible use of guns and ammunition to the rest of us, the good guys, instead of holding the bad guys accountable for their actions?\nAnd, Mr. President, if I may, I'd like to use Chicago, your hometown, a city that has some of the strictest gun laws in the Nation, a city that for decades—and still is under Democratic control—a city that has an outrageous and even embarrassing murder rate, as my first example. Why can't we round up these thugs, these drug dealers and gang members, and hold them accountable for their actions or allow the good people in Chicago access to firearms to protect themselves? Thank you. The President. Good. All right. Well, let me—it's a multipart question, so let me just say a couple things. First of all, the notion that I or Hillary or Democrats or whoever you want to choose are hell-bent on taking away folks' guns is just not true, and I don't care how many times the NRA says it. I'm about to leave office. There have been more guns sold since I've been President than just about any time in U.S. history. There are enough guns for every man, woman, and child in this country. And at no point have I ever—ever—proposed confiscating guns from responsible gun owners. So it's just not true.\nWhat I have said is precisely what you suggested, which is, why don't we treat this like every other thing that we use? We used to have really bad auto fatality rates. The auto fatality rate has actually dropped precipitously, drastically, since I was a kid. Why is that? We decided we had seatbelt laws. We decided to have manufacturers put airbags on—in place. We decided to crack down on drunk driving and texting. We decided to redesign roads so that they were less likely to have a car bank. We studied what is causing this—these fatalities using science and data and evidence, and then we slowly treated it like the public health problem it was, and it got reduced.\nWe are not allowed to do any of that when it comes to guns because people—if you propose anything, it is suggested that we're trying to wipe away gun rights and impose tyranny and martial law. Do you know that Congress will not allow the Center for Disease Control to study gun violence? They're not allowed to study it because the notion is, is that by studying it, the same way we do with traffic accidents, somehow, that's going to lead to everybody's gun being confiscated.\nWhen we talked about background checks—if you buy a car, if you want to get a license—first of all, you've got to get a license. You have to take a test. People have to know that you know how to drive. You don't have to do any of that with respect to buying a gun. And when we talked about doing effective background checks, it was resisted because the notion was, we were going to take your guns away.\nI just came from a meeting today in the Situation Room in which I've got people who we know have been on ISIL websites, living here in the United States, U.S. citizens, and we're allowed to put them on the no-fly list when it comes to airlines, but because of the National Rifle Association, I cannot prohibit those people from buying a gun. This is somebody who is a known ISIL sympathizer. And if he wants to walk into a gun store or a gun show right now and buy as many weapons and ammo as he can, nothing is prohibiting him from doing that, even though the FBI knows who that person is.\nSo, sir, I just have to say respectfully that there is a way for us to have commonsense gun laws. There is a way for us to make sure that lawful, responsible gun owners like yourself are able to use it for sporting, hunting, protecting yourself. But the only way we're going to do that is if we don't have a situation in which anything that is proposed is viewed as some tyrannical destruction of the Second Amendment. And that's how the issue too often gets framed.\nMs. Ifill. Mr. President, you've been very generous with your time.\nThe President. I haven't.\nMs. Ifill. You really have.\nThe President. But I'm glad you asked that because I know I've—[inaudible].\nMs. Ifill. I'm glad you did. The President. ——a lot of folks here.\nMs. Ifill. But you've got places to go.\nThe President. I've got to go to the Air Force Academy to deliver a commencement tomorrow. But for those of you who are further interested on this gun issue, I actually did a whole town hall with a competitor, CNN.\nMs. Ifill. Anderson Cooper.\nThe President. You can pull it up on YouTube, and I think it will give you more of a sense of the kinds of issues that I'm talking about.\nMs. Ifill. You know, you could stay here all night, or I could let you go.\nThe President. I could.\nMs. Ifill. Thank you very much.\nQ. [Inaudible]\nThe President. Well, we know that it exists because I'm putting on bug spray all the time when I go out.\nMedical Research\nQ. [Inaudible]\nThe President. We've been doing some investment. This whole issue of medical research is something that's a top priority, and we've been trying to put more money into it. But when I get back, I'll ask about whether we're doing something on—what kinds of fruits and vegetables you've got? Did you bring some samples? [Laughter]\nQ. I didn't. Sweet corn——\nThe President. Sweet corn. Where are you selling mostly?\nQ. Retailers.\nThe President. Retailers. Fantastic. All right, well, congratulations. Next time I'm in town, maybe I'll pass.\nThank you, guys. All right, thank you. Thank you, sir. Appreciate you.\nQ. Can I ask you a question?\nThe President. Real quick. Yes, go ahead. Thank you, sir.\nLesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Rights\nQ. In light of recent legislation, there's been a lot of things passed that discriminate against LGBT——\nThe President. At the State levels.\nQ. ——and restrict women's rights to contraception or abortion. And I wonder what encouragement you could give me and people like-minded who believe that people should—that I should be able to decide what I want to do with my body and not have this already in writing that I can do and have somebody restrict that, and the fact as a LGBT advocate not be allowed to have the same rights as other people? The President. Well, here's what I would say. We still have work to do. But in terms of LGBT rights, the transformation of this country in my lifetime is extraordinary. The change in attitudes just since—and I'm not that old a guy. I know to you, I am. But this wasn't even talked about in high school when I was there. Very few people even felt comfortable being out. And now you have—I mean, the culture has changed completely on this.\nSo I guess what I'd say to you as a young person is, first of all, you should be pretty hopeful about the incredible progress that's been made on the issue you care about. With respect to a lot of restricted laws not just on LGBT issues, but also on reproductive health issues or contraception, a lot of those are being done at the State level. And people have different opinions on that on both sides. I would say that in our politics, we ignore State government more than we should. Everybody focuses on all the noise going on in Congress, but a lot of these issues are at the State level, and a lot of people don't even know who their State legislator is. They don't know what's going on in terms of laws that are passed in State houses.\nAnd this is why I say, regardless of your political views—Democrat, Republican, conservative, liberal, Independent—you have to vote. I know it doesn't seem like it makes a big difference, but we have a lower voting rate than any other advanced nation. In the last midterm election, less than 40 percent of people voted who were eligible to vote. Less than 40 percent. And then, people are surprised when crazy stuff happens. [Laughter] Well, if great, thoughtful people who are trying to look at both sides of issues and trying to sort things out, and believe in civility, et cetera—if they're not bothering voting, then the people who vote are the people who are the most polarized, least likely to be able to come up with compromises that achieve our goals. So you've got to vote. There's no excuse.\nMs. Ifill. Thanks, everybody.\nThe President. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2016-06-01", "title": "Remarks at the PBS NewsHour's \"Questions for President Obama\" Town Hall Meeting in Elkhart, Indiana"}

EARNEST: Before we start, I have some additional information about the rescue of the Thunderbird pilot whose aircraft crashed earlier this afternoon.\nAs you know, it is not uncommon for local military and law enforcement assets to be used in support of Secret Service operations during a presidential visit. This afternoon, after learning of the crash, a military helicopter that was operating in support of a Secret Service mission responded to the crash site just a few miles away from Peterson Air Force Base. This helicopter is part of a search-and-rescue unit that's based here in Colorado. The helicopter, in close coordination with the Air Force and the Secret Service, identified the site of the crash and landed to retrieve the pilot. The Secret Service agent onboard the helicopter is an EMT and was able to quickly evaluate the pilot's condition.\nAfter rescuing the pilot, the helicopter returned to Peterson Air Force Base and landed their local first responders who were able to evaluate the pilot further. Fortunately, the pilot did not sustain serious injury. The helicopter, after delivering the pilot, took off and resumed its mission in support of the President's drive from the United States Air Force Academy back to Peterson Air Force Base.\nThis is a good illustration of the skill, professionalism and judgment that our men and women in the military and the Secret Service display every day. The President benefits from that service every day and is deeply appreciative of what our men and women in the military and the Secret Service do. Obviously we don't frequently have the opportunity to tell that story, and obviously today I'm pleased to have the opportunity to do so.\nMany aspects of the crash are still under investigation, so there's not much more that I can say about it at this point. But I'm sure this is something that the Department of Defense and the United States Air Force will take a look at and they can answer additional questions you may have on it.\nQ: Can you describe the conversation between the President and the pilot?\nMR. EARNEST: As I mentioned, the pilot fortunately did not sustain serious injury, so he was up, walking around, and the President had an opportunity to walk over and shake his hand. The pilot saluted the President and, as I mentioned in my statement earlier, the President was obviously pleased to have the opportunity to both express his relief that the pilot was not seriously injured. The President did thank him for his service to the country, and the President advised the pilot that this might be a good time for him to contact his wife and let her know that he's okay.\nQ: Do you know the name of the pilot? And do you have any information about what led to the incident in the air and how he managed to survive it?\nMR. EARNEST: Josh, I don't know the name of the pilot. Obviously the Air Force has a standard operating procedure for publicizing information like that, so once that information can be released I'm sure the Air Force will release it.\nI don't have any additional details about what conditions may have contributed to the crash of the aircraft. That obviously will be the subject of a careful investigation that will be conducted by the Air Force. So for additional information about that investigation I'd refer you to the Air Force.\nQ: Did the pilot come to that hangar? Did the President ask to meet with him and that's why he was there? Or how did that come about?\nMR. EARNEST: Once the pilot was rescued by the helicopter, they brought him to where local first responders were, and so that's why he was at that location. But that did happen to be the location where -- that would be along the route of the President's motorcade on the way to the airplane. So the pilot and the first responders were, in this instance, literally on the way to the plane. So the motorcade stopped and the President had an opportunity to visit briefly with the pilot but also to thank the first responders who reacted quickly to attend to him.\nQ: You said the helicopter return to its job of overseeing the motorcade movement. But the pilot would have been rescued before the motorcade was underway, right?\nMR. EARNEST: Just so you understand the timeline, the helicopter was at the Air Force Base because the President had not left from the Air Force Academy yet. So when they were informed of the crash they responded quickly, identified the crash location, were able to rescue the pilot, bring him back to the Air Force Base. Once they returned to the Air Force Base they were able to essentially allow first responders to do the work of evaluating the pilot. So he was offloaded from the helicopter, and the helicopter was able to take off and went back and fulfilled its mission related to the President's motorcade trip back to Peterson Air Force Base.\nQ: Was it just one Secret Service person on the helicopter -- so it was just piloted by one person?\nMR. EARNEST: It's my understanding that there was one Secret Service agent that was aboard the helicopter, and that Secret Service agent did happen to be an EMT. In order to ensure effective coordination and communication between the military and the Secret Service when there is a military helicopter that's conducting operations in support of a Secret Service mission, then it is not uncommon for Secret Service personnel to be on board the helicopter.\nSo this is a helicopter that is operated by military pilots because it's a military helicopter. But to ensure effective coordination and communication in support of a Secret Service mission, a Secret Service agent is aboard the helicopter. In this case, the Secret Service agent happened to be an EMT and was able to put those skills to work to evaluate the condition of the pilot.\nQ: So it was a military helicopter that a Secret Service agent happened to be on.\nMR. EARNEST: That's correct. And again, the Secret Service agent was onboard the helicopter because the helicopter was operating in support of the Secret Service mission. And it is just a coincidence that the military helicopter that was operating in support of the Secret Service mission actually is typically part of a search-and-rescue unit. And so they obviously had skills that were put to relevant use here in terms of rescuing the pilot whose aircraft had crashed.\nQ: This was a rescue unit of what branch of the military?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know. I assume that it is an Air Force search-and-rescue unit, but I'll see if I can get that information for you.\nQ: Is everybody good on the plane? The President said yesterday that he wanted to increase Social Security benefits for seniors. It seemed like the first time we had heard that from the President, although he's talked before in the past about bolstering it. So I'm wondering if you could put some more meat on the bones about what exactly the President is proposing there, if we're going to see an actual proposal, or just if this was him maybe misstating what he's said before about wanting to strengthen the system but not actually strengthening -- or improved benefits?\nMR. EARNEST: No, the President -- let me start by saying that you obviously had the opportunity to see the President's speech in person and you understand that the President was talking about his commitment to ensuring that Americans all across the country get a fair shot and a fair shake. And part of that is ensuring that Americans across the country have access to a secure and dignified retirement.\nMany Americans rely heavily on the benefits that they get from Social Security. These are obviously benefits they have -- from a system that they have paid into. And dating back to 2007, the President has discussed a variety of ways to strengthen Social Security both in terms of extending the solvency of the Social Security trust fund, but also potentially strengthening the assistance that it provides to Americans across the country.\nLet me finish because this part is key, too. There were a lot of ideas that have been put forward about how exactly to do that. And one of the ideas that the President has previously mentioned is the idea that you can essentially ask wealthier Americans to pay more into the system. Right now, every American pays -- I think it's about the first $110,000 that they make every year, they pay a percentage of that income into the Social Security system. There have been a variety of proposals about raising that cap. Obviously if you make less than $110,000, then you don't have to pay -- you wouldn't have to pay an incremental increase because your income does not exceed that level. So this is essentially a way that you could ask wealthier Americans to pay more into the system.\nNow, what the President discussed in 2007 is that he made a campaign promise that he would not raise taxes on individuals who make $200,000 a year or couples who make more than $250,000 a year. So one proposal that the President discussed in his first campaign for the presidency was potentially raising the cap above that $250,000 threshold. Again, that would be a way that wealthier Americans could pay more into the Social Security system. This would not add an additional burden to middle-class families, but it would enhance the resources that are available to strengthen the Social Security system either by extending solvency of the trust fund, or increasing benefits, or both.\nAnd so the President essentially, yesterday, was indicating that proposals to increase the solvency of the Social Security trust fund, enhance benefits, and do so without adding a burden to the middle class is consistent with his vision of expanding economic opportunity for the middle class and ensuring everybody in America gets a fair shake by getting access to a secure and dignified retirement.\nQ: But just to be clear, what was the proposal that the President has made in the past to increase benefits? I understand the things that you talked about to increase solvency, but that different than the benefits. So what is the proposal that the President has made that would have people taking more money out of the system?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what the President talked about in 2007 is that there are a variety of ways that we can consider strengthening retirement security for Americans across the country. I don't think the President has ever been in a position in which he ruled out increasing benefits that could be available to seniors.\nQ: He did the opposite. He's advocated reducing benefits through chained CPI, and of course that was part of negotiations.\nMR. EARNEST: I appreciate you raising that because that is not true. We discussed that as a policy proposal because that is something that Republicans advocated. That is something that Republicans wanted. And the President -- the whole notion of a grand bargain is that Republicans would get something that they want and Democrats, including the President, would get something that he wants. So that is something that Republicans put on the table, something that Republicans put on the table because it's something that they support. That is not something that the President ever supported; it's something that the President acknowledged that could be part of a grander bargain that would do a bunch of things, including strengthening Social Security and reducing the deficit.\nSo that's never been something that we've proposed or supported. It's something that we've indicated that would be acceptable as part of an acceptable grand bargain that Republicans advocated.\nQ: I think my point is that you guys put that in a budget, admittedly as part of this grand bargain. You've never put in a budget how you would increase benefits to Americans. And so I think there's two parts of the question -- one, what would that benefit increase look like? Is this an actual proposal, or just a broader policy thing? And the other is, this is obviously been a huge touchstone in the Democratic presidential campaign. Bernie Sanders has hammered this issue time and again. And so I think a lot of his allies, a lot of progressives are seeing this as a fig leaf by the administration to say, okay, now we're supporting increasing Social Security benefits in an attempt to unify the party. So can you speak to that, and if that is not at all intended, or if that is sort of it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I just want to go back to this because this is important. And I know that this is something that back in 2011 and 2012 and 2013 that we discussed a lot, but it's important for everybody to understand who may not have been covering this issue as closely as you were back at that time that the reason the so-called chained CPI was included in our budget was not an indication that we supported that policy proposal. That has never been the position of the administration, and it's certainly never been the position of the President.\nWe did include it in our budget to illustrate what kind of impact that could have on our fiscal situation, but only as part of a broader so-called grand bargain, something that -- the reason it would be included in a grand bargain is because it's something that Republicans were asking for. That's the essence of a grand bargain. So that has never been our policy position.\nQ: -- policy position?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm having flashbacks of 2013. We made very clear that -- yes, that is traditionally what a budget is used for. But in the years that we included chained CPI in our budget we were very specific about the fact that this is not a proposal that we support, but rather we would include it in our budget to illustrate what a potential grand bargain could look like. And the essence of a grand bargain is that Republicans would get something that they want and Democrats would get something that we want.\nThe reason that a grand bargain did not succeed in being completed is Republicans never wanted to be in a position of actually considering what Democrats wanted. So it's very important for people to understand, the President does not support, has never supported this so-called chain CPI proposal. That is something that Republicans wanted, and the President indicated a willingness to try to find common ground with Republicans if he were to get something that he wanted, too, in a grand bargain. Unfortunately, Republicans were never willing to actually do that.\nBut to answer your question more directly, I would not at this point anticipate a more detailed white paper policy proposal from the administration. I think the point that the President is making -- which, again, is consistent with what he said back in 2007 -- is that if we want to find ways to expand economic opportunity for the middle class and make sure that everybody in America is getting a fair shake we need to look creatively for ways to ensure that people can have access to a secure and dignified retirement. And one way that you could do that would be to strengthen the Social Security system, potentially by extending the life of the trust fund, potentially increasing benefits, and doing that without adding an additional burden to seniors or to middle-class families.\nAnd that's the point that the President was making. I recognize that there are other Democrats that have advocated for this position, too, and we obviously are pleased. I think this does go to something that the President was talking about in the town hall, which is that despite the longer-than-expected Democratic primary that, frankly, has been more competitive than many people expected, there has been remarkable unanimity of opinion around a core set of values. And there are significant stylistic differences between the two Democratic candidates, but when it comes to the core values that Democrats are fighting for, there's a lot of overlap among the proposals that have been floated by the two candidates and by the current Democratic President.\nQ: Let's go to another one of those. Bernie Sanders today introduced a bill on Puerto Rico that obviously differs significantly from the package that was negotiated by the administration and House Democrats and House Republicans. I'm wondering what your guys' reaction to that bill is -- if you think it's helpful, or hurts your chances of getting the legislation that you support passed, and if you support Senator Sanders's legislation.\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't seen Senator Sanders's proposal, so I don't anticipate at this point that we would comment on it. I'll just be clear about what we discussed earlier when I think you asked me about this a couple of weeks ago. There are certain aspects of the House bill that the administration does not support. And these are proposals that would allow some employers in Puerto Rico, for example, to pay younger workers below minimum wage. I think Republicans would have a tough time articulating how exactly that's going to improve the fiscal condition of the island of Puerto Rico. It seems mean-spirited to me.\nBut this is a compromise proposal, and the President is willing to go along with this compromise because he does believe that this House proposal does sufficiently give Puerto Rican authorities -- Puerto Rican officials the authorities that they need to restructure that debt. There are also built into the legislation proposals for holding Puerto Rican officials accountable for implementing needed reforms to address the long-term fiscal challenges that are facing Puerto Rico.\nThe President believes this is an important priority, because right now there are 3 million Americans living in Puerto Rico that are facing an increasingly dire situation because the government of Puerto Rico can't pay its bills. It's having an impact on the local education system. It's having an impact on the local health care system. And the President is hopeful that Democrats and Republicans in Congress will get together and pass this bill so that we can start to address some of those problems.\nSo the bill that's been put forward in the House is one that the administration supports, not because we believe it's perfect, not because we support every provision that's included, but because we do believe it would provide Puerto Rico the relief that's necessary to address their many problems.\nQ: Josh, is the White House satisfied with the State Department's response to this missing aspect of this press briefing video, and specifically the fact that the State Department is not even investigating further to determine who was responsible for this and why they did it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I don't know a whole lot about this particular situation. It's an unusual one, to say the least. It sounds like the State Department has concluded that somebody made a specific decision to edit the video. Now, first of all, that seems inconsistent with the whole purpose of a public briefing. Second, what does seem consistent with the spirit of a public briefing is a full, complete and accurate transcript, which I understand was released by the State Department and has been publicly available since the day of that briefing. I also understand that video footage that was not altered of the particular briefing has been available through the Department of Defense that regularly records those briefings.\nI'm not really sure what that person thought that they were doing by editing the video, but it's not consistent with the goals of the briefing or consistent with the standard practice that is observed by other government agencies that hold regular briefings, including the White House.\nQ: If somebody did that on your staff, would you want to find out who they were and fire them?\nMR. EARNEST: I feel quite confident in saying that no one would make a decision like that about a briefing that I was involved in without telling me. I think we benefit from the fact that we have a somewhat smaller operation at the White House.\nBut, look, what the State Department has done is clarified exactly what procedures should be followed, and they expressed a lot of confidence that something like this would never happen again.\nQ: This isn't some other part -- I mean, this is your government. This is President Obama's government. This is an executive agency. It would seem like -- I mean, it's not like somehow they're different or separate. They're part of your operation. I mean, in some ways you oversee them.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, not really. I think what is true is that it is important for government agencies to be functioning consistent with the kinds of values that are articulated at the White House. And the clarification that the State Department has issued as it relates to their policy for issuing videos of public briefings is consistent with the policy that we've pursued at the White House.\nQ: So, on that, your counterpart at the State Department has said the reason that they are not going to investigate this any further is that at the time that this happened there was no formal policy prohibiting this. So is there a formal policy at the White House that prohibits the editing of videos of your briefings? And if not, how are you confident that that won't happen?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm confident because I know that everyone that works on my staff at the White House understands that preserving the integrity of those kinds of transcripts and those videos is really important. So it's not uncommon, those of you who are close readers of transcripts that are issued by the White House, for clarifications and corrections to be issued. Those are always clearly marked. And that's an important principle.\nLook, I'm not aware of any manual that is handed out to employees at the White House that governs these kinds of things, but I'm confident that everyone at the White House understands why it's important to preserve the integrity of these materials.\nLook, I also understand -- I guess I would also make the point that I think a whole lot of people at the State Department understood the importance of preserving the integrity of these kinds of materials because the complete, accurate, and unedited transcript was issued on the same day of the briefing and has been available on their website from the beginning. The same is true of the video that was posted by the Department of Defense. So I feel quite confident in saying that this is a widely understood principle in public affairs operations across the federal government.\nQ: Can you give us your reaction to Paul Ryan endorsing Donald Trump today, saying that he'll vote for him?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't think I have a reaction to share, but thank you for giving me the opportunity.\nQ: Does the President share Hillary Clinton's view that Donald Trump is unfit for office and shouldn't be able to have the nuclear codes? That was part of her argument today.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, those are obviously the words that she included in her speech and represent her view. The President has had a number of opportunities to describe his view of the job and his concern about some of Mr. Trump's comments and what they say about how he would handle the important responsibilities of the presidency. But I'll let the President's words speak for themselves. Over the last few weeks, you've gotten plenty of them.\nQ: -- in terms of the nuclear codes before. Is that consistent with --\nMR. EARNEST: Can you say that one more time?\nQ: You've used that analogy before in terms of somebody who has the nuclear codes.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, that's sort of the most vivid illustration of the substantial responsibilities that are invested in the presidency. And it's why the debate about who should succeed President Obama as the 45th President of the United States is an important one and one that is worth the time and attention of all of you and your news organizations, but also worth the time and attention of the American people who have to make a decision about what person and what kind of person is going to be entrusted with that substantial responsibility.\nBut, no, I don't think that is a reflection of a coordinated effort when it comes to language. I think that is just both Secretary Clinton and President Obama discussing, in vivid terms, the importance of this election.\nQ: Was Donald Trump in mind when the President was delivering his speech today and talking about the responsibilities of American leadership?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I feel confident in saying that he was not. The President was articulating the approach that he has taken to trying to advance U.S. interests around the world. And he used some examples of ordering military action to take terrorists who seek to do harm to the United States or our allies off the battlefield. He also described his approach to using diplomacy to try to advance our interests, particularly when it comes to preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. And his discussion of that approach I think reflected his own thinking after seven and a half years sitting in the Oval Office about how best to achieve America's goals around the world, particularly as it relates to maintaining our relationships with countries that are allies of the United States and with countries that aren't.\nQ: Did you have a chance to look into the renewing of the Iran sanctions after 2016 at all?\nMR. EARNEST: I thought I did. But why don't I give you something useful. I mean, what I can say -- well, I'll just give it a shot. We'll wing it. Look, there has been interest that members of Congress have articulated in this issue for quite some time. And we participate in those conversations, and we'll continue to do so, both with Democrats and Republicans.\nOur focus, however, right now is on ensuring Iran's continued compliance with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action that verifiably commits Iran to not developing or acquiring a nuclear weapon. And we continue to believe that we have the tools that are necessary to fulfill the terms of the agreement that we committed to, but also to hold Iran accountable, fulfilling their end of the bargain. And in order to effectively implement the Iran deal and to hold Iran accountable, and to coordinate with our allies and to fulfill our own responsibilities, we don't believe that additional legislation is required to do that. And that is what our focus has been on.\nWhat you also have noticed is that the United States continues to have significant concerns about other aspects of Iran's behavior that do not involve their nuclear weapons program. And those are concerns that relate to Iran's support for terrorism, the Iran regime's propensity for violating human rights, and Iran's support for destabilizing activities in the Middle East, and Iran's continued insistence on menacing our closest ally in the Middle East, Israel.\nThe administration continues to consider and apply tough sanctions against Iran for that kind of behavior. And the administration continues to have significant authorities in that area, and we continue to use those significant authorities in coordination with the rest of the international community.\nSo we'll continue to engage in a conversation with Congress right now, but our focus has been on implementing the JCPOA -- and that's something that does not require any additional legislative activity. And we're also interested in using existing sanctions authority to hold Iran accountable for other activities that are of significant concern to the United States. And we'll continue to consult with Congress about that because we know that there are members of Congress in both parties that share our concerns about that behavior, and those conversations will continue.\nQ: I think there is still an outstanding question, though -- even though, granting the point that you don't think you need additional legislation -- whether under the JCPOA, Congress could renew these sanctions without violating the deal. And we haven't really heard a definitive answer from the administration on that point.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I mean, I think what I can say is that we continue to be in close consultation with members of Congress about the most effective way to implement the JCPOA to achieve the desired result, which is continuing to verify that Iran is not able to develop or acquire a nuclear weapon. And that's what our focus continues to be on. There are some members of Congress that support that effort and there are some that don't. And our concern primarily has been about opponents of the deal using legislation to undermine it. And we've been explicit about our firm opposition to that kind of legislation.\nYou're asking a different question about whether or not there is legislation that can be consistent with implementing the deal. And that's something we'll continue to talk to Congress about.\nQ: Josh, can I ask, one of the things that was a little unusual about the speech today was when the President gave a fairly sensitive list of people who have been killed and captured on his watch, some of whom are familiar to Americans and some of whom probably aren't. And I was curious why he made the decision to list those people by name.\nMR. EARNEST: The President said that on a couple of other occasions. The President -- I recall a VFW speech where the President did that. I think what is true about many of those individuals that the President names is those were individuals who were taken off the battlefield because of the skill, professionalism and courage of members of the United States Air Force. Those were -- not all of those individuals, but some of those individuals were removed from the battlefield by military aircraft, manned or unmanned.\nSo speaking to Air Force cadets in front of a large Air Force audience, it seemed appropriate in this instance to describe situations in which the President had called upon members of the Air Force to take action that keeps us safe. But the President also I think went to some length to describe situations in which the threat of military force can be used to back meaningful and impactful diplomatic efforts, whether that's removing Syria's declared chemical weapons stockpile or reaching an Iran deal. That's how diplomacy and the world's most effective fighting force can go hand-in-hand to advance our interests.\nAnd I think that's the point the President was trying to make. I mean, in the instances that the President laid out, diplomacy was not really a viable alternative.\nQ: -- in part to concerns that he hasn't used force aggressively enough to defend the nation, or trying to make the point that he has?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the President was just trying to help people understand exactly what his approach has been. And his approach has included ordering robust military force to eliminate dangerous terrorists from being able to threaten the United States. But in other situations, the mere threat of military force backed by robust skilled and tenacious diplomacy has succeeded in advancing our interests and making America safer.\nAll right, thanks.\nEND 3:48 P.M.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118129", "text": "Government and Business Leaders Gather in San Francisco at CEM7 and the Mission Innovation Ministerial to Accelerate Clean Energy Deployment and to Double Clean Energy R&D Investments over Five Years to $30 Billion per Year\nPresident Obama's leadership has helped catalyze the largest investment in clean energy in U.S. history and has expanded that progress globally, providing the opportunity to advance low-carbon economies, create jobs, and establish entirely new industries that will drive global wealth and prosperity. We are already starting to see progress. Last year, the world set two new records -global investment in renewable energy was the highest ever, and, for the first time, more than half of the world's new electric capacity came from clean sources. In addition, by 2020, global energy efficiency investment in buildings is projected to increase from $90 billion in 2014 to over $125 billion. But we have more work to do.\nThat is why, today, the United States is hosting global energy leaders for the first time since the Paris Agreement at the Seventh Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM7) and the inaugural Mission Innovation (MI) Ministerial in San Francisco. At the meetings, energy leaders from 23 countries and the European Union, representing 90 percent of clean energy investment and 75 percent of global carbon emissions, will take ambitious action to help implement policies and solutions to meet their countries' climate and clean energy goals. In particular, these countries are meeting with the dual goal of accelerating the deployment of today's clean energy technologies through the CEM and investing in innovation for the technologies of the future through Mission Innovation.\nLast year, in Paris, the President and the leaders of 19 countries launched Mission Innovation, a new effort to double public investment in clean energy research and development over five years. Today, those 20 nations, and the European Union as the newest partner, are announcing their specific plans to meet that target, and committing to invest nearly $30 billion per year in public clean energy research and development by 2021. In addition, today, at the CEM, 21 countries, the European Union, nearly 60 companies and organizations, and 10 subnational governments, are also making more than $1.5 billion in commitments to accelerate the deployment of clean energy and increase energy access - including towards three new, high-impact campaigns to promote corporate sourcing of renewables, commercial and industrial energy efficiency, and advanced cooling technologies. Today's actions show that the transition to a clean energy future is inevitable and every sector and every level of government is involved.\nThis clean energy transition is reinforced by findings released today by Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) that renewable energy is expected to grow substantially in the next 25 years. In fact, globally, renewable energy installations are on track to increase more than 600 percent by 2040, adding nearly 4,900 GW of wind, solar, and other sources. However, even with these changes, global temperatures are expected to continue to rise at an alarming pace. In fact, according to BNEF for the power sector to make its share of contributions toward limiting global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius, an additional 3,000 GW of renewable energy and $2.9 trillion in investment will be required over the next 25 years.\nThat is why today's meeting and announcements are so important, so countries can continue to work together to accelerate the transition to the clean energy economy of tomorrow in collaboration with our smartest scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs.\nDRIVING GLOBAL INVESTMENT IN CLEAN ENERGY INNOVATION\nMission Innovation: On November 30, 2015, during the first day of the Paris climate negotiations, President Obama joined 19 world leaders to launch Mission Innovation, an initiative to double public investments in clean energy research and development investment over five years. Today, at the inaugural Mission Innovation Ministerial, all 21  Mission Innovation partners, including the European Union as a new member, released their respective baseline investment and doubling plans.\nCollectively, these 21 partners  committed to double nearly $15 billion per year in baseline funding for global public investment in clean energy research and development, reaching just under a combined total of $30 billion per year by 2021. Today's announcement exceeds the original baseline funding estimate of $10 billion per year.\nThe Mission Innovation partners also approved an Enabling Framework and created a Steering Committee to support implementation of the initiative. The Mission Innovation partners represent well over 80 percent of global public investment in clean energy research and development. These efforts under Mission Innovation represent an unprecedented acceleration of research and development efforts for innovative clean energy technologies. In fact, earlier this year, President Obama pledged to seek to double $6.4 billion in clean energy research and development funding for Mission Innovation for the United States.\nBreakthrough Energy Coalition: Ministers also met with leaders of the Breakthrough Energy Coalition, including Bill Gates and other investors, who are interested in pursuing investments in Mission Innovation countries, underscoring the critical link between government innovation and entrepreneurship to bring affordable clean energy technologies to market.\nClean Energy Investment Initiative: The United States is continuing to show our  leadership in clean energy investment. In addition to our Mission Innovation commitment, one year ago, the Obama Administration announced over $4 billion in commitments by foundations, institutional investors, and other long-term investors to scale up clean-energy innovation and climate change solutions, as part of the Clean Energy Investment Initiative. Today, additional private-sector stakeholders are making new commitments to accelerate clean energy innovation and expand investment in climate solutions:\n• Wells Fargo is increasing support for building efficiency startups through the next round of its $10 million philanthropic Innovation Incubator (IN2) program, administered by the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) National Renewable Energy Laboratory;\n• Nia Community Fund is making a new $5 million investment commitment for clean energy solutions, Additionally, Nia has partnered with Green Alpha Advisors to build broader clean-energy investment options in public markets;\n• 12 universities, Second Nature, and Clean Energy Trust are launching Campus Cleantech Pilots, a new partnership to accelerate clean energy technology commercialization by opening universities as first-of-a-kind testing and demonstration platforms for startup;\n• Stanford University and the Stanford Linear Accelerator are announcing Bits & Watts, a research partnership to accelerate the integration of more than 50 percent renewable energy into the electricity grid;\n• Hawaii's Energy Excelerator is building on follow-on seed investments and sharing its clean energy startup accelerator model throughout California;\n• PRIME Coalition, which facilitates catalytic charitable investment in early-stage climate innovation ventures, is expanding with new support from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, among other foundations; and\n• Mercer Investment Consulting will undertake a new project with the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL) to educate U.S. public pension fund fiduciaries about the potential legal and economic risks associated with high-carbon portfolios and their opportunities to reduce those risks; as well as a new project with Divest/Invest Philanthropy covering the landscape of investment products available to this coalition of over 140 foundations and other investors representing $12 billion in total assets that have committed at least 5 percent of their respective endowments to investing in clean energy and climate solutions.\nIn the coming weeks, the Administration will take two new actions to further expand private-sector investment in clean energy innovation and  accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy. DOE's Clean Energy Investment Center is launching a first-of-its-kind Lab Partnering Service that will facilitate direct, streamlined access for the public to the clean-energy technology expertise of the National Laboratories. The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is also publishing a draft rule to improve and permanently extend its Early Stage Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program, focused on strengthening financing options for private funds that invest in clean energy technology companies and other early-stage, innovation-driven small businesses.\nSUPPORTING PARIS IMPLEMENTATION AND CLEAN ENERGY DEPLOYMENT THROUGH THE CLEAN ENERGY MINISTERIAL\nToday, we are announcing that in order to support the implementation of nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement, the Clean Energy Ministerial, an initiative that was started by the United States in 2010 and now involves 23 countries and the European Union, is launching an enhanced effort - called \"CEM 2.0.\" CEM 2.0 pairs high-level political engagement of energy ministers with sustained initiatives and high-visibility clean energy technology and policy campaigns to provide a powerful combination for accelerating clean energy policy and technology deployment. To support transparency and track progress, CEM members agreed to support the International Energy Agency (IEA) in taking on the role as the Secretariat. Nine CEM members - Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Japan, Norway, Sweden, the United States - committed to providing start-up funding to support the first three years of the new Secretariat. Also, the European Union today announces that, in cooperation with a member state, they will host CEM9 in 2018.\nToday, the IEA confirmed the clean energy potential of the NDCs submitted for the Paris Agreement. Based on analysis the World Energy Outlook series, the IEA shows that full implementation by all countries of their NDCs would increase global solar generation thirty fold and wind generation seven fold, when compared with 2010. According to IEA, this level of deployment would go hand in hand with further declines in costs: by 2030, IEA anticipates the reduction in the cost of wind and solar would be more than 90 percent of that required in IEA's 450 Scenario, a 2 degree stabilization scenario. New targets and support schemes are set to increase the renewable deployment to 2030 beyond the NDCs.\nTo set us down this path, Secretary Moniz and fellow ministers announced financial support for the CEM's Clean Energy Solutions Center and additional actions to decarbonize the power sector. The ministers also announced new campaigns in three high-impact areas - corporate sourcing of renewables, commercial and industrial energy efficiency, and advanced cooling technologies - that can cut global carbon emissions while driving economic growth.New commitments were also announced that will advance super-efficient lighting, transform power systems for the 21st century, improve energy access, and enhance the deployment of clean energy policy expertise. The commitments build on the more than 154 U.S. companies that have already joined the American Businesses Act on Climate pledge. Today's commitments include:\nProviding Technical Assistance for NDC Implementation: The Clean Energy Solutions Center offers no-cost, fast response expert assistance on clean energy policy and finance measures to countries around the world. Following the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21), the Solutions Center serves as a critical component in helping countries implement their Nationally-Determined Contributions (NDCs) and other climate and clean energy goals. In March, Australia committed $722,600 to the Clean Energy Solutions Center with a focus on the Asia Pacific region. Today, Sweden announced that it is providing $200,000 in support toward the Center, with an emphasis on support for Clean Energy Solutions Center technical assistance in Africa and the Caribbean.\nDecarbonizing the Power Sector: GO15, an association of 18 of the world's largest power grid operators, commits to working with the CEM to support programs that address operational, technological and financial challenges of power grid modernization. The ClimateWorks Foundation announces a strategic alignment of their philanthropic programs with CEM programs that support power sector decarbonization in Mexico, India, China and other CEM member governments. The energy ministries of Canada, Mexico, and the United States also announced their intention to jointly carry out a North American Renewable Integration Study - the single largest renewable energy integration study ever undertaken.\nIncreasing Corporate Sourcing of Renewables: The new Corporate Sourcing of Renewables Campaign focuses on driving additional deployment of renewables across the range of CEM member countries. RE100, a global business initiative led by The Climate Group in partnership with CDP, as an action of the We Mean Business coalition, has estimated that if 1,000 of the world's most influential businesses become 100 percent powered by renewables, they could decarbonize almost a tenth of all electricity used worldwide and cut more than 1,000Mt of CO2 every year. Already, corporate purchase of power in the United States has supported more than 8 GW of projects, up from just 0.6 GW in 2009, and globally more and more companies are seeking out clean energy. CEM member governments and partners joining the CEM campaign will work to significantly increase the number of companies powering operations with renewable energy and deploy supportive policies and resources that can help facilitate additional corporate sourcing of renewables. Today we are announcing that:\n*  Germany and Denmark are announcing that they are leading this campaign, and China, the European Union, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the  United States are joining.\n*  International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance (REBA), RE100, World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), World Resources Institute (WRI), are also joining the initiative in order to scale corporate procurement and drive additional deployment of renewables across the range of CEM member countries.\n*  Apple commits to work with CEM countries and partners to spur the development and procurement of renewable energy within its global supply chain. Apple is working with its suppliers to install more than 4 gigawatts of new clean energy worldwide, including 2 gigawatts in China by 2020. Apple's supply chain is the single biggest source of its comprehensive carbon footprint, so the company is committing to actively engage with ministers and partners in the US, China and other CEM countries to drive the transition to green manufacturing.\n*  Autodesk is announcing three milestones: 1) Powering their facilities with 100 percent renewable energy - four years ahead of schedule. 2) Deepening their commitment to 'credible' renewable energy procurement - procuring energy that is additional, local and that spurs innovation. 3) Setting an internal price on carbon. These inter-related activities will accelerate progress toward Autodesk's science-based greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction target.\"\n*  Facebook announces commitments to: 1) Fund the REBA initiatives; 2) Collaborate to expand REBA internationally, 3) Work through REBA to raise awareness and help other companies navigate the complexities of PPAs; 4) Work closely with utilities to develop green tariffs; and 5) Source 50 percent of our energy from clean energy sources in 2018.\n*  Google commits to work in collaboration with national governments, renewable energy buyers and suppliers, NGOs, and others across CEM members to convene a group of stakeholders to survey the policy and regulatory structures critical to enabling corporate purchasing of renewable energy and make policy recommendations for how to further unlock corporate renewable energy demand in CEM members.\n*  Microsoft is announcing that they will power their datacenters with energy that is at least 50 percent wind, hydro and solar by 2018 and 60 percent early next decade. This is a significant given that the IT sector including Microsoft are some of the fastest growing energy users in the world, consuming as much energy as a small state and in decades to come as much as mid-size nations. Microsoft is actively working through REBA to deliver on these goals in markets around the world. In addition, Microsoft pledged they will maintain 100 percent carbon neutrality on top of this new commitment.\n*  Wells Fargo commits to purchasing renewable energy to power 100 percent of operations by 2017 with a transition to long-term agreements that fund new sources of green power by 2020.\n*  While the CEM campaign is encouraging action by companies of all sizes, it is driving the biggest, most influential companies to make a 100 percent renewable power commitment and join RE100. The companies already signed up to this initiative were recognized during the Ministerial and the following companies announced they are joining RE100 taking the total number of committed companies in RE100 to 65.\n*  Dentsu Aegis Network is committing to sourcing 100 percent renewable electricity by 2020. The company recognizes that de-coupling carbon from growth will allow it to become resilient to resource scarcity and price fluctuations - delivering on carbon goals while achieving long term financial savings.\n*  Equinix has a long-term goal of using 100 percent renewable electricity with an interim goal of reaching 50 percent (against a 2015 baseline) by 2017.\n*  Interface, Inc. is committing to operate its factories on 100 percent renewable electricity by 2020. Based in the U.S., the company is already sourcing 94 percent renewable energy across its global operations.\n*  Tetra Pak is committing to powering its operations with 100 percent renewable electricity by 2030, with an interim goal to reach 80 percent by 2020. By joining RE100, Tetra Pak will benefit from expert guidance and peer-to-peer learning on renewable electricity options in different markets.\n*  TD Bank Group, the first Canadian company to join RE100, has sourced renewable electricity equivalent to 100 percent of its global operations since 2015. It also generates solar energy at 124 locations, including at its net zero energy branch in Florida.\nDeveloping Climate Smart Cooling Technologies: The new Advanced Cooling (AC) Campaign challenges governments and industry to develop and deploy at scale super-efficient, smart, climate friendly and affordable cooling technologies critical for prosperous and healthy societies furthering the goals of the Montreal Protocol. Access to cooling can improve health, productivity, economic growth, and educational outcomes. For example, improving the average efficiency of air conditioners sold in 2030 by 30 percent could reduce emissions by up to 25 billion tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) over the lifetime of the equipment and reduce peak electricity demand by as much as 340-790 gigawatts. To help achieve this goal, today:\n• Canada, China, India, Saudi Arabia, and United States are joining the Advanced Cooling Challenge and are committing to promote greater use of cost-effective, energy efficient air conditioning and refrigeration equipment through appliance efficiency policies and programs.\n• The U.S. government is partnering with the Air Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute (AHRI), the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), the Alliance for Responsible Atmospheric Policy, and other governments and international organizations to conduct critical research regarding the safe use of mildly flammable (A2L) and flammable (A3) refrigerants as low-global-warming-potential (low-GWP) alternatives to hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in the air conditioning and refrigeration sectors. This research will support the acceleration of updated safety standards to allow widespread use of these climate-friendly refrigerants in the United States and internationally. In support of this effort, the DOE is contributing $3 million in funding, AHRI is contributing $1 million, and ASHRAE is contributing $1.2 million.\n• Daikin Applied is committed to developing equipment-specific demand response control solutions for our entire portfolio of HVAC products and systems. Intelligent Equipment™ from Daikin Applied is a cloud-enabled controls solution that forges a new path to HVAC unit efficiency. Daikin is already developing Automated Demand Response (ADR) for Intelligent Equipment, which will allow customers to maximize their energy efficiency and offset usage from peak hours, all at the unit level. Intelligent Equipment with ADR will also help utilities meet growing energy demands.\n• Danfoss commits to speed the adoption of energy efficient equipment by providing a full array of components for low-GWP refrigerants, including deploying ejector technology which can improve the efficiency of CO2 systems by as much as 20 percent over traditional refrigerants in warm climates, and invest in a $5 million Application Development Center to help OEMs redesign traditional systems and to test them, with the aim of improving system efficiency.\n• Goodman commits to the development of climate friendly heating and cooling systems that use low GWP refrigerants and provide high levels of energy efficient performance.\n• Honeywell commits to increasing its production of its low-global-warming-potential (GWP) refrigerants, insulation materials, aerosols and solvents and anticipates spending nearly $900 million through 2019on research & development and new capacity to produce these next generation solutions, which have global warming potential equal to or better than carbon dioxide and at least 99.9 percent lower than the products they replace.\n• Ingersoll Rand commits to spending $500 million by 2020 for research and development to deliver high efficiency and low GWP heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) and refrigeration solutions to global markets before 2030.\n• SFO commits to assessing its existing cooling equipment policies and programs and install, where appropriate, super-efficient, smart, climate-friendly and affordable cooling technologies within its facilities.\n• The Children's Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF) has assembled a team of experts to help governments and industry around the world, including in India and China, to increase the energy efficiency of air conditioners in parallel with the phase down of super-polluting HFC refrigerants. CIFF is providing a grant of $12.8 million to support this work. This work will complement CIFF's comparable support over the past several years to phasing down super-pollutant HFCs and strengthening climate protection under the Montreal Protocol.\n• The ClimateWorks Foundation commits to work with governments, industry, and other stakeholders to make cooling accessible, affordable, efficient, and climate-friendly, through a program of research, outreach and communications work.\n• The Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development (IGSD) is assembling an expert energy efficiency team to work with governments and industries around the world to improve the efficiencies of air conditioner. The IGSD team will provide policy support and technical assistance for select countries and their industries. This will help phase out super-polluting refrigerants known as HFCs, while also supporting the switch to more efficient air conditioning technologies.\n• The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) supports the challenge's goals to spur breakthrough action and innovation by governments, businesses, and non-profit groups, as well as consumer awareness, to advance high-performance cooling equipment. NRDC is committed to working with government officials, community leaders, businesses, local experts, and academics across the globe - including in China, India and the United States - to develop and deploy an integrated approach that enables a transition to affordable, low- and high-tech space cooling solutions, such as super-efficient air conditioners, fans and cool roofs. NRDC believes these options will maximize energy savings, improve air quality, reduce greenhouse gases and heat island effects, and ensure all individuals can be cool and comfortable in their homes, businesses, and vehicles.\nImproving Energy Management: The new Energy Management Campaign aims to secure 50,001 global certifications to International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 50001 by 2020. ISO 50001, the global energy management system standard, has a proven framework of requirements to transform the way organizations manage energy and meet sustainable energy goals. Approximately 15,000 facilities worldwide have been certified to ISO 50001 since its launch in 2011, realizing energy improvements of 10 percent or more, often through low-cost or no-cost changes to operations. Broad implementation of ISO 50001 across commercial and industrial sectors globally could drive cumulative energy savings of approximately 62 exajoules by 2030, saving over $600 billion in energy costs and avoiding 6,500 Mt of CO2 emissions.

To help achieve these shared goals:\n*  The Government of Italy is announcing that it is providing $7.2 million in new funding to support the World Bank Group's Lighting Global program, including its groundbreaking quality assurance framework, increasing the Italian government's total support for the program to $20.75 million since its first investment at the inaugural CEM.\n*  The Governments of Canada and United Arab Emirates endorse the Global Lighting Challenge, which was launched in Paris during COP21, joining the 14 original CEM members who had participated in the Challenge launch.\n*  Power Africa announces a $1.5 million multi-year commitment to support the expansion of Global LEAP+RBF to East Africa. Global LEAP+RBF is an innovative new partnership to drive and demonstrate scale in the global off-grid appliance market.\n*  The United States is announcing the third round of the Global LEAP Awards, featuring competitions for the world's highest quality, most cost-effective and energy efficient off-grid appliances. The 2016-17 awards will be supported by Power Africa, through the U.S. Department of Energy, and the U.S. Agency for International Development's (USAID) U.S. Global Development Lab.\n*  Cleveland Clinic is joining the GLC and so the retrofits of all their hospitals as well as any new construction will count towards the global 10 billion goal. Cleveland Clinics are committed to tracking not only the cost and emissions savings but also the health benefits of advanced energy efficient lighting options. Cleveland Clinic expects to retrofit 500,000 tubes and bulbs to LED over five years.\n*  Global LEAP, together with UK's Department for International Development, the ClimateWorks Foundation and Power for All, are convening a high-level event, \"EnergyAccessX\", where entrepreneurs, thought leaders, technologists, designers, and policy experts will gather to discuss the role of distributed renewables in advancing universal energy access.\n*  Philips Lighting is committing to sell more than two billion energy efficient LED light bulbs by 2020. Reaching this goal is estimated to save an amount of energy equivalent to that generated by 60 medium-sized coal-fired power stations with emissions equivalent to those from 24 million cars by 2020. The company also reaffirms its pledge to make its global operations carbon neutral by 2020 and said that it expects electricity for its U.S. operations to be 100 percent from renewable sources later this year.\n*  MGM Resorts International is announcing that they are joining the GLC, building on their commitment 2014, to retrofit 1.3 million traditional light bulbs to high efficiency lamps. At this point in the initiative, MGM has already installed over 850,000 lamps, and is as such over half way towards its goal.\n*  SFO commits to installing high-efficiency and high-quality lighting products within all retrofit projects and new construction projects.\n*  Washington State is committing to require new investment in cost-effective, high-efficiency lighting by strengthening the state's energy code, ensuring its utilities capture all cost-effective electricity efficiency opportunities, growing state and private sector investment in modern lighting for public buildings, and securing safe and effective LED lighting for all streets and highways in the state. Washington should be able to achieve more than 2.5 million megawatt-hours of energy efficiency improvement over the next 20 years.\n*  XPRIZE is announcing their commitment to incentivize innovation and technologies that aim to provide energy abundance for all, including off-grid populations. The development of prizes and other activities to address energy access follows the NRG COSIA Carbon XPRIZE - a $20 million global competition over 4.5 years to address carbon emissions by incentivizing technologies that convert CO? emissions into valuable everyday products like building materials and alternative fuels. The Carbon XPRIZE and future energy innovation challenges are part of XPRIZE's growing portfolio of Energy & Environment prizes and long-term vision for accelerating revolutionary energy technologies to help move the world towards a clean, abundant energy future.\nSUPPORTING SUBNATIONAL ACTIONS TO ACCELERATE THE TRANSITION TO CLEAN ENERGY\nIn order to successfully transition to the clean energy economy of tomorrow, every level of government must be involved. That is why, yesterday, the State of California hosted the first Subnational Clean Energy Ministerial and next week Beijing will host the U.S. China Climate Leaders Summit. In addition, we are announcing the following actions:\nExpanding the Number of Subnational Governments Committing to Reduce Carbon Pollution through the Under2MOU: Yesterday, Governor Jerry Brown announced 7 new signatories to the Under2MOU - City of Budapest, Hungary, Laikipia County, Kenya, City of Portland, USA, City of Sacramento, USA, City of Santiago, Chile, Telangana, India, and Veneto, Italy. Since the effort began just over one year ago, the Under2 MOU has grown to a coalition of 135 jurisdictions representing 32 countries and six continents. Together, they represent more than 780 million people and $21 trillion in GDP, equivalent to more than a quarter of the global economy. Under the agreement, signatories commit to either reducing greenhouse gas emissions 80 to 95 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 or achieving a per capita annual emission target of less than 2 metric tons by 2050. These targets allow each individual government to tailor emission reduction plans to fit regional needs.\nEnhancing the Pacific Coast Collaborative: Leaders from the Pacific Coast Collaborative (PCC)-a partnership between California, Oregon, Washington and British Columbia-announced a new pact with mayors from Los Angeles, Oakland, Portland, San Francisco, Seattle, and Vancouver to slash greenhouse gas emissions through new clean energy initiatives. The agreement outlines shared commitments and concrete actions to improve buildings, transportation, and waste management on the west coast. California, Oregon, Washington and British Columbia also signed an updated and strengthened PCC agreement that maintains the region's commitment to account for the cost of carbon pollution and build a market for low carbon transportation fuels, while launching new collaboration to reduce short-lived climate pollutants and promote integration of the regions electricity grids.\nAdvancing National and Subnational Innovation in Clean Energy Finance. This week, DOE hosted a finance roundtable this week to discuss green banks and green bonds, which represent growing trends for public financial institutions at both the national and subnational levels. At the roundtable, leading stakeholders made the following announcements advancing public innovations in clean energy finance:\n• The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) announced the release of a new report, \"Green Investment Banks: Scaling up Private Investment in Low-carbon, Climate-resilient Infrastructure\". This report, prepared with the support of Bloomberg Philanthropies, provides the first comprehensive study of publicly capitalized green investment banks (GIBs), analyzing the rationales, mandates and financing activities of this relatively new category of public financial institution.\n• The Green Bank Network (GBN), a global platform launched at Paris COP-21 to share best practices on innovative public-private clean energy finance, announced that a Memorandum of Understanding has been signed by all of its members: the UK Green Investment Bank, the Japanese Green Finance Organization, the Malaysian Green Technology Corporation, the Australian Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the Connecticut Green Bank and the New York Green Bank. In addition, the GBN announced the launch of greenbanknetwork.org.\n• Energy Programs Consortium (EPC) announced the release of a report entitled \"The Warehouse for Energy Efficiency Loans (WHEEL) Feasibility Study: India, China, Brazil and the EU\". The report, with support from the ClimateWorks Foundation, explores the feasibility of globally scaling WHEEL, a US public-private-philanthropic partnership model for residential clean energy finance. EPC is advancing a project with the World Bank using this model to securitize commercial and industrial energy efficiency loans in India.\n• Allotrope Partners, in partnership with the World Resources Institute and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, announced the launch of the Nationally Determined Contribution Investment Accelerator (NDC IA) under the Low Emissions Development Strategies Global Partnership. This innovative public, private partnership will accelerate deployment of renewable energy in developing countries by addressing key policy and financing gaps.", "timestamp": "2016-06-02", "title": "Fact Sheet: U.S. Hosts World's Energy Ministers to Scale Up Clean Energy and Drive Implementation of the Paris Agreement"}

Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau – a government watchdog dedicated solely to protecting working Americans from unfair and deceptive financial practices – is putting forward an important proposal to crack down on abusive payday lending, and I stand with them in that effort.\n\"This is an important point of contrast in this campaign. Donald Trump wants to strip the U.S. government's power to apply rules to payday lenders, abolish this critical consumer watchdog, and roll back the other Wall Street reforms that we put in place after the financial crisis. Working families deserve a president who will look out for them – not payday lenders and special interests on Wall Street.\"", "timestamp": "2016-06-02", "title": "Hillary Clinton Statement on New CFPB Proposal for Payday Loans"}
{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119295", "text": "Thank you, thank you so much. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you San Diego for that warm, warm welcome and thanks to Ellen for those moving words, her introduction, and for reminding us it's not only our men and women in uniform that serve our country, it's their families, their spouses, their children, and we are grateful to each and every one of them. I want to recognize and thank Congressman Scott Peters for being here, thank you very much.\nAnd all of the other electeds and service members, active duty and retired National Guard and Reservists, veterans, military spouses, family members, all who are with us today.\nOn Monday, we observed Memorial Day – a day that means a great deal to San Diego, home of so many active-duty and former military and their families. We honor the sacrifice of those who died for our country in many ways – by living our values, by making this a stronger and fairer nation, and by carrying out a smart and principled foreign policy.\nThat's what I want to speak about today – the challenges we face in protecting our country, and the choice at stake in this election.\nIt's a choice between a fearful America that's less secure and less engaged with the world, and a strong, confident America that leads to keep our country safe and our economy growing.\nAs Secretary of State, Senator and First Lady, I had the honor of representing America abroad and helping shape our foreign policy at home. As a candidate for President, there's nothing I take more seriously than our national security. I've offered clear strategies for how to defeat ISIS, strengthen our alliances, and make sure Iran never gets a nuclear weapon. And I'm going to keep America's security at the heart of my campaign.\nBecause as you know so well, Americans aren't just electing a President in November. We're choosing our next commander-in-chief – the person we count on to decide questions of war and peace, life and death.\nAnd like many across our country and around the world, I believe the person the Republicans have nominated for President cannot do the job.\nDonald Trump's ideas aren't just different – they are dangerously incoherent. They're not even really ideas – just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds, and outright lies.\nHe is not just unprepared – he is temperamentally unfit to hold an office that requires knowledge, stability and immense responsibility.\nThis is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes – because it's not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin.\nWe cannot put the security of our children and grandchildren in Donald Trump's hands. We cannot let him roll the dice with America.\nThis is a man who said that more countries should have nuclear weapons, including Saudi Arabia.\nThis is someone who has threatened to abandon our allies in NATO – the countries that work with us to root out terrorists abroad before they strike us at home.\nHe believes we can treat the U.S. economy like one of his casinos and default on our debts to the rest of the world, which would cause an economic catastrophe far worse than anything we experienced in 2008.\nHe has said that he would order our military to carry out torture and the murder of civilians who are related to suspected terrorists – even though those are war crimes.\nHe says he doesn't have to listen to our generals or our admirals, our ambassadors and other high officials, because he has – quote – 'a very good brain.'\nHe also said, 'I know more about ISIS than the generals do, believe me.' You know what? I don't believe him.\nHe says climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese, and he has the gall to say that prisoners of war like John McCain aren't heroes.\nHe praises dictators like Vladimir Putin and picks fights with our friends – including the British prime minister, the mayor of London, the German chancellor, the president of Mexico and the Pope.\nHe says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the Miss Universe pageant in Russia.\nAnd to top it off, he believes America is weak. An embarrassment. He called our military a disaster. He said we are – and I quote – a 'third-world country.' And he's been saying things like that for decades.\nThose are the words my friends of someone who doesn't understand America or the world.\nAnd they're the words of someone who would lead us in the wrong direction. Because if you really believe America is weak – with our military, our values, our capabilities that no other country comes close to matching – then you don't know America.\nAnd you certainly don't deserve to lead it.\nThat's why – even if I weren't in this race – I'd be doing everything I could to make sure Donald Trump never becomes President – because I believe he will take our country down a truly dangerous path.\nUnlike him, I have some experience with the tough calls and the hard work of statecraft. I wrestled with the Chinese over a climate deal in Copenhagen, brokered a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, negotiated the reduction of nuclear weapons with Russia, twisted arms to bring the world together in global sanctions against Iran, and stood up for the rights of women, religious minorities and LGBT people around the world.\nAnd I have, I have sat in the Situation Room and advised the President on some of the toughest choices he faced.\nSo I'm not new to this work. And I'm proud to run on my record, because I think the choice before the American people in this election is clear.\nI believe in strong alliances; clarity in dealing with our rivals; and a rock-solid commitment to the values that have always made America great. And I believe with all my heart that America is an exceptional country – that we're still, in Lincoln's words, the last, best hope of earth. We are not a country that cowers behind walls. We lead with purpose, and we prevail.\nAnd if America doesn't lead, we leave a vacuum – and that will either cause chaos, or other countries will rush in to fill the void. Then they'll be the ones making the decisions about your lives and jobs and safety – and trust me, the choices they make will not be to our benefit.\nThat is not an outcome we can live with.\nAs I see it, there are some important things our next President must do to secure American leadership and keep us safe and our economy growing in the years ahead. These are all areas in which Donald Trump and I profoundly disagree. And they are all critical to our future.\nFirst, we need to be strong at home.\nThat means investing in our infrastructure, education and innovation – the fundamentals of a strong economy. We need to reduce income inequality, because our country can't lead effectively when so many are struggling to provide the basics for their families. And we need to break down the barriers that hold Americans back, including barriers of bigotry and discrimination.\nCompare that with what Trump wants to do. His economic plans would add more than $30 trillion – that's trillion with a 'T' – $30 trillion to our national debt over the next 20 years. He has no ideas on education. No ideas on innovation. He has a lot of ideas about who to blame, but no clue about what to do.\nNone of what Donald Trump is offering will make America stronger at home. And that would make us weaker in the world.\nSecond, we need to stick with our allies.\nAmerica's network of allies is part of what makes us exceptional. And our allies deliver for us every day.\nOur armed forces fight terrorists together; our diplomats work side by side. Allies provide staging areas for our military, so we can respond quickly to events on the other side of the world. And they share intelligence that helps us identify and defuse potential threats.\nTake the threat posed by North Korea – perhaps the most repressive regime on the planet, run by a sadistic dictator who wants to develop long-range missiles that could carry a nuclear weapon to the United States.\nWhen I was Secretary of State, we worked closely with our allies Japan and South Korea to respond to this threat, including by creating a missile defense system that stands ready to shoot down a North Korean warhead, should its leaders ever be reckless enough to launch one at us. The technology is ours. Key parts of it are located on Japanese ships. All three countries contributed to it. And this month, all three of our militaries will run a joint drill to test it.\nThat's the power of allies.\nAnd it's the legacy of American troops who fought and died to secure those bonds, because they knew we were safer with friends and partners.\nNow Moscow and Beijing are deeply envious of our alliances around the world, because they have nothing to match them. They'd love for us to elect a President who would jeopardize that source of strength. If Donald gets his way, they'll be celebrating in the Kremlin. We cannot let that happen.\nThat's why it is no small thing when he talks about leaving NATO, or says he'll stay neutral on Israel's security.\nIt's no small thing when he calls Mexican immigrants rapists and murderers. We're lucky to have two friendly neighbors on our land borders. Why would he want to make one of them an enemy?\nAnd it's no small thing when he suggests that America should withdraw our military support for Japan, encourage them to get nuclear weapons, and said this about a war between Japan and North Korea – and I quote – 'If they do, they do. Good luck, enjoy yourself, folks.' I wonder if he even realizes he's talking about nuclear war.\nYes, our friends need to contribute their fair share. I made that point long before Donald Trump came onto the scene – and a number of them have increased their defense spending. The real debate here is whether we keep these alliances strong or cut them off. What he says would weaken our country.\nThird, we need to embrace all the tools of American power, especially diplomacy and development, to be on the frontlines solving problems before they threaten us at home.\nDiplomacy is often the only way to avoid a conflict that could end up exacting a much greater cost. It takes patience, persistence and an eye on the long game – but it's worth it.\nTake the nuclear agreement with Iran. When President Obama took office, Iran was racing toward a nuclear bomb. Some called for military action. But that could have ignited a broader war that could have mired our troops in another Middle Eastern conflict.\nPresident Obama chose a different path. And I got to work leading the effort to impose crippling global sanctions. We brought Iran to the table. We began talks. And eventually, we reached an agreement that should block every path for Iran to get a nuclear weapon.\nNow we must enforce that deal vigorously. And as I've said many times before, our approach must be 'distrust and verify.' The world must understand that the United States will act decisively if necessary, including with military action, to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. In particular, Israel's security is non-negotiable. They're our closest ally in the region, and we have a moral obligation to defend them.\nBut there is no question that the world and the United States, we are safer now than we were before this agreement. And we accomplished it without firing a single shot, dropping a single bomb or putting a single American soldier in harm's way.\nDonald Trump says we shouldn't have done the deal. We should have walked away. But that would have meant no more global sanctions, and Iran resuming their nuclear program and the world blaming us. So then what? War? Telling the world, good luck, you deal with Iran?\nOf course Trump doesn't have answers to those questions. Donald Trump doesn't know the first thing about Iran or its nuclear program. Ask him. It'll become very clear, very quickly.\nThere's no risk of people losing their lives if you blow up a golf-course deal.\nBut it doesn't work like that in world affairs. Just like being interviewed on the same episode of \"60 Minutes\" as Putin was, is not the same thing as actually dealing with Putin.\nSo the stakes in global statecraft are infinitely higher and more complex than in the world of luxury hotels. We all know the tools Donald Trump brings to the table – bragging, mocking, composing nasty tweets – I'm willing to bet he's writing a few right now.\nBut those tools won't do the trick. Rather than solving global crises, he would create new ones.\nHe has no sense of what it takes to deal with multiple countries with competing interests and reaching a solution that everyone can get behind. In fact, he is downright contemptuous of that work. And that means he's much more likely to end up leading us into conflict.\nFourth, we need to be firm but wise with our rivals.\nCountries like Russia and China often work against us. Beijing dumps cheap steel in our markets. That hurts American workers. Moscow has taken aggressive military action in Ukraine, right on NATO's doorstep. Now I've gone toe-to-toe with Russia and China, and many other different leaders around the world. So I know we have to be able to both stand our ground when we must, and find common ground when we can.\nThat's how I could work with Russia to conclude the New START treaty to reduce nuclear stockpiles, and with China to increase pressure on North Korea. It's how our diplomats negotiated the landmark agreement on climate change, which Trump now wants to rip up.\nThe key was never forgetting who we were dealing with – not friends or allies, but countries that share some common interests with us amid many disagreements.\nDonald doesn't see the complexity. He wants to start a trade war with China. And I understand a lot of Americans have concerns about our trade agreements – I do too. But a trade war is something very different. We went down that road in the 1930s. It made the Great Depression longer and more painful. Combine that with his comments about defaulting on our debt, and it's not hard to see how a Trump presidency could lead to a global economic crisis.\nAnd I have to say, I don't understand Donald's bizarre fascination with dictators and strongmen who have no love for America. He praised China for the Tiananmen Square massacre; he said it showed strength. He said, 'You've got to give Kim Jong Un credit' for taking over North Korea – something he did by murdering everyone he saw as a threat, including his own uncle, which Donald described gleefully, like he was recapping an action movie. And he said if he were grading Vladimir Putin as a leader, he'd give him an 'A.'\nNow, I'll leave it to the psychiatrists to explain his affection for tyrants.\nI just wonder how anyone could be so wrong about who America's real friends are. Because it matters. If you don't know exactly who you're dealing with, men like Putin will eat your lunch.\nFifth, we need a real plan for confronting terrorists.\nAs we saw six months ago in San Bernardino, the threat is real and urgent. Over the past year, I've laid out my plans for defeating ISIS.\nWe need to take out their strongholds in Iraq and Syria by intensifying the air campaign and stepping up our support for Arab and Kurdish forces on the ground. We need to keep pursuing diplomacy to end Syria's civil war and close Iraq's sectarian divide, because those conflicts are keeping ISIS alive. We need to lash up with our allies, and ensure our intelligence services are working hand-in-hand to dismantle the global network that supplies money, arms, propaganda and fighters to the terrorists. We need to win the battle in cyberspace.\nAnd of course we need to strengthen our defenses here at home.\nThat – in a nutshell – is my plan for defeating ISIS.\nWhat's Trump's? Well he won't say. He is literally keeping it a secret. The secret, of course, is he has no idea what he'd do to stop ISIS.\nJust look at the few things he's actually said on the subject.\nHe's actually said – and I quote –'maybe Syria should be a free zone for ISIS.' Oh, okay – let a terrorist group have control of a major country in the Middle East.\nThen he said we should send tens of thousands of American ground troops to the Middle East to fight ISIS.\nHe also refused to rule out using nuclear weapons against ISIS, which would mean mass civilian casualties.\nIt's clear he doesn't have a clue what he's talking about. So we can't be certain which of these things he would do. But we can be certain that he's capable of doing any or all of them. Letting ISIS run wild. Launching a nuclear attack. Starting a ground war. These are all distinct possibilities with Donald Trump in charge.\nAnd through all his loose talk, there's one constant theme: demonizing Muslims and playing right into the hands of ISIS'. His proposal to ban 1.5 billion Muslims from even coming to our country doesn't just violate the religious freedom our country was founded on. It's also a huge propaganda victory for ISIS. And it alienates the very countries we need to actually help us in this fight.\nA Trump Presidency would embolden ISIS. We cannot take that risk.\nThis isn't reality television – this is actual reality.\nAnd defeating global terrorist networks and protecting the homeland takes more than empty talk and a handful of slogans. It takes a real plan, real experience and real leadership. Donald Trump lacks all three.\nAnd one more thing. A President has a sacred responsibility to send our troops into battle only if we absolutely must, and only with a clear and well-thought-out strategy. Our troops give their all. They deserve a commander-in-chief who knows that.\nI've worked side-by-side with admirals and generals, and visited our troops in theaters of war. I've fought for better health care for our National Guard, better services for our veterans, and more support for our Gold Star families. We cannot put the lives of our young men and women in uniform in Donald Trump's hands.\nSixth, we need to stay true to our values.\nTrump says over and over again, 'The world is laughing at us.' He's been saying this for decades, he didn't just start this year.\nHe bought full-page ads in newspapers across the country back in 1987, when Ronald Reagan was President, saying that America lacked a backbone and the world was – you guessed it – laughing at us. He was wrong then, and he's wrong now – and you've got to wonder why somebody who fundamentally has so little confidence in America, and has felt that way for at least 30 years, wants to be our President.\nThe truth is, there's not a country in the world that can rival us. It's not just that we have the greatest military, or that our economy is larger, more durable, more entrepreneurial than any in the world. It's also that Americans work harder, dream bigger – and we never, ever stop trying to make our country and world a better place.\nSo it really matters that Donald Trump says things that go against our deepest-held values. It matters when he says he'll order our military to murder the families of suspected terrorists. During the raid to kill bin Laden, when every second counted, our SEALs took the time to move the women and children in the compound to safety. Donald Trump may not get it, but that's what honor looks like.\nAnd it also matters when he makes fun of disabled people, calls women pigs,proposes banning an entire religion from our country, or plays coy with white supremacists. America stands up to countries that treat women like animals, or people of different races, religions or ethnicities as less human.\nWhat happens to the moral example we set – for the world and for our own children – if our President engages in bigotry?\nAnd by the way, Mr. Trump – every time you insult American Muslims or Mexican immigrants, remember that plenty of Muslims and immigrants serve and fight in our armed forces.\nDonald Trump, Donald Trump could learn something from them.\nThat brings me to the final point I want to make today – the temperament it takesto be Commander-in-Chief.\nEvery President faces hard choices every day, with imperfect information and conflicting imperatives. That's the job.\nA revolution threatens to topple a government in a key region, an adversary reaches out for the first time in years – what do you do?\nMaking the right call takes a cool head and respect for the facts. It takes a willingness to listen to other people's points of view with a truly open mind. It also takes humility – knowing you don't know everything – because if you're convinced you're always right, you'll never ask yourself the hard questions.\nI remember being in the Situation Room with President Obama, debating the potential Bin Laden operation. The President's advisors were divided. The intelligence was compelling but far from definitive. The risks of failure were daunting. The stakes were significant for our battle against al Qaeda and our relationship with Pakistan. Most of all, the lives of those brave SEALs and helicopter pilots hung in the balance.\nIt was a decision only the President could make. And when he did, it was as crisp and courageous a display of leadership as I've ever seen.\nNow imagine Donald Trump sitting in the Situation Room, making life-or-death decisions on behalf of the United States. Imagine him deciding whether to send your spouses or children into battle. Imagine if he had not just his Twitter account at his disposal when he's angry, but America's entire arsenal.\nDo we want him making those calls – someone thin-skinned and quick to anger, who lashes out at the smallest criticism? Do we want his finger anywhere near the button?\nI have a lot of faith that the American people will make the right decision. This is a country with a deep reservoir of common sense and national pride. We're all counting on that.\nBecause making Donald Trump our commander-in-chief would be a historic mistake. It would undo so much of the work that Republicans and Democrats alike have done over many decades to make America stronger and more secure. It would set back our standing in the world more than anything in recent memory. And it would fuel an ugly narrative about who we are – that we're fearful, not confident; that we want to let others determine our future for us, instead of shaping our own destiny.\nThat's not the America I know and love.\nSo yes, we have a lot of work to do to keep our country secure. And we need to do better by American families and American workers – and we will. But don't let anyone tell you that America isn't great. Donald Trump's got America all wrong. We are a big-hearted, fair-minded country.\nThere is no challenge we can't meet, no goal we can't achieve when we each do our part and come together as one nation.\nEvery lesson from our history teaches us that we are stronger together. We remember that every Memorial Day.\nThis election is a choice between two very different visions of America.\nOne that's angry, afraid, and based on the idea that America is fundamentally weak and in decline.\nThe other is hopeful, generous, and confident in the knowledge that America is great – just like we always have been.\nLet's resolve that we can be greater still. That is what I believe in my heart.\nI went to 112 countries as your Secretary of State. And I never lost my sense of pride at seeing our blue-and-white plane lit up on some far-off runway, with? ?'The United States of America' emblazoned on the side. That plane – those words – our country represents something special, not just to us, to the world. It represents freedom and hope and opportunity.\nI love this country and I know you do too. It's been an honor and a privilege toserve America and I'm going to do everything I can to protect our nation, and make sure we don't lose sight of how strong we really are.\nThank you all very much.", "timestamp": "2016-06-02", "title": "Remarks in San Diego, California"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122577", "text": "Today the White House is announcing a new Federal policy statement from the U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services and Education on better supporting our country's youngest dual language learners (DLLs) in early childhood programs. The Obama Administration will be joined by public and private sector organizations that will also announce new commitments to support DLLs. Additionally, the White House, in collaboration with Too Small to Fail and Invest in US, is holding a regional convening today at the United Way Center for Excellence in Early Education in Miami, FL to highlight the importance of supporting our country's DLLs in early childhood programs.\nData indicate that about one in five school-aged children speak a language other than English at home, a figure that has more than doubled in the past few decades. Estimates suggest that this number may be even higher for learners under the age of six; for example, nearly a third of children in Head Start programs are DLLs. Research with young DLLs clearly reflects that children's bilingual skill development promotes overall language development and should be encouraged.\nThe Federal policy statement being released today recognizes the cultural and linguistic assets of this population of children, and provides important resources and recommendations to the early childhood field to ensure that our nation's early education programs are accessible to these families, and that they appropriately foster the learning and development of this large and growing group of children. Today's announcements also mark progress on the President's My Brother's Keeper Initiative, which aims to ensure that all young people, including children of color, can reach their full potential.\nCollectively, today's Federal actions include:\n•      A New Federal Policy Statement on More Effectively Supporting Dual Language Learners in Early Childhood Programs: The U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Education (ED) will release a Federal policy statement on supporting DLLs in early childhood settings. The statement includes comprehensive policy recommendations to States and to early childhood programs. It also recommends that States and local communities work together to ensure that all early childhood programs are welcoming and linguistically accessible to families of DLLs, foster children's emerging bilingualism and learning more broadly, and support the early childhood workforce in building their capacity to stimulate the learning of DLLs.\n•      A New DLL Electronic Toolkit for Programs, Early Educators, Child Care Providers, and Families: The new DLL Toolkit, released by HHS' Office of Head Start, includes free resources on supporting the learning and development- including dual language development - of DLLs at home, in early learning settings, and in the community. The DLL toolkit will be available at no cost to all early childhood programs, including all Head Start programs, which serve more than 300,000 DLLs every day. The toolkit will also be disseminated to home visitors in all 50 States supported by the Maternal Infant and Early Childhood Home Visiting program, and the families they serve.\nAdditional Announcements Made at Today's Convening Include:\n•      Too Small to Fail, in partnership with the Early Learning Coalition of Miami- Dade and Monroe County and Univision will launch a new citywide \"Talking is Teaching: Talk, Read, Sing\" public awareness campaign in Miami, with an emphasis on reaching families of young DLLs. The campaign promotes early brain and language development by encouraging parents to engage in meaningful activities with their young children starting at birth -- like counting toes while giving a bath or singing a song while changing a diaper. Miami is the seventh community with which Too Small to Fail has partnered, with three more expected this summer. Too Small to Fail also promoted a set of parent and early educator resources developed in partnership with HHS and ED–- in both English and Spanish - to encourage parents and early educators to talk, read, and sing with young DLL's in their home language.\n•      First Five California will announce that they are developing a $16 million DLL Pilot to identify effective culturally and linguistically responsive strategies to better support young children who are DLLs. The pilot will focus on three priority areas while ensuring they are scalable and implementable across California's multi-lingual early learning settings. The strategies include: professional development for early educators and program directors on successful teaching strategies and curricula approaches to promote dual language acquisition; proven practices to partner with families of DLLs; and appropriate child and program assessment tools.\n•      The University of Washington's Institute for Learning and Brain Sciences will release a new report on bilingual language learning in young children. The report showcases the Institute's latest studies demonstrating that the baby brain is fully capable of learning multiple languages at the same time. The report also describes major milestones in bilingual language learning and highlights the cognitive benefits of bilingualism, including enhanced abilities to control attention, think flexibly, and update information in working memory.\n•      The Civil Rights Project at the University of California Los Angeles will release a new research brief outlining the economic benefits of bilingualism in a global economy. The report includes findings that suggest that the average difference in earnings between a children who lose their home language, compared to those who keep their home language and become bilingual, is more than $5,400 annually.\n•      The National Head Start Association will partner with Head Start programs across the nation, business bureaus, and local chambers of commerce, to develop and widely disseminate a toolkit to promote two-generation best practices that support the parents of DLLs in areas such as job training, enrolling in adult education programs, and accessing English language courses, in order to foster family stability and promote child wellness. The toolkit will include a review of best practice examples from Head Start programs that are supporting two generation approaches for children who are DLLs and their families, and guidance for how to replicate the best practices across the country.\n•      New America will release a new report citing the significance of increasing the linguistic diversity of educators in the early childhood workforce. The report highlights the gap between the proportion of children who speak a language other than English at home, and the proportion of educators who speak a language other than English fluently. The authors outline a comprehensive research agenda to identify the barriers to increasing linguistic diversity in preschool through third grade settings, and the best strategies to move forward.\nThese actions build on President Obama's broader agenda to expand access to high quality early education for all children. Over the course of the President's time in office, he has:\n•      Improved and Expanded Head Start: For over 50 years, Head Start has been at the heart of America's communities. From our urban and rural neighborhoods, to our farmworker communities and tribal nations, it has played an important role in the lives of more than 32 million children and their families. The Obama Administration has invested an additional $4 billion in the program, and implemented important reforms to raise Head Start's standards, focus on school readiness results, and promote accountability, including the launch of a new process designed to ensure that only the most capable and highest quality programs receive Head Start grants. Head Start and Early Head Start have grown by an additional 40,000 children in the years since President Obama took office.\n•      Launched the new Early Head Start-Child Care Partnerships: Research indicates that gaps in development begin to form as early as the first year of life. Through the President's signature Early Head Start-Child Care Partnerships, we have expanded access to high quality early learning opportunities to more than 30,000 additional infants and toddlers in 275 communities across America by creating strong partnerships between our Early Head Start grantees and child care providers that serve young children. These Partnerships are building early learning capacity and infrastructure in the neighborhoods across our country that need it most- and for our children who need it most. To date, these grants are working to enhance the quality of 1200 child care centers and more than 600 family child care homes across the country.\n•      Launched the Maternal Infant and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program: In 2009, President Obama launched the MIECHV program to support pregnant women and families and help parents with young children tap the resources and hone the skills they need to raise children who are physically, socially, and emotionally healthy and ready for school. To date, the MIECHV program has provided 2.3 million home visits, reaching nearly 150,000 families across all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and five territories.\n•      Signed a new and improved child care bill into law and put forward a bold plan to expand access to high quality affordable child care: In 2014, President Obama signed a landmark Child Care and Development Block Grant reauthorization into law, marking a significant step forward in improving our child care system. The new law makes important reforms including shoring up standards that help ensure our children are safe and healthy while they are in child care and ensuring continuity of services. It also increases the amount of funding states can use to increase the quality of their child care systems. A few months later, during his State of the Union address, the President put forth a landmark child care proposal that would guarantee all eligible families with young children have access to affordable, high quality child care. The proposal would also ensure that child care workers have greater access to training and higher education-- and commensurate with new competencies, higher and more fair compensation.\n•      Invested in High Quality Preschool and Proposed a Bold Plan to Expand Access to all 4-year-olds: In his 2013 State of the Union Address, President Obama proposed a landmark plan that would ensure that all 4-year-olds from middle- and low- income families have access to high-quality preschool. Since his call to action, 38 states and D.C. have increased funding in their public preschool programs, investing an additional $1.5 billion, and totaling almost $7 billion in investments this year alone. Beyond these state investments, the President has dedicated $750 million- through his signature Preschool Development Grant program - in high quality preschool, so that 230 high-need communities can provide more than 100,000 additional children with access to preschool.\n•      Launched the Race to the Top-Early Learning Challenge (RTT-ELC): The Obama Administration invested over $1 billion in 20 States through the Early Learning Challenge, a competitive fund that enabled states to increase the quality of their early education programs, to establish higher standards across programs and to provide critical links with health, nutrition, mental health, and family support for our neediest children. By December of 2014, more than 200,000 children with high needs are enrolled in the highest quality state-funded preschool programs across the 20 States, and nearly 230,000 children with high needs are enrolled in the highest quality child care programs. This effort has also helped to almost double the number of early childhood programs participating in initiatives to improve their quality in those 20 States. This effort has also helped to almost double the number of early childhood programs participating in initiatives to improve their quality in those 20 States.\n•      In December 2014, the White House held the Summit on Early Education where President Obama announced over $ 1 billion in new public and private investments for early education. More than $330 million in new actions from corporate and philanthropic leaders and $750 million in new Federal grants were announced to support early education. The President also released a Playbook to offer strategies for local leaders to develop and expand early education in their communities.", "timestamp": "2016-06-02", "title": "Fact Sheet: Supporting Dual Language Learners in Early Learning Settings"}

Brodeur, who was killed in the shootings at Kabul International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, on April 27, 2011; Ahmed Abu Khattala, suspected perpetrator of the terrorist attacks on the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11, 2012, who was captured during a raid in Benghazi, Libya, on June 16, 2014; Sulayman Dawud al-Bakkar, an operative in the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) terrorist organization known as \"Abu Dawud\" who was captured during a raid in Iraq in February; and President Bashar al-Asad of Syria.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117899", "text": "Hello, Air Force! Thank you so much. Thank you. It is wonderful to be back at the United States Air Force Academy.\nThank you, Secretary James, for your service to our Air Force and to our Nation. Governor Hickenlooper, Academy leaders, faculty and staff—especially your outstanding Superintendent, Lieutenant General Michelle Johnson. And most of all, congratulations to the class of 2016!\nAs he prepares to conclude a remarkable 40-year career in the Air Force, a career that started on this day 40 years ago, please join me in saluting someone who many of you look up to and whose counsel I've relied on as well: Chief of Staff General Mark Welsh. Thank you, Mark. Thank you, Mark, and thank you, Betty.\nAnd although he's not here today, I am proud to have nominated another Academy graduate—and a combat-tested pilot—to serve as the 21st Air Force Chief of Staff, General David Goldfein.\nNow, cadets, you can take enormous pride in all the hard work that has brought you to this day. I also ask you to give a big round of applause to all your moms and dads, grandparents, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles who supported you and sacrificed for you so you could be here today. Give them another round of applause.\nNow, I have to tell you, some days I spend more time with the Air Force than my own family—[laughter]—especially on Air Force One. You take good care of me. You are always on time. You never lose my luggage. [Laughter] I don't have to take off my shoes before I get on. [Laughter] So I'm really going to miss Air Force One—[laughter]—as well as the incredible airmen that I've come to know. And that includes the pilots who flew me here, Lieutenant Colonels Dan Thorn and Rob Tobler and Major Brent Ellis, all three of them proud Air Force Academy graduates. Give them a big round of applause.\nNow, this Academy is one of our Nation's most selective academic institutions. Just being accepted is a big deal, a testament to your talent and your leadership. And we are particularly grateful to those of you with prior enlisted service, including Cameron Kistler, who deployed to Iraq; Robert Parati and Clayton Logan, who deployed to Afghanistan. We thank you. Your country thanks you.\nCadets, here you were tested by fire, literally. Because when you went through Beast, as General Johnson noted, Waldo Canyon was actually on fire. [Laughter] During Recognition, you ran to the Rock in a blizzard. So you have more than earned your unofficial motto: \"Forged in fire and tempered in ice.\" Which is a great motto, although it does sound like something out of \"Game of Thrones.\" [Laughter]\nAnd through it all, you've become like family. You survived morning accountability formations, survived living in Sijan Hall. [Laughter] That night in F-1 where you learned to \"earn each day.\" You've cheered Coach Calhoun and the Falcons as I've welcomed them to the White House to present the Commander in Chief Trophy, which Air Force has won a record 19 times.\nAnd I look out into your ranks and I see airmen who will excel as pilots and engineers, analysts—so many specialties. The first cyber graduates in this Academy's history. And David Higgins, a marksman who's going to the Olympics in Rio, bring home the gold, David! No pressure. [Laughter]\nIn you, I see men and women of integrity and service and excellence. And you've made us all proud. And perhaps no one would have been more proud of your success than Major David Brodeur, whose sacrifice in Afghanistan we honor, and whose family joins us today—2016.\nYou've learned other lessons, as well, like what happens when you paint one of the planes on the Terrazzo in your class color. With such \"achievements\" in mind, I hereby grant amnesty to all cadets serving restrictions and confinements for minor offenses. [Laughter] Only minor. [Laughter]\nToday we congratulate our newest Air Force officers. And on behalf of the American people, I thank you for choosing a life of service. In the coming weeks, some of you will head to the chapel to get married. In the years ahead, you and your families will serve around the world. As officers, you'll be responsible for the lives of those under your command, and you'll be called upon to lead with wisdom, courage, and compassion. And that's what I want to talk with you about today.\nI've served as Commander in Chief for nearly 8 years now. It has been the highest honor of my life to lead the greatest military in the history of the world. It inspires me every day. Today will be the last time that I have the honor of addressing a graduating class of military officers. And there's a debate going on in our country about our Nation's role in the world. So, with that in mind, I hope you don't mind if I share some lessons I've learned as Commander in Chief, lessons that you may find useful as you lead those under your command and as we work together to keep our Nation strong and secure.\nFirst, as you look at the world, be guided by an honest and clear-eyed assessment. Remember what you learned at this Academy: the importance of evidence and facts and judgment. And here's a fact: The United States of America remains the most powerful nation on Earth and a force for good.\nWe have big challenges in our country: in our politics, our economy, our society. Those are challenges we have to address. But look around. We have the world's strongest economy. Our scientists, our researchers, our entrepreneurs are global leaders in innovation. Our colleges and universities attract the best talent from around the world. Our values—freedom, equality, opportunity—those values inspire people everywhere, including immigrants who come here, ready to work, and integrate and help renew our country.\nOur standing in the world is higher. And I see it in my travels from Havana to Berlin to Ho Chi Minh City, where huge crowds of Vietnamese lined the streets, some waving American flags. So make no mistake, the United States is better positioned to lead in the 21st century than any other nation.\nAnd here's another fact: Our military is, by a mile, the strongest in the world. Yes, after two major ground wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, we're drawing down the size of our Armed Forces, which is natural and necessary. And we have to keep improving readiness and modernizing our force. But it is undeniable: Our military is the most capable fighting force on the planet. It's not close.\nOur soldiers are the best trained, best equipped land force on Earth, tested by years of combat, able to sustain power anywhere in the globe. Nobody can match our Army. Our sailors serve on aircraft carriers that can go almost anywhere and submarines that move undetected: the largest and most lethal Navy in the world, on track to surpass 300 ships. Nobody can match our Navy. Our Marines are ready at a moment's notice, \"first to fight\" or deliver help in a crisis, the world's only truly global expeditionary force. Nobody can match our Marines. Our coast guardsmen serve on the most advanced cutters in history, and special teams can shoot smugglers' engines, hook-and-climb or repel aboard, protecting our shores. Nobody can match our Coast Guard.\nAnd as for our airmen, with your unequaled vigilance and reach, unrivaled fifth-generation fighters, a new generation of remotely piloted aircraft pilots, astonishing precision that calls to mind your actual class motto, \"On Target, On Time,\" nobody can match America's Air Force.\nNot only that, no other nation brings its forces together like we do in one joint force, as we saw in an operation against ISIL in Syria just last year. Air Force aircraft provided surveillance. Navy F-18s provided close air support. Army aviation assets delivered our special operators, an assault force of marines and soldiers, to the target, and one of ISIL's top leaders, Abu Sayyaf, was eliminated. That's the power of America's military. And we need to keep it that way.\nAnd here's one more fact as you go out into the world: We are blessed to be living in the most peaceful, most prosperous era in human history. Now, that sounds controversial until you survey the history of the world. It's hard to see with all the violence and suffering in the world and what's reported on the news every day. But if you step back for a moment, think about last week, when I was in Hiroshima to remember all who were lost in a World War that killed some 60 million people—not 60,000, 60 million.\nFor decades, there have been no wars between major powers. Wars between nations are increasingly rare. More people live in democracies. More than 1 billion people have been lifted from extreme poverty. From the Americas to Africa to Southeast Asia, there's a new generation of young people, connected by technology and ready to make their mark. I've met them. They look up to America. They aspire to be our partner. That's the progress and the hope that we have to build on. And so much of that derives from the extraordinary leadership and sacrifice of our Air Force and the other branches of our military.\nSo we are well positioned. You enter this moment with a lot of good cards to play. But we face serious threats. Terrorist networks slaughter the innocent and plot attacks against our Nation. Civil wars, like in Iraq, tear countries apart and create humanitarian catastrophes and havens for terrorists. Russian aggression against Ukraine, disputes in the South China Sea, these are testing an international order that we built, where the sovereignty of nations is respected and all nations abide by the same rules. Nuclear weapons, as in North Korea, and the specter of nuclear terrorism still threaten us all.\nSo how to meet these threats while also seizing the incredible opportunities of this moment in history, that's going to be your challenge: the challenge of your generation.\nWhich leads me to a second lesson. As we navigate this complex world, America cannot shirk the mantle of leadership. We can't be isolationist. It's not possible in this globalized, interconnected world. In these uncertain times, it's tempting sometimes to pull back and to try to wash our hands of conflicts that seem intractable, let other countries fend for themselves. But history teaches us, from Pearl Harbor to 9/11, that oceans alone cannot protect us. Hateful ideologies can spark terror from Boston to San Bernardino.\nIn a global economy, it's not possible to stop trading goods and services with other countries. Weak public health systems on the other side of the world allow diseases to develop that end up reaching our shores. So we cannot turn inward. We cannot give in to isolationism. That's a false comfort. Allowing problems to fester over there makes us less secure here. So, as Americans, we have to keep leading and working with others to build the security and prosperity and justice we want in the world.\nBy the way, one of the most effective ways to lead and work with others is through treaties that advance our interests. Lately, there's been a mindset in Congress that just about any international treaty is somehow a violation of American sovereignty, and so the Senate almost never approves treaties anymore. They voted down a treaty to protect disabled Americans, including our veterans, while Senator and World War II veteran Bob Dole was sitting right there in the Senate Chambers in a wheelchair.\nWe don't always realize it, but treaties help make a lot of things in our lives possible that we take for granted, from international phone calls to mail. Those are good things. Those are not a threat to our sovereignty. I think we can all agree on that.\nBut also from NATO to treaties controlling nuclear weapons, treaties help keep us safe. So if we're truly concerned about China's actions in the South China Sea, for example, the Senate should help strengthen our case by approving the Law of the Sea Convention, as our military leaders have urged. And by the way, these treaties are not a new thing. The power to make treaties is written into our Constitution. Our Founding Fathers ratified lots of treaties. So it's time for the Senate to do its job and help us advance American leadership, rather than undermine it.\nNow, part of the reason this is so important is because the United States remains the one indisputable nation in world affairs. I say this all the time. After 8 years, I have not gone to an international conference, summit, meeting where we were not the ones who made the agenda possible, even if we weren't hosting it. We have more alliances with other countries than anybody else, and they're the foundation of global stability and prosperity. On just about every issue, the world looks to us to set the agenda. When there's a problem around the world, they do not call Beijing or Moscow, they call us.\nAnd we lead not by dictating to others, but by working with them as partners, by treating other countries and their peoples with respect, not by lecturing them. This isn't just the right thing to do, it's in our self-interest. It makes countries more likely to work with us, and ultimately, it makes us more secure. So we need smart, steady, principled American leadership.\nAnd part of leading wisely is seeing threats clearly. Remember Ebola? That was a serious threat, and we took it seriously. But in the midst of it, there was hysteria. \"Flights must be banned!\" \"Quarantine citizens!\" These were actual quotes. \"Seal the border!\" And my favorite: \"Remove Obama . . . or millions of Americans die!\" [Laughter] That's an actual quote. [Laughter]\nThe thing is, when we panic, we don't make good decisions. So, with Ebola, instead of responding with fear, we responded with facts and responded with science and organization. And thanks to a coordinated global response, enabled by the American military and our medical workers who got in there first, we stopped the spread of Ebola in West Africa and saved countless lives and protected ourselves. So we've got to engage with the world. We can't pull back. Of course, leading wisely also means resisting the temptation to intervene militarily every time there's a problem or crisis in the world. History is littered with the ruins of empires and nations that overextended themselves, draining their power and influence. And so we have to chart a smarter path. As we saw in Vietnam and the Iraq war, oftentimes, the greatest damage to American credibility comes when we overreach, when we don't think through the consequences of all of our actions. And so we have to learn from our history. And that also means we're doing right by our men and women in uniform.\nSo, cadets, in your positions of leadership, you will be called upon to sustain this balance: to be hard headed and big hearted; guided by realism and idealism and even when these forces are sometimes at odds. We've got to have the realism to see the world as it is: where sometimes uncomfortable compromises are necessary; where we have the humility to recognize that there are limits to what even a nation as powerful as ours can do; that there may be wars we cannot always stop right away or lives we cannot save. But we also need the idealism that sees the world as it ought to be: a commitment to the universal values of democracy and equality and human rights and a willingness to stand up for them around the world, not just when it's easy, but when it's hard. Because that's who we are and that's American leadership.\nNow, at times, ensuring our security requires the use of military force. And that's the third lesson I want to discuss. As Commander in Chief, I have not hesitated to use force, unilaterally where necessary, to protect the American people. Thanks to our military, intelligence, and counterterrorism professionals, bin Laden is gone. Anwar Awlaki, a leader of the Al Qaida affiliate in Yemen, is gone. Ahmed Abdi Godane, the Al Qaida leader in Somalia, he's gone. Ahmed Abu Khattala, accused in the attacks in Benghazi, captured. Mohammad Mansur, the leader of the Taliban, gone. Leader after leader in ISIL, Haji Mutazz, their number two; Mohammed Emwazi, who brutally murdered Americans; Abu Nabil, the ISIL leader in Libya—all gone. Abu Dawud, a leader of their chemical weapons program, captured.\nThe list goes on. Because if you target Americans, we will find you and justice will be done, and we will defend our Nation.\nBut even as we celebrate the courage of our troops who serve in war, even where we do not hesitate to act on behalf of our security, we should never celebrate war itself. War, no matter how noble our intentions may be, promises agony and tragedy. And no one knows this more than those who fight those wars: our wounded warriors who bear the scars, seen and unseen; our veterans, who remember their fallen comrades; our Gold Star families, whose hearts ache with pride and with loss.\nWe have a solemn responsibility to these Americans who sacrifice in our name. We have a responsibility to be guided by intelligence and not ideology and to never rush into war and to explore other options first. Because sending our troops into harm's way must always be a last resort.\nAnd sometimes, those decisions are tough. I know, for example, that my decision not to conduct strikes against Syria after it used chemical weapons was controversial among some in Washington. But because we seized a diplomatic option, backed by our threat of force, nations came together, and we accomplished far more than military strikes ever could have. All of Syria's declared chemical weapons were successfully removed.\nAnd in acting militarily, we have a responsibility, whenever possible, to build coalitions and partnerships. There are times where we have to do it alone. But on a whole lot of global problems, the United States shouldn't bear the entire burden of global security by itself. Others have to step up. That's why, as we assist and train Afghan forces, we're part of a 39-nation coalition. Our coalition against ISIL includes 66 partners, including Arab nations. We've learned that often the best way to defeat terrorists is not by sending large numbers of American ground forces to occupy and patrol foreign cities and towns. It's better to train and build up local partners; they're the ones who have to stabilize their own countries over the long term.\nCompared to when I came into office, when we had nearly 180,000 American troops in Afghanistan and Iraq, today that number is less than 15,000. Most of our troops have come home. Our local partners on the ground are in the lead. And as ISIL continues to lose territory in Iraq and Syria, these terrorists are learning the same lesson as others before them: You will never be strong enough to destroy America or our way of life. You are going to lose. But part of that is because we're on the right side of history, and part of it is because we can mobilize others to work with us.\nWhen we use force, we have a responsibility to use it proportionally. Unlike terrorists who try to kill as many people as possible, the United States military goes to extraordinary lengths to avoid civilian casualties. It's the tragedy of war, however, whenever—whether it's conventional warfare or precise strikes—that innocents sometimes are caught in the crossfire. And these are deaths that haunt us all. Nobody more than me. As technology evolves, we can never grow numb to the consequences of our actions. We have to hold ourselves to high standards, be even more transparent, and do everything in our power to prevent the loss of innocent life. That's how America goes to war. And that's how, ultimately, America also wins the peace.\nAnd we have a responsibility to always give our troops a clear mission, the support they need to get the job done, and a plan for what comes after. I insisted, for example, that our surge of forces in Afghanistan be matched with a transition to ensure Afghans took responsibility for their own security.\nIn Libya, we were right to launch an air campaign to prevent Qaddafi from massacring innocent civilians, but we didn't do enough to plan for the day after, when deep-rooted tribalism plunged Libya into disorder.\nIn Syria, the suffering in the civil war has been heartbreaking to see a nation shattered and hundreds of thousands killed and millions driven from their homes. It is gut wrenching. And as a father, I look at Syria's children, and I see my own. That's why we've said that the dictator, Asad, must go and why we support a moderate Syrian opposition. And it's why America provides more humanitarian aid to the Syrian people than any other nation.\nBut suggestions for deeper U.S. military involvement in a conflict like the Syrian civil war have to be fully thought through, rigorously examined with an honest assessment of the risks and tradeoffs. How will it alter the conflict? What comes next? When we ask those questions, we prevent the kind of mission creep that history teaches us to avoid.\nIf Iran and Russia want to spill their blood and treasure trying to prop up their Syrian client and get sucked into a quagmire, that is their choice. As President of the United States, I've made a different choice. And the only real solution to the Syrian conflict is a political solution, including a transition away from Asad. And that takes diplomacy, not American soldiers being dragged into the middle of another civil war in the Middle East. Our foreign policy has to be strong, but it also has to be smart. Which brings me to my last lesson that I want to share: As powerful as our military is, we have to remember that many of the threats to our security cannot be solved by military force alone. We've got to draw on every tool, all elements of our national power.\nWhen we invest in the development that promotes education and opportunity around the globe, it can make conflicts and military interventions less likely later. So if you want to support our military, you also have to be in favor of foreign assistance that helps some young person learn in a very poor country, because it may end up making it less necessary to send our sons and daughters somewhere to fight. You can't separate the two.\nWhen we encourage economic and political reforms—when citizens, especially young people, in other countries have jobs and can choose their own leaders and have their human rights and dignity upheld—that can help reduce the appeal of violent extremism. We now have hope of averting the worst effects of climate change and the instability that would threaten our national security because American leadership helped rally the world and forge the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change.\nSo if we're going to seize the possibilities of our time, we have to use all these tools, and we have to have the courage to chart new paths. Because we negotiated with Iran and enforced strong sanctions, we reached a deal that prevents Iran from obtaining a nuclear bomb, and we did it without firing a shot. With diplomacy, not war. We put aside 50 years of failed policies, and now we're seeing Americans returning to Cuba and the Cuban people looking to us, and having new hope for the future. Four decades after the conflict between us, Vietnam and America are forging a new partnership, showing the world that peace is better than war.\nAnd perhaps no element of our power is more enduring than the example that we set ourselves: the values we live as a nation and as individuals. That's how we won the cold war: not just with the strength of our arms, but with the power of our ideas, the power of our example. It's how we defend our Nation—including our refusal to torture—because America doesn't just insist that other countries respect human rights, we have to uphold them as well and lead the way. It's how we treat those we capture. Which is one of the reasons we have to close the prison at Guantanamo, because America has to stand for rule of law.\nWe live our values when our military, like America itself, truly welcomes the talents of all people. We're stronger when our gay and lesbian cadets and troops can serve their country—a country they love—without hiding who they love. We're stronger when cadets, like Wasim Soomro and Ismail Baumy and James Salem, know that we celebrate their service as proud, patriotic Muslim Americans who are also serving in our Armed Forces.\nAnd on this 40th anniversary of the first female cadets arriving at this Academy, we are stronger because General Johnson leads this institution; because Air Force General Lori Robinson leads Northern Command, our Nation's first female combatant commander; and because all combat positions in our military are now open to women like you. We're stronger because of it.\nSo there you have it, a few thoughts from your Commander in Chief on how to keep our military strong and our Nation secure. We can never know what the future holds. But in the not-so-distant future, when I'm no longer President, I will sleep well at night because I know that men and women like you serve to keep us free.\nTake care of each other. Take care of those under your command. And as long as you keep strong that Long Blue Line, stay true to the values you've learned here: integrity, service before self, excellence. Do this, and I'm confident that we will always remain one Nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\nCongratulations, class of 2016. God bless you all. God bless the United States of America.", "timestamp": "2016-06-02", "title": "Commencement Address at the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado"}

Earlier this week, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power met with Permanent Representatives to the United Nations and others representing the co-hosts for the Summit – Canada, Ethiopia, Germany, Jordan, Mexico, Sweden and the UN Secretary General. The Leaders' Summit co-hosts pledged to work closely together to advance the objectives of the Summit, not only through direct action but also through concerted efforts to urge and support robust action by other UN Member States.\nWith 20 million refugees around the world, a comprehensive, collective international effort to strengthen refugee protection and assistance is more critical than ever. The co-hosts for the Summit all recognize that the international community must do more to protect and assist refugees. Humanitarian appeals are at record levels, yet are underfunded. Massive numbers of refugees are turning to dangerous and illegal smuggling networks in search of safety; and millions more face long-term dependency in first asylum countries, without access to lawful employment and education. In the lead up to the UNGA, the co-hosts and other UN Member States that join this effort will make concrete commitments to address these challenges, and all new and significant commitments made during 2016 will be recognized at the Leaders' Summit.\nThrough the Leaders' Summit, we will seek: at least a 30 percent increase in financing for global appeals and international humanitarian organizations; to double the global number of resettled refugees and those afforded other legal channels of admission; and to increase the number of refugees worldwide in school by one million, and the number of refugees granted the legal right to work by one million. Reaching these ambitious objectives will be challenging; yet, the level of need demands no less. The United States has long been a humanitarian leader. During this Administration, we continue to strive to do more and encourage other countries to do the same. The Leaders' Summit will further that leadership and address a level of displacement the world has not witnessed since World War II. This week's meeting with key partners committed to meeting these objectives is another key step in efforts to strengthen the international response and expand opportunities for refugees worldwide.", "timestamp": "2016-06-03", "title": "Press Release - Statement by National Security Advisor Susan Rice on Co-Hosts for President Obama's Leaders' Summit on Refugees"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117659", "text": "Aboard Air Force One\nEn Route Miami, Florida\n2:56 P.M. EDT\nMS. FRIEDMAN: Thanks, everyone. And I don't actually have anything at the top, so I will just turn it over to your questions.\nQ: Jennifer, would you like to give the White House reaction to the jobs report? And is there anything that the White House could do in the coming months that might improve the jobs picture?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: Thanks, Kevin. So I think as you've heard us say many times throughout the past seven years and again today, we don't read too much into any one month's number. This is obviously something we generally look at longer-term trends and these numbers are inherently volatile. And so obviously the number this month was disappointing and fell below expectations, but there are a couple factors involved in that, which is generally the volatility and then, of course, the temporary strike in the telecommunications industry, which I know many of you have covered, and which, as you're aware, Secretary Perez worked very hard to help resolve.\nSo what we're really focused on is some trends that we've seen particularly so far in 2016 that tell sort of the better story of where things stand. A couple of data points for you on that. Payroll growth has averaged 150,000 jobs a month, which is well above the pace necessary to maintain a low and stable employment rate. Average hourly earnings for private employees have increased 3.2 percent in 2016. And in addition, this week actually marks 65 consecutive weeks of initial jobless claims below 300,000. And that's actually the longest streak since 1973.\nSo it's important to sort of keep in mind and look at those longer-term trends. Now, there are a number of things that Congress, in particular, can and should be doing, and this is something that you've heard the President and others talk about extensively for a long time now -- some of the basic and most fundamental pieces, including adequate funding for our nation's infrastructure, raising the minimum wage -- again, something we've been calling on Congress to do for years now and we've seen 17 states plus Washington, D.C., a number of businesses take action, but still Congress has yet to act on that. Passing the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement -- these are all things -- steps that we can take and should take.\nQ: This report comes just a couple days after the President talked up the strength of the American economy. Does this report undercut that? And is there a potential to hurt Democrats at the ballot box in November?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: So, look, Byron, again, we don't read too much into any one month under any circumstances. In addition to the data points I just shared with you, the fact is that U.S. businesses have now added 14.5 million jobs over 75 straight months in private sector job growth.\nSo what you heard the President talk about in Elkhart are a couple important things -- some of the longer-term trends that we've seen over the course of his entire presidency. So a couple of points there. The rate of new foreclosures has fallen to pre-crisis levels and rising home prices have gotten millions of homeowners back above water. Auto sales reached record a level in 2015 and domestic auto production has doubled since the crisis. As you know, health care prices have risen at the lowest rate in 50 years since the ACA became law, and 20 million Americans have the added security of health insurance as a result of the Affordable Care Act.\nSo you heard the President discuss that progress that's been made but also what we've done together as a country to make that progress and what we need to do to build on it. And he talked about the choice that Americans are going to have to make in the coming months to ensure that we can continue to build on that progress rather than reversing it.\nQ: What about 2016? The White House might not care as much about the month-to-month numbers, but the general public does, and certainly the Republicans will use this as fodder on the campaign trail. What's the administration's strategy for countering that? And will the President say anything either tonight at the fundraiser or anytime soon to try to address this and try to keep your message going?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: I think, again, what you heard the President lay out in Elkhart on Wednesday is something that you'll hear him continue to make the case for in the weeks and months ahead -- obviously you'll hear from him tonight as well. So I think you can expect to hear those kinds of themes, again, where he draws a clear, stark contrast in the choice that voters are going to have to make in the coming months between what the Democrats are running on and talking about, which is building on the progress we've made, and what the alternatives are on the other side, which have been laid out pretty clearly as well.\nQ: There was continued violence in San Jose yesterday at the Donald Trump rally. Does the White House have anything to say to the people who are protesting? I know you don't agree with Donald Trump's comments, but are people crossing the line?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: So, look, I think the President has spoken about this generally a number of times. He's made clear that violence has no place in American political discourse, and that continues to be his position. You'll have an opportunity to hear from him again certainly in the coming days and weeks and months, so I'm sure you'll hear more about the topic generally.\nQ: Is the President going to try, though, to cool passion out there, tempers, for the people that are outside of Trump's rallies?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: I think you've heard the President speak to this generally and his views on the fact that violence has no place in the political discourse, and that continues to be his view.\nQ: Donald Trump kept up his attacks on a judge of Mexican heritage. He questioned that this judge could even hear this fraud trial. I guess, is the White House alarmed by those comments, both the racially tinged nature of them as well as the attack on an independent judiciary?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: So, look, as you've heard us say before, we're not going to comment on every comment that's thrown out there on the campaign trail, both the positive ones and the more egregious ones. But one thing the President has been clear about in general is his strong belief in both an independent judiciary and the rule of law. And both of those things are essential to our democracy. And that's true in all circumstances, and that should also be something that transcends politics. And this is obviously something the President has spoken about a number of times and spent a lot of time on. So that is his general view.\nQ: Before we got on the plane I noticed that the NSC was tweeting about Zika. Has there been another case or a case -- is there something new that you can tell us about?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: I don't have any updates from here. I'm not sure if anything has transpired since we've been in the air. But I think generally you've heard what we've said -- the President and, as importantly, our public health officials -- about what we need to do for what is now a public health emergency in terms of dealing with the Zika virus. The President has put forward the plan that his public officials believe are what we need to combat Zika, and House Republicans are basically three months and more than a billion dollars short in terms of -- three months late and a billion dollars short in terms of what they've done about it.\nThe President, along with his public health team, along with governors from across the country and a number of members of Congress understand the need to adequately fund efforts to address Zika. And he's put forward a $1.9 billion proposal to do so, and there's absolutely no reason that Congress shouldn't be acting immediately.\nQ: I wanted to ask you about this retirement advice regulation lawsuit led by the Chamber of Commerce against the Obama administration. I'm just kind of wondering if this new advice -- if these regulations interfere with the business's ability to cut a profit. Is that the view?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: So I think -- I don't have any specific comment for you on the lawsuit. I have not looked into that, and would leave that to folks who are the lawyers in the house. But as a general matter, I think you've heard the President say a number of times that he believes that American workers and retirees deserve to receive retirement advice that is in their best interest. And that should be a basic, fundamental right. And the rule that the Department of Labor put forth was created to ensure that financial advisors act in their client's best interest -- which, again, should be common sense.\nWe know that conflicted advice already costs American families an estimated $17 billion a year. And so not only is this something that's the right thing to do, but it makes sense for pocketbooks, as well. And so that's sort of the hallmark of the action that the Labor Department took.\nQ: And then yesterday, the President met with the pilot of that Thunderbird aircraft that crash-landed. Does the President have any intention -- or has he already reached out to the family of the pilot that was killed in the Blue Angel crash in Tennessee?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: I don't have any particular conversations or phone calls to read out at this point. But obviously the President sends his deepest sympathies and condolences to the family and friends and colleagues of that individual.\nQ: On the Puerto Rico legislation being considered in Congress, the White House has been clear that it wants legislation to move. There's a provision in that bill that would create an oversight board for Puerto Rico. Does the White House want Congress to include funding for that board so that it's fully independent, and ensure objectivity of it?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: So, Angela, I'm glad you asked about this, because this is an issue that's very important both to the President and the American people. Just stepping back, what we've said a number of times is that it is critical, and the time is right now to address the crisis in Puerto Rico. And that involves providing a workable and comprehensive restructuring authority with appropriate oversight that respects Puerto Rico's self-governance. So we're obviously encouraged to see the House introduce legislation to provide Puerto Rico with these tools that help address the crisis that's harming the 3.5 million Americans who are living in Puerto Rico.\nAnd so, as you know, the legislation that you're referencing passed the House National Resources Committee with strong bipartisan support, and we are encouraging Congress to move forward on that as quickly as possible.\nNow, obviously we would have preferred a bill without certain provisions, such as the minimum wage and overtime provisions. But as is the case in any compromise, this is a bill that we could support and we think it's critical.\nWhen it comes to the oversight board, obviously the discussions are still ongoing. And I think it was important generally that we reach an agreement on the process to ensure that we had a well-functioning independent group of experts on the board and that the board is up and running as quickly as possible so we can work with Puerto Rico to address the crisis.\nQ: Any position on whether it should be funded by Congress?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: I think I would check with the Treasury Department on that specific question, and we can see if we have any additional details for you.\nQ: One more question I had was: In Elkhart, the President said that he believed that after next week's primaries there be a clear picture on who the Democratic nominee is. At that point, do you expect the President to put more pressure on Bernie Sanders to end his campaign? Do you think that he'll step up or change his own -- I guess he's kind of been reserved so far from putting pressure on Bernie Sanders. Do you expect that to change in the coming days?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: So, John, what you heard the President say on Wednesday is something that he said a number of times over the past months, but actually his views on this date back to his own experiences in 2008, where he had an extensive primary campaign. The President also said on Wednesday he believes that a competitive Democratic primary is a good thing. He said that, \"There's been a healthy debate in the Democratic Party.\" And he, in terms of timing, was noting that this is -- given the primary calendar coming to an end soon, with two large primaries next week in the calendar, just as a matter of fact, time is going to be ending soon.\nAnd so I think what the President also said is that what he's tried to do is make sure that voters, rather than he, are making the decision and deciding the outcome. And so he said we'll have a pretty good sense next week, a clearer picture, given the large primaries that are expected next week, and that there's going to be plenty of time for him to step in and campaign. So I don't have any specific announcements or events to preview for you.\nQ: Speaking of previewing, can you preview the visit by Prime Minister Modi on Tuesday? He was here fairly recently. And India sounds like it has a fairly long agenda for what it wants out of the meeting with President Obama. But what does the U.S. want to go away with? And what do you expect to be top of mind during those talks?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: Thanks, Angela. So I think we'll have additional detail for you on that closer to the time. But obviously there's a whole host of issues where our relationship and partnership is robust and important -- everything ranging from climate to military steps we're taking, to a whole host of economic steps that we're working on together. And so I think you can expect them to discuss a whole range of those items and the robust partnership we have.\nQ: What can you tell us about the President's activities this weekend, beyond the fundraisers tonight?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: So we don't have any additional public schedule items for this weekend. Nothing to share at this point. Now, as you may recall, there have been certain other times where he's spent a little bit of time outdoors in this part of the country, so I wouldn't preclude that from happening again this time. But no, nothing public on his calendar for this weekend.\nQ: Week ahead?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: The week ahead. All right, let's do it.\nSo, on Monday, the President will welcome this year's Super Bowl Champion, the Denver Broncos, to the White House to honor the team in their Super Bowl 50 victory.\nOn Tuesday, the President will meet with Prime Minister Modi of India, as we've just discussed, at the White House. And the visit will highlight the deepening of the U.S.-India relationship in key areas since the President's visit to New Delhi in January 2015. Among the issues that the President looks forward to discussing are progress made on climate change and clean energy partnership, security and defense cooperation, and economic growth priorities.\nOn Wednesday, the President will travel to New York, New York, where he will attend a DSCC event and a DNC event.\nOn Thursday, the President will host a reception at the White House in recognition of LGBT Pride Month.\nAnd on Friday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.\nQ: Could you just repeat Thursday? I didn't hear that, sorry.\nMS. FRIEDMAN: Sure. On Thursday, the President will host a reception at the White House in recognition of LGBT Pride Month.\nQ: Jen, is there anyone traveling with him on the plane today? Any members of the Senate?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: No, I don't think we have any members on the plane with us today. I'll let you know if there's someone I missed. But I don't think so.\nThanks, everyone.\nEND 3:12 P.M.

First of all, it is beyond a pleasure and an honor to be here to celebrate the City College of New York Class of 2016! You all, I mean, this has been the most fun I think I've had at a commencement ever. (Applause.)\nLet me just say a few thank yous. Let me start, of course, by thanking President Coico for that wonderful introduction, for her leadership here at City College, for this honorary degree.\nI also want to recognize Senator Schumer, Chancellor Milliken, Trustee Shorter, Edward Plotkin, as well as your amazing valedictorian, Antonios Mourdoukoutas -- did I get it right? (Applause.) And your amazing salutatorian, Orubba Almansouri. (Applause.) I really don't want to follow those two. (Laughter.) If anybody is wondering about the quality of education, just listening to those two speakers lets you know what's happening here. And I'm so proud of you both -- and to your families, congratulations. Well done. Well done. (Applause.)\nAnd of course, let us not forget Elizabeth Aklilu for her amazing performance of the National Anthem earlier today. She blew it out of the water. (Applause.)\nBut most of all, I want to acknowledge all of you -– the brilliant, talented, ambitious, accomplished, and all-around outstanding members of the class of 2016! Woo! (Applause.) You give me chills. You all have worked so hard and come so far to reach this milestone, so I know this is a big day for all of you and your families, and for everyone at this school who supported you on this journey.\nAnd in many ways, this is a big day for me too. See, this is my very last commencement address as First Lady of the United States. This is it. (Applause.) So I just want to take it all in. And I think this was the perfect place to be, because this is my last chance to share my love and admiration, and hopefully a little bit of wisdom with a graduating class.\nAnd, graduates, I really want you all to know that there is a reason why, of all of the colleges and universities in this country, I chose this particular school in this particular city for this special moment. (Applause.) And I'm here because of all of you. I mean, we've talked about it -- Antonios, I'm going to talk a little bit about diversity, thank you. (Laughter.)\nJust look around. Look at who you are. Look at where we're gathered today. As the President eloquently said, at this school, you represent more than 150 nationalities. You speak more than 100 different languages -- whoa, just stop there. You represent just about every possible background -– every color and culture, every faith and walk of life. And you've taken so many different paths to this moment.\nMaybe your family has been in this city for generations, or maybe, like my family, they came to this country centuries ago in chains. Maybe they just arrived here recently, determined to give you a better life.\nBut, graduates, no matter where your journey started, you have all made it here today through the same combination of unyielding determination, sacrifice, and a whole lot of hard work -– commuting hours each day to class, some of you. (Applause.) Yes, amen. (Laughter.) Juggling multiple jobs to support your families and pay your tuition. (Applause.) Studying late into the night, early in the morning; on subways and buses, and in those few precious minutes during breaks at work.\nAnd somehow, you still found time to give back to your communities –- tutoring young people, reading to kids, volunteering at hospitals. Somehow, you still managed to do prestigious internships and research fellowships, and join all kinds of clubs and activities. And here at this nationally-ranked university, with a rigorous curriculum and renowned faculty, you rose to the challenge, distinguishing yourselves in your classes, winning countless honors and awards, and getting into top graduate schools across this country. Whoa. (Laughter.)\nSo, graduates, with your glorious diversity, with your remarkable accomplishments and your deep commitment to your communities, you all embody the very purpose of this school's founding. And, more importantly, you embody the very hopes and dreams carved into the base of that iconic statue not so far from where we sit -- on that island where so many of your predecessors at this school first set foot on our shores.\nAnd that is why I wanted to be here today at City College. I wanted to be here to celebrate all of you, this school, this city. (Applause.) Because I know that there is no better way to celebrate this great country than being here with you.\nSee, all of you know, for centuries, this city has been the gateway to America for so many striving, hope-filled immigrants -- folks who left behind everything they knew to seek out this land of opportunity that they dreamed of. And so many of those folks, for them, this school was the gateway to actually realizing that opportunity in their lives, founded on the fundamental truth that talent and ambition know no distinctions of race, nationality, wealth, or fame, and dedicated to the ideals that our Founding Fathers put forth more than two centuries ago: That we are all created equal, all entitled to \"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\" City College became a haven for brilliant, motivated students of every background, a place where they didn't have to hide their last names or their accents, or put on any kind of airs because the students at this school were selected based not on pedigree, but on merit, and merit alone. (Applause.)\nSo really, it is no accident that this institution has produced 10 Nobel Prize winners -- (applause) -- along with countless captains of industry, cultural icons, leaders at the highest levels of government. Because talent and effort combined with our various backgrounds and life experiences has always been the lifeblood of our singular American genius.\nJust take the example of the great American lyricist, Ira Gershwin, who attended City College a century ago. The son of a Russian-Jewish immigrant, his songs still light up Broadway today. Or consider the story of the former CEO of Intel, Andrew Grove, class of 1960. (Applause.) He was a Hungarian immigrant whose harrowing escape from Nazism and communism shaped both his talent for business and his commitment to philanthropy.\nAnd just think about the students in this very graduating class –- students like the economics and pre-law major from Albania, who also completed the requirements for a philosophy major and dreams of being a public intellectual. The educational theater student from right here in Harlem who's already an award-winning playwright and recently spoke at the White House. The biomedical science major who was born in Afghanistan and plans to be a doctor, a policy maker and an educator. (Applause.) And your salutatorian, whose Yemeni roots inspired her to study Yemini women's writing and to advocate for girls in her community, urging them to find their own voices, to tell their own stories. I could go on.\nThese are just four of the nearly 4,000 unique and amazing stories in this graduating class –- stories that have converged here at City College, this dynamic, inclusive place where you all have had the chance to really get to know each other, to listen to each other's languages, to enjoy each other's food -- lasagna, obviously -- (laughter) -- music, and holidays. Debating each other's ideas, pushing each other to question old assumptions and consider new perspectives.\nAnd those interactions have been such a critical part of your education at this school. Those moments when your classmates showed you that your stubborn opinion wasn't all that well-informed -- mmm hmm. (Laughter.) Or when they opened your eyes to an injustice you never knew existed. Or when they helped you with a question that you couldn't have possibly answered on your own.\nI think your valedictorian put it best -- and this is a quote -- he said, \"The sole irreplaceable component of my CCNY experience came from learning alongside people with life experiences strikingly different from my own.\" He said, \"I have learned that diversity in human experience gives rise to diversity in thought, which creates distinct ideas and methods of problem solving.\" That was an okay quote. (Laughter and applause.) Okay, you're bright. (Laughter.) I couldn't have said it better myself.\nThat is the power of our differences to make us smarter and more creative. And that is how all those infusions of new cultures and ideas, generation after generation, created the matchless alchemy of our melting pot and helped us build the strongest, most vibrant, most prosperous nation on the planet, right here. (Applause.)\nBut unfortunately, graduates, despite the lessons of our history and the truth of your experience here at City College, some folks out there today seem to have a very different perspective. They seem to view our diversity as a threat to be contained rather than as a resource to be tapped. They tell us to be afraid of those who are different, to be suspicious of those with whom we disagree. They act as if name-calling is an acceptable substitute for thoughtful debate, as if anger and intolerance should be our default state rather than the optimism and openness that have always been the engine of our progress.\nBut, graduates, I can tell you, as First Lady, I have had the privilege of traveling around the world and visiting dozens of different countries, and I have seen what happens when ideas like these take hold. I have seen how leaders who rule by intimidation –- leaders who demonize and dehumanize entire groups of people –- often do so because they have nothing else to offer. And I have seen how places that stifle the voices and dismiss the potential of their citizens are diminished; how they are less vital, less hopeful, less free.\nGraduates, that is not who we are. That is not what this country stands for. (Applause.) No, here in America, we don't let our differences tear us apart. Not here. Because we know that our greatness comes when we appreciate each other's strengths, when we learn from each other, when we lean on each other. Because in this country, it's never been each person for themselves. No, we're all in this together. We always have been.\nAnd here in America, we don't give in to our fears. We don't build up walls to keep people out because we know that our greatness has always depended on contributions from people who were born elsewhere but sought out this country and made it their home -– from innovations like Google and eBay to inventions like the artificial heart, the telephone, even the blue jeans; to beloved patriotic songs like \"God Bless America,\" like national landmarks like the Brooklyn Bridge and, yes, the White House -– both of which were designed by architects who were immigrants. (Applause.)\nFinally, graduates, our greatness has never, ever come from sitting back and feeling entitled to what we have. It's never come from folks who climb the ladder of success, or who happen to be born near the top and then pull that ladder up after themselves. No, our greatness has always come from people who expect nothing and take nothing for granted -- folks who work hard for what they have then reach back and help others after them.\nThat is your story, graduates, and that is the story of your families. (Applause.) And it's the story of my family, too. As many of you know, I grew up in a working class family in Chicago. And while neither of my parents went past high school, let me tell you, they saved up every penny that my dad earned at his city job because they were determined to send me to college.\nAnd even after my father was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis and he struggled to walk, relying on crutches just to get himself out of bed each morning, my father hardly ever missed a day of work. See, that blue-collar job helped to pay the small portion of my college tuition that wasn't covered by loans or grants or my work-study or my summer jobs. And my dad was so proud to pay that tuition bill on time each month, even taking out loans when he fell short. See, he never wanted me to miss a registration deadline because his check was late. That's my story.\nAnd, graduates, you all have faced challenges far greater than anything I or my family have ever experienced, challenges that most college students could never even imagine. Some of you have been homeless. Some of you have risked the rejection of your families to pursue your education. Many of you have lain awake at night wondering how on Earth you were going to support your parents and your kids and still pay tuition. And many of you know what it's like to live not just month to month or day to day, but meal to meal.\nBut, graduates, let me tell you, you should never, ever be embarrassed by those struggles. You should never view your challenges as a disadvantage. Instead, it's important for you to understand that your experience facing and overcoming adversity is actually one of your biggest advantages. And I know that because I've seen it myself, not just as a student working my way through school, but years later when I became -- before I came to the White House and I worked as a dean at a college.\nIn that role, I encountered students who had every advantage –- their parents paid their full tuition, they lived in beautiful campus dorms. They had every material possession a college kid could want –- cars, computers, spending money. But when some of them got their first bad grade, they just fell apart. They lost it, because they were ill-equipped to handle their first encounter with disappointment or falling short.\nBut, graduates, as you all know, life will put many obstacles in your path that are far worse than a bad grade. You'll have unreasonable bosses and difficult clients and patients. You'll experience illnesses and losses, crises and setbacks that will come out of nowhere and knock you off your feet. But unlike so many other young people, you have already developed the resilience and the maturity that you need to pick yourself up and dust yourself off and keep moving through the pain, keep moving forward. You have developed that muscle. (Applause.)\nAnd with the education you've gotten at this fine school, and the experiences you've had in your lives, let me tell you, nothing -– and I mean nothing -– is going to stop you from fulfilling your dreams. And you deserve every last one of the successes that I know you will have.\nBut I also want to be very clear that with those successes comes a set of obligations –- to share the lessons you've learned here at this school. The obligation to use the opportunities you've had to help others. That means raising your hand when you get a seat in that board meeting and asking the question, well, whose voices aren't being heard here? What ideas are we missing? It means adding your voice to our national conversation, speaking out for our most cherished values of liberty, opportunity, inclusion, and respect –- the values that you've been living here at this school.\nIt means reaching back to help young people who've been left out and left behind, helping them prepare for college, helping them pay for college, making sure that great public universities like this one have the funding and support that they need. (Applause.) Because we all know that public universities have always been one of the greatest drivers of our prosperity, lifting countless people into the middle class, creating jobs and wealth all across this nation.\nPublic education is our greatest pathway to opportunity in America. So we need to invest in and strengthen our public universities today, and for generations to come. (Applause.) That is how you will do your part to live up to the oath that you all will take here today –- the oath taken by generations of graduates before you to make your city and your world \"greater, better, and more beautiful.\"\nMore than anything else, graduates, that is the American story. It's your story and the story of those who came before you at this school. It's the story of the son of Polish immigrants named Jonas Salk who toiled for years in a lab until he discovered a vaccine that saved countless lives. It's the story of the son of immigrant -- Jamaican immigrants named Colin Powell who became a four star general, Secretary of State, and a role model for young people across the country.\nAnd, graduates, it's the story that I witness every single day when I wake up in a house that was built by slaves, and I watch my daughters –- two beautiful, black young women -– head off to school -- (applause) -- waving goodbye to their father, the President of the United States, the son of a man from Kenya who came here to American -- to America for the same reasons as many of you: To get an education and improve his prospects in life.\nSo, graduates, while I think it's fair to say that our Founding Fathers never could have imagined this day, all of you are very much the fruits of their vision. Their legacy is very much your legacy and your inheritance. And don't let anybody tell you differently. You are the living, breathing proof that the American Dream endures in our time. It's you.\nSo I want you all to go out there. Be great. Build great lives for yourselves. Enjoy the liberties that you have in this great country. Pursue your own version of happiness. And please, please, always, always do your part to help others do the same.\nI love you all. I am so proud of you. (Applause.) Thank you for allowing me to share this final commencement with you. I have so much faith in who you will be. Just keep working hard and keep the faith. I can't wait to see what you all achieve in the years ahead.\nThank you all. God bless. Good luck on the road ahead. (Applause.)", "timestamp": "2016-06-03", "title": "Commencement Address by the First Lady at City College of New York"}

Everybody, please have a seat. Have a seat. Well, it is so good to see all of you. Thank you so much. I see a bunch of old friends and just made some new friends, and so I'm just thrilled to be here.\nFirst of all, I just want to thank Robert and Janice for their incredible hospitality. Thank you so much. Give them a big round of applause. Not to mention their moms, who are here—very important. Two great friends who've worked tirelessly on behalf of the Democratic Party for a long time: Stephen Bittel and Henry Muñoz. Where are they? There they are. Running for Congress, former Governor, great friend—Charlie Crist is in the house!\nNot in attendance, but I just want to give a shout-out to because I think he's going to be outstanding in the United States Senate, and I just left him—Patrick Murphy. I want everybody to be working hard for Patrick. And last, but not least, somebody who—I don't know how she does it because she's everywhere all the time, nonstop, and she's a mom and a wife, and has been just an incredible supporter of my agenda. She's taken tough votes when they're the right thing to do, and she is somebody who I have counted on consistently. She's had my back. I want to make sure we have her back—Debbie Wasserman Schultz.\nSo I'm not going to give a long speech here because I want to take some time for questions and conversation. You may have noticed there's an election going on. [Laughter] One that's a little unusual, little more colorful than some in the past. And just this week, I went to Elkhart, Indiana—some of you may have seen this—the place, the city that I first visited 3 weeks after I was elected. It was the first place outside of Washington that I went to at the dawn of my Presidency. And at the time, the unemployment rate there was close to 20 percent, and about one in 10 people were either in foreclosure or at risk of losing their homes.\nAnd I went back because this is a predominantly Republican county—I won Indiana in 2008, got whupped in 2012, but in both elections I lost Elkhart—and pointed out to them their unemployment rate now is 4.1 percent, that only one in 30 people still have trouble with their mortgage payments. This is the \"RV Capital of the World,\" and they are now on pace for selling more RVs than they ever have. And the point I made to them is that if in fact what is driving your votes, if what you're deeply concerned about is the state of the middle class and the ability of people to work hard and get ahead and pass on opportunity to their kids and their grandkids—if that's what you're concerned about, then this election shouldn't be close.\nBecause the economic agenda that we have put forward has not only worked to pull us out of recession, but the things that we have not yet gotten done, but have proposed—like an increase in the minimum wage or rebuilding our infrastructure and putting people back to work all across the country or investing more in research and development and emphasizing clean energy and making sure that we have trade deals that work for America, but don't result in trade wars that could destroy our economy—those things are actually going to help the middle class and create ladders of opportunity.\nAnd in contrast, the agenda that's being presented by the party that the majority of folks in Elkhart, up until this point at least, have voted for run contrary to what everybody says is their biggest concern, which is middle class families getting squeezed. You can't make an argument that cutting taxes for the top 1 percent even further is going to help middle class families. You can't make an argument that not investing in infrastructure somehow is going to help businesses thrive and jobs get created. You can't argue that making no progress on equal pay for equal work is somehow good for two-parent households that are reliant on both paychecks.\nSo I said to them, I said, look, there are other issues other than the economy. Maybe what's driving you is your concern about gun rights. Maybe what's driving you is abortion or same-sex marriage. I'm happy to have those debates. I think I'm on the right side of these issues, but I'm respectful of us having a civil conversation about it. But if your concern is the economy, then this shouldn't be close.\nNow, in fact, when you look at what's happening in the other party right now, there is no coherent economic theory. And the appeal that is being made is not primarily an economic one, but rather it is feeding resentments, and looking for a \"they\" to blame for whatever frustrations people understandably feel at any given moment in time. And so being able to say that it's immigrants, or it's gays, or it's somebody that is taking something away from you—that's the essence of the message that the Republican nominee is delivering and, frankly, has been the essence of the message that's been delivered by this Republican Congress for too long.\nAnd it's divisive. And it's factually wrong. And it has held us back, because we would have recovered faster, stronger, now we'd be in better shape and we would certainly be laying a better foundation for our kids and our grandkids if they'd actually wanted to get stuff done, as opposed to just consolidate control of the House of Representatives or gain seats in the Senate or try to block me from whatever I proposed.\nNow, that's just the facts. And I actually challenged people during my talk. I said, look, if there's anything I'm saying that you think is wrong, if you're disputing the basic argument they're making or the facts that I'm presenting, I can show you their websites, and I can show you the economic data.\nSo we've got the better arguments here. And the issue is going to be, do we feel the same sense of urgency? And are we engaged and are we participating to make sure that we win a White House and we get back a Congress that can move this country forward in a constructive way?\nAnd the good news is, we've got great candidates around the country who are prepared to do that. And I'm confident that we will have, by the time of the convention, a nominee around which we can rally. And I'm going to work has hard as I can to make sure those things happen.\nBut just a couple of cautionary notes, and then I'll take some questions. Point number one: We have to take this election seriously. Because we live in a fascinating media environment—we were just talking, my staff and I, as we were driving over here—I don't watch television as a general rule, except sports—[laughter]—but they were explaining how Mr. Trump occupies about 70 percent of the news today. It's just constant. And celebrity and fame is such a driver in this culture that—and everything is so contested, because people, if they want to believe something, they can go to this TV station or this website and block everything out—that strange things can happen in an election like this if we're not working hard, if we're not engaged, if we're not participating.\nSo although I am confident in our abilities to win, I want us to run scared the whole time. That's point number one. Point number two is, it is very important for us to remind ourselves of who we are and what is best about American democracy and not slip into some of the bad habits that currently manifest themselves in the other party. We saw in San Jose these protesters starting to pelt stuff on Trump supporters. That's not what our democracy is about. That's not what you do. There's no room for violence. There's no place for shouting. There's no room for a politics that fails to at least listen to the other side, even if you vehemently disagree. Because I believe if you've got the better argument, you don't need to do that. Just go out there and organize and persuade.\nWhenever I'm in a town hall or an event and I mention something that I really disagree with on the Republican policy, and people start booing when they hear the word \"Republican,\" I always say, \"Don't boo, vote!\" [Laughter] Booing doesn't do anything. [Laughter] You're not getting anything done there.\nAnd by the way, I want our democracy to work in such a way that eventually—and I've been waiting a while now—but eventually, the Republican fever breaks, and they become once again a sensible, center-right party that can have a coherent policy debate with us, and we can actually get some stuff done. But that doesn't happen if we start digging into absolutist positions and aren't willing to compromise and are resorting to some of the same kinds of tactics that they've been engaging in for quite some time.\nThe bottom line is, though, we have cause for optimism. I've done a lot of commencements recently and including the Air Force Academy. And these military academies are incredible, the pageantry. They march in and at the end of it, they throw up their hats, and the Thunderbirds fly over, and it's beautiful, it's amazing. And these young people, they just make you optimistic. They're serving their country. They come from every walk of life. I do have to salute and shake hands with a thousand of them—[laughter]—and so I get, like, pitcher's arm at the end of it. [Laughter] They're all really young and excited to see me, so they're all like—[laughter]—\"Mr. President, it's great to see you!\" [Laughter] \"I'm proud of you.\" [Laughter]\nBut I've been doing these commencements, and you talk to these young people—they're great. And they're smart, and they're hopeful, and they're sophisticated, and they want to contribute to the world. And so, in each of the commencements, because they've been so overloaded with negative stuff and name calling and bad news, I have to remind them, I said, look, as tough as things seem right now, as frustrating as our politics may be, as terrible as some of the events you see around the world may be, if you had to choose one time in American history or world history in which to be born and you didn't know ahead of time whether you were going to be male or female, Black, White, gay, straight—you didn't know who you were going to be, you'd choose now.\nWe forget sometimes, we take for granted the incredible progress that we've made across every dimension of the economy, security, a society that's more tolerant and more accepting of diversity. We've got a lot of stuff to build on. But we've got to make sure we get this election right.\nAnd that's where you come in. Supporting the DSCC, supporting the DCCC, supporting the DNC. I can't do it alone. Debbie, Henry, Stephen—they can't do it alone. We're going to need you. And your presence here today makes all the difference.

She supported and he opposed the measure which was criticized by one of the country's foremost Latino organizations, by organized labor and by a leading human rights organization.\n\"I voted against this bill because the League of United Latin American Citizens, the largest and oldest Hispanic organization in the United States, said that it could not 'support a bill that will separate families and lead to the exploitation of immigrant workers,'\" Sanders said....akin to slavery allowing employers to exploit workers, cheat them out of wages, deny them medical treatment...\n\"I voted against this bill because the Southern Poverty Law Center found that the massive expansion of guest worker programs included in the legislation were akin to slavery allowing employers to exploit workers, cheat them out of wages, deny them medical treatment for on-the-job injuries, force them to live in squalid conditions and compel them to mortgage their futures to obtain low wage, temporary jobs.\"\n\"I voted against this bill because the AFL-CIO, the largest trade union in America representing over 12 million workers, said that it was 'far from the kind of comprehensive immigration reform that would improve the status quo for either U.S.-born or immigrant workers or their families' and was 'likely to make matters much worse,'\" the Vermont senator said.  We must protect children fleeing to the U.S. from violence in Central America, not use them to \"send a message.\"\nSanders noted other areas of disagreement with Clinton on immigration issues.\nHe opposes deportation of children who fled to the United States from violence in Central America. She thinks the deportations will \"send a message.\" \"Instead, we need to welcome these children into our country and do everything we can to help them get their lives back together,\" Sanders said.\nHe wants to shut down private prisons used to jail those awaiting deportation. She took campaign cash from private prison lobbyists.\nThey also split on whether to allow undocumented immigrants to obtain drivers' licenses. She fought and helped block passage of a proposal in New York. He supported a similar effort in Vermont which became law in 2013.\n\"I am proud that I have the strongest immigration reform plan of any candidate running for president.

I'd been on the job for 3 weeks, and we were just a few months into the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes. Elkhart was hit harder than most. Unemployment there peaked at nearly 20 percent shortly after my visit. Nearly one in five people there were out of work.\nThis week, I returned to Elkhart. Unemployment there has now fallen to around 4 percent. More families are back on sturdy ground. More are covered by health insurance. More of their kids are graduating from high school. And it's no accident. It's because people there worked hard and sacrificed and looked out for each other.\nBut it's also because we made a series of smart decisions early in my Presidency: to rescue the auto industry, to help families refinance their homes, to invest in things like high-tech manufacturing, clean energy, and the infrastructure that creates good new jobs, not to mention the job training that helps folks earn new skills to fill those jobs.\nThe results are clear. America's businesses have created 14.5 million new jobs over 75 straight months. We've seen the first sustained manufacturing growth since the nineties. We've cut unemployment by more than half. Another 20 million Americans have health insurance. And we've cut our deficits by nearly 75 percent.\nWe haven't fixed everything. Wages, while growing again, need to grow faster. The gap between the rich and everyone else is still way too wide. Republicans in Congress have repeatedly blocked investments and initiatives that would have created jobs faster. But the middle class isn't getting squeezed because of minorities or immigrants or moochers or anyone else we're told to blame for our problems. If we're going to fix what needs fixing, we can't divide ourselves. We've got to come together, around our common economic goals. We've got to push back against policies that protect powerful special interests and push for a better deal for all working Americans.\nThat's the choice you'll get to make this year: between policies that raise wages and policies that won't, between strengthening Social Security and making it more generous or making it harder to help people save and retire, between strengthening the rules we put on Wall Street to prevent another crisis or dismantling them, between a Tax Code that's fair for working families or wasteful tax cuts for a fortunate few at the very top.\nOver the past 7 years, we've proven that progress is possible. But it's not inevitable. It depends on us. It depends on the choices we make. And if we come together around our common values and our belief in opportunity for everyone who puts in the effort, then we'll deliver on a brighter future for all of us.\nThanks, and have a great weekend.", "timestamp": "2016-06-04", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}

If you just asked him, he'd tell you. He'd tell you he was the double greatest, that he'd \"handcuffed lightning, thrown thunder into jail.\" But what made \"the Champ\" the greatest—what truly separated him from everyone else—is that everyone else would tell you pretty much the same thing.\nLike everyone else on the planet, Michelle and I mourn his passing. But we're also grateful to God for how fortunate we are to have known him, if just for a while; for how fortunate we all are that the Greatest chose to grace our time.\nIn my private study, just off the Oval Office, I keep a pair of his gloves on display, just under that iconic photograph of him: the young champ, just 22 years old, roaring like a lion over a fallen Sonny Liston. I was too young when it was taken to understand who he was: still Cassius Clay, already an Olympic Gold Medal winner, yet to set out on a spiritual journey that would lead him to his Muslim faith, exile him at the peak of his power, and set the stage for his return to greatness with a name as familiar to the downtrodden in the slums of Southeast Asia and the villages of Africa as it was to cheering crowds in Madison Square Garden.\n\"I am America,\" he once declared. \"I am the part you won't recognize. But get used to me—Black, confident, cocky; my name, not yours; my religion, not yours; my goals, my own. Get used to me.\"\nThat's the Ali I came to know as I came of age, not just as skilled a poet on the mic as he was a fighter in the ring, but a man who fought for what was right, a man who fought for us. He stood with King and Mandela, stood up when it was hard, spoke out when others wouldn't. His fight outside the ring would cost him his title and his public standing. It would earn him enemies on the left and the right, make him reviled, and nearly send him to jail. But Ali stood his ground. And his victory helped us get used to the America we recognize today.\nHe wasn't perfect, of course. For all his magic in the ring, he could be careless with his words and full of contradictions as his faith evolved. But his wonderful, infectious, even innocent spirit ultimately won him more fans than foes, maybe because in him, we hoped to see something of ourselves. Later, as his physical powers ebbed, he became an even more powerful force for peace and reconciliation around the world. We saw a man who said he was so mean he'd make medicine sick reveal a soft spot, visiting children with illness and disability around the world, telling them they, too, could become the greatest. We watched a hero light a torch and fight his greatest fight of all on the world stage once again, a battle against the disease that ravaged his body, but couldn't take the spark from his eyes.\nMuhammad Ali shook up the world. And the world is better for it. We are all better for it.

My administration implemented our Nation's first comprehensive national HIV/AIDS strategy, and we've updated it through 2020.\nWe've invested in research and evidence-based practices that have given us revolutionary tools like treatment as prevention and preexposure prophylaxis. We've made critical investments to help eliminate waiting lists for the AIDS Drug Assistance Program. We've continued efforts to support the promise of a vaccine. And the Affordable Care Act has resulted in millions of individuals gaining affordable, high-quality health coverage, all without denial for preexisting conditions like HIV.\nWhile there is more work to do—the economically disadvantaged; gay and bisexual men, especially those who are young and Black; women of color; and transgender women all continue to face huge disparities—I'm confident that if we build upon the steps we've taken, we can finish the job.\nNearly 5 years ago, I said that an AIDS-free generation is within reach, and today, the global community is committed to ending this epidemic by 2030. This will take American leadership, smart investments, and a commitment to ensure that all communities are heard and included as we move forward.\nSo today let's call the names. Let's remember those we lost too soon. And let's rededicate ourselves to ending this epidemic once and for all.", "timestamp": "2016-06-05", "title": "Statement on the 35th Anniversary of HIV/AIDS in the United States"}

For many, this month is an opportunity to focus on reflection and spiritual growth, forgiveness, patience and resilience, compassion for those less fortunate, and unity across communities. Each lesson is profound on its own and, taken together, forms a harmonious whole. It's also a time of year that brings some of the best dishes to the table across the world as families and neighbors gather for iftar.\nHere in the United States, we are blessed with Muslim communities as diverse as our Nation itself. There are those whose heritage can be traced back to the very beginning of our Nation, as well as those who have only just arrived. Doctors, lawyers, artists, teachers, scientists, community organizers, public servants, and military members, each night will all break their fasts together in cities across America.\nAs Muslim Americans celebrate the holy month, I am reminded that we are one American family. I stand firmly with Muslim American communities in rejection of the voices that seek to divide us or limit our religious freedoms or civil rights. I stand committed to safeguarding the civil rights of all Americans, no matter their religion or appearance. I stand in celebration of our common humanity and dedication to peace and justice for all.\nAnd in this month of reflection, we cannot forget the millions of lives that have been displaced by conflict and struggle, across the world, and in our own backyards. Far too many Muslims may not be able to observe Ramadan from the comfort of their own homes this year or afford to celebrate Eid with their children. We must continue working together to alleviate the suffering of these individuals. This sacred time reminds us of our common obligations to uphold the dignity of every human being. We will continue to welcome immigrants and refugees into our Nation, including those who are Muslim.\nAs I have done throughout my Presidency, I look forward to opening the doors of the White House to Muslim Americans during this special occasion, this year for an Eid celebration marking the end of Ramadan. I can think of no better way to mark my administration's last celebration of Ramadan as President than to honor the contributions of Muslims in America and across the world for Eid.

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117658", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:22 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Happy Monday. Before I get to your questions, let me just -- I wanted to start today by acknowledging the death of NPR journalist, David Gilkey, and his colleague, Zabihullah Tamanna. Both of them were killed while reporting on the conflict in Afghanistan over the weekend.\nI know there are a number of people in this room who worked with Mr. Gilkey and deeply respected his professionalism and his commitment to going anywhere, even dangerous places like Afghanistan, repeatedly, to get the story and to tell the story in photos and on video. His work is a testament to the courage and passion that is displayed by professional journalists around the world every day who put their lives at risk to tell the story of people whose voices would otherwise go unheard.\nIn short, we owe these professionals a debt of gratitude for the risks they take and the service that they provide. Mr. Gilkey was honored on many occasions by his colleagues for his work, including by the White House News Photographers Association as the best photographer of the year in 2010. The President had an opportunity to meet Mr. Gilkey when he greeted that year's award-winning journalists in the Oval Office, like he does every year.\nI know there are a lot of broken hearts in this room and over at NPR headquarters over the loss of your beloved colleagues. Please know that the thoughts and prayers of everyone here at the White House, including the President and the First Lady, are with those who are mourning the death of Mr. Gilkey and Mr. Tamanna today.\nSo after that sad news, Darlene, we can go to questions.\nQ: Thank you. A question about Congress -- lawmakers are coming back to town this week. They'll be here for about six weeks or so before they go off to the political conventions and then the August recess. Besides money for Zika and the bill to help Puerto Rico with its debt crisis, what other legislation would the White House like to see Congress send over here before they break?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Darlene, obviously you noted two priorities. Puerto Rico and Zika are priorities because they are, at this point, emergency situations. The situation facing the 3.5 million Americans who live in Puerto Rico is increasingly dire. We talked about the impact of the government's financial challenges on the school system and on the health care system in Puerto Rico, and those challenges become even greater and have more severe consequences as they worsen. And so it's time for Congress to get that done.\nI think the situation with Zika is similar. There was an opportunity that Congress had to provide funding, consistent with the request that our public health professionals have made, starting back to February. But Republicans in Congress have dragged their feet and have still not come forward with a funding plan consistent with what our public health professionals say is necessary to do everything possible to protect the American people from the Zika virus.\nSo those are certainly two priorities, and so I'm glad that you noted them. Other priorities that come to mind that we believe are worthy of Congress's attention in this period -- the first would be dealing with the opioids epidemic in this country. The President put forward a specific budget proposal -- again, back in February -- to dedicate an additional $1 billion in funding to expand treatment options for people in communities all across the country who are dealing with opioid addiction. Too many innocent lives have been lost as a result of this significant problem. And for years this has been treated as a law enforcement problem and it certainly has to do with our criminal justice system, but there are public health questions that are raised here, too, and we could certainly have an impact on this epidemic if more treatment options were available to people who are dealing with this addiction. That would certainly start by congressional funding for treatment centers that would expand the number of personnel and the number of beds that are available to treat people with significant addiction challenges.\nObviously we continue to be concerned about the Republicans in the Senate refusing to give a hearing and a vote to the President's Supreme Court nominee. We'd obviously like to see Republicans get that done. If we were following along the timeline for previous Supreme Court nominees to be considered and confirmed by the Senate, Chief Judge Garland would have been confirmed months ago. But the fact is, here we are in June, and the President's nominee has not even gotten a hearing. And, again, this is evidence of Republicans failing to do their job. It has consequences for our justice system. It certainly has consequences for the Supreme Court. And there's ample time for the Senate to give him a hearing and a vote before they go on their six or seven-week-long summer vacation. The American people and our justice system would certainly benefit from that.\nThere are a whole host of other things that could certainly fall in this category. Things like making progress on criminal justice reform is something that we would like to see before the Congress leaves for the summer. That certainly is not an exhaustive list, but I think that gives you a good idea of what our priorities are.\nQ: With the Democratic primaries about to wrap up, what guidance do you have for us on when we can expect the President to make an endorsement?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have any news to make on the timing of a presidential endorsement at this point. Those of you who traveled with the President to Florida over the weekend heard him discuss at fundraisers in South Florida on Friday night his approach to this issue. And his view continues to be that the Democratic Party and the Democratic candidates are in broad agreement about what priorities are worth fighting for. And the commitment to a set of values -- particularly around fairness and justice and equality and expanding economic opportunity for everybody -- those are things that Democrats all across the country agree on. And those are the values and priorities that the two Democratic candidates for President have been campaigning on.\nAnd a campaign platform that is built on those priorities has won both candidates strong support all across the country. It's a really good thing for our party, and I think it augers well for Democratic prospects in the general election. But we're not there yet. There are still votes that have to be cast in both New Jersey and California, and the President has made a decision that he wants to give those voters an opportunity to make their voice heard before he weighs in.\nQ: Finally, will the President attend the funeral on Friday for Muhammad Ali? And if he does not go, who will the White House send to represent him?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we're still taking a look at the plans that are being made for Muhammad Ali's funeral. Many of you saw the statement that was issued by the White House on Friday -- or on Saturday, and obviously the President has strong feelings about Muhammad Ali and what is so unique about him and the unique message that he delivers about what our country is all about. So obviously the President and the First Family are mourning his loss, but I don't have any updates for you on the President's schedule. But we'll keep you posted on that.\nTim.\nQ: Just briefly on Judge Garland again, are there any meetings scheduled with Republicans this week or in coming weeks?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have an update on Chief Judge Garland's meeting schedule. I know that he does have a meeting with Senator Cantwell on the books for later this week. But we can get you some more details about that.\nObviously the case that we have made to individual senators is that, traditionally, private meetings have just been the prelude to public hearings that are convened by the Judiciary Committee. And there are 16 Republican senators who have already met with Chief Judge Garland. Many of those Republicans walked away from that meeting saying quite good things about Chief Judge Garland. Senator Portman called him \"an impressive guy.\" Senator Toomey called him \"very, very smart, very, very knowledgeable.\" Senator Graham called him \"well qualified.\"\nSo our view is that it's pretty hard for Republican senators to justify having a private conversation with Chief Judge Garland -- by all accounts having those conversations go well -- but yet refuse to convene a public hearing. After all, it is those Republican senators who have said that American voters should have a role in the process. Well, what better way could the American people have a role in the process than to give the American people the opportunity to hear directly from Chief Judge Garland himself, let him make the case for why he has the judgment and the experience to serve with distinction on the Supreme Court.\nWe certainly believe that he would do that if given the opportunity, to participate in a public hearing. And I suspect that's precisely why Republicans won't give it to him. And that's rather unfortunate. It is certainly inconsistent with, I think, widespread notions of fairness, and it certainly is inconsistent with the constitutional responsibilities that are vested in the United States Senate.\nQ: There were 19 Republicans that were saying they would want to meet with him, and he's met with 16. Do you see the three coming together?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have the updates on the schedule, but we certainly have been in touch with their offices to try to schedule something.\nQ: And just moving to Fallujah. Since Friday, some of the leaders of the Iran-backed militias have bickered with the Iraq military. They want to see the Fallujah fight go faster, and they don't like the fact that the Iraq military is moving up equipment to Mosul, the next fight. Does the White House have any concern about this bickering?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Tim, we've made clear from the beginning that the United States and our coalition partners are prepared to be supportive of those Iraqi forces that are operating under the command and control of the Iraqi central government. And those are forces that are committed to minimizing civilian casualties and protecting the people of Fallujah who have suffered so much under ISIL's occupation.\nThese are basic humanitarian principles that they are committed to observe. And we certainly noted the statements from Iraqi political and religious leaders demonstrating their commitment to those principles.\nSo, look, there's not much that I have to say about the Shia militias and their preferences. Obviously, the organization that we're cooperating with and advising and assisting is the Iraqi central government and the forces that are operating under their command and control.\nQ: One more on Fallujah. If the Islamic State is pushed out, to what extent is the White House concerned about the aftermath and sectarian violence ensuing after that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we obviously are concerned about the current humanitarian situation inside of Fallujah. There are all kinds of heinous reports about the way that ISIL is treating the citizens of that city. There are reports that some of the citizens are being used as human shields, and in some cases, even worse.\nSo that's the point of this operation in the first place, is to try to drive ISIL out of the city. We do believe it is very important that once Fallujah is liberated, that the forces that succeeded in liberating the city abide by basic humanitarian standards. We certainly would not tolerate using this conflict against ISIL as an opportunity to exacerbate sectarian tensions in that region of the world. And we certainly would not condone using this conflict as cover to inflame sectarian conflict. That's why it's important that these security forces are operating under the command and control of the Iraqi central government because the Iraqi central government has demonstrated a commitment to pursuing an inclusive agenda that represents the diversity of Iraq's population.\nSo this is certainly something that we're mindful of. But as I noted in my answer to your previous question, we welcome the statements from Iraqi political and religious leaders about the need to conduct this operation in a way that minimizes civilian casualties and protects the people of Fallujah. And that certainly is what we would expect those forces to do.\nOlivier.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. A couple on the announcement on the President's travel to Poland and Spain. There's a reference in the part about Poland about NATO providing stability in regions other than the North Atlantic region. Obviously NATO invoked Article 5 for Afghanistan. Are there other parts of the world that you think NATO can play a bigger role?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the statement was referencing NATO's role in Afghanistan, and that's the reason it was worded the way that it was. We obviously welcome the substantial contributions that our NATO partners have made to supporting the Afghan government in Afghanistan. And that kind of ongoing support will be critical to Afghanistan and the international community of achieving our objectives in that country.\nQ: And on a considerably lighter note, the Spanish leg of the visit, the President's timetable there overlaps with part of the San Fermin Festival, which includes the running of the bulls. (Laughter.) Guess where I'm going with this.\nMR. EARNEST: Someone did their homework today. (Laughter.)\nQ: He's going to miss the big one, but there are other runnings. Any interest in watching the spectacle? Would he go to Pamplona? Would he be interested in any of that?\nMR. EARNEST: I suspect he probably is interested in that. I've not spoken to him about it. But I don't know whether or not the President's itinerary will allow for witnessing that rather interesting event.\nMR. EARNEST: All right, Justin -- birthday boy. Happy birthday.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: That seemed somewhat less than genuine, Justin. (Laughter.)\nQ: At least, like, now when I know nothing it's not because of my age. (Laughter.) It's just on me. (Laughter.) I wanted to go back and ask you about it last week, but Donald Trump has intensified some of his comments about federal judges, and I'm wondering if you think those comments are racist.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, I know that there's been plenty of commentary on the presumptive Republican nominee's comments. And the presumptive Republican nominee certainly does not seem to strain in prompting people to offer an opinion about his comments. But I'm going to resist the urge to do that, but let me make one observation about that.\nSome who have weighed in with their opinion are Republicans who serve in the United States Senate, and they've had some rather pointed things to say about the impact that his comments could have on our justice system in this country. I guess I would just point out that it's a little ironic for Republicans in the Senate who say they have concerns about the Republican presidential nominee's views as it relates to judges to also say that they're not going to confirm any judges to preserve the ability of the Republican presidential nominee to potentially make those appointments.\nThat certainly is true at the Supreme Court level, and it is additional evidence of the uncomfortable position that Republicans have tried to adopt here when it comes to not doing their job on the Supreme Court -- on considering the President's Supreme Court nominee. But, look, this applies to other federal judges as well. There are a variety of very well-qualified Obama nominees to judges in both at the appellate level and at the district level who would fill vacancies on courts that have declared judicial emergencies. So this is not just the President deciding willy-nilly that he wants to fill judicial vacancies. In some cases, you have judges in these districts and in these circuits basically saying, we need help in order to manage the caseload and in order to prevent the kind of backlog that would potentially delay justice. But yet, Republicans, even when faced with well-qualified nominees, some of whom have earned the support of Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, blocking the nominees is indefensible.\nNow, the truth is I think that position would be indefensible even if they hadn't already stated their own concerns about the ability of the Republican presidential nominee to discuss maturely our system of justice.\nQ: I think part of the reason I ask is I remember a few months ago during some of the heat of the Republican nomination contest, you guys went out of your way to say that the comments by some of the Republican nominees, if not denounced by Republican lawmakers, should kind of be a strike against them in their campaigns. And so at a point where there have been some sort of high-profile endorsements but then criticism from Republican senators, like you mentioned, do you guys think that, one, this is an issue that voters should be paying attention to, what Donald Trump has said about judges? And two, do you think Republican leaders should maybe withdraw their endorsements of Donald Trump over this issue?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me say it this way. I'm not surprised that there are many Republicans, in Congress at least who have chosen to overlook these controversial comments and continue to support the presumptive Republican nominee. Those are the same Republicans who elected a man who describes himself as \"David Duke without the baggage\" to a leadership position in the House of Representatives. These are the same Republicans, both in Congress and in legislative bodies across the country, who have, in some cases, admitted openly that they support voting restrictions in a way that would disadvantage minority voters and enhance the prospects of Republican candidates.\nSo that's why I guess I find the reluctance of current Republican officeholders disavowing their endorsement totally unsurprising. This is not an exception, this is the rule. And it's an unfortunate one. And, yes, I do suspect that it's one that people across the country will notice.\nQ: An American sailor was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving and causing a crash in Okinawa over the weekend. This is obviously on the heels of the charges that were brought against an American contractor and a real intense meeting between Prime Minister Abe and President Obama. I'm wondering if the President or anybody at the White House has been in contact with the Japanese government about this, and secondly, what it says to the President's pledge to sort of reevaluate how the base in Okinawa has been operating.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Justin, we are aware that on June 4th, a vehicle driven by a U.S. Navy sailor stationed in Okinawa was involved in a three-car accident in which some people sustained injuries. The United States deeply regrets this accident took place, and our thoughts and prayers are with those who were injured and their families.\nThe United States is fully cooperating with Japanese officials on this investigation, and the United States will continue to do all we can to ensure that DOD personnel serving in Japan conduct themselves with the highest standards.\nI'd refer you to the Department of Defense for more recent conversations that may have taken place between military officials and their Japanese counterparts. I did make note of the announcement by Lieutenant General Lawrence Nicholson, who is the highest-ranking U.S. military official in Okinawa, in which he noted American solidarity with the Okinawan people. And I know that there were some changes to the rules and regulations in Okinawa to try to address this situation. These are referred to in the military as modified liberty regulations for 30 days that would essentially outlaw the consumption of alcohol by servicemembers for the next 30 days.\nAgain, that is a decision that is made by military leaders in Okinawa who are seeking to address what is understandably a very sensitive situation in the eyes of the Japanese people.\nRon.\nQ: Just to follow up on the Trump question, when you were asked about the comments he's made about the judge, you referred to what Republicans have been saying about it. What is the White House, the President's attitude about these? Why wouldn't you answer that directly?\nMR. EARNEST: There are, as I struggle to try to convey here -- the presumptive Republican nominee often says things that are viewed as controversial or prompt a public response. And, look, I'm just not going to respond to every potentially controversial thing that he may have to say.\nBut what I think is relevant is to note the reaction of other Republicans. And I think that the people will take a measure of that party and that party's office holders based on how they respond to the situation.\nQ: Is there some line that he has to cross before you -- how do you determine that --\nMR. EARNEST: I will cop to the fact that it's relatively arbitrary.\nQ: Speaking of lines, what is the line that the President endorses?\nMR. EARNEST: I think that this is rooted largely in his own judgment. And he discussed at the town hall that he participated in in Elkhart his view that Democratic voters across the country should have an opportunity to decide, and that after the Democratic voters in New Jersey and California weigh in tomorrow, we may have a better sense of where the race is headed. But until then, the President himself made a decision to withhold judgment.\nNow, the other thing I would point out is we've also seen Senator Sanders and his campaign indicate that they appreciate the President going to great lengths to try to be fair; that they've acknowledged that Secretary Clinton is somebody that is a friend of President Obama, somebody that served for four years with distinction in the Obama administration. And we've seen from Sanders officials that they appreciate the President's commitment to fairness and to allowing Democratic voters to determine the outcome here.\nQ: Is getting the majority of superdelegates and pledged delegates clinching the nomination?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think, again, Democratic officials and the candidates themselves will have to make their own decision about which metric they're going to follow. I think many of your news organizations are considering this same question.\nQ: What is the White House considering?\nMR. EARNEST: And I think we'll continue to watch the situation. We're going to give Democratic voters the opportunity to weigh in. But certainly, somebody who claims a majority of the pledged and superdelegates has a strong case to make.\nQ: How concerned is the President about the possibility of a contested convention, or if this going on for weeks to come? How damaging could that be? Or perhaps as you view the previous months, as a robust process. Is that a positive or a negative?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think it depends on how this process plays out, so it's hard to reach a conclusion in the abstract. What I can say is --\nQ: Well, it's pretty -- this is not abstract. I mean, this is pretty clear in terms of what --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it's not really clear because we don't know whether or not this is going to happen or not. And what kind of support each candidate has taken to the convention and how they conduct themselves in the weeks leading up to the convention and then once they arrive in Philadelphia -- I think all of that is hard to determine. Those kinds of details matter.\nBut let me just say, the President made clear at that fundraiser in South Florida on Friday that the stakes in this election are really high. And the Democratic Party cannot afford to take lightly the risk that is posed by the potential of electing the presumptive Republican nominee.\nSo the President intends, certainly through the fall, if not earlier, to engage in this campaign and to engage in this debate about the future of our country. And that's an opportunity that the President relishes.\nI would also point out that this actually puts the President in a relatively unique place in our history. It's been at least a generation, if not longer, since you had a two-term President in his final year in office in demand by party leaders, including by the party nominee, on the campaign trail.\nAnd President Obama does have a strong track record and a deep reservoir of support all across the country -- and not just among Democrats -- to make a strong case that would benefit Democrats, up and down the ballot. And I would anticipate that the President will spend a lot of time in the fall making a strong case, not just on behalf of the Democratic presidential candidate, but also on behalf of Democratic candidates up and down the ballot.\nQ: All of which leads to the obvious question of, why wait? Why, as he said the other day, something about -- it just seems like political niceties that may, in fact, some would think, jeopardize the Democrats' chance in November. Given his popularity, given his obvious determination and zeal to get out there and do it, I mean, why are we -- why are you just kind of -- why is he dancing around this?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, because the President does believe that, I would acknowledge. And I think the Sanders campaign would agree that the President has worked hard and gone to great lengths to try to be fair. And he certainly has a lot of respect for both candidates. He's met privately with both candidates in the middle of this campaign. But, look, the President does have a long, personal relationship with Secretary Clinton. She served as his Secretary of State for more than four years, for goodness sake.\nSo the President has gone to great lengths to try to be hands off to give Democratic voters the opportunity to make a decision about who should represent our party in the general election. Now, I think the thing that's also true, Ron, is that the President has, on a couple of occasions, made a pretty forceful argument in support of Democratic candidates, even though we don't know who the Democratic nominee is going to be. And he did that most recently in his speech in Elkhart, where he made a compelling case about the wisdom of pursuing the priorities that both Democratic presidential candidates are advocating on the campaign trail.\nSo it's not as if the President has not weighed in forcefully in support of Democrats. It's true he has not weighed in forcefully in support of one Democrat in the presidential race, but he certainly has been an ardent and effective advocate for Democratic values and Democratic priorities, even in the context of a contested nomination fight.\nMark.\nQ: On the issue of fairness to Senator Sanders, would President Obama be inclined to endorse Hillary Clinton if Bernie Sanders did not drop out between tomorrow's primaries and the convention?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, at this point, we'll hold on the hypotheticals. And the President was clear -- again, in answering this question to a voter in Elkhart, or a citizen in Elkhart -- I don't know if that person was voting or not -- but the President was pretty clear that once the voters in New Jersey and California have an opportunity to express their preference about who should represent the Democratic Party in the general election, then we may be in a position where we have a much greater sense of what the outcome is likely to be. But until then, we'll wait another 48 hours here and see how this plays out before we get too deep into the hypotheticals.\nQ: Has the White House been in touch with the Clinton campaign about an announcement or campaigning?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the White House has been in touch with both campaigns throughout this nomination fight. And, look, the President has had individual conversations with both candidates throughout this nomination fight. Both candidates have been here at the White House, meeting privately with President Obama over the course of the last nine months or so. So we've maintained an open line of communication with both campaigns and with both candidates, and I would expect that to continue.\nQ: Lastly, why does President Obama believe that running scared in the fall campaign is a good strategy?\nMR. EARNEST: Because the context here is the President believes that it's important not to take the Republican Party's decision to nominate a controversial figure lightly. Many of your news organizations have conducted polls -- some of which, certainly not all of which, but some of which indicate that either Democratic candidate would be a very heavy favorite in the general election. And the President, as he's said on a number of occasions, is feeling quite good about Democratic prospects in the fall, but he thinks it's really important for Democrats to be motivated and to not take lightly the prospect of a general election contest between the Democratic nominee and the Republican nominee.\nQ: Despite what the polls say, this is something that's worth fighting for. And the President certainly intends to devote a lot of time and energy to this debate, and he expects that people across the country will do the same thing, even if some polls indicate that the race is not likely to be particularly close.\nQ: Listening to the Democratic fundraiser speech on Friday evening, I got the feeling -- or reading the notes on it -- the transcript -- I got the feeling that if it weren't for the Constitution and it weren't for Michelle Obama, he would love to be running. (Laughter.) Do you get that feeling talking to him as well?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me acknowledge that both of those sayings are significant obstacles. (Laughter.)\nQ: He said Michelle was even more important.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, he did. He did. But, look, there is no denying that the President relishes the opportunity that he has to spend time traveling across the country making a forceful case for the values that he's dedicated his career to fighting for. And I think that will be evident -- all of you will have an opportunity to cover the President when he's out making this argument in the fall.\nAnd there's a reason that many Democrats are hopeful that President Obama will be quite visible in this campaign. They're hopeful because he's good at making a case. He's good at making the case for the kinds of values that Democrats care about. He's good at making the case for a foreign policy that is smart about deploying our force and our influence around the world to advance our interests. The President is good at making a case about an economic strategy that's focused on expanding economic opportunity for everybody in America, particularly the middle class. He's good at making a forceful case for why it's so critically important for us to educate and upskill the next generation of American workers to compete in a 21st century economy. He's good at making a case for an America that's more just, that fights for equality and fairness. And he's good at making the case for an America that's inclusive.\nQ: He made it sound like he'd really like to be running.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I make it sound like the President is really looking forward to being actively engaged in this campaign. And, look, he's good at it. This is a strength of his. And the President is looking forward to working closely with, again, not just the Democratic nominee for President, but for Democratic candidates up and down the ballot.\nAnd look, the stakes in this election are high. And I think that's the other thing that motivates the President, Mark, is that it's not -- this isn't just a hobby, this is his life's work. This is his passion. And it's something that he feels strongly about. He's got a deep conviction about how important these issues are. He's dedicated his life to fighting for them. And he understands that who the next President is will have a significant impact on the trajectory of that fight.\nAnd so the President isn't just looking forward to having some fun on the campaign trail, he's also looking forward to making an argument and making a case, because he understands the stakes are quite high.\nQ: He's spoiling for a fight.\nMR. EARNEST: He certainly is not going to shrink from it, I'll tell you that.\nMichelle.\nQ: So we heard the President say that he has plenty of time to throw his support behind the nominee, but he also talked about running scared. And you cited these poll numbers that show a wider lead, but they were much, much tighter a short time ago. And when you look at the President's campaign, in May, showed Romney beating him. So how much store are you putting into poll numbers like that? And does the \"plenty of time\" have something to do with the fact that he thinks it's not going to be close?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't put much stock in the poll numbers; I don't think the President does, either. And that's why he intends to be strongly supportive of what he expects will be a vigorous debate and a vigorous campaign.\nBut look, the reason that the President says that he's got plenty of time is informed by his own experience with this process. You'll recall back in 2008,when he was competing against then-Senator Clinton, that there was a much-longer-than-expected Democratic nomination contest, and there were concerns that were understandably expressed by people inside the Democratic Party and out about the impact that that longer-than-expected nomination contest would have on the prospects of the eventual party nominee.\nThe truth is -- and Senator Obama may not have said this at the time, but President Obama would tell you that that longer-than-expected campaign made him a better candidate, and it made him better on the stump. It made him better on the debate stage. And it gave his campaign the opportunity to build an organizational infrastructure coast to coast. And it put states in play in that presidential election that previously hadn't been -- states like Indiana and North Carolina and even Virginia at the time. People forget that that was not a state that was regularly referred to as a battleground state. It was sort of viewed as on the margins, but yet that's a state that President Obama won twice.\nSo the fact that the nomination process has gone on a little longer than expected is not necessarily a bad thing for the Democratic Party, but the point that the President is making is that once that primary contest comes to an end, once there is a nominee, it's important for all Democrats to be all in in this election, because the stakes are quite high.\nQ: So if he feels that there is enough risk there -- and there have been indications that this could be close, even recently -- for him to say a phrase like \"running scared,\" isn't there a sense that, had he thrown his support behind someone earlier that maybe those numbers could have been wider earlier, maybe there could have been more momentum earlier on the other side? What do you think?\nMR. EARNEST: I think it's certainly easy to armchair-quarterback all of this. But, look, I think the President is quite proud of the way this nomination process has played out on the Democratic side. It's been a vigorous campaign. There's been a robust debate. There's been an opportunity for Democrats all across the country to understand exactly what our party's candidates are fighting for.\nAnd, look, I don't think there are many Republicans who would agree with me. Well, let me say it this way: I don't think many Republicans would say the same thing about the contest on their side of the aisle. What I would say about Democrats is that this contest has motivated and engaged Democrats all across the country around a core set of values that just about every Democrat can strongly support. And it will be -- as you allude to, it will be important for our party to be united around those values in a general election, but the fact that those are values that Democratic voters have in common I think will greatly enhance the President's ability and the eventual Democratic nominee's ability to unite the party around those values, and wage a vigorous general election campaign in states all across the country.\nQ: So these votes that you say the President is waiting for are going to happen on Tuesday. Is there any reason why he would not endorse Hillary Clinton on Wednesday?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, without knowing the outcome of those contests, I wouldn't hazard a guess.\nQ: But if the outcome is the opposite, then are you saying he would not endorse Hillary Clinton?\nMR. EARNEST: What I'm saying is mostly that I don't have any news to make about the timing of a presidential endorsement. But I guess what I would say is the same thing that the President said last week, which is that we are likely to know a whole lot more about how this contest concludes once those votes are cast. But until then, we'll wait and see.\nQ: At the risk of being annoying, maybe I could ask it this way then: Why would he not endorse somebody on Wednesday?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know. Maybe he will. (Laughter.)\nMargaret.\nQ: Thanks so much. You're not putting yourself out of misery here. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: It's all right. It's what I signed up for.\nQ: So given the Tuesday primaries, can you at least say if it is too early and people are getting ahead of themselves in anticipating an endorsement this week?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, again, I think the President I think probably said this best last week when he said we're likely to know more about how this nomination process ends this week, based on the fact that you have two states with a whole lot of Democrats in them who are casting votes this week. So I don't have any news to make in terms of the timing of an endorsement, but we're going to learn more and we'll let those voters make their voice heard before we make any additional decisions about whether or not the President should weigh in.\nQ: That sounds like you're leaving the door open then.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President opened the door when he said last week that we would know more about the potential outcome here.\nQ: It's the start of Ramadan. In the statement that the White House put out there was comment in there that did seem very political given that there really is no one talking about a ban on Muslims other than the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump -- or at least there's no traction behind that kind of policy. Why did the White House feel that was necessary to put that political statement in something that's the start of a religious holiday?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I actually would describe it as a value statement because I think it is an American value that we do not impose a religious test on people who are seeking to enter the United States. And I would also point out that there's more than one Republican -- high-profile Republican who has indicated support for this very unwise, ill-advised policy. So I think a clear articulation of American values when it comes to freedom of religion is an entirely appropriate statement to make at the beginning of a religious holiday that is observed by millions of American Muslims.\nQ: Do you fear you're giving what some might dismiss as rhetoric, albeit damaging and perhaps dangerous rhetoric, some would say credence as a potential policy shift in the United States by putting it in a statement like that? I mean, it's one thing for a few Republicans to voice support. But in terms of actual traction as a change in a policy, we haven't seen that.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, this has been a policy proposal that has been hotly debated for months now, dating back to at least November. So I don't think there is much risk of this issue getting further attention because of its inclusion in this presidential statement. In fact, I think the White House and the President felt it was important to make an affirmative declaration about core American values, and not discriminating against people because of the way that they worship God. That's an important value and one that's worth giving voice to, and I think it's entirely appropriate to talk about the importance of freedom of religion and protecting religious liberty when you're marking the beginning of a religious holiday that's observed by millions of American Muslims.\nQ: Is this kind of value statement, as you've described it, this sort of thing we're going to hear from the President when he doe hit the campaign trail? I mean, is that how you and the President is viewing the necessity of his involvement -- that this is about not only his own legacy, but the legacy of U.S. values and policy here? It's not so much about the candidates as it is about the fate of those values as he's seeing himself defending?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, let me also hasten to add here that there are many, many well-known, prominent Republicans and national security experts of undeclared political persuasion who would strongly agree with the value statement that was included in the Ramadan statement. So I think that merits mentioning as well.\nLook, I think the stakes in this election are quite high because there are a number of important issues that hang in the balance. The President went to Elkhart last week and talked about the economic choices that the next President will have to make. The President has certainly made the economic decision-making and a question of those economic priorities a top priority since he's been in office. And the next President will have some important decisions to make about our economy. But look, there are a whole host of other issues that are important, too. Some of them relate to foreign policy and even relate to protecting core American values, like freedom of the press and an independent judiciary, the rule of law, and yes, religious liberty.\nQ: Is the White House getting a sense that the candidates are as enthusiastic as the President is about the campaign trail? I mean, do you have a full dance card requesting things and appearances so far? Or is this just an anticipation of what you think --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think you'd have to go ask them.\nQ: You have not gotten those requests so far?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm saying that I haven't personally talked to many candidates for office, but --\nQ: But you said that you have spoken with the campaigns -- the White House has.\nMR. EARNEST: The White House has certainly been in touch with both presidential candidates and certainly campaigns beyond that. And yes, I would say as a general matter that there is interest on the part of Democratic candidates for the President being out on the campaign trail, aggressively making a case in support of the kinds of priorities that Democratic candidates across the country have been fighting for.\nQ: A quick question on the schedule. It sounded like you weren't ruling out an attendance at some level at the Muhammad Ali funeral or eulogy on Friday. I'm pretty sure there's also a significant date in the Obama household on Friday. Do you see those two things conflicting?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we've got some work to do on the schedule. But as we get the schedule locked down, we'll let you know.\nQ: But it is possible.\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know exactly timeframe for both events, but as we get updates on the schedule we'll be sure to let you know.\nShannon.\nQ: There is a new book coming out on Mrs. Clinton by a former Secret Service officer who was on protective detail during her time as First Lady here at the White House. It doesn't sound like it's going to be flattering. Is there a feeling within the administration about agents writing about their time in protective detail of the First Family, flattering or unflattering?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I haven't read much of the publicity about this particular book. And I think that the Secret Service obviously has some standards that they maintain, particularly as it relates to protecting details about their policies and procedures. But, look, I think I'd reserve judgment about the wisdom of writing a book from such a perspective until I know more about the book.\nQ: Is it appropriate, do you think?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, again, from here, I can't -- I wouldn't weigh in on whether -- on the propriety of doing something like that.\nQ: I want to ask you as well about something you referred to earlier about judicial appointments. I think you said the President doesn't willy-nilly decide where he's going to fill these gaps. You mentioned the judicial emergencies, which exist still across the country, dozens of them. They did years ago as well when the President decided to fill three positions on the D.C. Circuit. At that time, there were bipartisan lawmakers, there were judges on the court who had said their workload was such that they didn't need additional judges. That, of course, led to the nuclear option being issued by --\nMR. EARNEST: Deployed.\nQ: -- yeah, deployed by then-Senate Majority Leader, Harry Reid. So how does that square with your statement about choosing judicial priorities?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, I think filling vacancies on the second-highest court in the land I think is a priority that everybody would acknowledge is important. But, look, what is true is that there are highly qualified judicial nominees with strong bipartisan support that have been put forward by this President that are being blocked by Republicans in the Senate solely because these individuals were nominated by a Democratic President. That is entirely inconsistent with the basic responsibility of the United States Senate. It's entirely inconsistent with generally accepted notions of fairness. And it is entirely inconsistent with ensuring that we protect our independent judiciary from overt partisan influence; that if we start describing judges as Democratic judges or Republican judges, that undermines the notion that the outcome is determined solely by an impartial consideration of the law.\nAnd, look, the President has also acknowledged that there's no one party that bears exclusive responsibility for politicizing this process. But what is also beyond dispute is that Republicans have escalated this dispute when it comes to the Supreme Court and when it comes to the nomination of Chief Judge Merrick Garland. Even Senator Lindsey Graham has acknowledged that what Republicans are doing right now is unprecedented. And I don't think he meant it in a positive way.\nQ: Why not focus where there are these dozens of judicial emergencies? If you're going to say that is the crisis, that's the issue that has to be handled, then why focus, as you did on the D.C. Circuit or other courts, where that obviously has shifted the balance, many would argue, of that court and certainly the way that it has decided things with regard to this administration?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, I think Republicans would be hard-pressed to make the case that somehow filling vacancies on the second-highest court in the land is not important. And the fact is, the President did put forward highly qualified nominees for that job, and those were individuals who, to this day, serve this country with distinction on the second-highest court in the land. What is also true is that there are courts that have judicial emergencies in place -- places where a vacancy in a judge's chambers is having an impact on the ability of the American people to get justice. And the President is deeply concerned about that, and the President has appointed well-qualified individuals with bipartisan support to fill those vacancies. But Mitch McConnell and Republicans in the United States Senate have blocked those appointees unfairly. And that's wrong, and it is inconsistent with the constitutional responsibility of the United States Senate. And the President is going to continue to make a strong case that the Senate should act on those nominees, including his nominee in the Supreme Court.\nQ: Is it accurate to say there was no judicial emergency in the D.C. Circuit at that time?\nMR. EARNEST: I'll be honest with you -- I don't know the answer to that. We could go and take a look at it. You said there wasn't, and I guess what I'm saying is that whether there is a judicial emergency on the D.C. Circuit or not, I think you'd be hard-pressed to make the case that filling a vacancy on the second-highest court in the land is somehow something that shouldn't be a priority. The President certainly thinks that it should be.\nMike.\nQ: Just a quick question on tomorrow's visit -- the Indian Prime Minister visit. Is it fair to say that the President's sort of -- the main deliverable the President is hoping for is a request to get India to quickly ratify the climate change agreement? Is that sort of the main thing that he'd like, policy-wise, to come away from? And if not, what are the other things that the President is hoping for out of the visit tomorrow?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have anything to say about potential deliverables yet. We may have more on this tomorrow, obviously. I can tell you that there are a couple of things that the President is interested in discussing with Prime Minister Modi tomorrow. The first is, obviously, the important role that India played in completing an international climate change agreement. We discussed back in December, in Paris, that India was going to play an important role in making important commitments to this agreement that would ensure that the world came together to confront this challenge. And President Obama had an opportunity to meet with Prime Minister Modi and the rest of the Indian delegation to those negotiations to talk over what role India could play and what commitments India could make.\nObviously, this is a situation where Prime Minister Modi demonstrated a lot of leadership, even in the face of a difficult political climate back home. He committed his country to standards that will be good for the Indian population, will be good for the Indian people, but more importantly will be -- or just as importantly will be good for the rest of the world, too.\nSo obviously the President has a lot of respect for the way that Prime Minister Modi has handled this issue, and I would anticipate that they'll have a discussion about what more the United States and India can do to advance the climate agenda. I would expect the United States and India to discuss the economic ties between our two countries. The economic relationship between the United States and India is an important one, and it is a relationship that benefits both our citizens. And so I would anticipate a discussion of some economic issues.\nThere are obviously some important national security issues as well. And we have seen, in recent years, greater and closer coordination between U.S. national security officials and Indian national security officials. And the President is certainly interested in trying to deepen and strengthen those ties because it would enhance the national security of both our countries.\nSo they've got a pretty full agenda. I recognize that I didn't discuss it in very much detail, but we'll have an opportunity to do that tomorrow.\nQ: Just on the first thing, on the climate thing. Is it fair to say that the President is pushing the Prime Minister to have his country ratify the climate change agreement by the end of the year? Because that's the next step, right? I mean, you can talk about the leadership that India provided in getting the agreement into place, but the next step is getting all these countries to ratify it so that then it goes into force. And there's, I think, 55 percent of the country or something have to do that. So is that one of the things that he's going to try to convince -- work hard during this visit to get India to do it?\nMR. EARNEST: What I don't know is I don't know the process that India has to go through in order to ratify the agreement. So I don't know whether or not the President will be making that specific request. We can discuss that tomorrow. But the role that India has played thus far in helping the international community come to an agreement has been significant, and we obviously would expect India, moving forward, to continue to play an important role in the international community in making progress even beyond the agreement that was signed -- that was reached back in December.\nQ: And I should probably say Donald Trump's name just in the question -- (laughter) -- because that's one of the required --\nMR. EARNEST: Don't give into the peer pressure. (Laughter.)\nAll right, let's move around a little bit.\nQ: You were talking about how good the President is at campaigning. And last week he had a moment when he was trying to take on Donald Trump, and he sort of paused or lost his train of thought. I don't know if you remember the moment, but --\nMR. EARNEST: I don't. Can you be more specific?\nQ: At one point, he appeared to go off-script, and there were a lot of news outlets that suggested that Donald Trump was making the President speechless.\nMR. EARNEST: I didn't see any of those accounts.\nQ: You didn't --\nMR. EARNEST: No.\nJohn.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. Two very brief questions on different areas. First, when the President was at the G7 Summit, he said that the agreement on Greece that was made at the time resolved the Greek debt issue for a reasonable amount of time. Given the fact that that country has debt-to-GDP of 180 percent, what is the timeframe he was referring to? And what needs to be done to have a permanent solution to the Greek crisis?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, John, I think what the President was alluding to is just the fact that Greece and the other members of the EU have made important progress in both offering up needed support to the Greek government and to the Greek people as they confront some significant fiscal and economic challenges in their country. And what we've seen also from the Greek government is a genuine commitment to implementing some key economic and fiscal reforms that would put Greece back on a path to sustainable debt load.\nSo this is not a problem that's going to get solved overnight, and there have been various points along the way over the last six years or so where it has looked as if the relationship between Greece and the EU might go down the wrong path. I think the President was simply observing that as the Greek government continues to successfully implement these reforms, and as the EU continues to keep its commitment to supporting the Greek government, that things seem to be moving in the right direction. And, look, the President I think also was offering some credit to leaders across the EU and in Greece for making some decisions that weren't terribly popular politically, but were critical to addressing this significant challenge that would have consequences for the global economy.\nSo there's been a lot of important progress that's been made, and the President is certainly pleased with the current trajectory. But there are important decisions that lie ahead, and the United States will be there to strongly support our allies and partners in Europe as they confront these significant challenges.\nQ: Here on the domestic front, tomorrow California is going to have a primary, and California Democrats are poised for an unprecedented situation. All polls indicate that under California's unique system, the two top vote-getters who will square off in November will both be Democrats, both of whom the President knows very well -- Attorney General Harris and Congresswoman Sanchez. How does he make a decision who to support and campaign for in the fall when there's two members of his own party competing?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think we'll wait and see what the results are before we contemplate how the President will confront that rather unique situation.\nQ: Can I ask you Wednesday morning?\nMR. EARNEST: You can certainly try. (Laughter.)\nByron.\nQ: Josh, ABC reported over the weekend that the White House scratched a line from a briefing transcript because reportedly you said it was inaudible. I was in that briefing, and I recall the question and it seemed pretty audible to me. The video also makes it pretty clear. I hear what was being said. Is the White House going to restore that line?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Byron, I think what was true at the time is that there was a little cross-talk. And fortunately, your conscientious colleagues at ABC News, recognizing the discrepancy, asked me about it the next day, and I had the opportunity to explain exactly what had occurred, and that's what I did.\nQ: You had two instances, both the White House and the State Department scratching things from the public record. I understand you're acknowledging that there was some cross-talk in the White House situation. But both have been about the Iran deal.\nMR. EARNEST: Byron, I don't think it's fair for you to say that they were scratched. I don't think that's an accurate --\nQ: Wasn't transcribed. In the State Department case, it was removed. Here it was not transcribed.\nMR. EARNEST: So I think it's important to note the distinction between what was apparently an effort at the State Department to make a specific decision to remove a portion of the video, and that's obviously something that I've said is inconsistent with what you'd expect from the whole goal of engaging in a public briefing. The situation that you're citing is related to a specific issue with a transcript that relates to two words. So I don't -- I think you'd be hard-pressed to make the case that there's a link between the two.\nQ: Can I re-ask you that question just for clarity? The question was, \"Can you categorically state that no senior administration official in this administration has ever lied publicly about any aspect of the Iran nuclear deal?\"\nMR. EARNEST: Byron, let me just state in the affirmative, which is that the administration has made a forceful and fact-based, accurate, truthful case about how the American people and the international community benefit from an international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\nAnd what I think is a much more worthy endeavor is to scrutinize the claims of those individuals who criticized the Iran deal falsely. There are individuals who suggested that somehow Iran would never agree to this agreement. They were wrong. There are individuals who said that we would not be able to verify that this agreement was being accurately implemented. They were wrong. There were individuals who suggested that somehow Iran would never follow through with the commitments that they had made in the context of the Iran deal. They were wrong. There are individuals who suggested that immediately Iran would get hundreds of billions of dollars in sanctions relief if this deal went through. They were wrong.\nI think it's worthy of spending some time considering exactly whether or not those individuals were just misinformed or lying.\nQ: But you're unwilling to categorically state that no public officials ever willfully misled on the Iran deal?\nMR. EARNEST: Byron, I can categorically say -- I'm going to say it in the affirmative. Unless you want -- you want to present some evidence, or just make a claim?\nQ: No. I mean, just there was some confusion over this on the question.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay. Well, let me say one more time, in the affirmative, declaratively, categorically, the administration made a strong, fact-based, truthful case about the benefits of the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. What we said about the Iran deal and its benefits for the American people have come to pass. And that's something that this administration is quite proud of, and I think it will be an important part of this President's legacy.\nQ: Shifting focus a little bit, Speaker Ryan started unveiling his plan -- the Republican plan that he's calling \"A Better Way.\" Tomorrow, he's unveiling his plans -- his specific plans on poverty. Is this a potential area for collaboration with the White House? Or do things like Zika, Puerto Rico need to be cleared from the desk first before this becomes really part of --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, no. The President had an opportunity to talk about this a little bit in his State of the Union address -- that there is some common ground that could be found when it comes to addressing poverty. One of the things that Speaker Ryan has previously indicated his strong support for is expanding eligibility for the earned income tax credit. President Obama actually thinks that this is a pretty good idea.\nSo there could be an opportunity for Democrats and Republicans to work together to make progress on an objective like that, something that would have a positive, broader economic benefit, but also would do something to fight poverty and, frankly, expand a little economic opportunity for those who are working really hard to get into the middle class.\nSo there is an opportunity for some overlap. I'll just say, Lana, the thing that -- I just have to, like, characterize myself as bemused by this process -- is that the way that individuals who worked for Mr. Ryan, for Speaker Ryan and other observers of this process sort of treat these policy papers as if they're, like, written by an academic or something; that somebody is sitting around at a think tank -- somebody who is not involved in government -- as generating all these great ideas that should be -- that merit careful consideration by the United States Congress.\nHe's the Speaker of the House. He doesn't just have to make policy proposals, he runs the House of Representatives. Put it in a bill. Put it on the floor. Run it through a committee. Have a debate. That's the whole reason you presumably ran for the job in the first place. Let's have that debate.\nAnd this is part of what I think the President has noted in the past too. He's eager to have some Republican members of Congress on the other side of the aisle who are actually interested in doing something, who actually want to put forward a proactive agenda. And look, I think many of the things that are included in the policy proposal that Speaker Ryan is going to put forward are things that are inconsistent with Democratic priorities.\nAnd that's fine. We can have that debate. Here's the good news for Speaker Ryan: There is a huge majority of Republicans in the -- Speaker of the House -- or the House of Representatives -- they've won a whole bunch of elections all across the country. So if his agenda is so good and his party is in charge, then let's put those ideas into a bill. Let's have a debate. Let's pass them through the House of Representatives. Let's engage in something here.\nBecause I think the benefit of that is, A, first of all, you're going to actually stand for something. But second of all, maybe we'll be able to find some common ground. Put forward a bill that's got a whole bunch of ideas, including expanding access to the earned income tax credit. And maybe we won't be able to pass the big bill, and maybe Speaker Ryan will be disappointed by that, but at least he can get one thing done. At least he can have one thing that he can point to that Democrats and Republicans would agree on, that the Democratic President would encourage Democrats in the House to support. Because I know there's some concern that Speaker Ryan must have about protecting his right flank and not angering conservative Republicans.\nBut if you actually want to get something done, why not work with the Democratic President to build strong support in the House of Representatives on a bipartisan basis? That will send a pretty strong message to the United States Senate that they should act on this too. That's the essence of governing, particularly in an era of divided government. But that's not what we've seen from Republicans.\nWe've seen from Republicans, basically, silence when it comes to an agenda. And the Speaker of the House, after serving in the job for eight months, finally puts forward some ideas and everybody acts like, oh, well, you know, it's -- like he works at a think tank or something. He's the Speaker of the House. It's his job to put forward ideas. But it's also his job to put those ideas on the floor of the House of Representatives and debate them. Maybe we can actually turn one or two of them into a law.\nQ: What do you think of the title, \"A Better Way?\" (Inaudible) on that too?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think on that front we would take a look at the individual proposals, and then we can all evaluate whether or not that's actually true.\nQ: Malia's graduation -- any special plans to celebrate that you can share with us?\nMR. EARNEST: None that I can share. But the President I think has spoken publicly about how this is an important moment for him. And the President and the First Lady are both quite proud of their daughter, as you'd expect.\nConnie, go ahead.\nQ: This is the anniversary of -- the anniversary of the shooting of Robert F. Kennedy after he won the California primary. Do you have any thoughts on the safety of the political candidates?\nMR. EARNEST: Any thoughts on what?\nQ: The safety of the political candidates.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously, in light of that tragedy, there were a number of reforms that were implemented to extend Secret Service protection to presidential candidates as well. And obviously the men and women of the Secret Service take very seriously the responsibility that they have to offer protection to those -- to obviously the President and the First Family, but also to some presidential candidates that are under their protection as well. So we obviously owe a debt of gratitude to the men and women of the Secret Service who go to great lengths to protect our candidates, to protect our President, and ultimately to protect our democracy.\nQ: (Inaudible) the country with the floods and fires, can you assure the American people that they'll get their compensation in a timely manner -- those that have been affected by floods and fires?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't know if you're referring to a specific incident.\nQ: Texas --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I know that there's been some high-profile flooding in Texas, and I'm not aware of any specific requests that have been made by the Texas governor, but we can certainly check to see if there's any federal assistance that's been requested in that instance. But that does remind me that there is the potential for Tropical Storm Colin to make landfall in Florida later today. I can tell you that the President was briefed on preparations in advance of Tropical Storm Colin early this morning by Lisa Monaco, the President's top Homeland Security advisor. You can get some more details from FEMA, but they've already deployed a liaison to the State Emergency Operation Center in Florida to ensure a well-integrated, seamless response to this storm.\nAs usual, we strongly encourage people who are potentially in affected areas to monitor weather reports and to listen closely to the instructions that are given by state and local officials. Those are instructions that will be given with the safety of these individuals in mind. And we encourage people to follow those instructions.\nThis particular storm does have the potential to lead to some pretty significant flooding. And we want everybody to be conscientious about listening to instructions and directions that they've received that are necessary to keep them safe.\nDave, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. This is kind of a long windup, so bear with me. When you were talking about the President being so good at explaining what's at stake in the campaign and how much he enjoys it, it brought to mind that four years ago he used to refer to Bill Clinton as the \"Secretary of Explaining Stuff\" on the campaign trail. And you also made the comment earlier about the fact that President Obama is, for the last generation, the only President at the end of his second term who is in demand on a campaign trail. Of course, that makes me think about the Lewinski affair and why President Clinton wasn't quite so popular at the end of his second term.\nAnd the difference between four years ago, when Bill Clinton was \"Secretary of Explaining Stuff,\" and this year seems to be that Donald Trump is eager -- willing, if not eager to go after the Clintons' past marital difficulties in the context of who's better for women, Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. So my question after all this is, is the White House or the President at all concerned that Trump's line of attack against the Clintons' marriage might make Bill Clinton less effective at explaining stuff is here on the campaign trail?\nMR. EARNEST: No. What continues to be true is that President Clinton, I would expect, will be a very powerful and effective advocate for his wife on the campaign trail. President Clinton certainly made a forceful case for President Obama's reelection four years ago. And I would expect that he will play a similarly persuasive and important role for his wife in this campaign, too. After all, there are -- I guess this is why it's important: Sitting in the Oval Office and being the Commander-in-Chief of the United States is a weighty responsibility. And there are only a handful of individuals who are still alive who have been charged with that responsibility. And I'm not aware that any of them, even the Republicans, have indicated that they're prepared to support the Republican nominee. And I think that's an indication of how seriously those men -- it's only men that have held the job so far -- believe that temperament and judgement are when choosing the next President of the United States. But I'm confident that President Clinton will be out on the campaign trail, strongly supporting his wife. And his own personal experience in the job will be part of what makes him such a persuasive advocate for her.\nThanks, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.\nQ: Did you say Secretary Clinton will be the nominee?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm sorry?\nQ: Did you say Secretary Clinton is going to be the nominee?\nMR. EARNEST: No.\nEND 2:38 P.M.

OBAMA: I told you it was going to be really different. But it's turned into something special. Are you guys ready to do some harvesting?\nCHILDREN: Yes.\nMRS. OBAMA: Well, let me make sure that everybody knows who's here, because we have a lot of the kids who helped us plant this spring. You were here -- mmm hmm. (Laughter.) I think almost all of you were here except for two people. Who are our two new students that are here? Hi, honey. Welcome. Is there another? You, too? Well, welcome!\nWell, we have students here from Washburn. Let's hear it from our Washburn students! (Applause.) You guys are back. We've got students from Kemper. Where are our Kemper students? (Applause.) We've got our students from Arthur Ashe Charter School. Yay! (Applause.) We have our Bancroft kids who are here. Yay, to the Bancroft kids. (Applause.)

And we're seeing that folks across the country are starting to do what we're doing here at the White House, and it's really helping a lot of kids eat better. I visited some schools where they've changed their whole school menu, and it's now healthy and fun and delicious, and the kids are into it, and they're eating vegetables and fruits more than ever before. So it's just great to see that a lot of schools and communities are doing what we're doing here. So you guys are champions in that effort, right?\nSo let's get to work.

In his remarks, he referred to Von Miller and DeMarcus Ware, outside linebackers, National Football League's Denver Broncos; and Tom Brady, quarterback, NFL's New England Patriots.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117901", "text": "The President. Hello, everybody. Good afternoon. Have a seat, have a seat. Welcome to the White House.\nNow, I have to tell you that these guys were out here practicing a little earlier. [Laughter] So before we get started, I just need to make sure that we're all set, that they were paying attention. So let me just say: Omaha! Omaha! 44 is Mike! Bags Montana! [Laughter] I don't know, it doesn't seem to work as well for me. [Laughter]\nLet's give it up for the Super Bowl Champion Denver Broncos! [Applause] Yes! We have some big Broncos fans in the house, including Mayor Hancock from the great city of Denver, outstanding Members of Congress, the delegation. I want to recognize Broncos CEO Joe Ellis, a couple of your former quarterbacks: GM John Elway, Coach Gary Kubiak.\nAnd let's give a big round of applause to Mrs. Annabel Bowlen. As many of you know, Annabel is here on behalf of the Bowlen family and her husband Pat, the longtime Broncos owner who's inspiring all of us with his courageous fight against Alzheimer's. And it's only fitting that when they won the Super Bowl in February, John declared from the podium: \"This one is for Pat!\" And I was just—we were backstage talking, the record that Pat was able to put together, going to more Super Bowls than losing seasons, that's pretty remarkable. You're not going to see that duplicated many places; that's a testimony to what an extraordinary owner he has been and continues to be.\nPat and Annabel have led this organization for 32 successful years; that rivals just about any other franchise in football. In that time, the Broncos have, as I said earlier, gone time and time again to the Super Bowl, and last year was a high-water mark, with a third Super Bowl trophy and a dominating win over Carolina.\nThat doesn't mean it was always pretty—or ever pretty. [Laughter] Coach has acknowledged this is a gritty, hard-nosed group of grinders. Last season, the Broncos won an NFL-record 11 games by a touchdown or less. And you don't do that without one of the greatest defenses of all time. Now, I'm a Bears fan—1985 was pretty good. Elway remembers. [Laughter] But I've got to admit, this one was pretty good too. [Laughter]\nIt all starts with Super Bowl MVP Von Miller, who terrorized opponents from the edge all season long. In the Super Bowl and the AFC Championship game, he had five sacks, two forced fumbles, an interception. Not bad for a guy who prides himself on his collection of eyeglasses—[laughter]—and claims to have been a geek all his life. We also saw him on \"Dancing With the Stars.\" I think he's wearing his dance shoes today. Where were they? They were shiny and impressive. [Laughter]\nVon was not alone. There was his partner on the opposite side, DeMarcus Ware. You had an extraordinary defensive line, a lockdown secondary. All in all, coordinator Wade Phillips's defense led the league in 19 statistical categories, including total defense, passing defense, and sacks. And down the stretch, they smothered three of the top four offenses in football.\nAnd then, there was an offense that always seemed to come up big when it needed to. There's running backs C.J. Anderson and Ronnie Hillman. Receivers Emmanuel Sanders and Demaryius Thomas. And we can't forget to mention the heart and soul of this team's offensive firepower, kicker Brandon McManus! [Laughter]\nAnd then, there's this guy from the commercials. [Laughter] It doesn't matter whether you need insurance—[laughter]—pizza—[laughter]—a Buick—[laughter]—I mean, you basically can stock your whole household with stuff this guy is selling. [Laughter] You know where to turn: It's Peyton Manning! Where'd Peyton go? He's around here somewhere. There he is.\nI have to say, I'm so pleased to be able to host Peyton here at the White House before I left. Anybody who has been a football fan has watched what is one of the greatest Hall of Fame careers ever, racking up more wins, more MVPs, more passing yards, more touchdown passes than anybody in history. The only quarterback to lead two different teams to Super Bowl wins. We were all obviously a little disappointed to see him hang it up this spring. But as somebody who is just a little bit older than he is, I was sympathetic—[laughter]—to the idea that running around with these guys, it takes its toll. But it is great to see somebody with a career like that, who always conducted himself on the field and off the field the way he did, to be able to go out on top. So please give a big round of applause for Peyton Manning.\nThank you. Yes, Peyton and I were talking back—and he said, yes, you should try it, don't overstay your welcome. [Laughter] Yes. But I've got term limits, so I had no choice—I can't. [Laughter]\nOf course, this team is far more than a collection of players. The Broncos are a way of life, not just in Colorado, but throughout the Mountain West. They call it Broncos Country. Sold out just about every game in Denver since 1970. I've heard how loud that stadium can get—back in 2008, I gave my convention speech at Mile High. Thank you for letting me borrow it just for a little bit. I have a feeling it's a little louder after Von sacks Tom Brady. [Laughter] But it was pretty loud on that day.\nAnd for all the love the fans give to this team, the Broncos gave it right back. In just the last year, players have served the community more than 360 times, from holding fitness clinics to mentoring young people to honoring our troops. All told, the Broncos have distributed more than $25 million to local charities since 1993.\nAnd earlier today Peyton and the guys spent some time with our wounded warriors. And nothing is—there's nothing I appreciate more than when outstanding athletes like this take the time to meet with our wounded warriors and are reminded of the fact that as much fun as this is, as great as football is as a part of our lives, it only happens because of the extraordinary sacrifice of our men and women in uniform. So we're very grateful to them for that.\nSo on and off the field, these guys are champs. Apparently, John Elway knows what he's doing. [Laughter] Coach knows what he's doing, the ownership knows what they're doing, and the players know what they're doing. And I assume that they're looking for another run.\nI will continue to root for the Bears—[laughter]—but I've got to give this organization credit for having done an extraordinary job. And this is a well-deserved celebration of an extraordinary season.\nSo please give, one more time, Super Bowl Champion Denver Broncos a big round of applause! Good job.\nHead Coach Gary Kubiak. Thank you, Mr. President. As you said before, unfortunately, the great leader of this organization, this team, is not here today. But on behalf of Mr. Bowlen, our entire organization, thank you so much for you and your staff allowing us to be here today and share this special moment.\nI am so proud of our fans, our organization, our coaches, but most importantly, these players. They gave it up for each other, and they went and achieved something special: They brought home a third world championship to the city of Denver. And I'm so proud to be a part of that, but this makes it even more so special. So thank you, and without further ado, Annabel is going to come up, and the captains, and present some——\nThe President. All right, what have we got, Annabel?\n[At this point, the President was presented with a team jersey.]\nThe President. Oh, look at that!\nAnnabel Bowlen, wife of Owner Pat Bowlen. This is for you.\nThe President. That is a good-looking jersey right there. Number 44. I think Mr. Sanders said I might still be able to be a wide receiver? [Laughter] I said, it's been a while since I ran 4.4 40. [Laughter] But that is wonderful. Thank you so much. I appreciate it and thank you so much. I need a helmet. [Laughter] You get knocked around here in Washington quite a bit. [Laughter] So thank you. These are beautiful. Why don't we strike this podium and we can get a good picture?

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117657", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n* Please see below for a clarification marked with an asterisk.\n1:02 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Nice to see you. I do not have any announcements at the top, so we can go straight to questions. Kevin, would you like to start?\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I wanted to ask about the timing of the fundraisers in New York City tomorrow. Were they planned so the President could hit the trail running for Hillary Clinton on the heels of today's primary?\nMR. EARNEST: These fundraisers have been on the books for quite some time. And I don't believe that most people expected that the Democratic nomination would continue to be contested into the first week in June. So I can tell you that the President does not expect to see or meet or appear with Secretary Clinton when he's in New York tomorrow. He'll be focused on a schedule that involves two fundraisers and the taping of the Tonight Show.\nQ: As the President indicated this morning, the leaders of the world's two largest democracies are meeting today. And yet the decision was made not to take questions from the reporters. Can you go into why? And is the administration disappointed that eight years after the reaching of a civil nuclear accord with India that U.S. companies have yet to finalize a contract to build a reactor there?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I will say that the schedule that was laid out for the President and the Prime Minister was to give them the opportunity to meet privately in the Oval Office and then to spend some time talking with all of you about their meeting. And they left -- after doing so, they have begun a private lunch that's taking place in the Cabinet Room even as we speak. So there wasn't an opportunity to take questions today. Typically, when the President does meet with world leaders, they will often have a formal news conference. In fact, I believe they may have done that the last time that Prime Minister Modi was here. But we didn't do that today.\nAs it relates to the announcements -- the discussion with the Prime Minister, there was extensive discussion about the leading role that India played in achieving an international agreement to fight climate change and fight carbon pollution. We've said on many occasions that India's role in that process was significant, and it's unlikely that we would have actually reached an agreement in Paris last December had the Indians not stepped up in terms of leadership in making some substantial commitments.\nAnd that really is a testament to Prime Minister Modi and his willingness to take a political risk to do what he thinks is right, not just for his country but for the planet. And he deserves a lot of credit for that.\nWhat I'll also say is that Prime Minister Modi recognizes that there's an important economic opportunity here. President Obama certainly recognizes that. And we've made the case, and as more countries around the world consider the move to a low-carbon economy that creates important opportunities in the alternative energy sector. And there certainly are important opportunities for American businesses, even in India, in the solar sector and in the wind energy sector. There also is an opportunity for the United States to work with countries around the world to develop further nuclear energy technology.\nAnd there was a discussion between the two leaders about the investment in infrastructure in India. And we were pleased to see India announce that it intends to build six Westinghouse nuclear reactors in India. This is a project that would create and sustain tens of thousands of good-paying jobs in the United States and in India. So this is a good example of how smart decisions about renewable energy and fighting climate change can have an important and positive economic impact in the United States and in countries around the world.\nQ: Are they near or still far away on finalizing a contract for those reactors?\nMR. EARNEST: My understanding is that they have made important progress. I don't know the exact status of that, but we'll see if we can get you a better update on that before the end of the day.\nRoberta.\nQ: Did the President get a firm commitment from Prime Minister Modi to ratify the Paris agreement this year?\nMR. EARNEST: I believe what Prime Minister Modi has said about this is that India shares the objective that the United States has laid out, which is to see the agreement come into force this year. And India has committed to doing their part to working toward the goal, a shared goal, of entering the agreement this year.\nObviously each country has their own unique process for signing onto the deal, and I'd refer you my Indian counterpart for an explanation of how that process works in India. I did get a brief explanation of how it works, so I'm not sure that I could explain it accurately here, so I'll let them do that. But it's more than just the Prime Minister himself signing on the dotted line.\nSo they'll work through their process, but they are working through that process with an aim to complete it before the end of the year. And that would represent substantial progress in meeting the bar for what is required for the agreement to go into effect. What is required is for 55 countries, representing 55 percent of the world's carbon emissions, signing onto the deal for it to go into effect. And India I believe represents about 4 percent of the world's carbon emissions. So getting them to sign onto the agreement this year would represent substantial progress toward that goal. And if we're able to achieve that goal and if the agreement were to go into effect this year, that would be several years ahead of schedule, and I think would be a clear sign that leaders around the world have a sense of urgency about fighting climate change and fighting carbon pollution. And it would be a welcome step in a positive direction for the health of the planet and the health of the people who live here.\nQ: So without getting into the details of the Indian process, it sounds like there is some development or some advancement in terms of what the Prime Minister is able to tell the President, in terms of -- is that -- am I reading it correctly?\nMR. EARNEST: It's my understanding that that represents a more ambitious goal than India had previously laid out in terms of their timing of signing onto the agreement. And so we obviously welcome that announcement from the Indian government.\nQ: Secondly, is the President ready to endorse Secretary Clinton now that she seems to have enough delegates to secure the nomination?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I know that there were a number of calculations that were conducted by media organizations throughout the day yesterday. Those calculations included an updated survey of superdelegates across the country, and some media organizations have concluded that Secretary Clinton now has achieved a majority of delegates who will be voting at the Democratic Convention.\nHowever, at this point, there is at least one superdelegate -- the one who works in the Oval Office -- who's not prepared to make a public declaration about his endorsement at this point. But stay tuned and we'll keep you updated.\nOkay. Move around.\nJordan.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. A couple questions for you. So Congressman Lee Zeldin, who is a surrogate for Donald Trump, was on television earlier. In his interview that he essentially accused the President of being racist. And I'm wondering -- this seems to be some kind of coordinated attack from the Trump campaign, and I'm wondering if you have any kind of --\nMR. EARNEST: \"Coordinated\" is a generous description. (Laughter.)\nQ: Loosely coordinated. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Most of the charges and countercharges of racism were lobbed by Republicans at Republicans, as far as I could tell this morning. Look, I think in the discussion about the Democratic nomination process yesterday, I was sort of asked about whether or not the President was concerned about how the Democratic primary had lasted longer than expected. The fact is that it did last longer than most people expected, as I acknowledged to Kevin. But I think what's true is that you've got two Democratic candidates for President who have campaigned across the country on a platform that's quite similar.\nYou've had candidates both out there aggressively talking about the need to expand access to quality health care to more Americans; that health care is a right, not a privilege. You've got Democratic candidates out there campaigning in favor of comprehensive, common-sense immigration reform that would have a positive impact on national security and on our economy.\nYou've got Democrats out there campaigning to fight climate change, to implement the Iran deal to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. You've got both Democratic candidates articulating a strategy for growing our economy from the middle out, making the case that that's the most sustainable way to grow the American economy. Both candidates are out there on the campaign trail, advocating for a higher minimum wage for more support for education and job training to ensure that American workers are prepared to compete in a 21st century global economy.\nYou've got both candidates out there making a strong case for equal pay for equal work.\nSo this has been a vigorous Democratic primary. But there's a strong case to be made that the Democratic Party is united around a core set of principles that I think will energize voters in the fall.\nRepublicans, on the other hand, wrapped up their nomination process early -- apparently it was early enough to allow the Republican Speaker of the House to basically call the Republican presidential nominee a racist and have the Republican governor of New Jersey try to defend him. So I'm not really sure if that's the way they drew it up, but I do think it is a clear illustration of the cleavages within the Republican Party.\nI'll leave it to those who are expressing concerns about their nominee's comments to explain why they continue to support him and vow to vote for him in the fall. I think that's a position I would struggle to defend, but I suspect they'll go ahead and try to do it.\nQ: Have you seen Congressman Zeldin's comments?\nMR. EARNEST: I heard a little bit about them, but I'm not sure they're worthy of a response from here.\nQ: On another issue, the 9/11 Families wrote of letter to President Obama urging him to release these 28 classified pages, and DNI Clapper said that it's possible that those pages could come out in June. It's now June. Do you have any update on the process there?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have an update on the process. I have not heard that the time frame has changed, so I'd encourage you to check with Director Clapper's office for an update on the timing. Obviously, there are another three weeks or so left in June. So I don't know if that timing has changed. I just haven't gotten an update on that recently.\nQ: Lastly, Congressman Hensarling put out a plan this morning that would dismantle some key parts of the President's --well, the Dodd-Frank law, including stripping some power from financial regulators. And I'm wondering if you have a response to that proposal.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, there's no -- there should be no more confusion about which party is on the side of big banks and large financial interests on Wall Street, and the Democratic Party that's fighting for middle-class families. The President made this argument pretty directly in his Elkhart speech last week, which is that there are a variety of reasons that people could be casting a vote.\nBut if you're focused on the economy and focused on which party is actually fighting for the middle class, it's a pretty open-and-shut case. It's Democrats who are out there fighting for a higher minimum wage. It's Democrats who are out there fighting for Wall Street reform that did succeed in creating an independent watchdog for consumers that recovered $11 billion for 25 million families across the country who were cheated. So these are reforms that essentially guarantee that taxpayers will not be on the hook for bailing out big banks if their risky bets go south.\nBut if you tear it down like House Republicans say that they want to do, that will allow big banks to go back to making risky bets and put taxpayers on the hook once again for bailing out those banks to prevent a second Great Depression. That doesn't make any sense.\nParticularly when you consider that Republican warnings about the impact that Wall Street reform would have on the economy were wrong. Republicans suggested that regulations associated with Wall Street reform would choke off innovation in the economy. They were wrong about that. Our economy is the most durable in the world. And we've seen important and sustained job growth and economic growth. We've also see sustained and rapid growth in the stock market itself. So it's really hard for Republicans to make a case that it is at all in our economic interest to tear down the reforms that have already done a lot to make our economy stronger and most stable.\nLalit.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. Can you give us a sense on the thoughts between the Prime Minister and the President on the different positions between India and the U.S.? And in that context, how did that decision see India and the U.S. can collaborate further in the region of the Indian Ocean?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I can tell you that this question about coordinating our activities when it comes to national security and counterterrorism was an important part of the agenda today. The President was certainly interested in looking for ways that the United States could deepen our coordination with India.\nObviously the United States, under the leadership of President Obama, has placed a renewed focus on our strategic interests in the Asia-Pacific and in the Indian Ocean. And I can tell you that there was important progress on finalizing agreements related to defense logistics, sharing of maritime information, and even the movement of U.S. aircraft carriers in the region. We welcome that improved cooperation and coordination, and we believe it will have a material and positive impact on the national security of the United States and India. And the two leaders agreed to have their staffs continue to work on efforts to deepen that cooperation even further.\nQ: Did the President support India's membership to Nuclear Supply Group? China is the only country which is publicly against India. How does U.S. plan to overcome this challenge?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I have to admit that I don't know the details related to India's possible participation in that group. What I can tell you is that the United States has sought to extend and deepen our relationship when it comes to India's work in diversifying its sources of energy, and that includes building nuclear power plants by Westinghouse, a good American company. We believe that would have positive impacts on the climate and a positive impact on the economy, both in the United States and in India.\nFor overcoming any obstacles to completing and implementing that agreement, I'd refer you to my colleagues at the National Security Council. And I'll see if I can get one of them to follow up with you for a more detailed answer.\nQ: And finally, do you have what they had at lunch?\nMR. EARNEST: I did not -- well, as you guys may know, they actually -- when the President has a formal lunch in the Cabinet Room, the White House chefs, demonstrating their versatility and their ability to work under difficult circumstances, actually set up the table right outside my office by the stairwell. (Laughter.) So I was able to smell lunch as it was being prepared, but I did not actually see what was on the menu. As I was walking out, they appeared to be preparing dessert. It appeared to be some variation on a strawberry shortcake. But we'll see if we can get you some more details about what the salad and entrйe course may have been. (Laughter.)\nRon.\nQ: Did you ask for a taste? And were you refused?\nMR. EARNEST: I was tempted to. (Laughter.) But it would have been a little awkward if I had walked out here and had a little, like, whipped cream on the side of my mouth.\nQ: Is the U.S. process part of the climate change deal done? Whatever the Indian process is -- is the U.S., whatever that -- what is that process and is it done?\nMR. EARNEST: What I can tell you about the United States' process is we have committed to completing it and implementing -- signing onto the deal before the end of this year. That's a commitment that we've already made.\nThe State Department is managing this process, as you'll recall. It's Secretary Kerry who essentially will be running that process, so I'd refer you to the State Department for an update on where that process stands. But we have committed to completing that process before the end of this year.\nQ: So it's a series of executive orders? There's no congressional action required?\nMR. EARNEST: There is no congressional action that's required.\nQ: So essentially it's a series of executive orders that move this process along?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know if it requires any executive orders. There may be some executive action required, but I'd refer you to the State Department for implementation questions.\nQ: On the New York trip tomorrow, the President is going to tape the Fallon show. And when does the show air?\nMR. EARNEST: The show will actually air on Thursday evening. So they're taping it one day in advance.\nQ: That's a long period of time, like 20-some-odd hours. Is there some reason for that?\nMR. EARNEST: It is. Well, I know this is something that your colleagues at NBC were interested in, but I don't know all the details.\nQ: And given that, is there more -- is there some likelihood that the President will comment on the election -- the primary results tomorrow morning before he leaves?\nMR. EARNEST: That's certainly possible. If there's an update to the President's schedule, we'll let you know.\nQ: Because again, he had signaled some time ago that, in fact, things would be clearer, or better -- whatever the words were. It just would seem unlikely that he would let this taping of this national show sit somewhere for that long a period of time having not commented on -- kept up with the news cycles.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we'll keep you posted on the President's schedule.\nQ: And just lastly, has he backed a superdelegate really? Or was he using a -- he is a superdelegate?\nMR. EARNEST: My understanding is the President actually is a superdelegate and will have a vote that he can cast at the --\nQ: And the Vice President, too, or --\nMR. EARNEST: That's my understanding, yes. So I think it's -- I was actually just looking at this right before I walked out here. My understanding is that it's sitting Presidents and Vice Presidents and former Presidents and Vice Presidents who are Democrats are superdelegates to the Democratic Convention.\nJames.\nQ: Josh, thank you. Three subjects as quickly as possible. On the visit of Prime Minister Modi, you stated earlier in this briefing that the commitment that the President secured from the Prime Minister was that the Prime Minister and the members of his team would do their part to try to achieve the goal of ratification through the Indian system by the end of the year. Why did the President not secure from the Prime Minister a commitment that, in fact, the Prime Minister would get it done?\nMR. EARNEST: James, this goes to the thing that I was trying to describe to Roberta, which is there is a complicated procedure that the Indians have already begun to go about signing onto this agreement. And I think the question is simply whether or not that procedure can be completed before the end of the year. Prime Minister Modi made a commitment that he was going to try to complete that procedure before the end of the year --\nQ: -- in his ability to deliver that?\nMR. EARNEST: That's my understanding, yes.\nQ: We saw the announcement earlier about Westinghouse proceeding with the construction of six nuclear reactors in India. Presumably, the White House, in disclosing that fact, regarded it as good news. Why does the White House not encourage Westinghouse to build six nuclear reactors in the United States?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I know that there are one or two that are under construction here in the United States that are important to job creation here. And I don't think there's anything that would dissuade us or anything that we would say that would discourage Westinghouse from considering similar, additional investments here in the United States.\nQ: On the campaign, you described in yesterday's briefing how \"good\" the President is -- your word -- at campaigning in general. Is it the view of the President that his participation in the campaign, on the campaign trail is essential to a positive outcome for the Democratic Party in the fall?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't heard him describe it that way. I think the President's thinking is that when considering who should sit in the Oval Office for the next four years, the American people might be interested in the opinion of people who have previously sat at that desk. And as I made reference to yesterday, at least those who are still living, none of them has indicated their support for the Republican presidential nominee at this point. And I think the President does feel confident that whoever does emerge as the Democratic nominee, that he'll have confidence in being able to advocate for that person's judgment, their values, their priorities, their approach to the job as something that is in the best interest of the country. And I think that as somebody who has done the job for the last 7.5 years, the American people will be interested in his opinion.\nQ: Lastly, I want to return, with some regret, to the subject of the controversy over the official White House transcript of the press briefing for May 9. Just by way of recapping, the controversy relates the fact that my Fox News colleague, Kevin Corke, asked you whether you could say categorically that no senior administration official had ever lied publically about the Iran nuclear deal. ABC News, Bloomberg News, Jason Chaffetz, many others, this reporter included, state, categorically, that the video shows, unmistakably, that you answered, \"No, Kevin.\" And, in fact, Mr. Corke gave you a second chance during that briefing to answer that question because the answer was so striking he thought you'd misunderstood him. You said yesterday that there was a little cross-talk that made this exchange inaudible. The very transcript of yesterday's briefing is studded with the word \"inaudible\" where it's appropriate. Why did the May 9 transcript not contain the word \"inaudible?\"\nMR. EARNEST: James, I don't write the transcripts. Obviously, we have the staff --\nQ: You clear them for quality, though, I assume.\nMR. EARNEST: Of course I do, James. Of course I do. Here's the point. I've been quite clear about exactly what our position on this has been. The administration has worked very hard to present a forceful, fact-based, truthful case about the way that the United States and the rest of the international community benefits from Iran not obtaining a nuclear weapon. And the truth is there are a lot of Republicans who opposed the deal who said a whole bunch of things about the Iran deal that were wrong. And I don't know if they were mistaken; I don't know if they were naпve; I don't know if they were poorly briefed; I don't know if they were lying. They were wrong.\nI leave it to them to defend exactly the position that they have taken, and I think I have presented factually, repeatedly, exactly the case that we have made.\nQ: My question was limited to the matter of the transcript and why, if you're asserting there was cross-talk that made something inaudible, the word \"inaudible\" didn't appear at the appropriate place?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know.\nQ: Final question on this. Essentially, Josh, what you're doing is you're standing there at the podium and you're maintaining that you did not say that which it is plainly discernable you said, actually.\nMR. EARNEST: James, I think what I'm saying is that there have been three follow-ups now to this question and I've answered it quite directly exactly what our position is. So if you'd like me to do it again, I can do it again.\nQ: I guess the final question is, are you willing to review that video one more time, Josh, with an eye toward possibly amending it as it should be amended?\nMR. EARNEST: No.\nMike.\nQ: Slightly more technical questions. Today, Prime Minister Modi announced not a deal for the Westinghouse reactors, but a pledge to get a deal. Are you disappointed, is the administration disappointed that when the Prime Minister comes he can't announce an actual contract on these things?\nMR. EARNEST: No, Mike. I think that the visit from the Prime Minister of India is one that we looked forward to, and we certainly were pleased with the opportunity that the two leaders had to sit down and discuss some important issues.\nQ: On this particular issue, though, are you disappointed that they weren't able to announce a contract today?\nMR. EARNEST: No.\nQ: As my colleague from India mentioned, it now looks likely that India will not be admitted to the Nuclear Supply Group because of some countries' objections. Is the administration disappointed that India won't be admitted to the Nuclear Supply Group?\nMR. EARNEST: Mike, I have to tell you that, as I had mentioned to Lalit, I'm not familiar with the details of this particular dispute, so we'll have somebody follow up with you on that.\nQ: The fiduciary rule legislation --\nMR. EARNEST: The conflict of interest rule?\nQ: Yes.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, that one.\nQ: -- has been passed by the Senate. You guys have indicated in the past you're opposed to it. Will you veto it? When will you veto it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, to be clear, what Congress did was they actually voted to overturn an executive action that would prevent investment advisors from acting in a way inconsistent with the best interests of their customers. That kind of behavior has actually cost, on average, $17 billion a year in retirement savings for hardworking Americans.\nThe President just believes it's common sense that if you sign up with an investment advisor to help you plan for your retirement that that individual should have your own best financial interests at heart.\nThe good news is, is that most of them do. Most of the retirement -- people out there who are offering retirement advice do keep their customers' best interests at heart. And this rule basically doesn't have any impact on the way that they do business. The only people who are affected by this rule are people who sign up clients but don't make a commitment to acting in that client's best interest.\nNow, again, I'll leave it to Republicans to explain who they claim to be on the side of middle-class families, except when it comes to their planning for retirement, in which case they're with the large financial corporations who are already making billions of dollars a year.\nThat's why the President is going to veto the bill, because he believes that this executive action is important to providing more middle-class families access to a dignified and secure retirement. I don't know exactly when the President will sign that bill, but I'll be sure and let you know exactly when he'll veto the bill. And we'll be sure and let you know exactly when he does it.\nQ: Lastly, the Speaker of the House today described Donald Trump's comments about the judge in his civil case as a \"textbook definition of a racist comment.\" Does the President agree with that characterization?\nMR. EARNEST: As I mentioned yesterday, I don't anticipate at this point that we'll weigh in on all the controversial comments that are uttered by the Republican nominee for president.\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, can you tell us a little bit about this phone call that the President had with Senator Sanders this weekend, and whether or not the discussion of an endorsement came up?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any private conversations to discuss at this point. The lines of communication between the White House and the campaigns have been open throughout the campaigns -- throughout the nomination process. And I think that should be evident by the fact that both candidates have been to the White House for a private meeting with the President of the United States. But I don't have any details about any private conversations that have occurred lately.\nQ: Was there a pairing with that phone call? I mean, did Secretary Clinton also receive one?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have any details of private conversations with either Democratic presidential candidates to share at this point.\nQ: Or even just the fact that one happened, not details of it?\nMR. EARNEST: Correct.\nQ: So when you look at some of the comments that were made this morning by Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker was saying that time is of the essence here for getting the Democratic Party to rally and coalesce. Does the White House agree, does the President agree that time is ticking here, that there needs to be unity soon?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, I think the President's view is that we are nearing the end of the nomination process and that Democrats all across the country had an opportunity to weigh in on the decision about who should represent the Democratic Party in the general election. And this is a process that has been energizing to millions of Democratic voters across the country. That's been a really good thing.\nAnd as the process winds down it will be important for the Democratic Party to come together in support of the party's nominee. The President certainly intends to make his voice heard in encouraging Democrats to come together behind whoever wins.\nQ: Does the President see himself as a unifier? I mean, is that the role that you're kind of describing here?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, when you take a look at some of the public opinion data about the President's standing in the Democratic Party, he certainly would be well positioned to play that role. And given how important he thinks this election is, and given how important Democratic unity will be in the general election, yes, I think you could expect the President to play that kind of role.\nQ: And you've said that the superdelegate who lives here isn't ready to endorse just yet. But as you said, many news organizations, mine included, have done the homework, done the math and see that Hillary Clinton has enough delegates. At least on the question of the symbolism, as someone who's gotten enough votes here be the first woman to lead a major party, that's historic. Do you have a reaction or a comment to that?\nMR. EARNEST: Not at this point. And the reason for that primarily is that even as we speak right now there are Democrats in six different states that are out there casting a ballot, making their voice heard on this process. And just out of respect for their role in this process, we're going to withhold comment until they've had an opportunity to participate. And we'll try again tomorrow.\nQ: Is that a promise, tomorrow? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: No. (Laughter.) But try again tomorrow -- at least as it relates to me expressing the President's point of view.\nQ: Will we be hearing from you tomorrow, if not the President, on this?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President is traveling to New York, and I do expect to gaggle with the traveling press pool on the plane.\nAndrew.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. This morning, Assad addressed parliament and again said that he has absolutely no intention of leaving office. I was wondering where you think that leaves the negotiations.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't think it represents a change in his position, and I don't think it represents a change in mine. President Assad has lost the legitimacy to lead that country. He continues to carry out heinous acts of violence against his own people. He continues to order the military to do things like drop barrel bombs against innocent civilians. There are reports that the Assad regime is engaged in repeated efforts to obstruct the delivery of humanitarian relief to hundreds of thousands of Syrians that are suffering.\nThat's why it's impossible for him to fulfill his rhetoric about uniting that country under his leadership. It's not going to happen. In fact, his continued presence in that office and in that job only exacerbates the chaos and turmoil and violence in that country. So it's time for him to leave so that the rest of the international community can support the Syrian people as they choose the political direction of that country from here. That's been our position for quite some time, and there's nothing about Mr. Assad's speech that's changed it.\nQ: And you've been pressing Russia for the better part of five years to use their influence with Assad to get him to step down. Is it your assessment the Vladimir Putin is unwilling or unable to influence Assad?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think you probably have to ask him exactly what his view of President Assad is. I think what is true is that -- and I think this is relevant -- what President Putin himself has said is that a political transition in Syria is necessary to bring the turmoil and violence inside that country to an end. So it's clearly in Russia's interest to try to bring about this transition. President Putin has said as much. So the question is, what is he prepared to do to use that influence to bring about that outcome that he believes is in the best interest of his country. We're going to continue to urge him to urge him to take those necessary steps, but ultimately it's up to President Putin.\nI would note that particularly when it comes to the Cessation of Hostilities, that President Putin didn't just state as an affirmative fact -- let me say it this way -- it's not just an affirmative fact that Russia has influence with the Assad regime in Syria, it's in the context of the cessation of hostilities, President Putin made a commitment to use that influence to get the Assad regime to abide by the cessation of hostilities. And in the last few weeks we have seen a concerning pattern of violations of that cessation of hostilities. And that's why we continue to urge the Russian government to live up to the commitment that they made to use that influence to get the Assad regime to abide by the cessation of hostilities.\nQ: While this diplomatic stalemate continues the humanitarian situation in Syria goes from bad to worse. The U.N. has kind of u-turned on the need for aircrafts for aid. Do you think that U.S. airdrops are -- unilaterally? Are they something that you'd consider?\nMR. EARNEST: At this point, I don't have details about what other options the United States might be considering. Obviously we are deeply concerned about the humanitarian situation. In the last week we have seen some aid organizations, including the United Nations, the Syrian Red Crescent, and the ICRC, succeed in delivering some humanitarian assistance to a couple of communities that were in critical need of support. But there are other deliveries that were blocked and prevented.\nOur concern is that there are hundreds of thousands at least that are suffering. The most effective way to bring them relief is essentially delivering these supplies on the ground. And in too many instances, we're seeing the Assad regime prevent that from happening. In other cases, it's just violence on the ground that's preventing that from happening.\nSo we continue to be deeply concerned about it. I know that members of the United Nations Security Council had an opportunity last week to meet to discuss what could be done to try to address this situation. Obviously the United States is an active participant in those discussions. It continues to be true, as has been the case over the last several years, that the United States is the largest bilateral donor of humanitarian assistance to try to provide for the humanitarian needs of the Syrian population. And the United States will continue to offer that support.\nQ: If I could just -- if you could indulge me with just one more question. Going back to the issue of the fact there was no press conference between Prime Minister Modi and the President, it just seems a little odd that two of the world's largest democracies -- the leaders of two of the world's largest democracies wouldn't be able to find time to come out and answer questions about their meeting. Was that a problem of -- did you actually ask the Indian delegation if they would be willing to hold a press conference and it wasn't possible because of them? Or what was the issue?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I think the issue was just a matter of scheduling. And between the private engagements that the President and the Prime Minister had both in the Oval Office and over lunch, that there was time for the two leaders to speak to the professional, independent journalists that cover the White House and that cover the Indian Prime Minister. But there was not time on the schedule for the two leaders to take questions.\nMichelle.\nQ: Now that Hillary Clinton does have that magic number of delegates and she's being called the presumptive nominee, is that how the White House is viewing the situation now?\nMR. EARNEST: Right now the White House views the situation as ongoing. Democratic voters in six states are at the polls even as we speak casting a ballot and making their voice heard about who should represent the Democratic Party in the general election. And out of respect for that ongoing process, I'm not going to declare a winner from here. We'll let these votes be counted; we'll let these voices be heard. And then I suspect we'll know a little bit more about the outcomes of the race at that point.\nQ: Well, with that number of delegates already in her pocket, what is really going to change? And since she's being called the presumptive nominee at this point, are you not -- you're not calling her that, is that right?\nMR. EARNEST: No. No one at the White House has labeled either candidate the presumptive nominee at this point. But obviously we're interested in the results tonight. We are interested in making sure that voters across the country can make their voices heard. The President said as much last week. And it certainly is possible that we'll know quite a bit more about what the likely outcome is going to be after the voters are tallied tonight.\nBut out of respect for those who are casting ballots right now, we'll continue to hold the position that we've held for several months now, which is to be fair and neutral and give the Democratic voters across the country the opportunity to make this decision.\nQ: So it's safe to say that's the only thing the President is waiting for before he officially endorses Hillary Clinton is to let the votes be cast?\nMR. EARNEST: I think that's the essence of the process.\nQ: Is it possible then that he will make a statement on this in some form as early as tonight?\nMR. EARNEST: I can just -- as you're all trying to plan your evenings, I I can tell you that I do not anticipate the President making a public appearance to discuss politics tonight. But if there are any updates, we'll keep you posted. But you don't have to worry about the President making an appearance. None is planned at this point.\nQ: And virtually every time the President speaks publicly now he's criticizing Donald Trump, sometimes without mentioning his name, but he's gotten general, he's gotten very specific about certain things that Donald Trump has said. So based on the things that Donald Trump has said most recently, is the White House considering those words to be racist? Or since the President tends to speak more generally, given I guess the body of statements that are out there by the candidate, does the President consider Donald Trump to be a racist?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't believe the President has used that specific word, but -- look, I think what is true is that, first of all, the President -- it's not unusual for the President to make comments that have nothing to do with the presidential race and don't have anything to do with either of the presidential nominees. In fact, the President did just that a couple of hours ago in the Oval Office. And so that's the first thing.\nThe second thing is, there is a tendency on the part of some observers to assume that every time the President makes a comment affirming a core Democratic or even American value, that that is perceived somehow as a shot at the presumptive Republican nominee. And I think that says much more about the language that is used by the presumptive Republican nominee than it does about the values that are championed by the President of the United States.\nLet me also say that -- and this is part of the case I was making to James about the role that the President will have in the general election -- regardless of who the Democratic nominee is, the President is an important validator. The President is somebody who has been doing this job for the last seven and a half years. And I think it will be relevant to the decision-making of many Americans -- not just Democrats, by the way, but some independents and some Republicans -- who will be interested to hear what the President thinks about which candidate has the judgment, the temperament, the maturity, the decision-making skills to advance U.S. interests around the world.\nWhen the American people see footage of the President, for example, as he did today, meeting with the Prime Minister of the world's largest democracy, the American people want to make sure that our interests and our country are being well represented. It matters who is sitting in that chair across from the Indian Prime Minister. That has significant consequences for our economy, for our planet, for our national security, for our alliances in that region and around the world.\nAnd I would anticipate that over the course of the general election, the President will be making the case about how important that leadership and that symbolism is, and why he believes that the Democratic nominee is best suited to fill that job.\nQ: But both the President and you yourself have used a lot of adjectives to describe Donald Trump's words in the past, including things like \"dangerous\" and \"divisive.\" Now that you have top Republicans using the word \"racist\" to describe some very specific things that were said, is there a reason why you don't want to say that -- unless you don't believe that those words are racist?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess I would -- one might observe that maybe -- well, I'll just say that I'm not going to take the bait every time that the presumptive Republican nominee says something controversial. In this case, there are plenty of voices that are being heard. And I guess what I would say is that I suspect the President's concerns aren't altogether different than some of the concerns that may be raised by Republicans. A rare moment of bipartisan unity maybe.\nQ: Okay. It's been interesting over the past couple of days to hear the First Lady get into a little bit of politics in her commencement speech, or -- even though that wasn't really the first time she's been critical of what is assumed to be things Donald Trump has said. Do you expect to see the First Lady on the campaign trail and getting involved, just as you described the President as a very popular unifier?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I don't know that -- the First Lady at this point does not have any campaign events on the books, but she certainly is somebody who is passionate about the future of this country. She is somebody who is passionate about progressive values. She certainly is somebody who is passionate about making sure that our veterans and our military families are taken care of, and that the commitments that our country makes to them are kept.\nThe First Lady is certainly passionate about health care issues and ensuring the health of the next generation of Americans. She's also somebody who's passionate about civil rights and equality and fairness and justice. And her commitment to those values and her commitment to those priorities have contributed to her large following across the country. There are Democrats and some independents and some Republicans who deeply respect the First Lady. And I certainly wouldn't rule out that at some point she may express a preference in the election, as well.\nSarah.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Given what you said about the President wanting to let the process play out, let Democrats' voices be heard, D.C.'s primary is on June 14th. Does he feel that the Democrats of the District of Columbia need to have the opportunity to weigh in before he does?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President would certainly expect and encourage Democrats in the District of Columbia to participate in that election and to make their voices heard, as well. But what I also said yesterday is that once somebody has definitively demonstrated that they've got a majority of delegates who will be voting in the convention, that person will have a strong case to make as the presumptive Republican nominee -- the Democratic nominee.\nSo, at this point, out of respect for people who are casting ballots right now, we don't have a winner to declare. But the President is going to continue to watch this process moving forward, and we'll keep you updated if he's got some comments.\nQ: So what's the difference? As we've been saying, there's sort of a mathematical case to be made that the Democrats have a presumptive nominee at this point. There might be a stronger mathematical case. But if we're kind of just talking about the idea that people need to get to weigh in before the President does, what's the difference between the votes happening today and the votes happening next week?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think part of the difference is that the votes are taking place right now, as we speak. And certainly the President has got deep respect for the process and for the people who are taking their lunch break or otherwise making time in their day to participate in the Democratic primary in their state. That's a good thing and that is certainly something that the President respects and encourages people to do to get engaged.\nBut look, we'll take a look at the tallies and we'll keep you posted.\nDave.\nQ: Josh, I wanted to ask you about this case at Stanford, where the young male student was sentenced to six months in the county lockup for a sexual assault on some young woman. I wonder is the President -- obviously the President has been very involved in violence issues on campus, sexual assaults on campus. Obviously, he's the father of two daughters. I was just wondering if he's expressed an opinion about the propriety of the sentence.\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't heard the -- I'm confident that the President is aware of this particular issue, given the widespread media coverage of it. I have not heard him weigh in with an opinion one way or the other, so I can't speak to his views on this particular case. But the President certainly has spoken many times, powerfully, about his views on this particular issue. The President believes strongly that sexual assault is wrong, that there's no place for it in our military, there's no place for it on college campuses, there's no place for it in our society.\nAnd the President and the Vice President have played a leading role in the \"It's On Us\" campaign to not just speak out against the scourge of sexual assault, but also to encourage men and women across the country to *[not] shirk from their responsibility, to intervene when the risk of sexual assault is heightened; that it's on us, as Americans, as active members of our community, to protect one another and to look out for one another, and, where necessary, to intervene to stop a sexual assault.\nThe President feels quite strongly about this. This is a priority of his. I'm sure that this is at least partially informed by the fact that he has two daughters, but I'm confident that the President would feel strongly about this issue even if he didn't. This is a case of right and wrong. And it's one that the President feels strongly about. And given the media attention that this issue has gotten, I wouldn't be surprised if at some point the President does weigh in.\nQ: Does the White House have a view on whether the judge should be removed from office?\nMR. EARNEST: There is no position that the White House has taken on that particular matter. Obviously there are people who have been quite outspoken in raising their concerns about the particular judge's decision, but I'm not going to weigh in on the details of an individual case.\nByron.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Can I ask you about this argument from Senator Sanders and his campaign that the superdelegates do not vote until the convention, and therefore it is premature to declare a winner? Does the President agree with that? And it sounds like you're saying that he may have something to say on this race in the coming days or tomorrow. If that's the case, it sounds like he's rejecting that argument.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Byron, I mean, in some ways, the President does have an established track record here. Many of you will recall in 2008 that then-Senator Obama's campaign went to great lengths to highlight the support of superdelegates for his campaign. And one of the reasons for that is that we saw that a number of superdelegates were switching affiliation between one candidate to support the Obama campaign, and that was important to building support and momentum behind President Obama's campaign.\nWe haven't seen that dynamic really at play in this most recent election; that there have been superdelegates that have weighed in on both sides, but there hasn't been a lot of changing of affiliation.\nSo, look, Senator Sanders and his campaign are certainly entitled to make whatever argument that they would like. Again, I would note that this is a pretty stark contrast to the Republican nomination contest, in which there's a lot of dispute about the rules. I think Senator Sanders understands the role that superdelegates play; Secretary Clinton understands the role that superdelegates play in choosing the Democratic nominee. They understood the rules when they signed up, and they're playing by them now.\nAnd to the credit of both candidates, they've understood the rules and they have worked hard, and both of them have succeeded in building a substantial following and winning a lot of support at the convention. And that's a testament to the aggressive campaigns that have been waged, and the success that both Democrats have experienced in building strong, energetic support for their candidacies.\nQ: Looking beyond this current race, it seems like Senator Sanders and many of his supporters are going to push for sort of long-term reforms to the nominating process. It sounds like they're pushing for more open primaries, a kind of reduced or perhaps eliminated role for superdelegates. Does the President have a position on either of those reforms? Would he like to see more open primaries or the end of superdelegates?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, I think every four or eight years there is a discussion within the party about what I think everyone would acknowledge is a rather complicated process for choosing a party nominee. And sometimes that devolves into a discussion about the benefits and consequences of superdelegates. Sometimes the discussion will veer into territory of the wisdom of allowing states like Iowa, New Hampshire to enjoy their traditional special status.\nI speak with some personal experience on this. Back in 2004, when I worked at the DNC, there was a -- this was at the end of 2003 and early 2004 -- there was a careful review of the process for appointing or selecting a Democratic nominee at that point. And there was a vigorous discussion about how the process -- the primary process could be changed to ensure that more Democratic voters and more states had an opportunity to weigh in, in the process of choosing a Democratic nominee.\nThat was something that was important in 2004, but that was less of a concern in 2016 because we saw this primary campaign extend to so many different states. And we saw in 2008 that that actually ended up benefitting the Democratic candidate in the general election.\nSo these kinds of discussions are part of the process just about every four or eight years. And I'm confident that the DNC, which has a responsibility to administer that process, will listen to the ideas and suggestions of Democrats all across the country and make a decision about whether or not the process needs to be reformed.\nQ: One more. You've been saying that it's been good for the country and for the party to have two Democratic nominees who have been having a vigorous debate. You've described this as a positive thing. But would it be good for the party and the country to have a contested convention scenario, or does the President feel as if the party should have a firm nominee who is not being contested heading into the convention?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I'll just say as a general matter -- I don't have any update on timing -- but I will just say as general matter that the President believes it's important for Democrats to come together at the close of the nomination process to strongly support the Democratic nominee, because the stakes in the general election are very high, and because Democratic voters, despite their differences, in some cases, over which candidate would better represent the Democratic Party in the general election, the truth is both candidates are fighting for the same kinds of things.\nBoth candidates are fighting for expanded access to health care. Both candidates are fighting for immigration reform. Both candidates are fighting to address climate change. Both candidates are fighting in support of implementing the Iran deal to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Both candidates are fighting for strategies that expand economic opportunity for the middle class. Both candidates are fighting for equal pay for equal work. Both candidates are fighting to enhance education and job training in this country because they understand that we need to train the next generation of American workers to compete and win in a 21st century global economy.\nSo it shouldn't be hard for Democratic voters across the country to support a candidate that's been running on the same kind of platform, even if the candidate they voted for in the primary didn't win.\nQ: When you said the close of the nominating process, you mean the end of the primaries and the end of the voting?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm being intentionally vague. (Laughter.)\nQ: That happens.\nMR. EARNEST: It does happen. It does happen.\nKaren.\nQ: Josh, a follow-up on the Stanford case. Given how high profile the White House has been on this -- as you said, and you went through all of that -- without getting into the specifics of this case, is there a concern, though, when there are light sentences like this -- because that's sparking the outrage -- that that sends a message to perpetrators of sexual assaults and victims of sexual assaults?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I don't want my comments to be interpreted as weighing in on this particular case. There are plenty of people on the outside who are weighing in on the case. I'm not going to do that from here.\nWhat I will just tell you is that the President -- and in this case, I feel confident in speaking for the Vice President -- that both of them view sexual assault as a scourge. Sexual assault has no place on our college campuses. It has no place in our military. It has no place in our society.\nThe Vice President, in particular, has been a leading advocate of combatting violence against women. The Vice President authored a bill called the Violence Against Women Act that would ramp up funding and resources for law enforcement organizations to combat that kind of violence and sexual assault in our communities.\nSo the President and the Vice President certainly think this is a high priority, and that a very clear, unambiguous message should be sent that sexual assault and sexual harassment and violence against women will not be tolerated in any way, shape, or form in this country. And they feel strongly about that -- both as a moral issue, but also as a law enforcement issue, as well.\nAnd again, I suspect that given the amount of media attention that this particular case has generated that the President may choose to weigh in one way or another at some point -- likely in response to a question. But I'm not going to talk about the individual case. But when it comes to this question about whether or not sexual assault is a serious problem, I think our country needs to unequivocally make it clear that sexual assault is not something that will be tolerated in our society.\nQ: Does he have something planned where he might comment in response to a question?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I'm not suggesting that he does. And so I don't want to send any mixed signals here. There's no plan for the President to weigh in on this. But I suspect that at the next opportunity where the President does take questions, that I wouldn't be surprised if one of you asks and the President has a thoughtful answer to share.\nQ: Just on a local issue. The D.C. City Council approved an increase to the minimum wage to $15 an hour today. You mentioned earlier how the Democratic candidates have been pushing for that. Paul Ryan was asked about it, and he said it would \"do more harm than good.\" Is there a White House reaction to the D.C. vote today?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't seen the details on the D.C. bill. The President has long been advocating for national legislation that would increase the minimum wage. The minimum wage hasn't been increased I believe in coming up on nine years now. That's too long for hardworking Americans to go without getting a raise. And the fact is right now if you are an individual working full-time making minimum wage and you're trying to raise a family of four, you're raising that family of four below the poverty line.\nSo for somebody who -- for Republicans who claim that they believe that there should be a strong linkage between hard work and the ability to raise a family, you would think that if Republicans were actually committed to that principle, that they would support raising the minimum wage. But for some reason, they keep blocking it.\nAnd again, I will leave it to them to try to come up with a rational, legitimate, intuitive explanation for why that is. Right now, it just looks like, to anybody who's paying attention, that they're doing the bidding of big business and they're not concerned about the impact on working people. That's just the way it looks. If that's not the way it is, I'm happy for them to clarify. But to anybody who's paying attention that sure is the way that it looks.\nGoyal. Seems like a good day to call on you.\nQ: Thank you.\nMR. EARNEST: I know the President was eagerly engaged on an issue that you're quite interested in, so let's discuss it.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. Two questions quickly. Prime Minister Modi and President Obama met several times in Prime Minister Modi's two-year term, and they call each other friends. They got so close and deep relations, I believe in these two years, and also making trips -- the Prime Minister was here in the U.S. four times, and the President went twice in India.\nMy question is that -- how does President compares Prime Minister Modi with other global leaders that he meets hundreds of times in this White House? And if Prime Minister Modi has invited him to the Taj Mahal?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me just say that I think what makes the relationship between Prime Minister Modi and President Obama so strong is the shared commitment that they have to warm relations between our two countries. Both leaders recognize that a strong relationship between the United States and India benefits the economy, the national security and the people of the United States and India. And I think that is what animates their relationship.\nThe President obviously has had an opportunity to spend time socially with Prime Minister Modi. Prime Minister Modi, as I recall, hosted a very nice state dinner for President Obama in India on Republic Day, when the President was there last year. Unfortunately, the President was not able to visit the Taj Mahal on that trip, but the President is certainly looking forward to having an opportunity to visit the Taj Mahal at some point after leaving the White House.\nQ: And second, India and U.S. made history yesterday -- for the first time, that -- over 200 -- after thousands of years of old items stolen or smuggled out of India, and they were presented or given under the leadership of President Obama and Attorney General yesterday to the Prime Minister. What you would call artifacts. So what do you think -- how the President thinks about this, that those items being stolen every day from India?\nAnd also, at the same time, before coming to the U.S., the Prime Minister was in Switzerland and he was talking there with the Swiss President about stolen money from India by corrupt politicians or -- called black market money. If the President of U.S. is going to help India, just like they helped to bring these artifacts out -- so that black market money sitting -- millions of dollars out of India.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I can't speak to any details. I'm not aware of the conversations that you referenced there with the Swiss. What I can tell you is that I think what is evident in the conversations and the readout of the conversations that you've heard today is that the President is committed to strengthening the relationship between the United States and India. And we want to look for every opportunity we can to remove impediments in that important relationship, because the world and surely the citizens of our two countries benefit from a stronger relationship.\nAnd so we're seeking to deepen our cooperation on economic issues, on national security issues, on fighting terrorism, on fighting climate change. There are a whole host of ways in which the United States and India can work together to improve the world for the citizens in our two countries. And President Obama has made this relationship a priority. In fact, President Obama was interested in strengthening U.S. ties with India even before Prime Minister Modi took office. You'll recall that the very first state dinner that Prime Minister -- I'm sorry, that President Obama and the First Lady hosted here at the White House was to host Prime Minister Modi's predecessor here at the White House. And that was an important event, and I think it was an important symbol about the priority that the President places on the U.S. relationship with India. And the President is pleased that he has found a partner in Prime Minister Modi to extend and strengthen that relationship.\nQ: I want to just clarify one thing quickly. Prime Minister thanked Attorney General about the over 200 artifacts presented to India. And he said that more relations -- strengthening relations on this because Indians -- 1 billion Indians in India -- also they put on Facebook that this is a great relationship between two countries that items are being returned by the United States. And the U.S. helped India to get those items. And also, at the same time, those Panama Papers, among others.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, Goyal, I mean, just as it relates to the specific artifacts, I'm not aware of that particular issue. But obviously President Obama believes in the importance of a strong relationship between the United States and India, and if there's an opportunity for us to remove impediments or irritants in that relationship, then we certainly want to take advantage of the opportunity to do so.\nJohn, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. You have some experience working for an historic candidate for President. You know the feeling that supporters had back in 2008 when President Obama became the presumptive nominee, when he became ultimately the nominee for the Democratic Party, becoming the first African-American major-party candidate to run and be the nominee for the parties of the presidency. Can you get a sense about what supporters of Hillary Clinton are feeling right now, with some news organizations saying that she is now the presumptive nominee for her party?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, Secretary Clinton's candidacy was historic back in 2008. And the President deeply respected the challenges that she encountered and overcame in running that campaign. It was a campaign in which she got 18 million votes to be the Democratic nominee for President -- a remarkable achievement in 2008. And she set out to pick up where she left off, and that process is coming to an end.\nI think what I can say at this point is that one of the things that was important to President Obama was that the country could be quite proud of the symbolic progress that we have made by nominating and then electing and then reelecting an African-American to serve as President of the United States. That represents tremendous progress in our country. And the President has observed many times that he owes a deep debt of gratitude to civil rights activists of all faiths and all races who fought hard for the progress that our country has made, and he's a beneficiary of that hard work and of the sacrifices that they made.\nThere's a similar story to tell about the progress that our country has made when it comes to the rights of women. And there's a similar story to tell about how even Secretary Clinton's candidacy for the Democratic nomination is a reflection of how much progress our country has made and how she has benefitted from the commitment and sacrifice made by previous generations of Americans -- men and women, black, white, Hispanic. And I think she will at some point speak much more powerfully and cogently than I can about how she is a beneficiary of that work and inheritor of that legacy. But that's something that she'll, I'm sure, discuss more once this nomination process has come to a conclusion.\nThanks, everybody.\nEND 2:13 P.M.

I am friends with and employ thousands of people of Mexican and Hispanic descent. The American justice system relies on fair and impartial judges. All judges should be held to that standard. I do not feel that one's heritage makes them incapable of being impartial, but, based on the rulings that I have received in the Trump University civil case, I feel justified in questioning whether I am receiving a fair trial.\nOver the past few weeks, I have watched as the media has reported one inaccuracy after another concerning the ongoing litigation involving Trump University. There are several important facts the public should know and that the media has failed to report.\nThroughout the litigation my attorneys have continually demonstrated that students who participated in Trump University were provided a substantive, valuable education based upon a curriculum developed by professors from Northwestern University, Columbia Business School, Stanford University and other respected institutions. And, the response from students was overwhelming. Over a five year period, more than 10,000 paying students filled out surveys giving the courses high marks and expressing their overwhelming satisfaction with Trump University's programs. For example:\n* Former student Tarla Makaeff, the original plaintiff in the litigation, not only completed multiple surveys rating Trump University's three-day seminar \"excellent\" in every category, but also praised Trump University's mentorship program in a glowing 5 plus minute video testimonial. When asked \"how could Trump University help to meet [her] goals\", she simply stated \"[c]ontinue to offer great classes.\" Once the plaintiffs' lawyers realized how disastrous a witness she was, they asked to have her removed from the case. Over my lawyers' objections, the judge granted the plaintiffs' motion, but allowed the case to continue.\n* Art Cohen, a lead plaintiffs in the litigation, completed a survey in which he not only rated Trump University's three-day seminar \"excellent\" in virtually every category, but went so far as to indicate that he would \"attend another Trump University seminar\" and even \"recommend Trump University seminars to a friend.\" When asked how Trump University could improve the seminar, Mr. Cohen's only suggestion was to \"[h]ave lunch sandwiches brought in\" and make the lunch break 45 minutes.\n* Former student Bob Giullo, who has been critical of Trump University in numerous interviews and negative advertisements from my political opponents, also expressed his satisfaction, rating Trump University's programs \"excellent\" in every category. When asked how Trump University could improve its programs, Mr. Giullo simply asked that students be provided \"more comfortable chairs.\"\nIndeed, these are just a few of literally thousands of positive surveys, all of which can be viewed online at www.98percentapproval.com.\nFor those students who decided that Trump University's programs were not for them, the company had a generous refund policy, offering a full refund to any student who asked for their money back within 3 days of signing up for a program or by the end of the first day of any multi-day program, whichever came later.\nNormally, legal issues in a civil case would be heard in a neutral environment. However, given my unique circumstances as nominee of the Republican Party and the core issues of my campaign that focus on illegal immigration, jobs and unfair trade, I have concerns as to my ability to receive a fair trial.\nI am fighting hard to bring jobs back to the United States. Many companies – like Ford, Nabisco, Carrier – are moving production to Mexico. Drugs and illegal immigrants are also pouring across our border. This is bad for all Americans, regardless of their heritage.\nDue to what I believe are unfair and mistaken rulings in this case and the Judge's reported associations with certain professional organizations, questions were raised regarding the Obama appointed Judge's impartiality. It is a fair question. I hope it is not the case.\nWhile this lawsuit should have been dismissed, it is now scheduled for trial in November. I do not intend to comment on this matter any further. With all of the thousands of people who have given the courses such high marks and accolades, we will win this case!\nDonald J. Trump", "timestamp": "2016-06-07", "title": "Statement by Donald J.

His message of hope and prosperity has captured the imagination of millions of Republicans, Democrats and Independents. His vision provides an historic opportunity to unify our people and break through old battle lines to enable the greatness of America to arise again.\nDonald Trump cares that working Americans are hurting, he understands the policy errors that have caused it to happen, and importantly, he is determined to use all his strength and skill to get us on the right track again.\nThere is so much that must be done – and done before it's too late. Donald Trump will only negotiate trade deals that benefit America. He will execute a wise, realistic foreign policy that brings peace through strength. He will finally respect and respond to the American people's demand for a lawful immigration system that serves America's interests. He will nominate judges of great ability who know they serve under the laws and Constitution, and are not above them. He will sign legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare, not veto it. He will produce a tax code that is fair to all and promotes jobs and better wages. He will stop wasteful Washington spending and restore fiscal sanity.\nThe choice could not be clearer. A vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for a failed status quo that for too long has put the special interests ahead of the people's interests.

Olson, R-TX, and 43 cosponsors)\nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 4775, the Ozone Standards Implementation Act of 2016, because it would significantly undermine Clean Air Act (CAA) protections, would block efforts to reduce harmful ground-level ozone pollution in communities across the country, and could delay future scientific reviews for other harmful pollutants.\nOzone pollution, also known as smog, has been linked to a range of adverse health effects which can lead to missed work and school days, increased hospital admissions, and premature deaths from respiratory and cardiovascular causes. H.R. 4775 would delay implementation of the 2015 ozone health standard that will otherwise improve air quality for millions of Americans. This would result in people living in areas with unhealthy ozone levels for at least an additional 10 years. The bill also would unnecessarily extend deadlines for science-based reviews of all National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) from 5 to 10 years—delaying for 5 years the requirement that the latest science inform our air pollution standards. Further, the bill would make other detrimental changes to the NAAQS core protections—most significantly allowing a fundamental shift away from the principle that the standards should be based solely on public health and welfare considerations. As a result, H.R. 4775 would jeopardize progress toward cleaner air and significantly delay health benefits worth billions of dollars for millions of Americans, including those most vulnerable—children, older adults, and people with asthma.\nAs required by the CAA, the Environmental Protection Agency sets primary air quality standards that protect public health with an \"adequate margin of safety,\" including the health of at-risk groups. These science-based air standards, which undergo rigorous public review and comment, have a proven record of success. They have resulted in cleaner air which has helped all Americans live longer, healthier lives in a growing economy. In fact, since 1970, emissions of key pollutants have decreased by nearly 70 percent while the economy has tripled in size.\nH.R. 4775 would undermine the vitally important environmental and health protections of the CAA.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118002", "text": "STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY\n(Senate)\n(Sen. McCain, R-AZ)\nThe Administration appreciates the Senate Armed Services Committee's continued support of our national defense and supports a number of provisions in S. 2943, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2017. The Administration also appreciates that S. 2943, as reported by the Committee, would authorize resources to support our troops in a manner that is consistent with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 without relying on budgetary gimmicks that risk the safety of our service members and undercut stable planning and efficient use of taxpayer dollars. Of particular note are provisions supporting the Administration's pay raise and force structure requests. As the bill is considered by the Senate, it is critical that the Congress adhere to the principle that any increase in funding must be shared equally between defense and non-defense – a central tenet of last fall's budget agreement.\nThe Administration strongly objects to many provisions in this bill that would hinder the Department of Defense's (DOD) ability to execute the President's defense strategy and the Administration's ability to carry out national security and foreign policy. Specifically, the bill attempts to micromanage DOD by impeding the Department's ability to respond to changing circumstances, directing overly prescriptive organizational changes, preventing the closure of Guantanamo, and limiting U.S. engagement with Cuba, and includes provisions that set an arbitrary limit on the size of the President's National Security Council staff. The bill would undermine expert judgments of the Department's civilian and military leadership and constrain the ability of the President and the Secretary of Defense to appropriately manage and direct the Nation's defense.\nReorganizing DOD without careful study and consideration would undermine the Department's ability to continue to carry out its national security functions, and comes at a dangerous time, with U.S. forces deployed across the globe, including as part of the Counter-ISIL campaign and NATO mission in Afghanistan. S. 2943 would restructure key parts of DOD in ways that have not been thoroughly reviewed by experts, either within or outside the Department, and that are likely to make the Department less efficient and agile. For example, it would dissolve the Office of the Under Secretary for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (USD/AT&L) and replace it with failed models of the past. USD/AT&L has a track record of improved acquisition performance for the taxpayer since the implementation of the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009 (WSARA) and the Better Buying Power initiatives of 2010 to the present. The bill would create dysfunctional partitions across DOD's research, engineering, procurement, and sustainment systems that will make it harder to sustain the Department's improved performance. The bill would reverse key aspects of WSARA, which reinforced early attention to requirements, cost and schedule estimates, testing, and reliability. The bill also would insert a civilian, other than the President or the Secretary of Defense, into the administrative chain of command for the first time. Simultaneously, it would direct the establishment of cross-functional entities, which in many cases already exist, but, if structured as the bill requires, would undermine the authority of the Secretary, add bureaucracy, and confuse lines of responsibility.\nThe bill includes other troubling provisions affecting the Department. For example, it would rigidly prescribe the use of a wide range of contracting methods in circumstances that history has proven are not appropriate or efficient in meeting the military's needs. It would direct wholesale reorganization of military medical treatment facilities, which would jeopardize the readiness of military healthcare providers to carry out wartime missions. It would prescribe onerous, across-the-board cuts to senior military billets, civilian executives, and contractors at a time when the Department is already undertaking a 25 percent cut to headquarters activities and other significant reforms to become leaner and more efficient. The bill also would impair personnel policies, such as parental leave and housing allowances, which are important to supporting the force – particularly female service members. These personnel changes would harm the Department's ability to recruit and retain the high-quality service members that our all-volunteer force requires. In addition, S. 2943 would impose unneeded costs, constraining DOD's ability to balance military capability, capacity, and readiness, including by failing to authorize a new Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) round.\nThe bill continues unwarranted restrictions regarding detainees at Guantanamo Bay and adds new provisions, attempting to dictate how the Executive Branch conducts foreign policy and requiring the disclosure of sensitive national security information. The Administration also objects to the inclusion of non-germane provisions, such as those exempting defense contractors from an Executive Order (EO) that ensures that agencies are identifying and working with contractors with track records of compliance with labor laws. These provisions have nothing to do with the national security of our country, and decrease the economy and efficiency of the Federal procurement system. Furthermore, the Administration strongly objects to efforts to limit our engagement with Cuba, curtailing the normalization of our relationship. The Administration is also concerned that, in addition to lacking defense and non-defense parity, expected attempts to increase funding for defense accounts will fail to reflect the highest joint priorities of the Department, ensure programmatic stability and continuity and contribute to improvements in the readiness of the joint force, rather than exacerbate readiness challenges.\nIf the President were presented with S. 2943, his senior advisors would recommend he veto the bill.\nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other concerns, a number of which are outlined in more detail below, and urges the Congress to work in a bipartisan fashion to make necessary changes to the bill. The Administration also looks forward to reviewing the bill's classified annex and working with the Committee to address any concerns on classified programs.\nGuantanamo Detainee Provisions: The Administration strongly objects to several provisions of the bill that relate to the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. As the Administration has said many times before, the continued operation of the facility weakens our national security by draining resources, damaging our relationships with key allies and partners, and emboldening violent extremists. In February, the Administration submitted a comprehensive plan to safely and responsibly close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and to bring this chapter of our history to a close. Rather than taking the steps necessary to close the facility, this bill includes several provisions that would seek to extend its operation. While some provisions represent an improvement over current law by authorizing additional flexibility in some circumstances, the bill fails to eliminate the unwarranted limitations on the transfer of detainees, including the onerous restrictions that currently constrain the transfer of detainees to foreign countries, and introduces additional problematic restrictions that would impede closure of the facility.\nAmong the onerous, unwarranted and harmful provisions, section 1029 would prohibit the transfer of detainees to numerous countries on the basis of State Department travel warnings, which are designed for the unrelated purpose of conveying information to individual tourists and other travelers about potential dangers associated with travel to those countries. These warnings do not reflect a country's ability to mitigate potential risk with regard to transferred detainees or serve as an appropriate substitute for the Administration's careful and individualized assessment based on all relevant facts and circumstances of the capability of potential receiving countries to successfully reintegrate detainees and implement appropriate security measures.\nIn addition, section 1027 would require the Secretary of Defense to provide to the Congress prior to any transfer a memorandum of understanding containing diplomatic assurances from the foreign nation to which the detainee would be transferred. Across two administrations, the Executive Branch has consistently informed the Congress and represented before U.S. courts that disclosing such diplomatic assurances from foreign governments would reduce the willingness of these and potentially other countries to cooperate with the United States on a range of matters. Section 1027 would also require the disclosure of sensitive national security information not only to the Congress, but to the very nation that is the subject of the assessment. Further, section 1028 could require the Secretary of Defense to provide the Congress with classified, sensitive national security information about detainees, in unclassified form.\nThe President has objected to the inclusion of these and similar provisions in prior legislation. Further, the provisions concerning detainee transfers could raise several constitutional concerns. In certain circumstances, sections 1021, 1026, 1027, and 1029 would violate constitutional separation of powers principles. Sections 1026 and 1029 could, in some circumstances, interfere with the ability to transfer a detainee who has been granted a writ of habeas corpus. And, as explained, sections 1027 and 1028 could require the disclosure of privileged information. The Administration would treat these provisions consistent with the President's constitutional authority in these areas.\nRestriction of the Size and Function of the National Security Council (NSC) Staff: The Administration strongly objects to section 1089, which would place an arbitrary limitation of 150 professional NSC staff, which assists the President by coordinating national security policy across the many departments and agencies in the Executive branch. By contrast, the combined staff of the Senate Armed Services, Foreign Relations, Homeland Security, and Intelligence Committees is larger than 150 people. This provision would radically restructure the NSC staff, requiring an arbitrary reduction in personnel that could inhibit the NSC staff's ability to advise and assist the President as he carries out his national security and foreign policy agenda in an increasingly complicated world. Indeed, the NSC staff includes a number of positions that were added after a 2009 review recommended the creation of additional directorates and positions to address emerging threats and challenges, such as cybersecurity and weapons of mass destruction-related terrorism. Arbitrarily reducing the size of the NSC staff could impede the NSC staff's ability to coordinate interagency policy and advise and assist the President on these important issues. Moreover, this Administration has already actively sought to ensure appropriate NSC staff levels, reducing the staff by 12 percent in the last eighteen months.\nElimination of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD/AT&L): The Administration strongly objects to section 901, which would eliminate the USD/AT&L and assign its duties to multiple officials, including a new Under Secretary for Research and Engineering, an Under Secretary for Management Support, and an Assistant Secretary for Acquisition Policy and Oversight. Unlike the USD/AT&L, the new Under Secretary for Research and Engineering would not have responsibility for developmental testing, which provides critical feedback regarding the early identification of design problems that is crucial for successful acquisition programs. The new Under Secretary would not have responsibility for contractor oversight and life-cycle sustainment costs, which would undermine DOD's ability to control contractor costs and oversee performance through the life of a program. And the new Under Secretary would not have the authority to direct the military departments and DOD components, undermining the ability of the Secretary of Defense to provide guidance and direction to the military services on major acquisition programs. Finally, the assignment of logistics oversight functions to both a new Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Logistics and Sustainment under the new Assistant Secretary for Acquisition Policy and Oversight and a new Under Secretary of Defense for Business Management would fracture and misalign logistics authorities, management, and execution and ignore the key logistics authorities and policies related to deploying, sustaining, and retrograding forces in contingency operations. Taken together, these changes would roll back the acquisition reforms of the last two decades and risk returning the Department to an era in which overly optimistic cost estimates, inadequate system engineering and developmental testing, inappropriate reliance on immature technologies, ineffective contractor management, and lack of focus on life-cycle costs by the military departments led to explosive cost growth and the failure of multiple major defense acquisition programs. It is particularly inappropriate for the Congress to do this now, when the data clearly shows that recent performance of the Department's acquisition system has improved markedly in recent years. For example, the proportion of major programs projecting funding savings below baseline has risen from 29 percent to 57 percent in development, and 44 percent to 79 percent in unit procurement, between the 2009 and 2014 Selected Acquisition Reports. Many of the reforms accomplished under WSARA and the Better Buying Power initiatives of 2010 to the present would be overturned just as compelling evidence that they are succeeding has become available.\nUndermining DOD Organization and Structure: The Administration strongly objects to sections 941 and 942, which would undermine the Secretary of Defense's ability to exercise authority, direction, and control over the Department. The provisions would blur lines of responsibility and control over resources within the Department, and would require the issuance of numerous unnecessary and burdensome policies, directives, and reports. Section 941 would undermine the Secretary's ability to create effective cross-functional teams, which are already an extremely common feature of the way the Department is organized today. For example, the Joint Requirements Oversight Council, the Defense Acquisition Board, the 3-Star Programmers, the Global Posture Executive Council, and the Deputy's Management Action Group are all chartered cross-functional organizations at the heart of the Department's core functions. These sections would limit the Secretary's ability to use teams such as these by mandating an inflexible legislative schedule for the establishment of such teams and requiring that the teams write their own charters. Section 941 also would give directive authority over other elements of the Department and authorize them to requisition personnel and resources from other parts of the Department without regard to competing mission requirements. Furthermore, by directing the Department to enter into contracts with outside consultants to obtain advice on the performance of the teams, this provision is squarely at odds with section 905, which would require considerable cuts to contractors in the Department. Section 941 would also prohibit the nomination of an individual to a senior DOD position unless the individual has successfully completed a course in \"leadership, modern organizational practice, collaboration, and the operation of mission teams.\" Sections 941 and 942 would require the Secretary to establish two separate comprehensive organizational strategies with overlapping and not always consistent requirements and different reporting requirements. Contrary to the stated objective of the legislation, these provisions would establish new processes and new paperwork burdens, resulting in increased bureaucracy and a larger, less efficient, and less responsive DOD organization.\nOrganization of the Department of Defense for Management of Special Operations Forces and Special Operations: The Administration objects to section 923, which would insert an Assistant Secretary into the administrative chain of command for the first time since the enactment of the National Security Act of 1947, displacing the Service Secretaries. This provision would also amend the responsibilities of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict to include assisting the Secretary and the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy in the development and supervision of policy, program planning and execution, and allocation and use of resources for the activities of the Department for countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (CWMD). These CWMD responsibilities currently reside under the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense and Global Security. Finally, this provision would intrude on the authority and the prerogative of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy to manage the organization to provide the best support to the Secretary and the President.\nRealignment of Director of Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E): The Administration strongly objects to section 894, which would realign the Director of DT&E under the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E). DT&E is part of the acquisition process and provides insight into managing risks, measuring technical progress, and characterizing technical performance during development. Independent of the acquisition process, DOT&E provides an assessment that characterizes a weapons system's operational effectiveness, suitability, and survivability. Therefore, DOT&E performs oversight that is singularly focused on testing, without regard for the fiscal and schedule realities of DOD acquisition. The realignment of DT&E under DOT&E would eliminate this separation, undermine a program manager's authorities and responsibilities, and drive increases in program cost and schedule by severely impacting the services' ability to plan and execute developmental test and evaluation strategies within the framework of the DOD acquisition process.\nU.S.-Cuba Military Engagement: The Administration strongly objects to the additional restrictions that would be placed on U.S.-Cuban military-to-military interactions. The proposed restriction would hamper pragmatic, expert-level coordination between the United States and Cuba on issues that benefit the United States. For example, the Commanding Officer of U.S. Naval Station Guantanamo Bay and his Cuban counterpart meet monthly to share information about activities on both sides of the fence to reduce the risk of accidental escalation. While section 1204 carves out an exception for exercises and operations related to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, it does not provide an exception or waiver for counter-narcotics. In addition, section 1204 limits the ability of the Secretary of Defense to invite, assist, or assure the participation of the Government of Cuba in security conferences, where much of the multilateral preparatory work on humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, and counter-narcotics takes place. It is in the U.S. national security interest to maintain flexibility in U.S. military-to-military engagement with Cuba due to Cuba's proximity and the many shared challenges faced by the United States and Cuba.\nProhibition on Conducting Additional BRAC Round: The Administration strongly objects to section 2702 and strongly urges the Congress to provide BRAC authorization as requested so that DOD can make better use of scarce resources. Maintaining excess infrastructure is costly and wasteful, and it deprives the Department of the ability to reallocate scarce resources to address readiness, modernization, and other national security requirements. In addition to addressing every previous Congressional objection to BRAC authorization, the Department recently conducted a DOD-wide parametric capacity analysis which demonstrated that the Department has 22 percent excess capacity. Additionally, the Administration's BRAC legislative proposal includes several changes that respond to Congressional concerns regarding cost. Specifically, the revised BRAC legislation requires the Secretary to certify that BRAC will have the primary objective of eliminating excess capacity and reducing costs; emphasizes recommendations that yield net savings within five years (subject to military value); and limits recommendations that take longer than 20 years to pay back. The Administration strongly urges the Congress to provide BRAC authorization as requested.\nModification of National Missile Defense Policy: The Administration appreciates the Committee's continued support for the Nation's ballistic missile defense programs. However, the Administration strongly objects to section 1665, which would amend section 2 of the National Missile Defense Act of 1999 (Public Law 106-38; 10 U.S.C. § 2431) by striking ‘limited.' The inclusion of this word is specifically intended to convey that the U.S. homeland missile defense system is designed and deployed to counter limited attacks (in number and sophistication) from Iran and North Korea, and not to counter the strategic deterrence forces of Russia and China. The Administration continues to believe that the most reliable and effective means to deter major nuclear powers from ever contemplating an attack on the United States is by maintaining a modern and robust strategic nuclear deterrent force.\nCounterterrorism Partnerships Fund (CTPF): The Administration strongly objects to the elimination of CTPF in section 4502, which would remove a valuable tool for partnership-focused approaches to counterterrorism. Cutting CTPF would greatly reduce the Administration's flexibility to provide counterterrorism assistance to foreign partners. The Administration strongly encourages the Congress to authorize the $1 billion originally requested to continue support for CTPF activities in FY 2017.\nTRICARE Reform: The Administration greatly appreciates the Committee's meaningful TRICARE benefit reforms in sections 701 and 702, which closely resemble those included in the President's ?Budget. However, the Administration is disappointed that the legislation does not include a modest enrollment fee for TRICARE for Life and phases in TRICARE Choice enrollment fees for non-Medicare eligible retirees over five years. Together, these elements of the Administration's proposal would provide nearly $2.6 billion in additional savings over a five -year period. The Administration encourages the Congress to fully adopt the benefit reform provisions submitted with the President's Budget. The Administration is also very concerned about section 726, which has the potential to cause serious program disruption and induce high additional costs derived from the unintended consequence of further complicating health care contract acquisition processes to comply with its detailed legislative mandates. The section would include a provision on continuous competition, allowing \"automatic renewal\" of the managed care contracts for up to 10 years, but then would prohibit the incumbent from rebidding on the successor contract. It also would allow either party to terminate the contract with 180 days' notice. Either provision could result in large geographic areas losing their TRICARE managed care contracts, severely limiting beneficiary access to civilian care. The multi-billion dollar TRICARE management contracts require substantial acquisition process time, compliance with many statutory requirements, and robust transition periods between contractors. As written, responsible implementation of this section is not feasible.\nMilitary Health System Reform: The Administration strongly objects to section 721, which would radically restructure the military health system. The language severs the relationship between each Service and its medical department, jeopardizing the ability of the Department to readily provide operational medical support. It also would separate the accountability for medical support to military missions and the responsibility for the quality of care from operational missions. Both functions are critically important to maintain the documented success in saving lives on the battlefield. The Defense Health Agency is both a DOD entity and a Combat Support Agency; however, when working operational support issues, there is considerable difference between having an accountable leader with knowledge of the mission in the Service chain of command versus a leader outside of that chain, as provided by section 721. The Department agrees that standardization of common clinical and business processes will lead to more effective and efficient care, and commits to substantially accelerating achievement of a common, enterprise approach consistent with the Services' operational readiness requirements. The Department looks forward to working with the Congress to ensure that the Military Health System provides state-of-the-art, quality care to all it serves, on and off the battlefield, while maintaining critical readiness capability to support the military mission.\nModifications to the Newly-Created Military Retirement System: The Administration appreciates the flexibility provided by sections 631-633 in connection with retired pay reform and urges the Congress to support the use of continuation pay for service members with up to 16 years of service, given varying retention rates across career fields and the military departments. However, the Administration is concerned about mandating a 2.5 monthly basic pay multiplier for continuation pay for all members. Allowing DOD greater flexibility to adjust the timing and amount of continuation pay would allow military services to shape the force more effectively and efficiently.\nRestructure of Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH): The Administration strongly objects to section 604, which would undermine the existing structure of BAH, return the allowance to its distorted state from the mid-1990s, and reinstitute a burdensome and inefficient administrative-authorization process by limiting BAH payments to actual expenses. It would also undermine the structure by basing the allowance solely on grade and location (disregarding dependency status), and would inappropriately penalize some service members over others by linking their BAH payments to their status as members of dual-military couples (members married to other members). Section 604 would disproportionately affect female service members and those military families in which both military members have chosen to serve their country (20 percent of the women on active duty are in a dual-military marriage, compared with 3.8 percent of active duty men). Both members of a dual-military couple would be provided a lesser compensation package than other members of equal grade, sending a message that their service is not as highly valued. It would similarly penalize members who choose to share housing with other members and thus would inhibit the ability of junior service members to obtain suitable housing in tight rental markets, which is currently a recurring concern. Also, section 604 would hurt the recruitment and retention of high-quality service members and their families, making it difficult to sustain the all-volunteer force. Finally, the changes would also impact benefits under multiple VA educational assistance programs that are based on BAH rates, potentially decreasing payment amounts, increasing the complexity of benefit calculations, and negatively impacting the timeliness of benefit delivery.\nMilitary Leave: The Administration objects to section 532, which would diminish the plenary authority of the Secretary of Defense and undermine his ability to manage the force. The Administration urges the Congress to support DOD's military leave proposal, which strikes the right balance between parental benefits and sustaining readiness. Additionally, the terms \"primary\" and \"secondary\" caregiver are used throughout the bill language without legislative definition. Given the myriad family situations in the force, the Department does not believe that these terms can be defined in a manner that creates a workable construct for implementing and administering the provision.\nHeadquarters Workforce Limitations: The Administration strongly objects to sections 904 and 905, which would impose new restrictions on the size of the civilian and contracted services workforces for DOD headquarters. In accordance with the requirements of section 346 of the FY 2016 NDAA, DOD has re-baselined its major headquarters activities and put in place a comprehensive plan to achieve a 25 percent reduction in the size of headquarters by FY 2020. The Department believes that the imposition of additional limitations on subcategories of headquarters and the revival of old and inconsistent headquarters definitions would add unnecessary bureaucratic requirements, further complicate the mission of reducing headquarters, and reduce the Department's capacity to respond to emergent mission changes and requirements. With the ongoing reductions and the many other reform efforts the Department has undertaken since 2008, we believe the Department's headquarters will be right-sized, given the tremendous breadth and depth of the Department's mission. Further cuts must be targeted, designed to reduce specific identified redundancies or inefficiencies, or come with commensurate reductions in the Department's mission.\nReduction in General Officer and Flag Officer Grades and Positions: While the Administration supports simplifying and improving command and control of the military, particularly where the number of four-star positions have made headquarters either top-heavy or less efficient, it objects to section 501, which would arbitrarily reduce the number of general and flag officers by 25 percent by the end of calendar year 2017. Reductions to the number of general and flag officer positions should be made deliberately after reviewing the role of each position and analyzing the impact of the reduction on the force. The Administration intends to reduce the number of four-star positions and across-the-board mandated reductions would degrade the effectiveness and readiness of the force.\nLimitation on Number of Senior Executive Service (SES) Employees: The Administration objects to section 1112, which would make a mandatory, 25 percent across-the-board reduction in the number of the Department's SES employees by January 1, 2019. The Administration supports the elimination of unnecessary and excessive executive positions as evidenced by DOD's elimination of 97 SES positions in 2011, and a further reduction of over 140 SES positions since then. However, any further reductions to SES positions in DOD should be made in a deliberate manner following a review and analysis of the impact of such reductions on the functioning of each component or agency. Requiring DOD to arbitrarily cut additional SES positions across-the-board would create long-term negative impacts for various DOD services and organizations.\nCoalition Support Fund: The Administration appreciates the extension of authority and funds associated with section 1212(f) of the FY 2016 NDAA.\nPakistan Security Enhancement Authorization: The Administration welcomes this authority to support security and stability in Pakistan, particularly in the Federally-Administered Tribal Areas and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. However, the Administration objects to subsection (d) of section 1214, which would make Pakistan ineligible for the Secretary of Defense's waiver authority unless the Secretary provides a certification to the congressional defense committees. We share the Committee's concerns regarding the threat posed to our forces and interests in Afghanistan by the Haqqani Network, and we continue to engage with Pakistan at the highest levels regarding the need for concerted action specifically against the group. However, the restriction in subsection (d) would unnecessarily complicate progress in our bilateral relationship on this issue and would limit the Secretary of Defense's ability to act in the U.S. national security interest.\nSecurity Cooperation Enterprise Reforms: The Administration appreciates the Committee's efforts to reform DOD's security cooperation enterprise in subtitle G of Title XII, particularly certain Administration requested reform proposals. The bill also proposes far-reaching reforms in a number of areas to enhance the transparency and oversight of security sector resources, professionalize the workforce, and improve the alignment of authorities to defense strategy. While these proposed reforms seek to address a number of existing challenges in the current framework, they go beyond the Administration's request with potentially broad ramifications that need to be analyzed carefully. Any reforms ultimately must ensure that no harm is done to DOD's current security cooperation and force readiness efforts, or to the State Department's lead role in foreign policy and security sector assistance, including by inappropriately codifying, expanding, limiting, or eliminating current authorities, resources, or mechanisms necessary to ensure that the United States pursues a coherent and consistent foreign policy through all assistance activities. In addition, this consolidation could undermine DOD's ability to support the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces.\nForeign policy and security cooperation authorities must continue to strike a balance between specific defense initiatives and broader foreign policy priorities. The bill's expansion of existing security cooperation authorities must continue to preserve or include requested mechanisms for ensuring State Department foreign policy direction, including joint formulation. The Administration is eager to work with the Committee, and with the Congress, to ensure the final legislation undertakes Administration-requested reforms in a carefully considered manner that avoids duplication of efforts and authorities, and unintended consequences for current DOD and State security sector assistance activities.\nProhibition on Use of Funds for Certain DOD Programs and Projects in Afghanistan that Cannot be Safely Accessed by United States Government Personnel: The Administration objects to the language included in section 1213, which would adversely affect two key assistance programs -- the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund (ASFF) and the Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP). DOD cannot predict or guarantee the future security environment in the vicinity of every program and project that is funded by CERP or ASFF, which are often used to fund multi-year programs and projects. As a result, DOD would potentially be required to seek a waiver for every program and project -- a burdensome requirement that could negatively affect DOD's ability to address urgent needs of the local population, interrupt or slow down training and sustainment programs, and delay funding the critical needs of the Afghanistan National Security and Defense Forces at a time when insurgent forces are leveraging every opportunity to threaten Afghanistan's security.\nMultiple Provisions Imposing Restrictions on the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) Program: The Administration strongly objects to sections 1036, 1037, 1038, and 1611. Section 1036 would restrict DOD's authority to use RD-180 engines, eliminate the Secretary's authority to waive restrictions to protect national security interests, and -- with section 1037 -- disqualify a domestic launch service provider from offering a competitive, certified launch service capability. Section 1038 would repeal the statutory requirement to allow all certified providers to compete for launch service procurements. Section 1611 would redirect funds away from the development of modern, cost-effective, domestic launch capabilities that will replace non-allied engines. The combined effect of these provisions would be to eliminate price-based competition of EELV launch service contracts starting in FY 2017, force the Department to allocate missions, inhibit DOD's ability to maintain assured access to space, delay the launch of national security satellites, delay the on-ramp of new domestic launch capabilities and services, and increase the cost of space launch to DOD, the Intelligence Community, and civil agencies. The authorization to use up to 18 RD-180 engines is necessary and prudent to expeditiously and affordably transition to the new domestic launch capabilities currently under development.\nTransition of Air Force Operation of Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) to Enlisted Personnel: The Administration strongly objects to section 1046, which would require the Air Force to transition all RPA operations to an organizational model that uses enlisted personnel for the preponderance of RPA operations by September 30, 2019. Over the last decade, the demand for RPA forces has grown dramatically, and various factors have resulted in undesirable cuts in training capacity and ultimately reduced the number of trained aviators. To address this issue, the Air Force developed and is implementing a get-well plan that has begun correcting pilot shortfalls and increasing RPA pilot manning to achieve and sustain a healthy RPA enterprise. Before the Congress mandates any particular manning determinations, the Air Force should be allowed to conduct a study assessing the appropriate future balance of officer-enlisted pilots/crews in the RPA enterprise and any potential impacts on future Air Force force structure. Directing a date and percentage for integrating enlisted pilots prior to understanding the ramifications for training through-put and force management may negatively impact the entire RPA force and reduce combat capability at a time when it is beginning to create a healthy enterprise after years of continuous surge operations.\nU.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) Assessment of Satellite Acquisition by National Reconnaissance Office (NRO): The Administration strongly objects to section 1606, which would require the Comptroller General to continually assess the cost, schedule, and performance of NRO programs that receive funding from the Military Intelligence Program or are supported by DOD personnel. Such an expansive definition would require annual audits of all NRO programs, not just those funded in part by DOD. This additional oversight would be exceptionally burdensome and unnecessarily wasteful to an agency that has received seven consecutive clean financial audits and was recently recognized by the Congress for its systems acquisitions excellence. The current oversight regime is sufficient and appropriate, and includes the NRO Inspector General, DOD, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Inspectors General of those agencies, the Office of Management and Budget, and the Congress. Since 2011, GAO access has been administered by Intelligence Community Directive 114, which reflects an agreement between the Comptroller General and the Director of National Intelligence. Given the sensitivity of NRO acquisitions, extensive GAO access would present security risks to the Nation's most sensitive space programs.\nLimitation on Acceleration of Dismantlement of Retired Nuclear Weapons: The Administration strongly objects to section 3113, which would place unnecessary restrictions on the ability of the President to exercise his responsibilities to manage the nuclear arsenal. The Administration also objects to the reduction in funding for accelerated dismantlement of retired nuclear warheads. The United States has a considerable backlog of retired warheads awaiting dismantlement that are no longer needed for military purposes. Funding for accelerated dismantlement is important both to appropriately manage the U.S. nuclear arsenal in a safe, secure, and effective way and to demonstrate continued U.S. commitment to nonproliferation and disarmament.\nNonproliferation Construction: The Administration strongly objects to continued construction of the Mixed Oxide (MOX) Fuel Fabrication Facility and to section 3114 which would require yet another study of the cost and time necessary to complete this facility. Even with a firm fixed-price contract for the MOX Fuel Fabrication Facility, numerous previous studies have confirmed that the alternative disposition method is expected to be significantly faster and less expensive. Consistently, these reviews have concluded that the projected life-cycle costs of the MOX fuel approach for plutonium disposition will be $30-$50 billion, and possibly higher, and will require approximately $800 million to $1 billion annually for decades through the life of the program. It would be irresponsible for the Congress to require continued construction of this project, which would only serve to waste limited national security funds and force more pressing nuclear security needs to go unmet. The already-proven alternative method of disposition is expected to be significantly faster and less expensive than the MOX approach, has far lower risks, and will begin to move plutonium out of the State of South Carolina much sooner.\nThe Administration also objects to section 3114, which would establish the Chief of Engineers as an owner's agent relative to the MOX Project. Recognizing the U.S. Army Corps' (USACE) expertise, the Department of Energy is already leveraging USACE personnel on its large construction projects, including the MOX Project where USACE is augmenting project oversight and providing independent cost estimates. Therefore, the Administration does not believe naming USACE as the owner's agent will provide additional value.\nProviding Footwear to Recruits at Initial Entry Training: The Administration objects to section 671, which would require the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps to provide athletic footwear directly to recruits upon their entry into the Armed Forces instead of providing a cash allowance for the purchase of such footwear, at the choice of the recruit. Mandating that a specific article of clothing be provided to new recruits is unprecedented and, in the case of athletic shoes, runs counter to research that indicates a strong correlation between the variety of athletic shoes available, fit, and comfort, and reduced injury rates. Forcing DOD into a \"one size fits all\" approach to athletic footwear may contribute to a higher incidence of injury to new recruits during one of the most critical times in a member's military training. DOD places the health of service members above all other considerations. Because only one company is currently producing a shoe that arguably meets the standards established in the section, this provision appears to provide a preferential arrangement for a particular company.\nDistributed Common Ground System of the Army (DCGS-A): The Administration objects to section 111, which would restrict award of any contract for the design, development, and procurement of any data architecture, data integration, cloud capability, data analysis or data visualization and workflow capabilities unless Federal Acquisition Regulation part 12 is used, includes firm fixed-priced procedures, and achieves initial operational capability within nine months and full operational capability within 18 months of contract award. This provision appears to micromanage and mandates a commercial solution without regard for price, ability to support a modular open system architecture, or cost associated with proprietary software maintenance. In practice, the provision could mandate acquisition of a system that does not fully meet required Key Performance Parameters without due consideration of integration costs and risks or schedule impacts, putting the system's affordability, functionality, and interoperability at risk.\nWarfighter Information Network-Tactical (WIN-T): The Administration strongly objects to the funding authorization that reduces WIN-T by $100 million. The reduction in funds stops the fielding of the WIN-T on-the-move networking capability to Army National Guard Brigade Combat Teams and creates a production break in WIN-T Increment 2 hardware. The production break will lead to the loss of key subject matter experts.\nCommissary Privatization Pilot Program: The Administration supports section 661, which would include provisions that would protect and enhance the Defense commissary and exchange systems and reduce their reliance on appropriated fund support by allowing the establishment of an alternative pricing program for commissaries. However, the Administration has concerns with the commissary privatization pilot program directed in section 662. The Department recently issued a Request for Information (RFI), in accordance with the requirements of the FY 2016 NDAA, and will not be able to assess the willingness of private sector entities to participate in a privatization pilot program in a manner consistent with the preservation of the commissary benefit until responses to the RFI have been received and assessed. By requiring the Department to conduct a pilot program for privatization regardless of the interest and capabilities of private sector entities, section 662 would place the commissary benefit at risk.\nEstablishment of an Assistant Secretary of Defense for Information: The Administration objects to section 903, which would establish an Assistant Secretary for Information whose responsibilities would be potentially duplicative with the Principal Cyber Advisor (PCA) to the Secretary of Defense as well as the Principal Space Advisor. While it would combine oversight of cyber policy and information technology, it would complicate, rather than improve, the oversight of U.S. Cyber Command and cyber operations, or U.S. Strategic Command and space operations, with governance of resources, acquisition, and cyber workforce policy fragmented. It also would create a new fracture in DOD and intelligence space management between the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and the new Assistant Secretary, and potentially distract from the current Chief Information Officer's position and responsibilities.\nManagement of Defense Clandestine Human Intelligence Collection: The Administration objects to section 945, which purports to establish a pilot program that would place case officers of the Defense Clandestine Service (DCS) under the control of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Requiring the transfer of all case officers and personnel who support case officers of the DCS to the CIA for three years is not a \"pilot,\" but is tantamount to an actual transfer of the program. Limiting the transfer to three years would not mitigate the burdensome management challenges, disruption of operations, and potentially high costs associated with moving the operating capability of the service to the CIA and then returning it back to DOD. Further, the Administration is concerned that there could be adverse and unforeseen implications of such a transfer to the professional development of DCS staff. DCS and CIA integrated operations are already working effectively and efficiently; a consolidation, as envisioned by the provision, is unnecessary. For example, the DCS and CIA already exchange or embed personnel for planning, management, coordination, execution of operations, and development and sharing of products. The DCS is already integrated with the CIA, as necessary and appropriate, throughout the breadth and depth of DOD and CIA clandestine operations around the world.\nB-21 (Long Range Strike Bomber): The Administration strongly objects to section 844, which would establish a critical cost threshold for the B-21 program below the acquisition program baseline (APB), which was based on two fully independent cost estimates. This section represents an unprecedented and extremely damaging reversal of the approved acquisition strategy for the B-21 program. To enforce a different performance standard after the execution of the acquisition strategy has begun will result in the carefully established business plan becoming mired in reporting delays and unprecedented, redundant breach certifications. The Administration also strongly objects to the $302.3 million FY 2017 funding reduction. There are no excess funds in the program in FY 2017 and the reduction will result in a significant delay in moving forward with the development program. Furthermore, the Administration believes that the requirement to transfer funds to the Rapid Prototyping Fund could jeopardize the program through increased risk to the availability of funds, and the additional reporting requirements would be unnecessarily burdensome, would add schedule risk, and would detract from overall program management at a critical phase of the program.\nPenalty for Use of Cost-Type Contracts/Preference for Fixed-Price Contracts: The Administration objects to section 826, which would require the Secretary of each military department and the head of each of the defense agencies to pay a penalty for some uses of cost-type contracts that are awarded over the next five fiscal years. Section 826 would unnecessarily constrain flexibility to tailor contract types for a given requirement. It also creates a complex financial transaction process that, to be auditable, will require extremely burdensome procedures. The Administration also objects to section 827, which would require higher level approval for the use of other than fixed-price contracts. This requirement is unnecessary and would result in the Department experiencing increased costs in situations where a cost-type contract would have been more appropriate. Acquisition officials and contracting officers should have the full range of contract types available to structure business arrangements that achieve a reasonable balance of risk between the Government and the contractor, while providing the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance. There is extensive history that demonstrates conclusively that fixed-price development is not in the Government or industry's interest in many circumstances.\nGlobal Positioning System Next Generation Operation Control System (GPS-OCX): The Administration strongly objects to section 1610, which would withhold FY 2017 OCX funding until a Nunn-McCurdy certification is complete. OCX will provide a cyber-hardened ground control network to operate the current and future GPS satellites. Fencing off FY 2017 OCX funding will result in a stop-work for the development, test, and integration of OCX Block 0 and Block 1, resulting in a 6-12 month slip to the launch and operation of GPS III. Additionally, the provision de-funds ongoing efforts to synchronize and modernize the GPS Enterprise, resulting in cost and schedule impacts across the space, mission control/planning, and user segments, and it stops all user equipment testing, preventing the deployment of M-code capable receivers as required in Public Law 111-383, section 913.\nNon-applicability of EO 13673 to DOD Contractors: The Administration strongly objects to section 829H, which would limit DOD's application of EO 13673 (\"Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces\") only to contractors or subcontractors who have already been suspended or debarred as a result of Federal labor violations covered by the EO. Such limited applicability would undermine broader safeguards established by the President to ensure that agencies are identifying and working with contractors with track records of compliance with labor laws, which enhances productivity and increases the likelihood of timely, predictable, and satisfactory delivery of goods and services. Narrowing the scope of the EO to those contractors that have already been suspended or debarred would limit contracting officers' ability to identify contractors with track records of non-compliance. It also would limit enforcement agencies' ability to assist contractors with significant labor violations to improve their labor law compliance, including through the use of labor compliance agreements, before suspension and debarment becomes the only option.\nApplicability of Certain Executive Orders to DOD: The Administration strongly objects to section 862, which would weaken a number of EOs and other actions taken by the President to protect taxpayer money and the integrity of the acquisition process and to improve the economy and efficiency of Federal contracting. For example, the President's Memorandum on Contractor Tax Delinquency laid the foundation for limiting agencies' ability to make new awards to contractors with serious tax delinquencies. These protections are no less relevant in the case of Federal contractors furnishing commercially-available off-the-shelf items. Section 862 also undermines other EOs such as EO 13665 that protect against discrimination in Federal contractors' workplaces. Discriminatory hiring and compensation practices decrease the likelihood that the most qualified and productive workers are hired at the market efficient price, and hence broad applicability is required to ensure an efficient market in Federal contracting. The remainder of EOs that section 862 seeks to weaken -- including those encouraging the use of Project Labor Agreements requiring that employees be notified of their statutory labor rights, as well as raising the minimum wage and providing paid sick leave for Federal contract employees -- similarly improve productivity of Federal contractors' workplaces. As such, section 862 should be struck as it would decrease the economy and efficiency of the Federal procurement system.\nPersonnel Background and Security Investigations: The Administration strongly objects to section 973, which would transfer responsibility for personnel background and security investigations of DOD personnel from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to the Defense Security Service. This provision would undermine the ability of the Federal Government to achieve economies of scale by further fragmenting the investigation process while diminishing the security, effectiveness, and efficiency of operations. The Administration is currently standing up the National Background Investigations Bureau (NBIB), which will strengthen how the Government performs background investigations. NBIB will be housed at OPM to conduct the vast majority of background investigations, but will leverage DOD expertise to bring the fullest national security and IT resources to bear against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. Section 973 would upend this plan and interfere with the Executive Branch's ability to determine appropriate means for implementing this critical national security function. It would also delay ongoing security clearance reform efforts, and likely cause significant investigative delays.\nExpansion of DOD Hiring Flexibilities: The Administration supports the inclusion of section 1106 (Direct Hire for post-secondary students and recent graduates), and section 1103 (temporary and term appointments), which would increase the ability of DOD to recruit and hire the talent it needs to carry out critical mission areas. We urge the Congress to broaden these provisions to include other Federal agencies under Title 5 of the United States Code. Hiring and recruitment flexibilities provided in these provisions would be extremely valuable for all Federal agencies, and would enable Government-wide improvements to help meet Federal workforce needs.\nProgram Acquisition and Contracting Restrictions: The Administration objects to section 145, which would prohibit the Department from using authorized funds to re-host the COMPASS CALL Primary Mission Equipment from the EC-130H to a commercial business jet without conducting a full and open competition. The Air Force requires the flexibility to employ appropriate contracting authorities as allowed by law, including the exemptions to full and open competition in order to efficiently and effectively execute the COMPASS CALL re-host plan. If the Air Force determines that less than full and open competition is allowable and advisable, conducting a full and open competition will unnecessarily delay fielding critical warfighter capability. The Administration also objects to section 146, which would restrict the Department from obligating or expending funds on the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System recapitalization program, unless the Air Force uses a fixed-price contract for engineering and manufacturing development. The restriction places unacceptable risk on the program by restricting the Department's ability to use a contract type which is best suited for the development effort.\nF-35 Joint Strike Fighter Program: The Administration strongly objects to sections 1086 and 1087, which would disband the F-35 Joint Program Office following the F-35 full-rate production decision (expected in April 2019), and establish the F-35 Follow-on Modernization program as a separate major defense acquisition program. The contention that the F-35A, F-35B, and F-35C are essentially three distinct aircraft with significantly different missions and capability requirements misses the mark and does not take into account the essential role that the F-35 Joint Program Office plays in the program, or the international nature of the program and the role that the international partners will continue to play for the remainder of this, the most complex cooperative weapons program DOD has ever undertaken. The follow-on modernization effort, which is just beginning, and the challenging transition from development to global sustainment and life-cycle support require continued management of the enterprise from a central Joint Program Office. While a transition to individual, Service-led, F-35 variant program offices might conceivably be advantageous at some time, now is not that time, and retaining the current program structure for the Follow-on Modernization program, with its existing oversight mechanisms, is the most prudent approach.\nMissile Defense Programs: The Administration strongly objects to section 1663, which would require the initiation of concept definition, design, research, development, and engineering evaluation and test for a space-based intercept and defeat layer and space test bed. There currently is no requirement for a space-based intercept and there are concerns about the technical feasibility and long-term affordability of interceptors in space. The Department is conducting an evaluation on a space-based missile defense layer, as required by section 1685 of the FY 2016 NDAA. The results of that evaluation will inform the technical feasibility of such a capability.\nDefense Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) Board: The Administration objects to the provision in section 811, which would create a new Defense-specific CAS Board to create standards addressing the measurement, assignment, and allocation of contractor costs. This action would result in unnecessary overlap and duplication with the functions of the existing Government-wide CAS Board and could result in contractors with both Defense and civilian contracts having to comply with two different standards for the same cost issue. Requiring the use of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) would impose inappropriate constraints on the Board's ability to carry out its responsibilities. GAAP focuses on reporting the financial results of overall operations, and addresses neither the allocation of costs to individual contracts nor the allowability of contract costs. Section 811 also imposes inappropriate limitations on the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) despite its historical success in savings on average of $3 billion annually due to findings, primarily those related to non-compliances with CAS and the Federal Acquisition Regulation Cost Principles. Commercial audit firms would audit GAAP costs, while DCAA would be limited to audits of direct costs on cost contracts and to audits of indirect costs only at contractors where their Government cost-type contracts are more than 50 percent of the entities' total sales. This would exclude some of DOD's largest contract from DCAA oversight. Audits by both DCAA and commercial audit firms would create burdens and inefficiencies for both contractors and Government agencies.\nModified Restrictions on Undefinitized Contractual Actions (UCAs): The Administration objects to section 816, which would require that UCAs be awarded on a fixed-price level of effort basis. Fixed-price level of effort is a contract type that is most appropriately used to acquire labor, as in the case of research or investigatory requirements. The Department employs UCAs largely in part to enable the contractor to acquire materials (e.g. long lead) for major weapon system programs, something this provision would seem to prohibit. UCAs are also used when the urgency of a Government need argues strongly against the negotiations delay caused by establishing final terms.\nRequirement to Use Firm Fixed-Price Contracts for Foreign Military Sales (FMS): The Administration objects to section 828, which restricts the contract type for FMS. Frequently, DOD combines requirements with FMS requirements on a single contract, or has contractors concurrently producing weapon systems for its requirements and FMS requirements under separate contracts. If the Department were precluded from using the appropriate type contract in any particular environment, it would effectively constrain DOD's ability to deliver best value to the FMS customer, and eliminate opportunities to achieve efficiencies by combining U.S. and FMS requirements on the same contract.\nPreference for Performance-Based Contractual Payments: The Administration objects to the provision of section 829 that would preclude DOD from conditioning performance-based payments on costs incurred. Performance-based payments are a method of contract financing and should not be used to pay contractors amounts in excess of costs incurred in advance of the Government's receipt of the item or service.\nProducts and Services Purchased through Contracting Program for Firms that Hired the Severely Disabled: The Administration strongly objects to section 829G, which would jeopardize approximately 33,000 existing jobs that DOD provides to people with severe disabilities, to include 2,800 veterans. Furthermore, this provision would effectively preclude the Department from awarding near-term contracts to enable opportunities for future employment for countless others with severe disabilities. The Department is by far the largest single procurer of goods and services from Ability One within the Federal Government. The provision would require DOD to perform several statutory duties that are currently performed by the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled, the Federal agency that administers the Ability One Program. For example, section 829G would require DOD contracting officers to determine when a firm's (nonprofit agency) employee is significantly disabled and ensure their hours equate to the 75 percent Direct Labor Hour (DLH) ratio in this section. Current law requires the 75 percent DLH ratio to be calculated based on all DLH in the firm's entire facility during the fiscal year. Additionally, there would be no mechanism available to legally add products or services to the Procurement List, restricting contracting with non-profits that employ people with severe disabilities to those items that are currently on the List. There is no practical way for the Department's contracting officers to meet the pre-contract formation and post-contract administration requirements of section 829G and would therefore bring these contracts and renewals to a standstill along with the employment opportunities that these contracts provide.\nDefense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS): The Administration objects to language in section 901, which would move DFAS from the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) to the Under Secretary of Defense (Business Management and Support) organization. DFAS performs important financial management and pay functions that are and should remain under the purview of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO). This action would remove core financial management functions, including payment of the Department's vendors, cash management, and financial audit support from the supervision of the CFO and sever critical links between DFAS and the CFO with respect to management of the Department's funding and audit functions. A crucial ingredient to all the Services achieving unqualified financial audit opinions is the role DFAS plays as a service provider. As the DOD focal point for audit, the CFO's centralized control of the service provider and the audit plan ensures all are vectored properly.\nJoint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Fund (JIEDDF): The Administration objects to section 1531, which fails to address the successor fund to the JIEDDF mandated by the FY 2016 NDAA. Without the authorization of the Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Fund, the successor fund proposed by DOD, the Administration is constrained in its ability to enable rapid response to non-traditional, unanticipated improvised threats on the battlefield, degrade improvised explosive device precursor facilitation networks of ISIL and other violent non-state actors globally, and protect against the rapidly emerging improvised threats currently faced by U.S. forces.\nPreference for Commercial Services: The Administration objects to the provision of section 864 that would preclude agencies from acquiring certain services unless they are commercial services, except where the agency makes a written determination establishing that no commercial services are suitable to meet the agency's needs. The range of applicable services has been significantly expanded beyond the information technology services specified in section 855 of the FY 2016 NDAA to include broad service categories such as logistics management services. Because cost-type contracts cannot be used for the acquisition of commercial items, this expansion would unnecessarily and inappropriately limit the Department's ability to execute contracts using the most appropriate contract type. For example, even though planned logistics support services for the Joint Strike Fighter are optimally suited for a cost-type contract, the Department would be precluded from using a cost-type contract as long as the services were available commercially.\nUniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) Reform: The Administration appreciates that the bill adopts a number of the UCMJ reforms proposed by the Administration, including enhanced victims' rights (including anti-retaliatory measures), improvements to trial procedures, and updated sentencing guidelines.\nNational Defense Strategy: The Administration strongly objects to section 1096, which would require DOD to publish a new national defense strategy annually. A national defense strategy must provide strategic direction, priorities, and tradeoffs to address both near and longer-term challenges. If a document is truly strategic, its shelf-life will be far longer than one year. A new strategy takes time to integrate within and usefully impact the Department's many operational, budgetary, scenario, and other assessments, processes, and systems. DOD continually assesses and regularly adjusts its strategy; however, formal annual assessments would create substantial administrative burden and discordant direction that degrades the effectiveness and efficiency.\nAuthority to Provide Reimbursable Auditing Services to Certain Non-Defense Agencies: The Administration appreciates the modification to section 893 of the FY 2016 NDAA in section 892 of the bill. However, the Administration recommends that section 892 repeal section 893(a) of the FY 2016 NDAA, rather than amending section 893(a). The prohibition on DCAA performing audits for non-defense agencies is counterproductive to the intent to reduce DCAA's incurred cost inventory backlog. It would extend the length of time required to reduce the audit backlog and create burdens and inefficiencies in the audit process for both contractors and multiple Government agencies.\nTransfer of the DCAA: The Administration strongly objects to the language in section 901 that would place DCAA under the Under Secretary of Defense (Management and Support). GAO previously concluded that audit independence would be impaired if DCAA was aligned with either the USD/AT&L or the Office of the Inspector General. Alignment under the Under Secretary of Defense (Management and Support) would impair DCAA's ability to perform independent audits. This would reduce DCAA's independence because it would locate DCAA within the organization responsible for acquisition and contract administration.\nAsia-Pacific Rebalance Infrastructure: The Administration strongly objects to the exclusion of requested language which would authorize DOD to proceed with planning, design and construction for public infrastructure projects identified as necessary mitigation for several significant impacts identified in the Navy's 2015 \"Guam and Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Military Relocation (2012 Roadmap Adjustments) Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement\" and Record of Decision. The cultural repository and public health laboratory are critical projects required to address the impact of the expanding military installations and missions on Guam necessary to implement the Asia-Pacific rebalance. A key aspect of the Asia-Pacific rebalance is to create a more operationally resilient Marine Corps presence in the Pacific and invest in Guam as a joint strategic hub. This necessary authority supports the ability of the President to execute our foreign and defense policies in coordination with our ally, Japan. Additionally, it calls into question among regional states our commitment to implement the realignment plan and our ability to execute our defense strategy.\nTransfer of Drug Interdiction and Counterdrug Funding: The Administration strongly objects to the section 4501 Other Authorizations transfer of $258.3 million from Drug Interdiction and Counter Drug Activities account to the unrequested Security Cooperation Enhancement Fund. The transfer of these funds would severely hinder DOD's drug interdiction and counter-drug efforts at a time when drug trafficking to the United States is increasing. Estimates of opium poppy cultivation in Mexico nearly tripled from 2013-2015 and over 90 percent of the heroin produced in Mexico is trafficked to the United States. The rate of overdose deaths involving heroin have tripled in the past three years. Colombia's estimated potential cocaine production increased by 67 percent since 2014 and is now at an eight year high. It is critically important that DOD continue to provide targeted and focused counterdrug training, equipment, and other assistance to meet the President's objectives under the National Drug Control Strategy goals, while supporting national strategies that aim to enhance security in Colombia, Mexico, and Central America, and protect U.S. public health and safety. The new Fund also raises other concerns.\nIncrease of Micro-purchase Threshold, Simplification of Proposal Development and Evaluation, and Acquisition of Innovative Commercial Items: The Administration strongly supports the Committee's efforts to reduce the complexity of the acquisition process and believes that sections 812 and 815 should be broadened to ensure the entire Federal Government has the necessary tools to acquire best value solutions and bring even greater savings to the taxpayer. Section 812 would reduce unnecessary complexity of small dollar acquisitions by raising the micro-purchase threshold. Civilian agencies should be able to receive these benefits and the Administration supports increasing these benefits by including civilian agencies and raising the threshold even greater to $10,000. Section 815 would simplify proposal requirements for certain services under Multiple Award task order contracts. The Administration estimates that multi-agency contracts or Government-wide acquisition vehicles account for approximately half of all service contract dollars awarded each year. To receive the greatest benefit of this section and create parity among acquisition vehicles, the Administration supports expanding this provision to all multi-agency contracts or Government-wide acquisition vehicles including the Federal Supply Schedules. The Administration also appreciates inclusion of section 868 which would provide pilot authority for the Department to acquire, on a pilot basis, innovative commercial items in the same manner as it acquires research and development, but urges the Congress to broaden the pilot to include the Department of Homeland Security and the General Services Administration so that they too may take advantage of the pilot to obtain emerging technologies more efficiently.\nRepeal of Moratorium on Public-Private Competition: The Administration objects to section 806, which would eliminate the moratorium on public-private competition between Government employees and private sector contractors to perform commercial activities that support DOD missions. OMB continues to work with DOD and other agencies on efforts to ensure the most effective mix of Federal employees and contractors and believes more time is needed for efforts to ensure core in-house capabilities for critical functions before the moratorium is lifted.\nBoard for the Correction of Military Records and Discharge Review Board Matters: The Administration objects to the overly-burdensome and duplicative reporting requirements in section 536. The Department has exercised extraordinary commitment to service members and veterans through extensive reforms to the military department's Review Boards' policies and procedures. These reforms include, but are not limited to, the inclusion of mental health professionals in all aspects of Discharge Review Board and Board for Correction of Military and Naval Records procedures, as well as highly-specialized procedures relative to cases in which petitioners alleged Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and/or Traumatic Brain Injury as factors in determinations regarding their service records. These procedures have been highly effective in addressing petitions asserting such bases and the Boards have performed and continue to perform their missions in open and transparent fashion, including the publication of redacted decisions in public reading rooms. The proposed reporting requirements, however, would not only require substantial, additional assets and take significant time, compromising the Boards' ability to accomplish their missions and provide equitable relief to deserving service members and veterans, but will also expose significant sensitive information and potentially Personally Identifying Information. The proposal would also ?mandate the revelation of factors both considered and not considered in each case. Such a requirement impinges on the Boards' ability to fashion appropriate remedies in highly individualized cases and also requires the creation and/or revelation of a template seemingly applicable in every case. Such an approach not only threatens the required autonomy of the Boards, but also creates a \"checklist\" approach belying the importance of discretion and consideration of each and every case on its merits while also creating the harmful practice of precedence in Board cases.\nNotification on the Provision of Defense Sensitive Support: The Administration objects to section 1052, which would levy an unnecessary and burdensome reporting and notification requirement on the Department regarding sensitive support to agencies outside DOD. The existing clandestine quarterly reports keeps the Congress fully informed of the Defense Sensitive Support Activity (DSSA) process and each approved request for support. Introducing an additional requirement for prior notification of each instance of requested support is fundamentally impractical given their frequency, risks slowing or interrupting providing critical and timely support for operations, and burdens limited staff with duplicative reporting requirements in a time of declining resources, staff the Department relies upon to do the effective oversight and execution of the DSSA process that the Congress and supported organizations expect.\nAssociate Director for Military Affairs: The Administration objects to section 1049, which would specify criteria and responsibilities of an Associate Director for Military Affairs at the CIA, because it is unnecessary and duplicative. Existing policies, regulations, and interagency agreements already provide for an Associate Director for Military Affairs.\nTransfer of Military-Grade Firearms to Private Companies: The Administration objects to section 1056, which could put the U.S. Army in the position of transferring certain military-grade firearms to dealers in the United States -- the kinds of transfers that are highly regulated under existing law -- and potentially make it more difficult for those weapons to be traced if later used in crimes.\nSpecial Immigrant Visas: The Administration is deeply concerned that this legislation does not extend or authorize new visas as requested for the Afghan Special Immigrant Visa program, which enables Afghans who have worked alongside our troops and our diplomats to seek refuge in the United States. Thousands of Afghans have performed this work, often at great personal risk. Many have even lost their lives. Many continue to face grave threats. These Afghan civilians have been essential to accomplishing our mission in Afghanistan.\nUse of Surplus Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Motors for Commercial Space Launches: Section 1607 would direct the Comptroller General to conduct an analysis of the costs and benefits of providing surplus ICBMs to the private sector for commercial space launch purposes. Both Federal law and the Administration's National Space Transportation Policy currently prohibit such transfers for commercial use. The Administration continues to support this long-standing policy, which seeks to avoid undermining investment, entrepreneurship, and innovation in the launch market.\nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other concerns.", "timestamp": "2016-06-07", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: S. 2943 - National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017"}

Since that time, the United States and India have made important strides together to advance this strategic partnership, and to our related cooperation on environmental stewardship.\nGlobal Leadership on Climate Change and Clean Energy\nIn recognition of the urgent threat of climate change, the United States and India recognize the urgency of the threat of climate change and are therefore committed to bringing the Paris Agreement into force as quickly as possible. The United States reaffirms its commitment to join the Paris Agreement as soon as possible this year. India similarly has begun its processes to work toward this shared goal.\nIn addition, the two sides plan to work together to adopt in 2016 an ambitious amendment to phase-down the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons - a potent greenhouse gas - under the Montreal Protocol, which could avoid a half-degree of temperature increase. By avoiding up to 0.5°C of warming by the end of the century, an HFC Amendment is one of the most consequential actions we can take to implement the goals of the Paris Agreement. Furthermore, the United States and India committed to work together to reach a successful resolution to address greenhouse gas emissions from international civil aviation at the upcoming International Civil Aviation Organization Assembly.\nThe United States welcomes the launch of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) and recognizes the critical role it can play in the development and deployment of solar power. Demonstrating support for the ISA, the United States and India plan to jointly launch an effort to promote access to off-grid solar power.\nThe Government of India has been a strong partner in the Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM), a forum of the world's major economies, working together to drive the transition to clean energy. India has demonstrated how international collaboration, such as efforts to establish lighting test standards through the CEM's appliance efficiency initiative, can lead to huge benefits. India's domestic efficient lighting program, which has deployed over 100 million efficient LEDs, inspired the CEM's Global Lighting Challenge.\nA Strengthened and Expanded U.S.-India Partnership to Advance Clean Energy\nIn September 2014, President Obama and Prime Minister Modi pledged to strengthen and expand the highly successful U.S.-India Partnership to Advance Clean Energy (PACE). Since then, the two countries have made important progress and have launched important new activities to advance both countries' ambitious clean energy objectives and Nationally Determined Contributions.\nCivil Nuclear Energy: The United States welcomes India's ratification of the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage earlier this year and the significant steps taken by Nuclear Power Corporation of India, Limited and Westinghouse towards finalizing contractual negotiations by June 2017 on a deal to build six AP1000 reactors in India by 2030. Once completed, this project will fulfill the promise of the U.S.-India civil nuclear agreement, will create jobs in both the United States and India, and will advance our shared clean energy objectives.\nAccelerating Renewable Energy Deployment: The United States and India are cooperating on key issues to support the Government of India's goal to deploy 175 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2022. Today the United States is announcing 5.4 GW of new commitments from U.S. renewable companies that are seizing the opportunity to invest in India.\n• Rooftop Solar: The two governments announced plans to extend their successful cooperation on rooftop solar to three new Indian states to improve utilities' capacity to scale up.\n• Grid integration: The United States and India are taking significant steps to enable large-scale integration of renewable energy into India's power grid through the Greening the Grid initiative. These include a first-in-class national study of strategies to transform India's grid, a new $18 million contract to implement renewable integration strategies, a new $4.7 million initiative to pilot new technology for balancing the power grid, and two new partnerships between U.S. and Indian electricity regulators and grid operators.\n• Solar Resource Data: The countries are also collaborating to enhance the quality and accuracy of India's solar resource maps and data to help developers and policymakers identify high-quality, bankable solar energy projects.\n• New Investments: The two commitments announced today should result in a near doubling of current installed solar energy in India:\no 8minutenergy Renewables will pursue a 4 GW solar photovoltaic project pipeline in India to help meet the Indian government's renewable energy goals. These utility-scale solar projects are expected to generate over 10,000 Indian construction jobs in total. The company has also committed to contribute to the Clean Energy Finance Forum, which provides broad multinational private sector feedback and support to the U.S.-India Clean Energy Finance Task Force and toward Government of India's vision of deploying the capital needed to achieve it's 100 GW solar target.\no In support of the Indian government's renewable energy goals, SunLink Corporation is partnering with domestic Indian companies with a deployment target of 1.4GW over the next five years. With this approach, SunLink is also helping stimulate domestic Indian manufacturing and construction jobs. The introduction of SunLink's proven technology into the emerging Indian solar market will help the country realize its renewable energy goals on an accelerated timeline.\n• Clean Energy Finance Hub: The United States is pleased to announce a new Clean Energy Finance Hub that will serve as a coordinating mechanism to focus United States Government effort that, in partnership with leading Indian financial institutions, will increase renewable energy investment in India.\nMobilizing Investment for Clean Energy: Through PACE the United States and India have mobilized over $2.5 billion since 2009 to support clean energy deployment. Today, the United States and the Government of India announced the creation of two innovative new initiatives that together are expected to mobilize up to $1.4 billion in climate finance for Indian solar projects.\n• U.S.-India Clean Energy Finance Task Force: The two governments are now working to implement the recommendations of the U.S.-India Clean Energy Finance Task Force, including standardizing a model power purchase agreement (PPA), optimizing a payment security mechanism for delayed payments under PPAs for utility scale clean energy projects and creating a warehousing facility of small renewable projects for an asset-backed green bond issuance.\n• New Clean Energy Finance Initiatives: The two new initiatives announced today are groundbreaking as leading U.S. foundations - including the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, Jeremy & Hannelore Grantham Environmental Trust, John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, and the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation. - have agreed to collaborate in the creation of the facilities with matching support from the Government of India.\no U.S.-India Clean Energy Finance initiative: The U.S.-India Clean Energy Finance (USICEF) initiative will raise and deploy up to $20 million in project preparation support, to be sourced equally from U.S. foundations and the Government of India, to solar power projects under consideration for financial support from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC). It is anticipated that this funding will leverage an estimated $400 million in investment from OPIC and other investors for projects deploying distributed solar for grid tied communities, off-grid communities, and those served by mini-grids to benefit poor communities\no U.S.-India Catalytic Solar Finance Program: The U.S.-India Catalytic Solar Finance Program (CSFP) will raise and deploy up to $40 million in high-impact catalytic capital, to be sourced equally from U.S. foundations and the Government of India, in support of investments into India's solar market, with a particular focus on the off-grid and solar rooftop markets that will benefit poor communities. CSFP's flexible capital will enable commercially oriented capital to flow into new, innovative, and high-impact projects. It is anticipated to mobilize up to $1 billion in capital flows.\n• EXIM Bank-IREDA Memorandum of Understanding: The Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM Bank) will continue its partnership with the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA) to identify opportunities for financing made-in-America renewable energy and energy efficiency exports in support of India's ambitious clean energy goals. The EXIM Bank also confirms its willingness to engage IREDA in discussions focused on new potential financing structures, including those that do not contemplate a sovereign guarantee, in order to boost U.S. exports to India in this critical sector.\n• These initiatives complement the ongoing cooperation between the United States and India on off grid energy access, specifically the Promoting Energy Access through Clean Energy (PEACE) program. In May 2016, the two governments announced the first nine recipients of off-grid innovation funding through the joint $7.9 million PACEsetter Fund. And the new investment initiatives announced today complement the Energy Access Investment Readiness Initiative, a public/private partnership launched in 2015 to mobilize $41 million to incubate off-grid enterprises.\nEnergy Efficiency: Expanding on historical collaboration, the United States and India are updating the Energy Conservation Building Code and supporting comprehensive state-level policies for the current framework, while making significant progress on space cooling collaboration.\nInnovation: President Obama and Prime Minster Modi launched Mission Innovation at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP-21) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, pledging, along with 18 other countries, to seek to double clean energy research and development investment over five years. This pledge builds on existing cooperation under the U.S.-India Joint Clean Energy Research and Development Center (PACE-R), a $100 million program funded by the United States and Indian governments and private sector.

There are also discussions to collaborate on cancer control planning programs. Bilateral discussions on evaluating Indian traditional medicine systems for cancer treatment and palliation are also underway.\nPeople-to-People Ties\nGrowing Academic and Tourism Links: The U.S. Embassy and Consulates in India issued more than 76,000 student visas in Fiscal Year 2015. Indian students accounted for the second-largest group of foreign students in the United States in the 2014-2015 school year, with the number of students from India in the United States increasing by over 29 percent to a record high of nearly 133,000. Through the Passport to India program, the U.S. government encourages American students to study abroad in India. At the same time, more than a million Americans traveled to India in 2015. The leaders' announcement that the United States and India will be Travel and Tourism Partners in 2017 aims to develop joint efforts and programs to grow these people-to-people and economic linkages. Similarly, the implementation of the Global Entry Program will facilitate travel between the two countries.\nU.S.-India State and Urban Initiative: In recognition of the vital role states and cities play in overcoming challenges to sustainable development, the United States and India are working to develop greater cooperation between U.S. and Indian states and cities, in particular on the clean energy front. To that end, both sides intend to develop a new U.S.-India State and Urban Initiative to forge connections between U.S. and Indian subnational leaders, local governments, practitioners, scholars, universities, and investors to share policy and programmatic innovation that will propel both countries towards a sustainable energy future.\nCultural and Academic Exchange Programs: In 2015, 161 American and 122 Indian students and scholars participated in the flagship, binational Fulbright-Nehru Program. In addition, hundreds of American and Indian students and experts ranging from high school students to established professionals traveled on State Department exchange programs. There are more than 19,700 alumni of such exchange programs in India, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and such programs continue to bind our interests together.\nUniversity Linkages: The United States and India announced eight educational partnership projects for the fifth and final round of the Indo-U.S. 21st Century Knowledge Initiative. Since 2012, this binational program, formerly known as the Obama-Singh 21st Century Knowledge Initiative, has created 32 education partnerships focused on the fields of energy, climate change and environmental studies; education and educational reform; public health; sustainable development and community development; and international relations and strategic studies.\nWomen's Empowerment: The United States and India expanded efforts to advance the economic and social empowerment of women and prevent gender-based violence, supporting India's \"Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao\" initiative. Their Partnership on Women's Entrepreneurship in Clean Energy (wPOWER) helps female entrepreneurs sell renewable energy, such as solar lanterns in India, and has now expanded to East Africa and Nigeria. USAID is facilitating an Indian Women's Impact Business Alliance whereby over 30 members have convened to come up with solutions for building capacity of women impact business and investors, unlocking capital. USAID also worked with private foundations and Indian businesses to invest $14 million on improving the health of adolescent girls in India through the maternal and child health alliance and supports the deployment of a mobile application that helps victims of gender-based violence to access support services.\nDiaspora: Both sides recognized the important role of Indian Americans in fostering stronger connections between the United States and India, and have been actively engaging with the Indian diaspora. The diaspora has made significant contributions to the fields of science and technology, with nearly 15 percent of Silicon Valley start-ups and 8 percent of all technology and engineering start-ups nationwide being founded by members of the community. Additionally, nearly 71 percent of the Indian diaspora, age 25 or older, have earned a Bachelor's degree, and more than half have earned a graduate or professional degree. The Indian American community has also recently become increasingly involved in U.S. politics as well as more active in philanthropic activities.\nTrilateral Development Cooperation: In April 2016, the United States and India held trainings for Afghan female business leaders who can return to their country and teach other women skills in embroidery, garment stitching, food processing, and marketing. This program is part of a partnership based on common foreign policy goals including women's economic empowerment, in this case through a USAID grant to the Self-Employed Women's Association (SEWA), one of India's leading grassroots women's organizations. The program is expected to provide vocational training to 3,200 Afghan women, including 200 who will travel to India to receive training in computer literacy, food processing, embroidery and garment making as well as in decision-making, leadership and marketing, in turn becoming \"Master Trainers\" in Afghanistan. Other examples involving the promotion of people-to-people ties within the region include a study tour organized in February 2016 for members of parliament from Nepal to visit Bhutan and share best practices in hydropower development. Similarly, the two sides also recently launched a $4 million trilateral development program to train agricultural professionals from 17 African and Asian countries.", "timestamp": "2016-06-07", "title": "Fact Sheet: U.S.-India Economic Cooperation and People-to-People Ties"}

Well, it is a great pleasure to welcome back my friend Prime Minister Modi and the Indian delegation to the Oval Office.\nI still have fond memories of being honored by the Prime Minister's invitation to participate in Republic Day celebrations in India and the incredible hospitality and warmth that was shown by the people of India during our visit.\nAs the world's two largest democracies and countries with strong bonds between our peoples, our businesses, our scientific and educational communities, it's natural that the United States and India have deepened and broadened our partnership across a whole range of issues.\nIn Paris, the joining of forces between India and the United States helped to forge a historic agreement that can effectively deal with climate change. And we discussed how we can, as quickly as possible, bring the Paris Agreement into force, how we can make sure that the climate financing that's necessary for India to be able to embark on the bold vision for solar energy and clean energy that Prime Minister Modi has laid out can be accomplished. And the agreements and memoranda that we reached, I think, reflect the seriousness with which both of us take the climate change issue.\nWe discussed, in addition, the progress that we've made around civil nuclear energy. And I indicated our support for India becoming part of the Nuclear Suppliers Group, the abilities for technologies that are critical to India's development and prosperity being available. And we also discussed in that same context our important work together around the nonproliferation of nuclear materials and technologies that could end up falling into the wrong hands. And I very much appreciated the Prime Minister's very effective interventions and participation in our Nuclear Security Summit.\nOf course, a key priority for both of us is how to promote economic prosperity and opportunity and poverty alleviation for our people. And we continued to discuss a wide range of areas where we can cooperate more effectively in order to promote jobs, to promote investment, to promote trade, and to promote greater opportunities for our people—particularly young people—in both of our countries.\nAnd—I'm sorry.\n[At this point, the interpreter continued her translation of President Obama's remarks into Hindi.]\nAnd we discussed both towards the end of our meeting, as well as—and intend to discuss during our lunch meeting important regional and security issues, because India and the United States have a shared vision of peace, of democracy, of countries resolving conflicts diplomatically rather than through war. And when we work together on the international stage, we can make significant progress not only on traditional security challenges, but also new security challenges like cybersecurity that are going to be increasingly important in the 21st century.\nSo again, I want to thank my friend Prime Minister Modi for his leadership. I know that whenever he visits, it is a source of great pride and excitement not only for the people of India, but the remarkable Indian American community here in the United States that are a symbol and a testament of the deep bonds of friendship and family that exist between our two countries.\nPrime Minister Modi. I, too, would like to thank my very close friend, President Obama, for this meeting today. We are meeting once again. And I'm also grateful to the Congress of the United States for inviting me and giving me the opportunity to address them tomorrow.\nWe've had a discussion on a range of issues, and I think it's not just the diplomatic strength of these discussions, but also the friendliness, the strength that comes out of that that is very important.\nOf course, India and the United States have been working together, and we will continue to do so. But what we have seen over the last 2 years is that India and the United States have been cooperating on issues that are of global concern. And we've been working shoulder to shoulder to achieve results that are of benefit to the entire world. Whether we're talking about nuclear security, global warming, the concerns of terrorism, the Paris Agreement—the initiative that was taken there—we have been working shoulder to shoulder. And I feel proud that we are not just two friends and two countries that are working together, we are proud of the leadership role that we have taken on, and we will continue to do so.\nToday we've had a discussion, as I said, on a range of issues. We've spoken about taking our economic relationship to new heights. We've talked about technical support. We have spoken about the energy sector, about funding—financing for clean energy. We've spoken about cybersecurity and the fact that India also leads a role as far as the Internet is concerned. So these are all a range of issues that we've had very good discussions on.\nIndia is a young country. We have a population of 800 million who are below 35 years of age. And in fact, the United States is well aware of the talent that India has. We and the United States can work together to bring forward this talent and use it for the benefit of mankind, to use it for the benefit of innovations, and to use it to achieve new progress and touch new heights. We will continue to do so in future too.\nIndia has made a name for itself as the fastest growing economy in the world. And India and the United States also are the world's biggest democracies. Both countries need to widen their cooperation, the scope of their cooperation, and find new areas to cooperate in that would assist in finding solutions for the world—for also for the developing nations of the world. We will meet again at the G-20 summit. And by that time, I expect that we would have moved forward on several issues. Climate justice is also an issue that we will be taking up.\nAnd we also have the MTCR; we have the Nuclear Suppliers Group. And the help and support that my friend President Obama has extended is something that I will always cherish and remember. Once again, I'd like to thank you very much.", "timestamp": "2016-06-07", "title": "Remarks Following a Meeting With Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India"}

Marking their third major bilateral summit, the leaders reviewed the deepening strategic partnership between the United States and India that is rooted in shared values of freedom, democracy, universal human rights, tolerance and pluralism, equal opportunities for all citizens, and rule of law. They pledged to pursue new opportunities to bolster economic growth and sustainable development, promote peace and security at home and around the world, strengthen inclusive, democratic governance and respect for universal human rights, and provide global leadership on issues of shared interest.\n2) The leaders welcomed the significant progress made in bilateral relations between India and the United States during their tenure, in accordance with the roadmaps set out in the Joint Statements issued during Prime Minister Modi's visit to the United States in September 2014 and President Obama's visit to India in January 2015. The leaders affirmed the increasing convergence in their strategic perspectives and emphasized the need to remain closely invested in each other's security and prosperity.\nAdvancing U.S.-India Global Leadership on Climate and Clean Energy\n3) The steps that the two Governments have taken in the last two years through the U.S.-India Contact Group, including by addressing the nuclear liability issue, inter alia, through India's ratification of the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage, have laid a strong foundation for a long-term partnership between U.S. and Indian companies for building nuclear power plants in India. Culminating a decade of partnership on civil nuclear issues, the leaders welcomed the start of preparatory work on site in India for six AP 1000 reactors to be built by Westinghouse and noted the intention of India and the U.S. Export-Import Bank to work together toward a competitive financing package for the project. Once completed, the project would be among the largest of its kind, fulfilling the promise of the U.S.-India civil nuclear agreement and demonstrating a shared commitment to meet India's growing energy needs while reducing reliance on fossil fuels. Both sides welcomed the announcement by the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd, and Westinghouse that engineering and site design work will begin immediately and the two sides will work toward finalizing the contractual arrangements by June 2017.\n4) The United States and India share common climate and clean energy interests and are close partners in the fight against climate change. Leadership from both countries helped galvanize global action to combat climate change and culminated in the historic Paris Agreement reached last December. Both countries are committed to working together and with others to promote full implementation of the Paris Agreement to address the urgent threats posed by climate change. India and the United States recognize the urgency of climate change and share the goal of enabling entry into force of the Paris Agreement as early as possible. The United States reaffirms its commitment to join the Agreement as soon as possible this year. India similarly has begun its processes to work toward this shared objective. The leaders reiterated their commitment to pursue low greenhouse gas emission development strategies in the pre-2020 period and to develop long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies.

They have committed to continue dialogue and engagement in Internet governance fora, including in ICANN, IGF and other venues, and to support active participation by all stakeholders of the two countries in these fora. The leaders committed to promote stability in cyberspace based on the applicability of international law including the United Nations Charter, the promotion of voluntary norms of responsible state behavior during peacetime, and the development and implementation of practical confidence building measures between states.\n22) In this context, they affirmed their commitment to the voluntary norms that no country should conduct or knowingly support online activity that intentionally damages critical infrastructure or otherwise impairs the use of it to provide services to the public; that no country should conduct or knowingly support activity intended to prevent national computer security incident response teams from responding to cyber incidents, or use its own teams to enable online activity that is intended to do harm; that every country should cooperate, consistent with its domestic law and international obligations, with requests for assistance from other states in mitigating malicious cyber activity emanating from its territory; and that no country should conduct or knowingly support ICT-enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential business information, with the intent of providing competitive advantages to its companies or commercial sectors.\nStanding Together Against Terrorism and Violent Extremism\n23) The leaders acknowledged the continued threat posed to human civilization by terrorism and condemn the recent terrorist incidents from Paris to Pathankot, from Brussels to Kabul. They resolved to redouble their efforts, bilaterally and with other like-minded countries, to bring to justice the perpetrators of terrorism anywhere in the world and the infrastructure that supports them.\n24) Building on the January 2015 U.S.-India Joint Statement commitment to make the U.S.-India partnership a defining counterterrorism relationship for the 21st Century, as well as the September 2015 U.S.-India Joint Declaration on Combatting Terrorism, the leaders announced further steps to deepen collaboration against the full spectrum of terrorist threats.\n25) The leaders committed to strengthen cooperation against terrorist threats from extremist groups, such as Al-Qa'ida, Da'esh/ISIL, Jaish-e Mohammad, Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, D Company and their affiliates, including through deepened collaboration on UN terrorist designations. In this context, they directed their officials to identify specific new areas of collaboration at the next meeting of U.S.-India Counterterrorism Joint Working Group.\n26) Recognizing an important milestone in the U.S.-India counterterrorism partnership, the leaders applauded the finalization of an arrangement to facilitate the sharing of terrorist screening information. They also called for Pakistan to bring the perpetrators of the 2008 Mumbai and 2016 Pathankot terrorist attacks to justice.\n27) The leaders affirmed their support for a UN Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism that advances and strengthens the framework for global cooperation and reinforces that no cause or grievance justifies terrorism.\nBolstering Economic and Trade Ties\n28) The leaders highlighted the strong and expanding economic relationship between the United States and India and committed to support sustainable, inclusive, and robust economic growth, and common efforts to stimulate consumer demand, job creation, skill development and innovation in their respective countries.\n29) In order to substantially increase bilateral trade, they pledged to explore new opportunities to break down barriers to the movement of goods and services, and support deeper integration into global supply chains, thereby creating jobs and generating prosperity in both economies. They look forward to the second annual Strategic and Commercial Dialogue in India later this year to identify concrete steps in this regard. They also commended the increased engagement on trade and investment issues under the Trade Policy Forum (TPF) and encouraged substantive results for the next TPF later this year. They welcomed the engagement of U.S. private sector companies in India's Smart City program.\n30) The leaders applauded the strong bonds of friendship between the 1.5 billion peoples of India and the United States that have provided a solid foundation for a flourishing bilateral partnership, noting that two-way travel for tourism, business, and education has seen unprecedented growth, including more than one million travelers from India to the United States in 2015, and similar number from the United States to India. The leaders resolved to facilitate greater movement of professionals, investors and business travelers, students, and exchange visitors between their countries to enhance people-to-people contact as well as their economic and technological partnership. To this end, they welcomed the signing of an MOU for Development of an International Expedited Traveler Initiative (also known as the Global Entry Program) and resolved to complete within the next three months the procedures for India's entry into the Global Entry Program.\n31) The leaders recognized the fruitful exchanges in August 2015 and June 2016 on the elements required in both countries to pursue a U.S.-India Totalization Agreement and resolved to continue discussions later this year.\n32) Recognizing the importance of fostering an enabling environment for innovation and empowering entrepreneurs, the United States welcomes India's hosting of the 2017 Global Entrepreneurship Summit.\n33) The leaders welcomed the enhanced engagement on intellectual property rights under the High Level Working Group on Intellectual Property and reaffirmed their commitment to use this dialogue to continue to make concrete progress on IPR issues by working to enhance bilateral cooperation among the drivers of innovation and creativity in both countries.\n34) The United States welcomes India's interest in joining the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, as India is a dynamic part of the Asian economy.\nExpanding Cooperation: Science & Technology and Health\n35) The leaders affirmed their nations' mutual support in exploring the most fundamental principles of science as embodied in the arrangement reached to cooperate on building a Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) in India in the near future and welcomed the formation of the India-U.S. Joint Oversight Group to facilitate agency coordination of funding and oversight of the project.\n36) The leaders look forward to India's participation at the September 2016 Our Ocean Conference in Washington, D.C. as well as holding of the first India-U.S. Oceans Dialogue later this year, to strengthen cooperation in marine science, ocean energy, managing and protecting ocean biodiversity, marine pollution, and sustainable use of ocean resources.\n37) The leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the Global Health Security Agenda and the timely implementation of its objectives. The Prime Minister noted India's role on the Steering Group and its leadership in the areas of anti-microbial resistance and immunization. The President noted the United States' commitment to support, undergo, and share a Joint External Evaluation in collaboration with the World Health Organization.\n38) The leaders recognized the global threat posed by multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and committed to continue collaboration in the area of tuberculosis and to share respective best practices.\n39) The leaders noted the growing threat of non-communicable diseases and the urgent need to address the risk factors by, inter alia, promoting healthy lifestyles, controlling sugar and salt intake, promoting physical activity especially among children and youth and strengthening efforts to curb tobacco use. The leaders also reiterated the importance of holistic approaches to health and wellness, and of promoting the potential benefits of holistic approaches by synergizing modern and traditional systems of medicine, including Yoga.\n40) The leaders strongly endorsed expansion of the Indo-U.S. Vaccine Action Program, which is fostering public-private research partnerships focused on the development and evaluation of vaccines to prevent tuberculosis, dengue, chikungunya and other globally important infectious diseases.\nGlobal Leadership\n41) The leaders reaffirmed their resolve to continue working together as well as with the wider international community to augment the capacity of the United Nations to more effectively address the global development and security challenges. With the historic adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in September 2015, and recognizing its universality, the leaders reaffirmed their commitment to implement this ambitious agenda domestically and internationally and work in a collaborative partnership for the effective achievement of Sustainable Development Goals.\n42) The leaders reaffirmed their support for a reformed UN Security Council with India as a permanent member. Both sides committed to ensuring that the Security Council continues to play an effective role in maintaining international peace and security as envisioned in the UN Charter. The leaders are committed to continued engagement on Security Council reform in the UN Intergovernmental Negotiations (IGN) on Security Council Reform.\n43) The leaders welcomed the successful convening of the Leaders' Summit on UN Peacekeeping and committed to deepening engagement on UN peacekeeping capacity-building efforts in third countries, through co-organizing the first UN Peacekeeping Course for African Partners in New Delhi later this year for participants from ten countries in Africa. The leaders also reiterated their support for ongoing reform efforts to strengthen UN peacekeeping operations.\n44) Building on their respective bilateral engagements with Africa, such as the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit and India-Africa Forum Summit, the leaders reflected that the United States and India share a common interest in working with partners in Africa to promote prosperity and security across the continent. The leaders welcomed trilateral cooperation with African partners, including in areas such as agriculture, health, energy, women's empowerment and sanitation under the Statement of Guiding Principles on Triangular Cooperation for Global Development. They looked forward to opportunities to deepen the U.S.-India global development cooperation in Africa, as well as in Asia and beyond.\nBuilding People-to-People Ties\n45) Both sides committed to open additional consulates in each other's country. India will be opening a new consulate in Seattle and the United States will open a new consulate at a mutually agreed location in India.\n46) The leaders announced that the United States and India will be Travel and Tourism Partner Countries for 2017, and committed to facilitate visas for each other's nationals.\n47) Reflecting on the strong educational and cultural bonds between the two countries, the leaders welcomed the growing number of Indian students studying in the United States, which increased by 29 percent to nearly 133,000 students in 2014-2015, and looked forward to increased opportunities for American students to study in India. The leaders also appreciated their governments' joint efforts through the Fulbright-Kalam Climate Fellowship to develop a cohort of climate scientists to confront the shared challenge of global climate change.\n48) Recognizing its mutual goal of strengthening greater people-to-people ties, the leaders intend to renew efforts to intensify dialogue to address issues affecting the citizens of both countries that arise due to differences in the approaches of legal systems, including issues relating to cross-country marriage, divorce and child custody.\n49) Prime Minister Modi welcomed the United States' repatriation of antiquities to India. The leaders also committed to redouble their efforts to combat the theft and trafficking of cultural objects.\n50) Prime Minister Modi thanked President Obama for his gracious invitation and warmth of hospitality.

Good evening.\nAudience members. Good evening.\nThe President. We are here to celebrate the life of our dear friend Cassandra, a warrior for social justice, a warm and generous servant who devoted her life to bettering the lives of others, and an unbelievable friend.\nI first met Cassandra in a place that tends to stoke one's passions for social and economic justice: the financial aid line at law school. [Laughter] We were just entering Harvard Law. We happened to be next to each other in line, I think it was in Pound Hall, and we were furiously filling out our financial aid forms. I have no doubt I was doing something wrong. She may have looked over my shoulder and said, \"I think that's wrong.\" [Laughter] And we were inching forward each time the registrar shouted, \"Next!\" We introduced ourselves to each other, and we bonded over the fact that we were signing our lives away to Harvard, fully aware of how long it would take us to pay off that debt that we were about to accrue.\nAnd then, we bonded over other things. We bonded over our love for jazz. We bonded over our fandom of Michael Jordan, because she was a Tar Heel and I was a Bull. We talked about our early beginnings in civic engagement, protesting apartheid, her at North Carolina and me at Occidental. And we talked about our interest in the law, why we were there: the notion that we might somehow take this knowledge that we were going to extract from this place an apply it to help those on society's margins to improve their circumstances.\nI made a lot of great friends at Harvard. Some of them are here today, like Judge Wilkins, who was older and cooler than I was at the time and still is. [Laughter] I don't know about older, but maybe still cooler. But Cassandra I relied on. I relied on her for counsel and for encouragement. I have a confession to make: I still possess some albums of hers. [Laughter] I think there's a Miles Davis album, a John Coltrane album. I've been listening to some of that music since she passed. In my defense, she kept one of my constitutional law books. [Laughter] But I think I got the better end of that trade. [Laughter]\nAnd that was true generally with Cassandra. Those who knew her, I think, understood that somehow, we were getting the better end of that trade.\nIn law school, we'd sit around and dream about how we were going to take what we learned in those halls and we'd go change the world. And while we separated for a time after graduation—her coming to Washington, me heading back to Chicago—we stayed in touch. I kept up with her while she was working in Congress and at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. I talked to her about the work I was doing as a civil rights attorney and a professor, and I told her about Michelle and all the hopes and dreams that we had together. And in a lot of ways, she served as a moral compass for me. She was a constant, steady presence.\nAnd when I arrived here in Washington after winning my Senate race, I was 99th in seniority. But I did have a secret weapon, and that was, I knew Cassandra. [Laughter] So I asked her for some advice, and she, of course, went farther than that, helping me to hire a smart, dedicated team, helping me to get a conversation going with Pete Rouse, who had been the chief of staff for Tom Daschle and who had no reason to want to deal with somebody who was 99th in seniority. But somehow, she persuaded him to take a meeting with me, and as a consequence, we were able to put together this remarkable team of people, many of whom still work with me today.\nShe helped me to plan what I might accomplish on behalf of the people of Illinois. And then, because I thought that she didn't have enough to do, I'd send her early chapters of a book I was writing at 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning just to see what she thought. And we'd try to have dinner at least once a month, just to keep each other grounded, mainly for her to keep me grounded, because she didn't need help on that front.\nI didn't know then that I'd run for President just a few short years later. But when I did, I knew that I needed her help. She was one of my most valuable utility players. She was like a Swiss Army knife: Whatever you needed, you could find. Smart enough to do just about any project, thoughtful enough to help others step in, finding those who might add to our collective efforts.\nShe was essential in the first days of my administration. Working with Greg Craig and others, she helped to stock our Justice Department with bright, dedicated attorneys. She meticulously crafted our earliest policies so that all who work in the White House hold ourselves to the highest of ethical standards as keepers of the public trust.\nIn fact, my first Executive orders, which she helped design, reflected both of our views that public service is a privilege, that it's not about advancing yourself or your friends or your clients or your donors or some ideological agenda, it's about advancing the interests of every single American: the pay freeze for senior staff, which made us very popular; the toughest lobbying ban in history; an ethics briefing on what's required of all of us to make sure that we're putting the people's interests above our own, a briefing, by the way, that I was the first person to receive. Each of those policies bore her touch.\nAnd later, as my Deputy Counsel, Cassandra helped to oversee a range of areas, among them the vetting and selection of judicial nominees. And she did that pretty good, because she got one of the finest judges to agree to undergo a difficult process and become an outstanding Supreme Court justice.\nBut her most lasting impact, at least in my administration, was just being who she was.\nEvery senior White House appointee in those first days—every single one—had to meet personally with Cassandra. Every single one. That's how much trust I had in her, in her integrity, in her judgment, in her feel for people. She was the person I trusted to ensure that everybody we hired understood the values of this administration and approached their jobs with the kind of professionalism and decency and integrity expected of anyone fortunate enough to serve their country at the highest level.\nShe knew I wanted the best and the brightest, people with the same kind of high-minded idealism that she and I had talked about late into the night all those years before in law school, what we had imagined might be possible: that politics and government could be different; that this country could be better; that justice could be served, that it wasn't a pipe dream, that it wasn't something in the past, that it was something that could actually be achieved.\nWhat better person to impart that message than Cassandra. What better person to impart upon each of us the notion that there's something bigger than ourselves and that when you give to others and you serve others and you do right by others, that that's what fills you up, that's what makes your life count.\nCassandra was one of those rare people you never wanted to disappoint, not because she was judgmental; she, in fact, was infinitely patient and forgiving of people's foibles. And she used that big, wonderful, deep laugh of hers to make you feel like, yes, everybody is going to make mistakes and everybody is going to screw up. So it wasn't because she was judgmental, it was because you felt somehow that she knew your best self, the person you couldn't always claim to be, but the person you hoped to be. She saw that in you. And I know she made me better, and I believe she made us better.\nAnd if you've spoken to anybody who knew her well over these past several days or any of the innumerable people that she took the time to mentor, you'll hear the same qualities that we were looking for in those early days of the administration applied to her in spades: professionalism, decency, integrity, insight, smarts, humor, and a fundamental kindness. She was a kind person. You know, it's interesting, as you get older, it turns out, kindness counts for a lot.\nIt's been brought to my attention that, in her final months, Cassandra was working on a passion project: not fine-tuning the sports cars she loved to drive—[laughter]—but rather, funding scholarships for underprivileged high school kids who want to go to college to study the arts. And that came as no surprise. That's the kind of thing she'd do.\nAs a society, we have an unfortunate tendency to celebrate the people we love only once they are gone. So it is a testament to Cassandra, to the life that she lived and shared with us, that so many people celebrated her while she was still here. I do wish I had seen her more this past year. I know she would forgive me and smile and comfort me and tell me not to feel too guilty. Because that's who she was.\nAnd I'd like to close my remarks on that note, by paraphrasing something that's stayed with me from a piece I read about her last week. It concluded by saying that Cassandra is survived by her mother, who lives in North Carolina; by her father, who lives in New York; by her sister, her brother-in-law, and her nephews, who she was so proud of, who live in Maryland; and her friends, who live everywhere. Her friends who live everywhere. How true that is.\nShe was my friend. She was as true a person as I ever met. I loved her dearly, and I will miss her badly.\nWe pray that the Lord grants our sister, Cassandra, eternal peace. May He bless her memory. May He bless her family and the lives of everyone that she touched.", "timestamp": "2016-06-07", "title": "Eulogy at the Funeral Service for Former Deputy White House Counsel Cassandra Q. Butts"}

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117656", "text": "Aboard Air Force One\nEn Route New York, New York\n2:58 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Hello, everybody. Are we ready to get started? I do not have anything at the top, so we can go straight to your questions.\nQ: Any endorsement today?\nMR. EARNEST: I do not anticipate any formal announcement of an endorsement in the presidential race from the President in advance of his meeting with Senator Sanders tomorrow, to be sure. That certainly would include the conversation that the President expects to have with Mr. Fallon tonight.\nQ: Why did you use the word \"formal\" when you said that just now?\nMR. EARNEST: Well -- that's perceptive of you. I'm just trying to be as specific as possible. And obviously in the readout that we put out late last night, the President had an opportunity to have a conversation with both Democratic candidates for President, and one of those calls was a congratulatory call, as we know from the readout. And for months now, we've been saying that the President will support the Democratic nominee for President. So just trying to be as specific as possible about the fact that I would not expect any sort of expression of, or formal announcement of an endorsement at any time in advance of the President's meeting with Senator Sanders tomorrow.\nQ: At this point, does the President think it's appropriate that Senator Sanders concede the race and stop seeking the nomination for the party?\nMR. EARNEST: At this point, the President believes that Senator Sanders has more than earned the right to make his own decision about the course of his campaign. And the President is certainly respectful of that, both because he has observed the way that Senator Sanders has succeeded in inspiring millions of Americans in support of his agenda, but the President also comes at this from a unique perspective, having run his own campaign for the presidency. And the President certainly understands the emotions and personal investment that's required to mount a campaign. So the President is respectful of that personal investment.\nAnd again, when you have performed as well as Senator Sanders has -- he certainly exceeded everybody's expectations, possibly even his own, in terms of the support and enthusiasm that he would generate all across the country. He's earned the opportunity to make these decisions based on his own thinking and based on his own schedule.\nQ: Josh, just to put a fine point on it, does the President and the White House see Hillary Clinton as the presumptive Democratic nominee for the presidential race?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, for now I think we've been quite clear about the President's intent to support the Democratic nominee. But we obviously are getting very close to the end of the nomination process, but I don't anticipate having a whole lot more to say about this in advance of President Obama's meeting with Senator Sanders tomorrow.\nThat meeting, by the way, will take place at 11:15 a.m. tomorrow at the White House.\nQ: What does the President want to say to Senator Sanders in that meeting?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, I don't have a whole lot of the meeting to preview. I think what is fair is I think the President certainly wants to congratulate Senator Sanders on a remarkably successful campaign. He succeeded in energizing not just millions of Americans all across the country -- Democrats and independents -- but also in empowering a new generation of political activists.\nYou all have heard the President talk a lot about the importance of engaging the next generation of Americans in our political process and how our country will be stronger because of that. And that certainly is one important part of Senator Sanders's many accomplishments.\nI think the President will also convey his appreciation for the kind of agenda that Senator Sanders has run on. Senator Sanders has been dogged in advocating for addressing issues like persistent economic inequality in the United States. Senator Sanders has spoken passionately about the need to counter the influence of special interests in our politics, particularly when it comes to money from special interests in our politics. And Senator Sanders has also been outspoken on a whole host of other issues -- things like immigration reform, and protecting the right of every American to have access to quality, affordable health insurance, the need to close loopholes -- tax loopholes that only benefit the wealthy and well-connected. All these issues sound familiar to you because you've heard the President spend the better part of eight years talking about them.\nSo what's also true of Senator Sanders is that he didn't just start talking about these issues when he announced that he was running for President last summer. These are values and priorities that have been the focus of Senator Sanders's career in public service for decades. And his advocacy is important. And I think they'll have a conversation in the Oval Office tomorrow about how Senator Sanders can build on the progress that he has made in bringing attention to those issues and ensuring that the next President of the United States shares those priorities.\nQ: Last night, Donald Trump made a very specific appeal to Sanders supporters and invited them into his tent -- particularly on issues like trade. And I'm wondering how concerned the White House is about that, how concerned the President is that a portion of Sanders supporters will go to Trump because of concerns they share.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think there will be an opportunity to have a very robust debate in the fall between the presumptive Republican nominee and the Democratic nominee. And we certainly would expect that voters across the country, regardless of who they voted for, regardless in which party primary they voted for, will be listening closely to the agenda that's put forward by both candidates.\nAnd I will say that one of the reasons the President believes it's important for Senator Sanders to remain engaged in this debate is that the kind of support that he built for his campaign is not something anybody should take for granted. It's not easy to build a nationwide political movement that earns millions of votes in primaries and caucuses in 50 states. That is a significant undertaking and a significant accomplishment. And no one should take that work for granted, and the President and the Democratic Party certainly doesn't take the support of those millions of Americans for granted in the general election.\nAnd I will say that I do feel strongly that the -- and the President feels strongly -- that the Democratic candidate will have a very strong case to make about why the Democratic candidate has earned the support of those voters as well.\nQ: So just to be clear, is the President waiting for Sanders to get out of the race before he makes his formal endorsement you've mentioned?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I don't have any update on the timing of a presidential announcement of any sort of formal endorsement.\nQ: Wouldn't that show some respect for this message and accomplishment you're talking about?\nMR. EARNEST: The President certainly deeply respects what Senator Sanders has accomplished, and that's why I would not anticipate any sort of formal announcement from the President in advance of his conversation with Senator Sanders tomorrow.\nQ: And will we see the two of them together at all tomorrow? Do they plan to make any statement or spray during this?\nMR. EARNEST: We are aware of your keen interest in covering the President's meeting with Senator Sanders. It will be a private meeting, but we're working to determine if there's a way to give you a sense of their interaction.\nQ: And can you say any more about how the President watched returns last night? Did he or maybe the First Lady together watch Hillary Clinton's speech? Or can you give us any readout on how that went?\nMR. EARNEST: I did not have a chance to ask him about that, so let me check on that and I'll see if I can get you the details. He obviously read a lot of the coverage today. And we were talking on the helicopter about the powerful speech that Secretary Clinton delivered last night. And it was a historic moment, and the President --\nQ: He was talking about that on the helicopter? The President was talking about what a historic moment it was?\nQ: Can you describe that in a little more detail, what he was struck by? How he viewed that speech?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I think the President was struck by the historic nature of last night's speech. And I think that's mostly it.\nLook, I think others have made this observation that regardless of which candidate you intend to support in the fall, the fact that we've got a woman who is leading, who has been nominated by a major party as a candidate for President of the United States is a history-making moment. And she rose to the occasion of that moment in delivering a powerful speech last night.\nQ: The primary went on as long as 2008, and in the end, the vote and the delegate margins were more substantial. Does the President think that the concerns about party unity are overblown? How worried do you detect that he is about that?\nMR. EARNEST: You guys have heard the President address this. While there are obvious stylistic differences between the two Democratic candidates for President, what's also obvious is that their values and priorities overlap almost completely; that when you hear Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders talk on the stump, they spend a lot of time talking about the middle class, they spend a lot of time talking about the importance of addressing climate change, bringing about immigration reform, ensuring access to quality, affordable health insurance, certainly countering the influence of special interests money in our politics.\nThese are things that both candidates talk about. These are priorities that both candidates have dedicated their career to fighting for. We don't see the same kind of unanimity around an agenda on the other side. And so the President is certainly optimistic that the party will be united headed into the general election, and I think the President will have something to say about that himself as well.\nQ: Does the President believe that there are people who are holding out for Bernie Sanders, who don't want him to quit or don't want Hillary Clinton to be the nominee -- that the President can convince them to support the person that he believes has won the nomination and whom he clearly supports?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think -- let me answer that question two different ways. The first is that it is an objective fact that in states all across the country, that President Obama's approval rating among Democrats is higher than anybody else's; the same applies to independents, by the way. And that means that the President will be a particularly influential advocate for the Democratic nominee in the general election.\nAnd so, yes, I would expect that would have some influence on those who supported Senator Sanders in the primary, but I also suspect that Senator Sanders is going to have something to say about this as well. And he certainly has succeeded, as I mentioned earlier, in energizing and engaging millions of Americans across the country, and he will have something important to say about who the next President should be and ensuring that the next President is somebody who shares the kinds of values that Senator Sanders has dedicated his career to fighting for.\nQ: He's a two-term President. Does he see himself as a part of the Democratic establishment? There's been a lot of talk about Democratic establishment versus Sanders supporters.\nMR. EARNEST: Look, when you are the President of the United States and you're vested with that kind of authority, it's hard to deny that you don't wield some institutional influence. The President certainly does.\nBut I think what's important about that is the President has gone to great lengths to make sure that he stays in close touch with his supporters all across the country. The notion of the establishment has a connotation that these are people in power and that they're somehow walled off from everybody else. The President does not see himself that way. The President sees himself as somebody who has remained true to his roots. This is somebody who started his career as a community organizer and has always viewed the true power in our democracy as coming from the grassroots level.\nAnd even though he has spent the last seven and a half years in the highest elected office in the land, the President has worked hard to make sure that he remains in close touch with the people who elected him into this job.\nQ: So he's not worried about getting written off as a member of the establishment by the Sanders revolution types?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the President's track record and the President's reputation speaks for itself -- as somebody who, yes, wields significant influence within the party and within the country. But he's also somebody who has remained in close touch with the American people, but also with his supporters who have not been shy about making their voice heard and expressing their preferences about which direction the country should take.\nQ: Josh, is there anything else you'd say about how the President reflected on Secretary Clinton in the helicopter ride in terms of their relationship? And also, can you say anything about when he will see her in person, given that he's seeing Senator Sanders in person tomorrow?\nMR. EARNEST: Other than what I said before in terms of Secretary Clinton's success in really rising to meet an historical moment, I don't have a lot more to say about the President's reaction to her candidacy or to her speech. I don't have any updates at this point about when the two of them may get together. But we'll keep you posted.\nQ: Why meet with Sanders in person and not with Clinton in person?\nMR. EARNEST: I wouldn't rule out a future in-person meeting with Secretary Clinton.\nQ: Since the President is --\nMR. EARNEST: You kind of walked into that one, I guess, right? (Laughter.)\nQ: They will someday meet again. (Laughter.) Since the President -- you said he's so popular with Democrats and independents -- should we expect that he will become sort of an advisor to the Clinton campaign? Is he going to offer behind-the-scenes advice on how to reach out to some of these voters?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, what I would anticipate is that the future Democratic nominee I think would benefit from the advice of the person who's won the last two national presidential elections. And obviously the President has had the opportunity over the last several months to communicate with both Senator Sanders and Secretary Clinton, both on the phone and in private meetings at the White House. Just in the last month, President Obama has had the opportunity to speak to Senator Sanders three different times. And I would expect that their meeting tomorrow will be a continuation of that ongoing conversation.\nBut, look, I would expect him to have an ongoing conversation with Secretary Clinton, too. She obviously got the majority of delegates, and I think it's an indication that she's got a pretty good stable of advisors. But, look, President Obama is somebody that's got some experience with this process and is obviously cheering for the Democratic nominee.\nQ: And how many times did he speak with Secretary Clinton in the last month?\nMR. EARNEST: I did not come prepared with those statistics, but we'll see if we can get them for you.\nQ: You all made a point in the readout last night of saying that Senator Sanders requested the meeting tomorrow. Given the fact that the President has spoken to Senator Sanders more than three times, or three times in the last month, do you have a good sense of what he wants out of this meeting? And were you surprised to hear him say \"the struggle continues\" last night?\nMR. EARNEST: No. I think he discussed the continued pursuit of his campaign's priorities in the context of what he described as a gracious phone call from Secretary Clinton. So, look, I'll let Senator Sanders describe what he meant in his speech. But I think all of you noticed the same thing that I did about him talking about how important these priorities are to him and, frankly, how concerned he is about making sure that President Obama is succeeded by somebody who shares those values. That certainly is something that President Obama believes is a top priority.\nQ: If I could ask about one other topic -- Puerto Rico. The President met with some lawmakers to talk about Puerto Rico and said there's no plan B. Is that the White House's opinion? I mean, the elected officials in Puerto Rico don't seem to be too enthused about the plan. Some are saying that the whole idea of a control board is against the idea of a democracy, where local people elect their own leaders. Is the President comfortable with the current deal as it stands?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Toluse, you'll recall that the White House -- or you may not recall, but let me remind you that the White House first laid out some legislative proposals to try to address the situation in Puerto Rico back in October. So it has been a painstaking process to build bipartisan support in Congress for a piece of legislation that would offer authority to officials in Puerto Rico that would allow them to deal with the difficult financial situation there.\nThe President believes this is important because there are 3.5 million Americans who live in Puerto Rico, who are facing an increasingly dire situation. The public health system has suffered as a result of the financial challenges on the island. And we've got new data from the CDC indicating that the Zika virus is likely to spread broadly in Puerto Rico this summer. That's a significant concern.\nSo the President is hopeful not just that Congress will act to pass the necessary Zika funding that our public health professionals say that we need, but that Congress will act in bipartisan fashion to pass this Puerto Rico bill as well -- not because it's perfect. It's not. And you've heard me describe in the past some of the concerns we have with the bill. But the bill does meet the test of giving Puerto Rican government officials the authority that they need to deal with the financial challenges there. And it's important that they be given that authority. It's also important that they follow through on reforms that would prevent something -- a financial situation like this from emerging in the future.\nSo this is a compromise bill. The President strongly supports it. And he encourages Democrats and Republicans in the House to support it as well.\nQ: On the Stanford case, the judge in that case is starting to receive a lot of threats -- people threatening that he should die and his family should be raped. Is the White House concerned about threats like those? And have you spoken to the President any more about the Stanford sexual assault case?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't spoken to the President about this specific case. There is no excuse for threats of violence. People are certainly entitled to express their opinion, even if that includes a disagreement with a decision. But that does not justify in any way even a threat of violence.\nQ: Josh, should we expect the President to be out on the presidential campaign trail before the Democratic convention?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any updates to the President's schedule at this point, but I wouldn't rule that out.\nQ: Very quickly on TSCA, the chemical safety bill that was overhauled and has now passed the Senate and the House. The President has indicated he'd sign that. Do you have any other comments of how the White House views that bill?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, we believe that this is a rare moment of bipartisanship in Congress, and we are pleased to see that the Environmental Protection Agency has been given additional authority to ensure that we can keep our families safe. And preventing these kinds of toxic chemicals from being used in a harmful way in consumer products will make our homes and communities safer. And we obviously give Democrats and Republicans in Congress credit for working together to approve this bill. The President will sign it, and we'll let you know when he has.\nThanks, everybody.\nEND 3:22 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2016-06-08", "title": "Press Gaggle by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}

The new communities are: Albuquerque, New Mexico; Baltimore, Maryland; Cleveland, Ohio; Dallas, Texas; Detroit and Flint, Michigan; Fresno, California; Hartford, Connecticut; Indianola, Texas; Jacksonville, Florida; Kansas City, Missouri; Los Angeles, California; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Oakland, California; Orlando, Florida; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Portland, Oregon; Sacramento, California and the Pine Ridge Reservation.\nMBK Success Mentors Initiative is a groundbreaking response to the challenge of chronic student absences in our country. It aims to reduce chronic absenteeism by connecting over one million students who are or at risk of becoming chronically absent with trained school-linked caring adults and near-peers over the next 3-5 years. The initiative is the nation's first-ever effort to scale an evidence-based, data-driven mentor model to reach and support the highest risk students – using existing resources already linked to schools, and the early warning metric of chronic absenteeism to drive student success. The original ten cities that launched earlier this year include, Austin, Boston, Columbus, Denver, Miami-Dade, New York City, Philadelphia, Providence, San Antonio and Seattle. In the past five months, these 10 communities have supported more than 8,000 chronically absent students with success mentors.\nNew data from the Department of Education's Civil Rights Data Collection, which collected student absenteeism rates for the first time, revealed that 6.5 million students—13 percent of all students—were chronically absent from schools in 2013-14. Other studies show frequent absences from school can be devastating to a child's future. The effects start early and spiral dramatically over time. Children who are chronically absent in preschool, kindergarten, and first grade are much less likely to read on grade level by the third grade. Students who can't read at grade level by the third grade are four times more likely to drop out of high school. By high school, regular attendance is a better dropout indicator than test scores. A student who is chronically absent in any year between the eighth and twelfth grade is seven times more likely to drop out of school.\nSTATE Bags, a buy one give one backpack brand, is announcing that it will donate 30,000 backpacks in the 30 MBK Success Mentors communities – and in partnership with Roc Nation – will engage artists and athletes in raising awareness of the importance of school attendance. These events will be led by child development specialists who have successfully risen from at-risk neighborhoods themselves, and serve as role model figures to the children served. For every STATE bag purchased from June 8 to September 8, one bag will be donated to students participating in the MBK Success Mentors initiative in the 30 communities.\nToday, more than 200 leaders from the 30 MBK Success Mentors Cities will gather at the White House for a national training summit to prepare Success Mentor \"Ground Troops\" for the start of the school year. The summit participants will receive training in identifying and supporting students who are, or are at risk of becoming, chronically absent from school – to help them succeed. U.S. Secretary of Education John B. King, Jr., Kevin Durant, Pierre Garзon and STATE Bags' Co-Founder, Scot Tatelman, will speak about the importance of mentorships that drive success in school and life. Durant also will announce that the MBK Success Mentors community that is the most successful in reducing student absenteeism over the next year will be the next location to benefit from the Kevin Durant Charity Foundation's \"Build It and They Will Ball\" Courts Renovation Initiative.\nThe Extent of Chronic Absenteeism:\nChronic absenteeism, or missing at least ten percent of school days in the school year, or a month or more of school, excused or unexcused, is a leading cause of low achievement and a powerful predictor of which students will eventually drop out of school. These rates are highest in our low-income communities, where school offers the best opportunity out of poverty. Civil Rights Data Collection data released this week demonstrates the extent of the chronic student absenteeism challenge in our nation. The data show that 6.5 million students – 13 percent of all students – miss almost a month or more of school each year.\n*  More than 3 million high school students – or 18% of all high school students – are chronically absent.\no      20% or more of American Indian or Alaska Native (26%), Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander (25%), black (22%), multiracial (21%), and Latino (20%) high school students are chronically absent.\no      High school students with disabilities served by IDEA are 1.3 times as likely to be chronically absent as high school students without disabilities.\no      20% of all English learner high school students are chronically absent.\n*  More than 3.5 million elementary school students – or 11% of all elementary school students – are chronically absent.\no      American Indian or Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander elementary school students are twice as likely to be chronically absent as white elementary school students.\no      Black elementary school students are 1.4 times as likely to be chronically absent as white elementary school students.\no      Elementary school students with disabilities served by IDEA are 1.5 times as likely to be chronically absent as elementary school students without disabilities.\nThe MBK Success Mentors Model:\nMBK Success Mentors is the nation's first-ever effort to scale an evidence-based, data-driven mentor model to reach and support the highest risk students. Mentors receive training to serve as motivators, problem solvers, connectors, and advocates, and help them form supportive relationships, identify and celebrate student's strengths, promote their attendance every day, and connect them with the necessary supports to keep them on track and thriving. Mentors are typically assigned 3-5 students as mentees, and meet with students 3 times per week in school all year.\nIn the past five months, the original ten cities that launched the initiative have supported more than 8,000 chronically absent students with success mentors.\nThe MBK Success Mentor Partners:\nMBK Success Mentors builds on theEvery Student, Every Day interagency campaign to eliminate chronic absenteeism as part of the mandate of the President's My Brother's Keeper taskforce.\nThe effort also includes a national Ad Council parent engagement campaign to elevate the conversation about the devastating impact of chronic absenteeism, specifically targeting parents of K-8th grade students. It is currently being rolled out on billboards, bus kiosks, and social media nationwide to alert parents about the devastating impact of missing just 2 days a month of school, which totals a month of school missed.\nThis MBK Success Mentors model is supported by a public-private network which includes the following key U.S. Department of Education collaborators: Dr. Robert Balfanz of Johns Hopkins University's Everyone Graduates Center, the Ad Council, the Arnold Foundation, Attendance Works, the Center for Supportive Schools, City Year, the Corporation for National and Community Service, MENTOR: The National Mentoring Partnership, United Way, the Mott Foundation, Roc Nation, STATE Bags, and Viacom's Get Schooled.\nAbout My Brother's Keeper:\nPresident Obama launched My Brother's Keeper in February of 2014 to address persistent opportunity gaps faced by boys and young men of color and ensure that all young people can reach their full potential. In response to the President's call to action, nearly 250 communities in all 50 states have accepted the President's My Brother's Keeper Community Challenge; more than $600 million in private sector and philanthropic grants and in-kind resources and $1 billion in low-interest financing have been committed in alignment with MBK; and new federal policy initiatives, grant programs, and guidance are being implemented to ensure that every child has a clear pathway to success from cradle to college and career.", "timestamp": "2016-06-08", "title": "Fact Sheet: New Cities Join My Brother's Keeper Success Mentors Initiative to Combat Chronic Student Absences and Drive School and Life Success"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "The President spoke at 8:57 p.m. at the residence of Kenneth Lerer and Katherine Sailer. In his remarks, he referred to Sen. Bernard Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, in their capacity as Democratic Presidential candidates. Audio was not available for verification of the content of these remarks.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117908", "text": "First of all, I know that was much better than Ken would have done. [Laughter] So I want to thank Ken and Katherine and their amazing family for opening up this great space. It is wonderful to see all of you.\nA couple other people I want to acknowledge. First of all, the DNC finance chair, Henry Muñoz. Where is he? He's back here somewhere. There's Henry. Henry has a pretty thankless job, but he does it with good humor and grace, and so we're really appreciative of him.\nAnd you have an outstanding Member of Congress here who is on the right side of issues, is smart, is tough, but most importantly, is courageous and is willing to stand up for what he thinks is right even when it's hard, whether it's voting against the Iraq war when that was a really hard thing to do, to supporting us getting nuclear weapons out of Iran without firing a shot, which was also a hard thing to do. So I just want everybody to please show some appreciation for Jerry Nadler.\nSo this has been an interesting election season. [Laughter] Not exactly what we expected. And yet I am both incredibly encouraged and concerned and determined. I'm incredibly encouraged because after having been President for 7½ years under as tough a set of circumstances as we've seen in recent memory—the worst financial crisis in our lifetimes, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, challenges from terrorism, the growing menace of climate change—despite all those things, I have seen the American people respond and seen the resilience and the basic decency and goodness of this country in all kinds of ways, in all parts of the country.\nI do a lot of commencements around this time of year—which I love doing, although my older daughter is graduating this week and I will not be able to handle that well. [Laughter] But when it's other kids graduating, I feel joyful and I'm happy. And one of the things that I've said to the young people that I met is that despite the cynicism and the bad news and the discouragement and the rancor that they're seeing on television, or these days on their phones every day, if you had to be born at one moment in human history and you didn't know ahead of time who you were going to be or whether you were going to be rich or poor, Black or White, what nationality, you would choose now, this moment, because the world is actually healthier, better educated, less violent, more tolerant than probably any time in human history.\nI said, if you were to choose a moment in American history in which to be born, you'd choose now. Because if you think about—I was mentioning the passing of Muhammad Ali, who basically had his first fight when I was born, won the Gold Medal for our country and came back and could not eat at a restaurant in his own hometown and ended up throwing that Gold Medal into the river, and then this week you saw somebody who was probably the biggest icon in the world and one of the most beloved, who was eulogized by an African American President. You'd choose now, not 50 years ago or 70 years ago or 30 years ago.\nSo there's cause for optimism because America is resilient and it's tough and it's full of good people. And I travel around the world, and the world still—even when it's a little begrudging—they still look to us to help lead and to help shape a better future for our kids. That's the good news. The bad news is that our politics has been a little screwed up lately. And we're seeing it now most prominently in the Republican nomination process and some of the interesting exchanges we've been seeing within the Republican Party, set aside between Democrats and Republicans. And I know that that's got a lot of people worried and it's got a lot of people discouraged.\nBut what I'm here to tell you is that if we do our jobs, then this country is going to be fine. If we do what we have to do, then the majority of the American people are going to want a country in which every child gets opportunity. And the majority of Americans are going to want a country where we're taking care of the environment and passing on a sustainable planet to future generations. And the majority of people want to continue the incredible vigor and energy that's brought about by immigration in this country, as long as it's lawful. And the majority of people are going to want to make sure that every talented kid in this country can go to college and not be burdened by mountains of debt.\nThe majority of American people are going to want to invest in science and research to cure diseases and to make sure that our economy stays vibrant and innovative. And the majority of people believe in things like science and scientists. [Laughter] And so when scientists tell us that the planet is getting warmer and we need to do something about it, the majority of people think that's a good idea, let's do something about that, because we don't want Manhattan to be under water.\nAnd so the question is, how do we make sure we do our jobs. Now, we just ended—or sort of ended—our primary season. And I'm going to be meeting with Senator Sanders tomorrow. I've had conversations with both him and Hillary Clinton. And the good news is, is that although primary seasons are always tough—your supporters and staff, they start saying things, and somebody reads it, and you start getting irritated—and so you get a little bruised feelings. When you look at the issues, there's a pretty broad consensus about what it means to be a Democrat and what our values are and what we're fighting for.\nAnd so I'm not too worried about us being able to come together. I am concerned about us doing the hard nuts-and-bolts work of turning out people to vote, particularly young people, particularly low-income people who oftentimes feel forgotten and are still stressed and are still pressed. And in order for us to reach them, we're going to have to do some work. We're going to have to organize. We're going to have to do what I did in 2008 and what we did in 2012, and that is fan out and go door to door and listen, as well as talk about the issues that are at stake. We're going to have to draw sharp contrasts, but we're also going to have to model the fact that it's possible to be passionate and full of conviction and not be mean or think that there's no possibility for a compromise. We've got to get busy, and we've got to organize, and we've got to work.\nAnd the only way we do that effectively is when we have support from folks like you. Because I met one young woman who said she had worked for me as a fellow, and so is responsible for me being here as President. [Laughter] Although I am—well, I am reminded of the story about Abraham Lincoln, where back in the day you had office hours if you were President, because people didn't have phones or Twitter or what not, so if they wanted to petition your Government they'd show up in Washington. And this guy comes to see Lincoln. He says—I think he wanted a postmaster job or something—he said, sir, I work tirelessly to deliver such and such county on your behalf, and I'm the reason you're President. And Lincoln looked up, and he says, sir, I forgive you—[laughter]—what can I do for you? [Laughter]\nBut the reason I'm here is because young people like this worked and were inspired, but more importantly, they inspired others. They inspired me. And those young people are still out there, but we've got to reach them. And we've got to give them the tools they need to help make this grand experiment in self-government work.\nSo I just want everybody to really feel a conviction that this will be fine as long as we do our jobs. But it's not a given. A democracy is not self-executing. It requires us to invest in it continually and nurture it and work it, and take responsibility for it. And I can't think of a clearer moment in my lifetime where that is necessary. And I like a situation where it's in our control. I like those moments where if I do what I'm supposed to do, I can get a good outcome. And you should feel that as well. But understand it's not going to be automatic, and make sure that all of you feel the same kind of energy and passion that helped to get me elected in 2008 and 2012. And in the meantime, we've got to get our Senate back and get a Supreme Court Justice. This is going to be fun. [Laughter]\nThank you very much, everybody. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2016-06-08", "title": "Remarks at a Democratic National Committee Fundraiser in New York City"}

Brady Press Briefing Room\n**Please see correction below marked by an asterisk.\n2:24 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. I appreciate your patience on the schedule today. Obviously both Senator Sanders and Secretary Clinton had announcements they wanted to make today, and so I was doing my best to get out of their way and give them the opportunity to go first. And now I am here to answer any questions you may have about their announcements or any other topics that may be on your mind today.\nSo, Kevin, do you want to start?\nQ: Sure, Josh. Thank you. So I guess let's just start with the obvious. Could you give us a little bit of the readout of what the President and Senator Sanders talked about during that hour-long meeting? Did they make any requests of each other?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously, the President was pleased to have an opportunity to welcome Senator Sanders to the White House and congratulate him on the remarkable success that he enjoyed in the context of his Democratic -- his campaign for the Democratic nomination for President. Senator Sanders competed in every state across the country and earned more than 10 million votes for his campaign. That's a remarkable accomplishment, and the President complimented him and congratulated him on his success.\nI think you could describe the conversation as a friendly conversation that was focused on the future. Part of that future conversation was about the importance of the upcoming general election. You've heard the President say on a number of occasions how important it is to him personally that he be succeeded in office by a President who is committed to building on the remarkable progress that our country has made over the last seven and a half years. So that certainly was an important part of the conversation.\nBut it went beyond that. There also was a conversation about the long-term future of the Democratic Party. And Senator Sanders's campaign enjoyed so much success because he was able to inspire a lot of young people -- both Democrats and independents -- to support his campaign and to be engaged in the political process. That's a good thing.\nAnd President Obama and Senator Sanders had an opportunity to talk about what work they could potentially do together in the future to ensure that the Democratic Party of the 21st century is diverse and vibrant and inclusive. That's been a long-stated goal of President Obama. And obviously President Obama had his own success in building a coalition that involved a lot of young Americans -- and not all Democrats.\nSenator Sanders built on that progress, and they're hopeful that they'll be able to work together in the future, not just at the national level but also at the state and local levels, as well.\nQ: Did they make any requests of each other?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm going to do my best to protect their ability to have a private conversation. But I think what is clear is that there's a lot of agreement about the way forward. Obviously, there is a lot of agreement when it comes to the future of the Democratic Party that I just described. There's also a lot of agreement about the highest priorities that the next President will have to grapple with. And so these priorities range from issues like addressing economic inequality and countering the influence of special interests in our politics, these are obviously issues that Senator Sanders discussed quite extensively on the campaign trail. But these are also issues that President Obama has had an opportunity to address.\nAnd as you heard from Senator Sanders in the driveway a couple of hours ago, there also was a discussion about other issues like expanding economic opportunity for the middle class; making sure that we keep our commitment to our veterans; making sure that we give college graduates in this country the opportunity to succeed and not just be weighted down with extraordinary debt. So again, these are all issues that President Obama has spent the last seven years fighting for. And Senator Sanders has spent a significant amount of time talking about these issues, too -- not just in the context of his presidential campaign, but in the context of his decades in public service.\nQ: And I'm sure the President gave the Senator the courtesy of letting him know that he would be endorsing Secretary Clinton in the coming moments or hours. Could you just provide a little bit of how the President broke that to him -- I'm sure it was probably expected -- and what was the response? And is the President disappointed that Senator Sanders did not go outside of the White House, and in talking to reporters did not endorse Clinton?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me start by saying that, no. Senator Sanders I think has been quite clear that he intended to compete for votes in the upcoming District of Columbia primary that's scheduled for Tuesday. So I don't think anybody had the expectation that Senator Sanders was going to deviate from that plan.\nAt the same time, to go back to your first question, the President has had the opportunity to speak to Senator Sanders now three times in the last week. And as a result of those conversations I think it's fair to say that Senator Sanders was not at all surprised by today's announcement.\nRoberta.\nQ: Did the President show Senator Sanders the video? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I'm not going to get into the details of their interactions, but I assure you that Senator Sanders was not surprised.\nAnd, look, Senator Sanders began his statement in the driveway in front of the White House today by saying that President Obama and Vice President Biden had made a commitment to him early in the process that they would not put their thumb on the scale. And Senator Sanders himself said how much he appreciated that President Obama and Vice President Biden kept that promise.\nQ: When was the video recorded? And why was it decided that the endorsement would be done through video rather than having an event or some kind of other alternative?\nMR. EARNEST: The video was recorded on Tuesday. And I think Secretary Clinton's campaign has already announced that there will be an event, and the President is very much looking forward to traveling to Green Bay, Wisconsin, Titletown, with Secretary Clinton to appear with her in person at a campaign event and build support for her campaign in the state of Wisconsin, a state that President Obama won twice.\nQ: And does he have other plans next week to do campaign-related events for Secretary Clinton?\nMR. EARNEST: That's the only campaign event that's on the schedule at this point, but I would anticipate that it's only the first of many campaign events between now and November.\nMichelle.\nQ: You mentioned in the meeting things that the President would like to see, working together on those issues. Did Sanders also have things that he wanted to see from the White House? Or did he have any particular asks?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'll let Senator Sanders characterize the points that he raised in their meeting. And I think he did that, again, when he spoke to you a couple of hours ago. He was quite direct about his appreciation to the President for keeping his promise not to weigh in in the primary process and give Democratic voters across the country the opportunity to make a decision about who should represent our party in the general election.\nAnd Senator Sanders, I think -- again, when I spoke to the President briefly about his conversation with Senator Sanders, I think both men are pretty enthusiastic about the opportunity that lies ahead, not just in advance of the general election, but over the course of a generation to ensure that the future of the Democratic looks as diverse and vibrant and inclusive as our country is.\nQ: Did the President ask Sanders to step out of the race sooner rather than later? And did he want him to step out before the D.C. primaries?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as I mentioned yesterday when I spoke to a group of you, Senator Sanders has more than earned the right to make his own decision on his own timeframe about the future of his campaign. And the President certainly respects the important work that Senator Sanders has done on the campaign trail. He certainly respects the strong support that he's built in all 50 states. And that means that Senator Sanders gets to decide what the future of his campaign looks like.\nI'll just point out -- again, when Senator Sanders spoke to all of you after meeting with the President, Senator Sanders reiterated how critically important it is for President Obama to be succeeded by a President who shares our values and is committed to building on the progress that this country has made under President Obama's leadership. That certainly was part of the conversation in the Oval Office. And Senator Sanders, when he spoke to all of you, made clear that that was a priority.\nQ: I mean, what was the point and the outcome of this meeting? What was decided between the two of them?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I think the point was for President Obama and Senator Sanders to continue the conversation that they've been having over the course of this week. And, look, in some ways, this is a conversation that dates all the way back to January when -- or February, whenever it was that Senator Sanders was here at the White House much earlier in the campaign.\nSo again, I don't think there was any expectation either on the part of Senator Sanders or President Obama that Senator Sanders was going to make some abrupt change to his campaign strategy, which at this point has included competing in the D.C. primary that's scheduled for Tuesday.\nQ: So why release it on Twitter? And why have it come from Clinton instead of the President?\nMR. EARNEST: I think obviously it makes -- there's some intuitive decisions about why it's important to give Secretary Clinton the opportunity to make this news. Obviously, I saw some of the early comments from her campaign that she was deeply appreciative of the President's endorsement. And the President was pleased to have the opportunity to share it. But it certainly is the decision for Secretary Clinton and her team to make about how best to use this material to advance her campaign.\nQ: And speaking of Twitter, you see a lot of Sanders supporters now putting out their continued support for Sanders, many of them saying, well, it's Bernie or nobody -- it won't be Clinton. What do you think is going to be the President's best approach, now that he is going to be out on the trail in a matter of days, to winning over those people?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, first of all, it's going to be Secretary Clinton's responsibility to win over those people. And I'm confident that she will have a very forceful case to make about the values that she represents. And so I think she'll have a strong case to make, but that's ultimately a case that she will make.\nBut President Obama certainly has a lot of credibility with those voters, I think that is true. President Obama, over the course of the last seven years, has fought very hard for many of the principles and priorities that Senator Sanders has been talking about over the course of this campaign. Senator Sanders has devoted an extraordinary amount of time to making sure that Wall Street doesn't run amuck and trample on middle-class families.\nAnd I can recite you -- I'll probably spare you at least right now -- a long recitation of all of the things that President Obama has done by implementing Wall Street reform to make sure that taxpayers are not on the hook for bailing out big banks that make risky bets, and also making sure that we're focused on expanding economic opportunity for the middle class. That is entirely consistent with a message that was spread by Senator Sanders in his campaign that clearly deeply resonated with voters -- young and old, Democrat and independent -- all across the country. So President Obama has a lot of credibility with those voters.\nAnd look, here's the last thing: Senator Sanders obviously has a lot of credibility with those voters. And you heard Senator Sanders say to all of you just a couple of hours ago how critically important it is that President Obama be succeeded by somebody who shares our values and is dedicated to those progressive priorities.\nSo there are any number of people -- Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders, and President Obama -- who can make a very forceful case to those who were enthusiastic supports of Senator Sanders in the primary.\nJon.\nQ: Josh, you mentioned that the President we obviously know will be out next week with Secretary Clinton, and intends to be out many other times. How eager is he to get out there on the campaign trail again? I mean, is this like one more campaign for him?\nMR. EARNEST: The President is very enthusiastic about the opportunity that he will have over the course of the next several months to make a strong case in support of Secretary Clinton. I think that is evident from the comments that President Obama made in Elkhart, Indiana last week. The stakes in this election are high, particularly if you take a look at the U.S. economy. We've made enormous progress over the last seven years, digging out of the ditch created by the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. The private sector is what led that recovery, but the private sector would not have succeeded without the important policy decisions that were made in the first couple of months of President Obama's presidency.\nSo for those voters who are focused on the economy, we've got a pretty strong case to make about the wisdom of the decisions made by President Obama and the commitment by Secretary Clinton to those principles. But I also think it was pretty evident from that video and from his appearance on \"The Tonight Show\" with Jimmy Fallon that will air tonight at 11:30 -- that's a free plug there, Peter, for your network -- but I think anybody who has an opportunity to watch that interview will see that the President is quite enthusiastic about this election and about the prospect of being succeeded in office by Secretary Clinton.\nQ: I noticed in that video he seems to give Secretary Clinton some credit for the bin Laden decision. It's mentioned in the video. But that was really his decision alone, he said in the past. What role did she have in that critical decision?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the point of that video, where the President talks about her courage and her compassion and her heart, and how her service to the country are critically important to -- were critically important to his decision to endorse her in this campaign. And I think the point that he's making in the video is that he chose to have Secretary Clinton by his side for the first four years of his presidency as he was making difficult decisions that had enormous consequences for the United States and our citizens.\nQ: Was she part of that decision?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, she's certainly in that picture where that decision is be executed. And she certainly was an important architect of the kinds of foreign policy decisions and strategic decisions that President Obama had to make over the first four years of his presidency.\nQ: And I don't know if you've been tracking her Twitter feed up there --\nMR. EARNEST: I have not.\nQ: -- but it may not surprise you that Donald Trump has tweeted.\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not surprised.\nQ: \"Obama just endorsed crooked Hillary. He wants four more years of Obama, but nobody else does.\" (Laughter.) Is that what he wants? Four more years of Obama?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, no. I think there have been a number of occasions over the last several months where you all have pointed out to me some differences between Secretary Clinton and President Obama. So they do not have the same opinion on every issue. But I think, again, just to go back to this video that was released today, the President said unequivocally that he does not believe -- at least he can't remember somebody who has been more qualified -- a candidate that's been more qualified to hold this office.\nAnd after getting to know her personally, working closely with her in the first four years of this administration, and spending more than a year on the campaign trail competing against her in the 2008 presidential election, the President has had to opportunity to watch Secretary Clinton perform up close. And he's seen her tenacity, her dedication, her commitment to a set of principles that they share. And that's why the President is quite enthusiastic about her campaign.\nLet's move around. Toluse.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Can you at this point confirm that the President did vote for Secretary Clinton during the Illinois primary a few months back?\nMR. EARNEST: I did not ask the President about which box he checked on his ballot, but I'm not aware that he changed his mind at any point over the course of the primary.\nQ: And now that the endorsement is officially out, I want to sort of revisit a question that you were asked a couple of days ago about the First Lady. She's going to be doing an event, the \"[United] State of Women,\" I believe next week. Can we expect to see her, now that we have our first woman nominee, sort of make the case for Secretary Clinton on the campaign trail as well?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, that event that you're referring to is one that has been in the works for months now here at the White House. So it is not a campaign event. It's an official event to talk about a series of issues that are critically important to America's women and American families. And there are a wide range of issues that they'll discuss. Part of that event includes a conversation that the First Lady will have with Oprah Winfrey. So I don't know if it will come up in the context of that conversation, but this is an event that was planned independent of any consideration of Secretary Clinton's campaign.\nThat said, I think it is entirely fair for you to interpret President Obama's remarks in the video that was released today as consistent with the First Lady's views of the campaign. The First Lady is enthusiastic about Secretary Clinton's campaign, and you can certainly interpret that video as a joint endorsement.\nAnd at some point -- I don't know exactly when that will be -- but at some point, I'm confident that the First Lady will have an opportunity to share her own views in her own words about why she believes it's important for Secretary Clinton to succeed President Obama.\nI'll end by reminding you that there are a number of occasions where Mrs. Obama has discussed her deep admiration for Secretary Clinton's public service, her career. She's been a trailblazer, and Mrs. Obama deeply respects what Secretary Clinton has done and the issues that she's fought for over the course of her long career.\nQ: One more. Yesterday, the President at the fundraiser said that he was concerned about the ability of the Democrats to do sort of the hard work of the ground game of turning out young voters, low-income voters, like he did in 2008 and 2012. Is that sort of a tacit criticism of the Clinton campaign, that she hasn't been able to reach those voters so far?\nMR. EARNEST: No, it's not. The President was making a point similar to the point that he made in South Florida at the end of last week, where he talked about how important it is for Democrats to run scared, to not be complacent about what the polls say.\nThe stakes in this election are high, and the Republican nominee has certainly defied conventional wisdom in the past. And his campaign is one that Democrats should take seriously. And the President certainly intends to devote a lot of time and energy to making sure that voters all across the country -- Democrats, independents and Republicans -- understand the high stakes. And the President will certainly make a strong and clear case for the candidate that he believe is at least as qualified as any other candidate to seek the office of the presidency in our nation's history.\nApril.\nQ: Josh, a couple of questions. The Sanders campaign, or Bernie Sanders has been looking at history when it comes to this unification process. They have looked at 2008, when Hillary Clinton conceded and Barack Obama reached out his hand for unification with Hillary Clinton. For this President, what does the unification process with Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders look like, particularly when it comes to his supporters?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think you're making an important point, which is that there's some relevant history here; that Secretary Clinton was not in such a different situation than the one facing Senator Sanders today.\nWhat Secretary Clinton did -- and this is well-known history now -- is she was justifiably proud of the historic nature of her campaign in 2007 and 2008. She was proud of the strong support that she got from voters all across the country. But she also made clear that then-Senator Obama was the best opportunity that our country had to advance the priorities that she'd been campaigning on. And again, I think there's a relevant analogy to be drawn between what happened eight years ago and what's happening right now.\nQ: Since you're saying this relevant analogy, can you bring us back to how beyond paying for her campaign debt, bring us back to how President Obama worked with Hillary Clinton to get her supporters, who were very angry at the time, like now, to follow him? What was that piece that people had --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think -- look, I think what's important is to be respectful of those voters. And certainly in 2008, President Obama -- then-Senator Obama was deeply of the investment and commitment that had been shown by then-Senator Clinton's supporters. And over the course of that summer and fall, President Obama and his campaign -- with the strong support and endorsement of then-Senator Clinton -- made a powerful case.\nAnd I don't think there were too many of those supporters that were converted in a day. But over the course of the campaign, I think the President made a strong case. And I think Secretary Clinton is certainly well-positioned to do the same thing with regard to Senator Sanders's supporters.\nQ: What is the concern in this administration about the independents that could go to Trump, particularly when it comes to issues of trade? They didn't like Hillary Clinton's trade issues or trade stand, and they were for Bernie Sanders, and they'd vote for Donald Trump?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, as you all have pointed out to me a number of times in this room, all three of the candidates that you just named have the same position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership. And it's a different one than President Obama has.\nQ: Okay, then lastly, one last piece to Tuesday and the video. What time was that video made? Was it after New Jersey? Or was it during the day? Or was it after California? What time was that video made?\nMR. EARNEST: I believe it was during the day, but it certainly was after a number of your news organizations had declared Hillary Clinton the presumptive Democratic nominee for President.\nOlivier.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. That was the Map Room, right?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know exactly which room it was. It was a room in the White House residence. This is --\nQ: There are a lot of rooms.\nMR. EARNEST: There are. I don't know which one it was. But this is certainly consistent with the practice that previous Presidents have followed when engaged in taping videos for political purposes. This is what President Reagan did. This is what both President Bushes did. This is what President Clinton did. And it's what President Obama has done before.\nQ: Costs borne by the Hillary campaign?\nMR. EARNEST: Either the Hillary campaign or the DNC. What I can confirm for you is it was not filmed at government expense.\nQ: Who wrote the script?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know who was involved in writing the script. But again --\nQ: Both camps at the White House, and the Hillary campaign, or the DNC?\nMR. EARNEST: Some combination I think is the best way to describe it.\nQ: And you have always said in the past that when it comes to the President's endorsements, it's the candidate who makes the decision about the timing. Your hesitation about confirming that the President may have given a head's up to Senator Sanders in their meeting, I kind of want to nail that down. Did the Hillary Clinton campaign decide when that went up? Or did you guys decide when that went up?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't recall having said that the candidates themselves determine that. Obviously, President Obama made a very purposeful decision over the course of this campaign to not weigh in and to give Democratic voters across the country the opportunity to determine who should represent our party in the general election. So the timing of this decision was one that was driven by the President. But obviously, as I noted yesterday, the White House had an open line of communication with each campaign. And so in order to make sure that Senator Sanders wasn't surprised, it required President Obama to communicate with Senator Sanders. And in order to make sure that Secretary Clinton's campaign was in a position to release the video, we obviously had to communicate with them, as well.\nQ: And lastly, poor D.C. voters, right? (Laughter.) Should they just stay home? Is that part of the message here, that the decision has been made now, the race is over? Their votes don't matter as much a California, New Jersey, or other states?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, no, that's not how I would describe it. I think the President is somebody who has on a number of occasions articulated his view that people should be engaged in the political process. People should be engaged in the public debate. And certainly an important way to do that is to participate in elections. There are delegates that are up for election to the Democratic Convention, and that is something that's worth voting on.\nLook, I think what other people have suggested is that there are potentially reforms to the nomination process that could be made that could potentially put District voters in a position to have more influence on the process than they do now.\nJames.\nQ: Josh, thank you. A few quick different subjects.\nMR. EARNEST: Sure.\nQ: Does the President have confidence in Debbie Wasserman Schultz to retain her position through the end of this cycle?\nMR. EARNEST: James, the President was in South Florida at the end of last week, and he talked about her service as the chair of the Democratic National Committee. The President appointed her to be the chair of the DNC during his first term, which means that part of her legacy at the DNC is having built a Democratic campaign apparatus that succeeded in reelecting the first African American President of the United States.\nPresident Obama is, of course, the first President since Eisenhower to be elected and reelected with more than 50 percent of the vote. And certainly the DNC and the structure that was built and financed through Debbie Wasserman Schultz's efforts can take some credit for that. She should.\nSo the President made clear that Debbie Wasserman Schultz has always had his back, and he's going to have hers. And the President announced his support for her reelection campaign. And he certainly is appreciative of all the important work that she has done at the DNC.\nQ: Was there ever any point where the President ever considered endorsing anyone other than Hillary Clinton?\nMR. EARNEST: As I alluded to Toluse, I'm not aware that the President ever changed his mind in the course of the Democratic primary.\nQ: You mentioned earlier that President Obama carried Wisconsin twice in a row. Why shouldn't we interpret the President's decision to campaign there with Hillary Clinton as his first outing as a sign of weakness on the part of the Democratic ticket since they're going to be campaigning in a state where, by all accounts, they should easily be able to retain that state?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President had to compete for Wisconsin both in 2008 and 2012. Those were hard-fought elections, but both times he came out on top. So I would anticipate a similar outcome in 2016.\nQ: Two more things really quickly. You just stated at the podium just now that you believe that there's a very strong case to be made for the President's economic stewardship over the course of the last seven and a half years. Senator Sanders, in his statement in the White House driveway today, painted a very different picture. Senator Sanders said that the \"United States right now is drifting toward oligarchy.\" Does the President agree with that?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the President certainly agrees that there is more work to be done to address increasing economic inequality in this country.\nQ: Are we drifting toward oligarchy?\nMR. EARNEST: Those are Senator Sanders's words.\nQ: I'm asking if you agree.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what the President agrees with is the notion that there is more that can be done to fight economic inequality in this country. And the President has put forward some very specific ideas for how to do that. Unfortunately, many of those ideas have been blocked by Republicans in Congress. We can certainly start by raising the minimum wage.\nBut, look, I think the President is proud -- and justifiably so -- of the remarkable progress that our country has made over the last seven years. But he's certainly not satisfied. There is a lot more important work that needs to be done, which is why he believes it's so important that he's succeeded by somebody who wants to build on the progress that we've made and not tear it down.\nQ: Presumably, if you or the President agreed that we are presently drifting toward oligarchy you would have said so in response to my question.\nMR. EARNEST: Those are Senator Sanders's words, and I'm using my own to convey our view.\nQ: Last subject matter. Previously, the President has used one public forum or another to comment on the FBI investigation into Mrs. Clinton and her email conduct. At one point, he stated that as far as he could see, there was no real damage done to national security. You yourself from this podium have suggested that the investigation wasn't trending toward any focus on Mrs. Clinton herself. I wonder if you could address for us the potential conflict of interest that might exist when the President of the United States, the head of the executive branch, is openly saying, I want this woman to succeed me in the Oval Office, and you have other employees of the executive branch -- career prosecutors, FBI agents -- working this case who now have just heard how the President wants to see this case resolved, in essence. Isn't there some conflict there?\nMR. EARNEST: James, there is not. And you noted a couple of instances in which the President had been asked about the FBI investigation, and in each of those answers the President made clear that that investigation is one that is being conducted independent of any sort of political interference. That is a principle to which the President is resolutely committed.\nYou mentioned my comments. My comments were actually also in response to a question and were a reference to published reports of comments from FBI officials about the direction of the investigation.\nBut, look, the reason that the President feels confident that he can go out and make this endorsement and record a video in which he describes his strong support for Secretary Clinton's campaign is that he knows the people who are conducting the investigation aren't going to be swayed by any sort of political interference. They aren't going to be swayed by political forces. That they know that the investigation should be guided by the facts and that they should follow the evidence where it leads. And the President has complete confidence that that's exactly what they'll do.\nQ: So when a career prosecutor or an FBI agent who's working on the Clinton investigation hears this President speak openly of how he wants Hillary Clinton to succeed him, you don't think that that career prosecutor or that FBI agent takes that as some indication of how the President wants to see this case resolved?\nMR. EARNEST: No. I think that those career prosecutors understand that they have a job to do, and that that job that they're supposed to -- which is to follow the facts, to pursue the evidence to a logical conclusion -- that that is a job that they are responsible for doing without any sort of political interference. And the President expects them to do that job.\nAnd, look, this is the reason that we actually ask career federal prosecutors to take the lead on these kinds of matters. They're the ones who conduct this investigation. They don't have political jobs. They have career jobs as law enforcement officers and as prosecutors and as investigators. And that's what their responsibility is. And that's why the President, when discussing this issue, in each stage has reiterated his commitment to this principle -- that any criminal investigation should be conducted independent of any sort of political interference and that people should be treated the same way before the law, regardless of their political influence, regardless of their political party, regardless of their political stature, and regardless of what political figure has endorsed them.\nQ: To your knowledge, has President Obama ever discussed the Department of Justice investigation with Mrs. Clinton?\nMR. EARNEST: He has not. He has not.\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, to what extent would you say today's meeting with Bernie Sanders was -- in front of the cameras, here at the White House -- a formality in some ways to soften the blow not only to him but to so many of his young supporters who are so badly needed on the campaign trail backed by Hillary Clinton?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I would not describe the meeting as a formality because I think the President is deeply respectful of Senator Sanders and the campaign that he has run over the last year or so.\nSo again, they had a serious conversation about the stakes of the upcoming general election and about the future of the Democratic Party, something that both candidates are quite interested in. So this was an important meeting. This was an important part of the President's day, and certainly was an important part of Senator Sanders's day too.\nQ: But was there a request to get his grassroots supporters on board with Hillary Clinton?\nMR. EARNEST: Look -- no, I'm not aware of any sort of specific requests like that. I think this was an opportunity for the President and Senator Sanders to sit down and discuss the future. They did it in friendly terms -- I think you guys saw them walking on the colonnade -- that Senator Sanders I think is evidently and justifiably proud of all that he's accomplished. And I think he appreciate the President showing him respect by inviting him to the White House and sitting down for an hour-long conversation with him, and giving him the time and space that's necessary for Senator Sanders to make some important decisions about the future of his campaign and the future of the movement that he's built.\nQ: Time and space? I mean, it was not much later that the actual endorsement came out. I mean, that's not much time and space.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Senator Sanders is going to make his own decisions. When I'm referring to time and space, I'm referring to Senator Sanders making his own decisions about the future of his campaign based on his own preferences and based on his own schedule. President Obama did the same thing. And the good news is, is that both men have a strong commitment to a core set of values and principles, particularly as it relates to the importance of investing in the middle class. Both men have a commitment to the principle of grassroots movements and grassroots coalitions, and how our party and our country are stronger when citizens at the grassroots level are engaged in the process of self-government.\nAnd both men have shared the view that the upcoming general election is really important, and that it's important that President Obama be succeeded by somebody who has the same kind of commitment to those values that Senator Sanders and President Obama do.\nQ: In the clip, the President used the term \"fired up\" -- \"I'm fired up,\" which is reminiscent, of course, of his own campaign. Does the President see hitting the campaign trail now for Hillary as, in some ways, an extension of his own campaign because in so many ways it will help preserve his legacy? I mean, how mindful of that is he?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, this is Secretary Clinton's campaign, and President Obama is enthusiastic about doing all that he can to support it. And that's exactly what he said in the video.\nQ: That language was deliberate, no?\nMR. EARNEST: It was deliberate. And I think the President is actually making clear that he's enthusiastic about Secretary Clinton's campaign -- again, not just because she's got as much -- she's as qualified as any presidential candidate in American history has been, but because she also has demonstrated, in a variety of circumstances -- difficult circumstances -- the heart, the compassion and the courage to get the job done. And the President feels strongly that she's the right person to succeed him in office.\nQ: Can you tell us anything about this Biden meeting with Sanders today and the speech he's going to be giving?\nMR. EARNEST: What I do know is that Vice President Biden has invited Senator Sanders to come to the Naval Observatory, the vice presidential residence, for a meeting around four o'clock this afternoon where Vice President Biden and Senator Sanders will have an opportunity to have a conversation about Senator Sanders's campaign, about the upcoming general election, and many of the issues that Senator Sanders has been discussing on the campaign trail.\nVice President Biden is somebody with a political following in his own right. He certainly is somebody who would be a valuable surrogate on the campaign trail. But once that meeting is concluded, I'll give Senator Sanders and the Vice President's office the opportunity to discuss any outcome of that meeting.\nQ: Is it a strategy session? Would you describe it as that?\nMR. EARNEST: I'll let them describe it once they've had an opportunity to talk.\nAndrew.\nQ: Does the President support getting rid of superdelegates?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I've not heard the President weigh in with that view. Obviously, the Democratic National Committee is responsible for laying out the process of choosing the Democratic presidential nominee. I made a reference to this in the briefing the other day -- that every four years or so, there is intense consideration within the Democratic Party about the best way to choose the Democratic nominee.\nI happened to work at the DNC in 2004. And in 2003, there was an established process with public hearings and reports and Blue Ribbon panels all dedicated to taking a close look at the process of choosing the Democratic nominee for President. And there were a number of things that were considered -- everything from the role of superdelegates to the first-in-the-nation status of both Iowa and New Hampshire. There was a discussion about whether or not primaries should be organized on a regional basis. So there are lots of ideas for ways to change the process of choosing the Democratic nominee. I think we would all acknowledge that it's rather peculiar process that both parties are engaged in.\nBut I think what's important, what both Senator Sanders and Secretary Clinton acknowledged, is that they knew what the rules were when they signed up. They knew exactly what role superdelegates would play in this process. But look, if the process wants to engage in another process to consider making changes, that's something that party officials should do.\nQ: Can you say a little bit about why the first joint campaign will take place in Green Bay? Where does that fit within in your strategy going forward?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, to be clear, that's Secretary Clinton's strategy, so I think I'd mostly let her campaign talk about it. But I would just observe that President Obama has won two presidential campaigns over the last eight years, and he won the state of Wisconsin both times. So he's certainly got some influence and a following in Wisconsin.\nCheryl.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. So the President has said he appreciates Senator Sanders bringing up the special interest influence in politics. Can President Obama do anything about campaign finance reform in his remaining months in office?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I don't have any executive orders or policy announcements or anything to put forward today. The President has put forward a couple of ideas for what would bring greater transparency to our political process. The President is obviously an enthusiastic supporter of the DISCLOSE Act. This is a proposal that was put forward by Democrats in Congress that would bring much-needed transparency to the financing of political campaigns in the United States. For some reason, Republicans don't seem to support that principle. The President has in the State of the Union address expressed his concern about the impact of the Citizens United decision on the financing of American elections. And it's why the President has speculated that what may be necessary is actually a rather painstaking process of amending our Constitution to make clear certain principles about the importance of transparency in our elections and how the American people and our political process would benefit from greater transparency.\nPeter.\nQ: When did President Obama first communicate to Secretary Clinton that he would be endorsing her campaign? Did it take place in that phone conversation on Tuesday?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have details of their conversations to go into. Obviously, the President did have an opportunity to make a congratulatory call to Secretary Clinton. What's also true is that the President's political director, David Simas, is somebody who is principally responsible for managing the lines of communication between the White House and the individual campaigns. So he certainly played the core role. That's the role that's ascribed for him. And he played that role of communicating with both campaigns to ensure that nobody was surprised and that this was reasonably well-organized.\nQ: To be clear, he would have taped it that day? So by the time they spoke, the tape would already be in the can, right?\nMR. EARNEST: The President did tape the video prior to placing his phone call to President Clinton on Tuesday evening.\nQ: For Bernie Sanders supporters who say, hey, all he wanted was to be able to give Americans the choice without President Obama tipping the scales until every American had had a chance to vote, they'll say, why couldn't the guy have just waited until after Tuesday in Washington, D.C? What do you say to the Sanders folks who say, why didn't he just give us a few more days?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think I'd say a couple of things. The first is, I think this is an indication of President Obama's enthusiasm to get engaged in the general election and be supportive of the Democratic nominee. The stakes are high. We do have a presumptive Democratic nominee based on calculations that have been conducted by your news organization and many others. And the President is enthusiastic about Secretary Clinton, based on this own personal relationship with her, but also watching on her in action on the campaign trail and in serving as Secretary of State.\nBut, look, Senator Sanders said it more authoritatively than I can about how deeply he respected President Obama and Vice President Biden not weighing in and keeping their commitment to allow Democratic voters across the country to make a decision about who should represent our party in the general election. And we now know that Secretary Clinton has gotten a majority of delegates that will be voting on the party nominee in Philadelphia.\nQ: Is the First Lady traveling with him on Wednesday?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't believe that she is, no.\nQ: And I guess beyond that -- there was one other thing I was going to tell you, but I think I forgot it.\nMR. EARNEST: (Laughter.) Well, I'll come back to you if it occurs to you.\nQ: I think it'll be a good one.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay, sounds good. Carol.\nQ: He yields the balance. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: We'll go to the gentlelady from Pennsylvania, Ms. Lee.\nQ: You should feel free to interrupt. (Laughter.) Did the President come away from the Sanders meeting with a commitment or at least the belief that there will not be any confrontation or contested convention?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President came away from his conversation feeling quite good about it. Again, I think this was evident from what all of you were able to see from their interaction on the Colonnade. And I think, again, I think Senator Sanders said it best out in the driveway here. He's enormously appreciative of the way that President Obama and Vice President Biden conducted themselves in the context of the primary. And Senator Sanders made clear that there are a set of principles and priorities that he's going to continue to fight for, including in the context of the general election. And I think based on Senator Sanders's comments about the Republican nominee, it's clear that he understands the stakes in this election. President Obama certainly understands the stakes in this election. You've heard him talk about that in a number of places, including in Elkhart.\nSo Senator Sanders has earned the right to make his own decisions about his campaign on a timeframe of his choosing. But the President came away from the conversation feeling quite good about it.\nQ: On a different topic. The other day, your statement of administration policy on the NDAA, the language on the Gitmo provisions was a little stronger than usual, and it said that the President -- that the White House would treat those provisions as consistent with the President's constitutional authority. Should we interpret that to mean that he will just ignore them?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't had a detailed conversation with our lawyers about that language, so why don't we take a look at that and we'll follow up with you. I just want to I just want to make sure I give you a good steer.\nI suspect that the language was chosen quite carefully for a reason. I just want to make sure I can help you understand that correctly.\nJohn, nice to see you.\nQ: Thank you. Following up on Carol's question about the Sanders fight on, he also talks about those issues and principles of fighting for them in Philadelphia, at the convention. What's your understanding of what that means?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I'll let Senator Sanders explain it. But I think Secretary Clinton has indicated that she believes that those are priorities worth fighting for, as well. And I'm not sure the Republican nominee has indicated as much.\nSo again, I think the case that I have been making for quite some time now, and President Obama has been making for quite some time now, is that the Democratic Party is united around a core set of principles. And despite some admittedly significant stylistic differences between the two candidates, their platforms and their priorities are drawn from the same values. I don't think the same is true of the Republican candidates. And I don't think the debate that we see on the Republican side of the aisle reflects that, right?\nThere are even vigorous disputes among Republicans who are currently serving in Congress about the wisdom of a variety of approaches. They've indicated some discomfort with some of the policies advocated by the Republican nominee.\nSo the President has pointed out that there is a pretty stark difference here between our two parties. And I think what's important -- and the real, most important indicator is an acknowledgement of the huge stakes in this general election. And we've heard President Obama talk about that at some length, and we heard Senator Sanders talk about that on the driveway just a couple hours ago.\nQ: And also on the driveway he talked about looking forward to meeting with Secretary Clinton, seeing how they could work together to defeat Donald Trump. And also on these issues on Philadelphia, about what's going to happen in Philadelphia, is it possible that the President could get involved to try to facilitate these discussions and facilitate some sort of agreements using his auspices and good offices?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, obviously the President knows both Senator Sanders and Secretary Clinton well. The President has got deep respect for both of them, and I think that respect has been reciprocated in those relationships. So the President certainly would be able to play a facilitating role if one is necessary, but we'll find out if it's necessary.\nAlexis, nice to see you.\nQ: Nice to see you, too. Josh, I have three related questions.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay.\nQ: Because we've had presidential cycles where the sitting President has not always been welcomed by the nominee on the campaign trail, I just wanted to ask you: The President's enthusiasm, how will he be using his time, say, between now and the convention, in addition to Wisconsin? Are we going to see him coordinating constantly with the campaign to develop a schedule both separate and apart from the nominee? What does he envision in terms of a commitment of time to help?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me start by saying that the President's most important job is Commander-in-Chief and President of the United States. And over the course of the last year and a half, you've all heard me say on many occasions that the President is determined to squeeze every last drop of opportunity that he can out of the days that are remaining while he's in office. So that will be his number one priority. It always has been, and it will be -- even though he's quite enthusiastic about the Democratic nominee.\nThat being said, when it comes to strategic decisions about the President's campaign schedule, a lot of it is going to be driven by Secretary Clinton and her campaign. This is her campaign. And President Obama has indicated that he wants to help. I'm confident that he'll have some advice for Secretary Clinton and potentially maybe even members of her team. But they're the ones that are making these decisions. And the President is quite enthusiastic about what he can do to try to help.\nQ: My second question is related to that. Because the teams are so woven together in terms of having served at the White House, having served in previous administrations, and the President joked about, I have advice, maybe they don't want to hear it, but I have advice, right -- how is he going to give that advice? In other words, has he talked to Secretary Clinton along the way? Has he talked to her? You said he talked to Sanders three times. How often has he been talking to her? Is he just going -- does he consider himself an advisor?\nMR. EARNEST: No, he does not consider himself an advisor. But he certainly is somebody who has got a lot of relevant experience, and he's somebody with a track record of success. So presumably, Secretary Clinton and even Senator Sanders, as he completes his campaign, would be interested in President Obama's advice.\nBut both Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders have plenty of advisors and plenty of other people who aren't advisors eager to give them advice. So the truth is the President is eager to be helpful, and he'll be helpful in whatever way he can.\nQ: How often has he spoken to the former Secretary this week?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I know of at least one conversation. This is the election night conversation when the President congratulated her for getting a sufficient number of delegates to clinch the Democratic nomination. I don't have any conversations to read out. You know that they've had an opportunity to meet here at the White House two or three times over the course of the campaign. And in part that's because they're friends, but in part that's because they both have a pretty keen interest in the general election.\nQ: Do you know whether they will be together? She's supposed to be in town tomorrow. I just wondered if they're going to get together before Wisconsin.\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any meetings that are planned for tomorrow, so I don't believe they will. So I suspect that the next opportunity that the President will have to see Secretary Clinton in person will be in Titletown on Wednesday.\nQ: And the last question is, some members of the Cabinet have already endorsed Secretary Clinton for nominee, obviously before she became the nominee. What's the President's direction to members of the Cabinet who may want to continue to be helpful or may want to join now to be helpful in terms of their use of their time, how they see fit politically? What is his direction to them?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, he's got a couple of directives. The first is that each of those individuals has a day job that's more important than the campaign. Each of those Cabinet secretaries is invested with significant responsibilities that has a significant impact on the American people. And I've got total confidence that all those Cabinet secretaries understand that that is their first priority.\nThe second thing is that there are rules in place that govern the way that government employees can engage in political activities. And the President expects that all of the employees in the federal government, from Cabinet secretaries on down, will be conscientious about following those laws, both the letter and the spirit. So that would be his second directive.\nBut consistent with the rather significant requirements of their day job, and consistent with the laws that govern political activity, the President would leave it to individual Cabinet members to make a decision about how involved they would like to be in the upcoming election.\nMike.\nQ: Josh, in your statement on Tuesday night, you specifically said that Sanders had requested today's meeting, and then just earlier you indicated that his decision to announce the endorsement today might not have been a surprise to Senator Sanders, given the fact that they had spoken earlier this week. Would it be right to assume maybe that Senator Sanders may have requested the meeting -- that you hold off on the endorsement until that meeting took place? Can you talk a little bit more how that meeting came together?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't think I'm going to get into all the details of their conversation, but the President certainly was interested in a conversation with Senator Sanders. Senator Sanders did suggest and did request that President Obama make time in his schedule for the two men to get together. The President was happy to do that and invited Senator Sanders to come to the White House to have that discussion. And the President felt that it was appropriate and respectful to withhold any formal announcement of an endorsement until he'd had an opportunity to sit down with Senator Sanders.\nObviously, late on Tuesday night, Senator Sanders was on the West Coast, and President Obama had his own busy travel schedule yesterday, so this morning was the first opportunity that the two men could get together. And the President was pleased to have that conversation. And Senator Sanders, as he said out in front of the West Wing a couple hours ago, was appreciative of the way that President Obama handled his business.\nQ: To be clear, you're not saying that Senator Sanders requested that he hold off on an endorsement until they had a chance to meet?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any sort of request like that. I think Senator Sanders's request was merely for an opportunity to sit down with President, and the President was happy to oblige and to arrange a meeting at the White House today.\nQ: And then the Vice President has been a bit freer in commenting about the race, but does this endorsement extend to him as well? Or will he make his own separate announcement?\nMR. EARNEST: I'd refer you to the Vice President's office for any sort of formal endorsement that the Vice President would choose to make.\nQ: And the last question is: In the video he talks about I think he's not sure that anybody has been more qualified to be President. Is he included himself eight years ago when he said that? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I mean, when you just take a raw look at qualifications, I think that's pretty obvious. She served as Secretary of State for four years. She is somebody who has been in the public eye for a couple of decades, including *four eight years as United States senator and eight years as First Lady.\nSo she is somebody who brings a wide range of experience. And I cite her experience as First Lady because she traveled the world, and was, particularly at the end of her tenure, essentially a diplomat for the United States.\nSo I think you'd be hard-pressed to come up with a presidential candidate -- with the possible exception of people who had served as Vice President before they ran for President. So somebody like --\nQ: Richard Nixon.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Richard Nixon or George H.W. Bush, somebody who had served for eight years as Vice President.\nQ: Al Gore?\nMR. EARNEST: Al Gore. So you could think of some other candidates who would fill that role. But with the exception of sitting Vice Presidents, I think you'd be hard-pressed to come up with a candidate throughout American history who's got more experience and is more qualified than Secretary Clinton to do this job.\nJulie.\nQ: Not to belabor the tick-tock, but just so I'm clear, you mentioned that the President talked with Bernie Sanders three times this week. When was the first time that he broached the possibility and prospect that he was going to endorse Secretary Clinton?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not going to get into the details of the conversations, but obviously he had a conversation on Sunday, a conversation on Tuesday, and then the conversation in the Oval Office today. Those were the three conversations that I was referring to. But I don't think I'm going to get into the details of exactly the nature of those conversations in each day.\nQ: Okay. And for today's meeting, what was -- I mean, you mentioned the President has some relevant experience here, given the campaign eight years ago. What was his advice to Senator Sanders, if he had any, about how to take the coalition that he's built throughout the campaign that the President talked about in the video, was impressive and he congratulated him on, and do something with it that would help boost Secretary Clinton's candidacy? I mean, were there specific things -- are there specific things that the President thinks he needs to do now?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think this is the best way that I can describe it to you while also trying to protect their ability to have a private conversation. The relevant experience that President Obama has is from 2008, in which he had also run in a competitive Democratic primary contest. President Obama came out the winner, but he benefitted enormously from the runner-up -- then-Senator Clinton -- enthusiastically supporting his general election campaign. And President Obama was able to speak firsthand how meaningful that was to him personally and to his campaign to have the strong support of then-Senator Clinton for his general election presidential race.\nAnd so that's the perspective that President Obama could share with Senator Sanders. Each situation is different, but I think there are some clear parallels here. And I think it was beneficial. I'll let Senator Sanders speak for himself, but I suspect it was beneficial for Senator Sanders to hear President Obama's perspective about how meaningful that endorsement was.\nAnd you'll recall that that endorsement from then-Senator Clinton came after she celebrated the accomplishments of her campaign. She gave a big speech here in Washington, D.C. -- I believe it was at the National Building Museum -- where she talked about the 18 million new cracks in the glass ceiling. And that was a genuine celebration of the movement and campaign that she had built. And the success of that campaign was worthy of enormous respect.\nBut shortly after that, she traveled with President Obama to New Hampshire and they had an event together where her presence on the stage alongside then-Senator Obama was really important. It didn't change everybody's mind that day, but it initiated a process where, over the course of the summer and fall, President Obama and Senator Clinton made a persuasive case to her supporters that President Obama was the right choice to succeed President George W. Bush in office.\nI think what's also true is that then-Senator Clinton announcing her support for Senator Obama's general election campaign didn't diminish her status at all. I think, if anything, her status as a singular political figure in the Democratic Party and in the country was enhanced. And her performance on the campaign trail, both in the primary election where they competed against one another, but also in the general election, where she was giving voice to many of the priorities that were animating President Obama's campaign, were part of the reason that he chose her to be Secretary of State.\nSo again, these situations are different. The candidates are different. The dynamics of the race are different. But I think there's some relevant parallels to be drawn, and hopefully President Obama's perspective was useful to Senator Sanders as he makes some important decisions about the future of his campaign.\nQ: So did he request that Senator Sanders think about -- actually think about endorsing her and doing it quickly?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, President Obama was deeply respectful of Senator Sanders. And because of the enormous success of his campaign, Senator Sanders is entitled to the time and space that he needs to make that decision on his own.\nQ: And the timing of the campaign appearance with Senator Clinton -- or Secretary Clinton next week, is it a coincidence that it's the day after the D.C. primary is over, and it's important for Senator Sanders to compete in that? Or is that something that the President did consciously, knowing that Senator Sanders wants to be able to be a factor in that contest?\nMR. EARNEST: For the decision about the timing, I'd refer you to the Clinton campaign.\nLana.\nQ: You mentioned a couple times that the President and Senator Sanders seemed to have a fun time when they were walking down the colonnade. We saw them laughing, the President even patted him on the back. What were they talking about?\nMR. EARNEST: I didn't talk to him about that aspect of their conversation.\nQ: You don't know what the joke was?\nMR. EARNEST: It was a funny one, apparently. But, look, I think -- I suspect that based on my observation and President Obama's own experience in having run a vigorous, longer-than-expected Democratic primary campaign, that there's a little bit of a weight that's lifted off Senator Sanders's shoulders. He's got some critically important decisions to make. But I think he can be profoundly proud of the movement that he's built and the results that he has to show for it. And I think that would put anybody in a good mood.\nQ: Donald Trump has been trying to appeal to Sanders supporters by asking them to \"get even with Clinton\" by supporting him. How important is Sanders --\nMR. EARNEST: That's quite a campaign slogan, huh?\nQ: Yeah.\nMR. EARNEST: \"Get even.\" (Laughter.)\nQ: Lots of slogans coming out of this campaign.\nMR. EARNEST: That will be really inspiring. (Laughter.)\nQ: How important is Sanders's concession and the timing of that to trying to keep those Sanders supporters enthusiastic about the Democratic nominee? Is Tuesday better than July?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I'm not going to backseat drive as Senator Sanders makes these decisions. So the unity of the Democratic Party will be important and important to Secretary Clinton's success in the general election. And in talking about how Secretary Clinton can succeed in winning the support of the 10 million Democrats and independents that supported Senator Sanders in the race, Senator Sanders is going to be an enormously influential voice and advocate to his supporters. But ultimately his decision about all this will be up to him.\nQ: Since it's being reported on Tuesday, was the plan always to release the video a couple of hours after the two men met at the Oval Office? Or did that meeting have an influence on the timing?\nMR. EARNEST: The rough timing -- as you could tell by a couple of changes to today's briefing schedule, the timing did shift a little bit over the course of the day today. So, once again, I appreciate your patience with that. But the general timeframe here is something that was well-established.\nQ: And my last question is about the attacks in Tel Aviv. What does the White House make of Israel's decision to suspend entry permits to Palestinians? Does the White House find that an appropriate response? Is it too similar in some ways to the presumptive Republican nominee's proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States because of terrorism?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me start by saying that we offer our condolences to the families of those who are mourning the loss of loved ones in a terrorist attack in Tel Aviv yesterday. This is violence against innocent civilians, and it's an outrage and something that's worthy of widespread condemnation.\nThe United States continues to stand strongly with our allies in Israel as they confront a very difficult security situation inside their own country. So we're going to support them and we're going to stand by them as they deal with the challenge of securing their country and protecting their citizens. But I don't have any comment on the steps that they have taken to try to do that.\nJuliet.\nQ: In terms of Debbie Wasserman Schultz, I know you reiterated the President's support for her. Bernie Sanders has been a sharp critic of her leadership of the DNC, and I'm wondering if you could provide any insights for us as to whether her leadership came up in the context of their conversation or whether there's anything you can say to the extent that the President and Bernie Sanders talked about structural changes within the DNC, beyond the platform that could help reflect his efforts to change the way the Democratic Party operates.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have additional details of their conversation to share. As I mentioned to James, the President is deeply appreciative of Debbie Wasserman Schultz's service as the chair of the DNC. And I think her track record, particularly as it relates to the last presidential election, speaks for itself.\nOver the last several months, Senator Sanders has expressed some frustration and concern about the process of choosing a Democratic presidential nominee. And he'll have to make his decisions about how best to pursue reforms of that process. But look, everybody knew the rules when they signed up, and Senator Sanders has indicated that a desire to change those rules in a way that he believes would make the process more fair. And that's something that will have to be considered by Democrats across the country.\nMark, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thanks. Josh, can you tell us why Senator Sanders arrived at the residence rather than the West Wing? Was it just for the photo-opportunity?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes. (Laughter.)\nQ: Awfully short. (Laughter.) The Green Bay event on Wednesday, is that a Hillary Clinton campaign event?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes. It is a campaign event in support of Secretary Clinton's campaign.\nQ: Do any White House staffers have to go off payroll in setting up the President's participation?\nMR. EARNEST: No. Not that I'm aware of, at least. I'm going to have to jog my memory from the 2010 campaign. But there are regulations that govern political activities. So there are members of the President's staff who can support him as he does his job, and one of those jobs is to be the leader of a political party. So there are narrow circumstances in which members of the President's staff can assist him and advise him as he undertakes those activities. The best example of that is the President's political director, David Simas, who has been the principal point of coordination -- again, within the balance of the law -- between the White House and the relevant presidential campaigns.\nQ: Have you got any White House reaction to the Chinese intercept of the American aircraft, reconnaissance aircraft? Is this another one of those incidents where you're just going to lodge a complaint through normal military channels?\nMR. EARNEST: We certainly will raise our concerns through usual military channels. But the Department of Defense has mentioned this directly that, back on June 7th, earlier this week, there were two Chinese jets that intercepted a U.S. reconnaissance aircraft that was operating in international airspace. The concern is that the Chinese jets conducted that intercept at an unsafe, excessive rate of closure.\nThe initial assessment from the Department of Defense is that this intercept and its unsafe nature appears to be a case of what the Department of Defense has described as improper airmanship. And they arrived at that conclusion because, based on their analysis, there was no other provocative or unsafe maneuvers that were executed. So that's the analysis of the Department of Defense.\nSo even though it was a case of improper airmanship and not otherwise provocative, we still do raise these concerns with Chinese officials, because again, U.S. aircraft was operating in international waters, consistent with international law and consistent with the principle that the President and Secretary of Defense have articulated on a number of occasions, which is that the United States will operate, fly and sail anywhere that international law allows. That's just what our aircraft was doing on June 7th.\nQ: Doesn't that mean the administration does not believe China was trying to send any message to the U.S. with this intercept?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think in this case the assessment from the Department of Defense is that this was a case of improper airmanship and that there were no other provocative maneuvers that occurred.\nQ: And one last issue. Besides that of a proud parent, will President Obama be playing any role at his daughter's commencement, graduation tomorrow?\nMR. EARNEST: You have adequately summarized the President's entire role in tomorrow's ceremony. So he will be there to see his first-born cross the stage and receive her diploma. And he and the First Lady are enormously proud of their daughter's accomplishments.\nQ: Do you know if he was asked to speak?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know if he was asked to speak. But if he were, he would decline.\nQ: Because he's going to be too overwrought with emotion to him hear it say it again and again?\nMR. EARNEST: The President has had an opportunity to give three commencement addresses this year, and this is an opportunity for him to not play the role of commencement speaker but rather to play the role of proud parent, as you described it.\nQ: Is it bittersweet? Can you address what he asked?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President talked about this a little bit with Mr. Fallon on \"The Tonight Show\" that will air tonight as well. And I think for every parent there's a sense that they're enormously proud of their child, pleased to see that they've grown up healthy and successful, but also -- yeah, it's a little bittersweet to see your child grow up. My son is only two and there are sometimes when I feel myself a little bittersweet about his growth.\nQ: Would you turn down Walker's high school? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: (Laughter.) Yes. Before I go, I also want to acknowledge that today is actually the last day of Frank Benenati in my office. So many of you have worked with Frank for quite some time now. Frank has been a loyal member of the President's team for quite a while in a variety of different roles, including on the President's reelection campaign, including at the Office of Management and Budget.\nFortunately, Frank is not going far. He's going to go and take a senior position over at the EPA. So, many of you may have an opportunity to be in touch with him over there. But just at the end of the briefing I wanted to take a minute to acknowledge Frank and his professionalism and his service to the President, to the country. And we're deeply appreciative for it, and we're going to miss you. (Applause.) So with that, thank you, guys.\nI assume the applause -- let the transcript reflect that the applause was for Frank, not for me. (Laughter.)\nQ: The applause was completely inaudible.\nMR. EARNEST: Maybe. (Laughter.) In spite of that, I'll be back tomorrow. I'll see you then.\nEND 3:40 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2016-06-09", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}

While the legislation is not perfect, it is an important first step to addressing Puerto Rico's challenges. The bill helps to protect the 3.5 million Americans living in Puerto Rico from further reductions in critical public services while giving Puerto Rico the tools it needs to restructure its debt.\nThe Senate should act expeditiously to review and vote on this measure, so the President can sign the bill into law ahead of the critical July 1st debt payment deadline. As we have said, Puerto Rico's path forward to economic growth requires not just the financial tools in this bill to address the immediate debt crisis, but also additional economic tools to grow Puerto Rico's economy in the long run. To that end, consistent with the President's plan released last year, Congress will need to take additional steps to ensure that Puerto Rico can provide access to quality health care and job opportunities for all its citizens. We urge leaders in both parties to build on today's bipartisan momentum and help Puerto Rico move toward lasting economic prosperity.", "timestamp": "2016-06-09", "title": "Statement by the Press Secretary on the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act"}

Duffy, R-WI, and two cosponsors)\nThe Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 5278, the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), which would provide Puerto Rico with a comprehensive restructuring authority to address its unsustainable debt, coupled with appropriate fiscal oversight to increase transparency and achieve meaningful reforms.\nPuerto Rico has already begun defaulting on its $70 billion of debt with a much larger default anticipated on July 1 when nearly $2 billion in additional payments are due. However, this is not just a matter of financial liabilities. The human costs for the 3.5 million Americans in Puerto Rico – in terms of access to health care, electricity, education, and basic public safety – are real and escalating daily. H.R. 5278 would allow Puerto Rico to restructure its liabilities to help address the ongoing crisis, with no new Federal spending.\nWhile the Administration supports passage of H.R. 5278, the Administration has concerns with some provisions in the bill. The Administration opposes the measures in this bill on minimum wage and overtime that put in jeopardy important protections for workers, do nothing to address the crisis, and further exacerbate the economic disparities between Puerto Rico and the mainland United States. Although the bill would include important provisions to ensure adequate funding for public sector pensions, it could do even more to protect pensions. Further, the bill should ensure Puerto Ricans have a robust voice on the proposed Financial Oversight and Management Board. While the bill includes provisions the Administration opposes, on balance, the Administration believes this compromise legislation is far superior to the status quo and is necessary to protect the well-being of 3.5 million Americans and create a path to recovery.\nOnly Congress has the authority to provide Puerto Rico the tools to resolve this crisis. Failing to act now will result in an economic and humanitarian crisis far beyond what Puerto Rico is already facing today. Absent the bill's protections and tools, an escalating series of lawsuits between creditors and against Puerto Rico could ensue, which could imperil essential services and put pensions in jeopardy.\nThe Administration urges the Congress to build on the bipartisan effort behind PROMESA and pass this legislation quickly before this crisis grows materially worse.", "timestamp": "2016-06-09", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 5278 - Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118080", "text": "\"We are big and vast and diverse; a nation of people with different backgrounds and beliefs, different experiences and stories, but bound by our shared ideal that no matter who you are or what you look like, how you started off, or how and who you love, America is a place where you can write your own destiny.\" President Obama, June 26, 2015\nSince taking office, President Obama and his Administration have made historic strides to expand opportunities and advance equality and justice for all Americans, including Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) Americans. From major legislative achievements to historic court victories to important policy changes, the President has fought to promote the equal rights of all Americans — no matter who they are or who they love. That commitment to leveling the playing field and ensuring equal protection under the law is the bedrock principle this nation was founded on and has guided the President's actions in support of all Americans. And the progress the Administration has made mirrors the changing views of the American people, who recognize that fairness and justice demand equality for all, including LGBT Americans.\nThe Obama Administration's record on social progress and equality includes:\nPreventing Bullying and Hate Crimes against LGBT Americans\n• Overcoming years of partisan gridlock, the President worked with Congress to pass and sign into law the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act into law in October 2009, which extends the coverage of Federal hate crimes law to include attacks based on the victim's actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity.\n• The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) collaborated with five other federal departments to establish a federal task force on bullying. One of the results was the creation of the website - www.StopBullying.gov. The site includes resources and assistance for LGBT youth, including examples of community groups that offer support and options to seek counseling. As part of the first-ever White House Conference on Bullying Prevention, the task force also funded a video called \"It Gets Better\" to address LGBT youth who have been bullied and are at risk of depression and suicide.\n• The U.S. Department of Education hosted five summits on strategies for protecting students, including LGBT students, from bullying and harassment. These events included an LGBT Youth Summit in 2011 and a meeting with transgender students in June 2015, with a sixth summit scheduled for August 2016.\nSupporting LGBT Health\n• In June 2009, President Obama issued a directive on same-sex domestic partner benefits, opening the door for the State Department to extend the full range of legally available benefits and allowances to same-sex domestic partners of members of the Foreign Service sent to serve abroad. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) also expanded federal benefits for same-sex partners of federal employees and allowed same-sex domestic partners to apply for long-term care insurance.\n• In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was signed into law by President Obama and ensures that Americans have secure, stable, and affordable insurance. Insurance companies are no longer able to discriminate against anyone due to a pre-existing condition, and because of the law, insurers can no longer turn someone away just because he or she is lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender.\n• The federal website, HealthCare.gov, designed to help all consumers find the health insurance best suited to their needs, makes it easy to locate health insurers that cover domestic partners.\n• The Affordable Care Act also makes it easier for people living with HIV and AIDS to obtain Medicaid and private health insurance and overcome barriers to care from qualified providers.\n• President Obama developed and released the first comprehensive National HIV/AIDS Strategy for the United States in 2010, updated it through 2020, and is implementing it to address the disparities faced especially by gay and bisexual men of all races and ethnicities and transgender women of color.\n• The President has supported legislative efforts to ban the use of so-called \"conversion therapy\" against minors and released a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) study condemning the practice. This report, which was developed in collaboration with the American Psychological Association and a panel of behavioral health experts, is the first federal in-depth review of conversion therapy. As SAMHSA reported, variations in sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression are normal. Conversion therapy is not effective, reinforces harmful gender stereotypes, and is not an appropriate mental health treatment.\n• HHS funded the Services and Advocacy for LGBT Elders (SAGE) to establish the first national resource center for older LGBT individuals. This center supports communities across the country as they aim to serve the estimated 1.5 to 4 million LGBT individuals who are 60 and older. This center provides information, assistance and resources at the state and community levels.\n• HHS now requires all hospitals receiving Medicare or Medicaid funds - just about every hospital in America - to allow visitation rights for LGBT patients. The President also directed HHS to ensure that medical decision-making rights of LGBT patients are respected.\nRepealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell\n• The President signed bipartisan legislation to repeal Don't Ask Don't Tell on December 22, 2010, allowing gay, lesbian, and bisexual Americans to serve openly in the Armed Forces without fear of being dismissed from service because of who they are and who they love, putting in motion the end of a discriminatory policy that ran counter to American values.\nEnding the Legal Defense of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA)\n• In February 2011, the President and Attorney General announced that the Department of Justice would no longer defend the Defense of Marriage Act's provision defining marriage as only between a man and woman, leading to the Supreme Court's landmark decisions holding the Act unconstitutional.\n• After the United States v. Windsor decision, in which the Supreme Court struck down Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act as unconstitutional, the President instructed the Cabinet to review over 1,000 federal statutes and regulations to ensure the decision was implemented swiftly and smoothly by the federal government to recognize the rights of same-sex couples.\n• The Administration has long advocated for a Constitutional guarantee of marriage equality for same-sex couples—a position the Supreme Court vindicated in its historic decision in Obergefell v. Hodges.\n• In October 2015, after the Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced proposed regulations implementing the Supreme Court's same-sex marriage decision for federal tax purposes to ensure all individuals would be treated equally under the law.\n• After the Supreme Court issued a decision in Obergerfell v. Hodges, the Social Security Administration (SSA) began to recognize all valid same-sex marriages for purposes of determining entitlement to Social Security benefits or eligibility for Supplemental Security Income. SSA continues to work closely with the LGBT advocacy community to conduct outreach to ensure that same-sex couples are aware of how same-sex marriage affects benefits.\nProtecting LGBT Americans against Discrimination\n• In July 2014, the President signed an Executive Order prohibiting federal contractors from discriminating against any employee or applicant for employment \"because of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin,\" continuing to set an example as a model employer that does right by its employees.\n• The Administration has taken unprecedented steps to protect and promote the rights of transgender and gender non-conforming Americans. These actions have included:\no The release of joint guidance from the U.S. Departments of Education and Justice to provide educators with the information they requested to ensure that all students, including transgender students, can attend school in an environment free from discrimination. Additionally, the Department of Education published Examples of Policies and Emerging Practices Guide for Supporting Transgender Students.\no The issuance of guidance from the Department of Justice that concluded that the prohibition against sex discrimination in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 encompasses claims of discrimination on the basis of gender identity, including transgender status.\no Agencies, including OPM, the State Department, SSA, and HHS, took various actions to ensure that transgender Americans were treated fairly and without discrimination in the workplace, in official documents, and in the health care system.\nTaking Steps to Ensure LGBT Equality in Housing and Crime Prevention\n• In 2009, HUD commissioned the first-ever national study of discrimination against members of the LGBT community in the renting and sale of housing. The Department also launched a website to allow citizens to offer comments on housing discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Since then, HUD has continuously worked to address LGBT housing discrimination.\n• In January 2012 and in 2015, the President issued a final rule and subsequent guidance to ensure that the Department of Housing and Urban Development's core housing programs and services are open to all persons regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.\n• HUD's Equal Access Rule makes it clear that housing that is financed or insured by HUD must be made available without regard to actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status. It also prohibits owners and operators of HUD-funded housing, or housing whose financing was insured by HUD, from inquiring about an applicant's sexual orientation or gender identity or denying housing on that basis. In addition, the guidance makes clear that sexual orientation and gender identity should not and cannot be part of any lending decision when it comes to getting an FHA-insured mortgage.\n• In 2013, HUD teamed up with the True Colors Fund to give LGBT youth a safe space to be their true selves. Over the next two years, the initiative has developed and evaluated strategies to prevent lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youth from becoming homeless or intervene as early as possible once they do become homeless.\n• The Justice Department issued guidance stating that Federal prosecutors should enforce criminal provisions in the Violence Against Women Act in cases involving same-sex relationships.\n• In December 2015, the Department of Justice issued Guidance on Identifying and Preventing Gender Bias in Law Enforcement Response to Sexual Assault and Domestic Violence. The guidance serves two key purposes. First, it aims to examine how gender bias can undermine the response of law enforcement agencies to sexual assault and domestic violence. Second, it provides a set of basic principles that - if integrated into law enforcement agencies' policies, trainings and practices - will help ensure that gender bias, either intentionally or unintentionally, does not undermine efforts to keep victims safe and hold offenders accountable.\nAdvancing and Protecting the Rights of LGBT Persons around the World\n• The Obama Administration continues to engage systematically with governments around the world to advance the rights of LGBT persons. The Administration's leadership has included various public statements and resolutions at the UN.\n• President Obama has also issued a presidential memorandum that directs all Federal agencies engaged abroad to ensure that U.S. diplomacy and foreign assistance promote and protect the human rights of LGBT persons.\n• The Department of State continues to grow the Global Equality Fund, a multi-sector public-private partnership to advance the human rights of LGBT persons globally. Since the Fund was launched in December 2011, it has allocated over $30 million to civil society organizations in 80 countries worldwide.\n• USAID, the U.S. government agency primarily responsible for delivering international aid and assistance, launched the LGBTI Global Development Partnership and \"Being LGBTI in Asia,\" and funded a range of LGBTI human rights programs. In 2014, USAID released its LGBT Vision for Action, a document that communicates USAID's position on LGBTI issues to internal and external stakeholders.\n• In February 2014, USAID appointed a USAID Senior LGBT Coordinator to ensure that the promotion and protection of LGBTI rights is fully integrated into all aspects of USAID's vital work overseas.\n• In February 2015, the U.S. State Department appointed the first-ever Special Envoy for the Human Rights of LGBTI Persons to lead and coordinate U.S. diplomatic efforts to advance LGBTI rights around the globe.\n• The State Department revised its Foreign Affairs Manual to allow same-sex couples to obtain passports under the names recognized by their state through their marriages or civil unions.\nRecognizing LGBT History and Contributions\n• On May 28, 2014, the Department of the Interior announced a new National Park Service theme study to identify places and events associated with the civil rights struggle of LGBT Americans and ensure that the agency is telling a complete story of America's heritage and history. The results of the theme study are expected later this year.\n• On June 9, 2015, the Henry Gerber House in Chicago, IL was designated a National Historic Landmark. Once the residence of noted gay rights activist Henry Gerber, the home was where the nation's first chartered LGBT rights organization, the Society for Human Rights, was formed in 1924. The Henry Gerber House is one of nine LGBT sites that have been designated as a landmark or historic place during the Obama Administration.", "timestamp": "2016-06-09", "title": "Fact Sheet: Obama Administration's Record and the LGBT Community"}

And for Michelle, she's been doing a lot of work with a program called \"Let Girls Learn\" that's not just domestic, but international. She's had a consistent group of young women who she mentors herself.\nFor us, what we've been trying to do is to really broaden the network of support that our young men have all across the country. And that's been true for this program, \"My Brother's Keeper.\" And I couldn't be prouder of the work that we've been able to do. In hundreds of cities across the country, we are seeing thousands of mentors step up. We are seeing organizations like the NBA and major corporations who are providing opportunities for young people to see what their opportunities are. We're linking them up with universities so that they know that they can aspire not just to go to college, but to complete college. And we're going to not just keep doing this until the end of my Presidency, but this is something that Michelle and I are very interested in doing after the Presidency is over.\nOne of my favorite things about this, though, is that I actually have a group of White House mentees, and these outstanding young men who you see, who are looking very sharp today—[laughter]—have been participating in the program. Some of them have actually been with us for a couple of years now. They started as juniors; they're now seniors. We have sitting around the table young people who despite, in some cases, some pretty tough circumstances—growing up with single parents, growing up in pretty tough neighborhoods—we've got young people who are going to be going to Stanford University. We've got people who are going to Yale. We've got folks who are going to Morehouse. We've got young people who are going to be joining our Armed Forces. We have folks who are going to be engineers and doctors and are pursuing just a wide range of interests.\nAnd I've gotten to know them over the last couple of years, and I could not be prouder of them. And it's a testimony to how much talent there is out there, as long as young people get a chance. And it doesn't take much. It just requires us really exposing them to what's possible and giving them some resources and some open doors. And they'll run through them.\nAnd I just want to, in front of them and in front of the press, say how incredibly proud I am of all them and what they're going to accomplish. And I want to thank members of my administration, because the way the White House Mentorship Program works, they don't just meet with me; more importantly, they're assigned mentors like a Jeh Johnson, my Secretary of Homeland Security, or Broderick Johnson, who's one of my—not just my Cabinet Secretary, but one of my chief advisers and closest friends. And so we've—Secretary King, Department of Education. They are active in this process as well, and they're real busy, but I think they would agree that this has been one of the more satisfying things that they have done.\nSo I'm proud of the young men, and I want to encourage—and I'm going to keep on talking about this—adults out there, particularly men out there, to—if you are interested in mentoring and signing up, get on the White House website and look up \"My Brother's Keeper,\" and we will get you signed up and get something rolling in your city or your community so you can be inspired by the incredible young people in your community, just like I am by these fine young men.\nAll right?

Hello, hello, hello! Good to see you. Hello! Well, welcome to the White House. Let me first of all——\nAudience member. Love you, Mr. President!\nThe President. [Laughter] Let me acknowledge some outstanding public servants who are here. We've got Secretary of the Army, Eric Fanning is in the house. Export-Import Bank Chairman Fred Hochberg is here. We've got some amazing Members of Congress—no one who has done more on behalf of justice and equality than former Speaker and, perhaps soon to be Speaker again, Nancy Pelosi. [Applause] We love Nancy.\nSo this is the eighth Pride reception that we will celebrate together. I want to begin by saying thank you to all the people that—I'm looking out in the audience; I see some new friends, but a lot of old friends, folks who have been with us through thick and thin. And I am grateful for all that you've done to work with us to accomplish some amazing transformations over these last 7½ years.\nSo every year, we set aside this month to celebrate the ways that so many lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Americans have helped to make our Union just a little more perfect. We honor the countless nameless heroes who paved the way for progress: the activists who marched; the advocates who organized; the lawyers who argued cases; the families who stood by their loved ones, even when it was tough; every brave American who came out and spoke out, especially when it was tough. Because of them, because of all of you, there's a lot to be proud of today.\nToday, we live in an America where \"don't ask, don't tell\" don't exist no more. Because no one should have to hide who they love in order to serve the country that they love. We live in an America that protects all of us with a hate crimes law that bears the name of Matthew Shepard. We live in an America where all of us are treated more equally, because visiting hours in hospitals no longer depend on who you are and insurance companies can no longer turn somebody away simply because of who you love.\nThanks to heroes like Edith Windsor and Jim Ober—I always get Jim's name—[laughter]—Jim knows I love him, but I never know where to put the emphasis—Obergefell—generations of couples who insisted that love is love, we now live in an America where all of our marriages and our families are recognized as equal under the law. And that's an extraordinary thing. When you talk to the upcoming generation, our kids—Malia's, Sasha's generation—they instinctively know people are people and families are families. And discrimination, it's so last century. [Laughter] It's so passé. It doesn't make sense to them. So we live in an America where the laws are finally catching up to the hearts of kids and what they instinctively understand.\nSo some folks never imagined we'd come this far, maybe even some in this room. Change can be slow. And I know that there have been times where at least some of the people in this room have yelled at me. [Laughter] But together, we've proven that change is possible, that progress is possible. It's not inevitable though. History doesn't just travel forward, it can go backwards if we don't work hard. So we can't be complacent. [Applause] We cannot be complacent. Securing the gains this country has made requires perseverance and vigilance. And it requires voting. Because we've got more work to do.\nWe still have more work to do when gay and bisexual men make up two-thirds of new HIV cases in our country. We have to work hard to make sure that jobs are not being denied, people aren't being fired because of their sexual orientation. We still have work to do when transgender persons are attacked, even killed for just being who they are. We've got work to do when LGBT people around the world still face incredible isolation and poverty and persecution and violence and even death. We have work to make sure that every single child, no matter who they are or where they come from or what they look like or how they live, feels welcomed and valued and loved.\nSo we're going to have to keep on pushing. And that's the work of all of us. The great and often unsung civil rights hero Bayard Rustin once said, \"We need in every community a group of angelic troublemakers.\" [Laughter] I like that.\nAnd that's what I see here tonight, people who aren't afraid to ruffle feathers in the name of justice and equality until we extend the full promise of America to every single one of us. And that's always been our story, not just in Selma or Seneca Falls, but in Compton's Café and the Stonewall Inn. It's the story of brave Americans who were willing to risk everything, not just their own liberty or dignity, but also doing it on behalf of the dignity and liberty of generations to come. They understood a truth that lies at the heart of this Nation: When all Americans are treated equal, we're all more free.\nAnd that's what should give us hope. Despite our differences and our divisions and the many complicated issues that we grapple with, real change is possible. Minds open. Hearts change. America shifts. And if the past few years have taught us anything, it's that people who love their country can change it.\nOne of the most special moments of my Presidency was that warm summer night last June when we lit up the White House like a rainbow. It was a powerful symbol here at home, where more Americans finally felt accepted and whole and that their country recognized the love that they felt. It was a beacon for people around the world who are still fighting for those rights. It was a reminder that when the change we seek comes, and when we move a little bit further on our journey toward equality and justice, we still have a responsibility to reach back and help pull up others who are striving to do the same.\nSo enjoy tonight. Have some champagne; some of you already have, I can tell. [Laughter] Tomorrow we get back to work. And by the way, we get back to work not just fighting on behalf of justice and equality for the LGBT community, but for everybody. Because one of the—if you've felt the sting of discrimination, then you don't just fight to end discrimination for yourself, you've got to fight for the poor kid who needs opportunity. You need to fight for the working mom who can't pay the bills. You've got to fight for some young woman on the other side of the world who can't get an education. It can't just be about us. It's about \"we\" and what we can do together.\nSo I'm very proud—very proud to have fought alongside you. We've got more miles in the journey, and I'm so glad that we're going to be traveling that road together.\nThank you very much, everybody. God bless you.", "timestamp": "2016-06-09", "title": "Remarks at a Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Month Reception"}
{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117653", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n**Please see below for a correction, marked with an asterisk.\n12:50 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Nice to see a little jovial Friday afternoon spirit here in the Briefing Room. As many of you know from the guidance last night, I'm joined today by Brett McGurk. Brett, as you know, is the Special Presidential Envoy to our coalition to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. As you know, Brett has periodically come to the Briefing Room to stand here at the podium and to give you an update on our efforts to counter ISIL -- not just in Iraq and in Syria but around the world.\nSo he's here with an update. The update that he'll be providing all of you is similar to the update that the President will receive when he convenes his national security team on Tuesday of next week. As you know, the President periodically every two or three weeks will do a meeting with his national security team to review progress and to consider any updates to our strategy. So that meeting will be convened at the Treasury Department. The usual assortment of national security officials will be joining him for that meeting. And as usual, the President will have a statement at the conclusion of that meeting to give you a little sense about what was discussed.\nSo with that, I'll turn it over to Brett. He's got some opening remarks and I believe even a visual aid here. And then he'll stick around for 10 or 15 minutes to take questions.\nSo, Brett, do you want to take it away?\nMR. MCGURK: Sure. Thanks, Josh. Thanks. It's great to be back here. I think I was here some months ago, and I just want to give an update of where we are in this most complex, most challenging, and also most important campaign.\nWhen the President addressed the American people back in September of 2014, he talked about our global campaign to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. And since then, we've actually made a lot of progress -- if you look at from where we were back then until now, and even from where we were when I last addressed you some months ago.\nSo what I want to do is just kind of briefly how we analyze this most difficult challenge. It's important to keep in mind, before I talk about the progress, I want to put the caveat in -- this is one of the most challenging terrorist situations we've seen in some time. Forty-thousand foreign fighters from all around the world have poured into Syria over the last four years -- that's an unprecedented challenge in terms of the types of numbers. But to address it, that's why we had to build a global coalition to address it and shrink their overall territory in Iraq, Syria, and also Libya.\nWe analyze it in three dimensions. There's the core in Iraq and Syria -- this is their self-proclaimed kind of phony caliphate. I've traveled now all around the world, and the common denominator when I asked leaders in various capitals what is it that's driving your young people to this movement -- the common denominator is this notion of a historic caliphate. So we have to shrink the core, and we're doing that -- I'll talk about that in some detail. So there's the core.\nThen there are the global networks. Those are the foreign fighter networks that feed the core in Iraq and Syria, the financial networks, and the propaganda networks. And we are constantly, through a global coalition, every single day, squeezing and constricting those networks.\nI just came from the State Department, where I addressed 66 ambassadors and representatives from our coalition to talk about how we're doing, particularly in that global network piece.\nAnd then they have seven affiliates around the world, self-proclaimed affiliates. It's important that we not get too distracted about these -- many of them are preexisting terrorist groups, which we're already very much focused on, such as Boko Haram in Nigeria. We're focused on that, we have been pre-Daesh, we're focused on them now, even after they're flying the black flag of ISIL.\nBut in a situation like Libya, where we see ISIL sending some of its best leaders to Libya to set up an affiliate, we do get concerned, we focus on it, we target the leaders quite effectively and with precision, which we've done. And we also work with the new government to begin to take back the territory that ISIL holds, and that is now very much underway.\nLet me go through very briefly some of the indicators that we look at in terms of how we're doing against ISIL. And I'll just kind of -- I'll allude to about eight of them because it shows where we are and where we've been.\nNumber one, we look at the morale of their overall fighters and the overall force. And the morale now, compared to where it was even four or five months ago, is plummeting. We're seeing them execute their own fighters on the battlefield. We're seeing them unable to move fighters around the battlefield. And we're seeing the recruits fall off precipitously.\nEven if you don't take it from me, look at their own statements and what they say to their own potential recruits. Their spokesman is a terrorist named Mohammad al-Adnani. He has talked for years about this movement as one as a global, historic, expanding movement. Every single thing they would say in their propaganda is that we are going to retain and expand our territories -- constantly going to expand. If you look back a year ago, their propaganda was these black flags kind of taking over the Middle East and moving into southern Europe.\nHis last statement about three weeks ago was very different. He actually said, you know, we might lose Raqqa, we might lose Mosul -- which they will -- and we might lose Sirte, but we're still going to be around so come join us anyway. It's kind of a very different message than what we were hearing, and I think it's one that is not quite as appealing to their potential recruits. So the morale is plummeting, they're executing their own fighters.\nNumber two, their ability to hold territory. They have not had a successful offensive operation, particularly in Iraq, in over a year. They've lost about 50 percent of their territory in Iraq, about 20 percent of their territory in Syria, and it's continuing to shrink. But most importantly, is the strategic territory that they held is shrinking quite dramatically. The border with Turkey is no longer accessible to them, and very significant towns in Iraq, such as Tikrit, Ramadi, Ar-Rutbah, going out in western Anbar Province -- no longer accessible to them. And all the road connections between Raqqa and Mosul have been cut off.\nNumber three indicator: Their access to combat-ready fighters: How big is this organization? We assessed back in December of 2014 they had as many as about 31,000 fighters in their ranks. It's now down, it's at the lowest historic point we've seen. We estimate -- it's hard to get an exact number -- but between 19,000 and 25,000, and it's continuing to shrink quite rapidly. Their ability to recruit and to move foreign fighters around the world, which is very important to protect all of our homelands is also much more difficult. Since the President went to the U.N. Security Council and the U.N. General Assembly in 2014, and we passed a very historic U.N. Security Council Chapter 7 Resolution called 2178. And that really shined the global spotlight on this problem. Since then, and in working with our coalition, 45 countries have enacted laws to restrict the ability of foreign terrorist fighters to travel through their territory; 35 countries have made arrests and broken up cells. And then through sharing information between different capitals, we learn more and more, and create a virtuous cycle.\nWe now have information-sharing agreements with 50 countries all around the world to combat this, and we're working very closely with Interpol. Interpol is a critical partner of ours. We have about 4,000 ISIL foreign fighter profiles in the Interpol database. That's a 400 percent increase from when we started this in the fall of 2014. It is much harder for these guys to travel and move around.\nThe fourth indicator: Their access to revenue. Their revenue -- we think we've cut off entirely their revenue that's coming from the outside. They rely entirely on self-generation -- oil, oil trade, sale of antiquities. And we have systematically gone about with very good intelligence work throughout our whole government effort to target that. They've cut their salaries in half. As you know, we've talked about it before, we've targeted their oil production efforts. We've targeted their trucks that move the oil around. And they are no longer able to do what they used to do.\nThis, again, creates a virtuous cycle. They've cut the pay to their fighters; the fighters don't want to remain in the organization; they desert; their morale plummets; they can't fight -- and then we can defeat them on the battlefield.\nA fifth indicator is their access to borders. When we started this, they controlled almost the entire Syrian border with Turkey. It's now down to about a 98-kilometer stretch of territory, and that is shrinking rapidly, particularly with an ongoing effort in Manbij, which I'll talk about very briefly.\nSixth, they're capable -- they have capable and confident leaders. This is an organization in which Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, in the Ramadan in 2014, went into Mosul -- at the Grand Mosque in Mosul and said, we're establishing a caliphate. We haven't heard from Baghdadi since late last year, and this is no longer a confident organization. You can just see it in their own statements.\nSo their leaders are not nearly as confident. They're not nearly as capable. And we are killing one of their senior or mid-level leaders once every three days now. We've taken out about 100 just over the last few months alone. And this is because of the intelligence that we're able to gather from everything that we're doing.\nThe fact that we have local actors on the ground, local forces on the ground working closely with us to gather intelligence, everything of course our military is doing in the skies over Iraq and Syria, and everything that our heroic Special Forces are doing, of course, on the ground in Iraq and Syria is creating this virtuous cycle.\nTheir media propaganda is not what it was before. They had kind of open season back in 2014. We've worked very closely throughout the global coalition to make sure that we get this stuff off Twitter, off Facebook, off YouTube. We work very closely with Facebook and Twitter. Twitter has taken down about *125,[000] pro-ISIL handles. For every one on Twitter now there's about six counter-ISIL handles countering their messaging every day, 24/7. Our partners in the coalition, the UAE has been a leader in this, the U.K., Malaysia, because it's a very localized message-based structure, but we're going at it every single day.\nFinally, their global cohesion -- they see themselves as a global organization. And their cohesion is shrinking. Their connections between the heart of their so-called caliphate in Syria and Iraq to their co-called affiliates is drying up and shriveling up. And even in their own propaganda -- because it's much harder for them to get into Syria now -- so they tell their recruits, maybe don't to Syria, think about going to Libya. But Libya is also increasingly a not-very-hospitable environment for them.\nAnd if you think about Libya, which isn't in the news as much as Iraq and Syria, but just a few months ago there was no government in Libya. There's now a government backed by the United Nations. That government is now on the ground in Tripoli. Of course, it is working with local forces loyal to that government, which are now starting to push into the heart of what ISIL thought was its stronghold in Sirte, and they're making some real progress.\nWe have a lot of work to do in Libya. There's a lot of actors on the ground. And it's a core principle of ours that those actors need to recognize that civilian-led government, and from there, if the government of Libya, of course, requests help from the international community, I think they'll find a very willing partner.\nLet me very briefly just highlight just a few points on this map. I referred to this map the last time I was here, and just to situate everyone, every color that is in this map are areas that ISIL at one point or another controlled. So in the summer of 2014, all those colors -- they were moving down on Baghdad. You might remember those days. Everything in green are areas that they've lost since then. Everything in orange are areas they still control. And the very small splotches of dark red are areas that they've actually gained.\nThis map only goes until the end of April, which is unfortunate, because since the end of April we've launched a number of major offensive operations with our partners on the ground. So there's a lot more green on this map now than there was in the end of April, and we hope to have an updated map coming out in the next week or so.\nBut let me just highlight a couple points on the map; I won't go through the whole thing. But number one, that's the 98-kilometer strip of border with Turkey that I mentioned. This is very important because it is the last strip of border it controls. Turkey has done a great job in kind of sealing off the area on the Turkish side of the border, but until we take the territory away in Syria, we still remain vulnerable.\nThere's a city there, a town called Manbij. Manbij is where we believe the Paris attackers, the Brussels attackers, they all kind of pulse through this area -- from Raqqa up to Manbij, and then out to the capitals where they had organized their attack. So we have to work with forces on the ground to close out this area.\nWe've pushed -- this is the Mara Line. That's the extent of ISIL's western advance, and we've worked with opposition groups to push to the east. That's proven to be very difficult because they have met with very fierce resistance from ISIL with suicide bombs and truck bombs. So we opened a new front about a week ago, and this is going extremely well, a force called the Syrian Democratic Forces. And the force that is doing this operation, there's about 3,500 of them. And it is based upon a core principle that we set when we developed this strategy, and this was fundamental to the President, fundamental to our DOD campaign plan, and also the diplomatic strategy: We want local people who know the local area to organize and liberate their areas. We don't want, obviously, American troops going into the streets and alleys of these towns. We want local people with local knowledge to liberate their own territory.\nSo when it comes to Manbij, there's an organization out called the Manbij Military Council. There are about 3,500 fighters. 3,000 of them are local Arabs from Manbij. I met some of their leaders when I was in Kobani, and I've met them elsewhere. And they launched an operation about a week ago and crossed the Euphrates River here in what some of our Special Forces who work with these guys have said is one of the most complex military maneuvers they've seen in some time. And they did it under fire. They've taken casualties. In fact, one of the main leaders of this organization, of the military council, his name was Abu Layla, someone that I also met, was killed in the operation. They've now named this operation after him, and they've continued to advance.\nThey continue to advance so rapidly that Manbij is now almost entirely surrounded. And once Manbij is taken away from ISIL, it will really entirely cut off their ability to move from Raqqa and to move fighters, and to threaten us and to threaten our partners and our homelands.\nSo it's a very important operation. It launched about a week ago. There was months of work that went into it. They still have some ways to go, but we're focused on it and it is critically important. And once we're in there, we think the amount of information we're able to get about ISIL, about the leadership networks will be very important for further unraveling it.\nRaqqa, just very quickly. Raqqa, of course, remains their kind of their headquarters, and we think a lot of their leaders are still there, although fewer than there were. And as I said, we're continuing to target those leaders in Raqqa, but, most importantly, the reason that the President made the decision to send additional Special Forces to Syria -- going from 50 to 300 -- is because we think we've hit on a formula that works -- again, organizing local people to take the fight to ISIL combined with air support and combined with hard, kind of local political work that we're doing. It works.\nAnd what we're doing to move down on Raqqa is recruiting and increasing the number of Arab fighters in their own territories. So obviously, we have people on the ground helping to do that training. And so far we think that is going quite well.\nI will just move around to number five. That's, of course, Mosul. The President has authorized additional military enablers for Mosul. Those are getting in place, and I'm very confident that when the decision comes to use then, they will be used quite effectively. And that will be coming.\nBut also important for Mosul, we're doing a lot of diplomatic and political work within our coalition to make sure that the humanitarian, the stabilization piece, and the local politics is set up so that we do Mosul right. Mosul is very complicated. There's about a million people still in Mosul. There's Arabs. There's Kurds. There's different ethnicities. And we want to make sure that everybody is pulling together and working together.\nHere I give the government of Iraq a lot of credit. They have allocated in their budget 15,000 local fighters from Ninawa Province to be part of the Mosul campaign. We're working very closely with our Kurdish partners in Erbil, and of course, with the government of Baghdad to organize and coordinate this entire effort. That is very much underway. And of course, we won't put timeframes on it. But we feel pretty good about how it's going to tick up.\nTikrit -- I mentioned Tikrit last time, but it's important because it's so critical that as we're focused on defeating ISIL, we're not just focused on defeating them and not thinking of what comes next. We're focused on the day after ISIL.\nAnd this is where as our global coalition we've done -- we've been able to pool resources. And I think we've hit on a very effective mechanism, which has really revolutionized the kind of post-conflict stabilization effort. Returning people to their homes after a conflict like this is one of the hardest things to do historically. We've looked historically. It can take years, if ever.\nIn Tikrit -- Tikrit, of course, is an iconic Sunni city in the heart of a mixed province, Salah ad Din Province. The entire population now -- 95 percent of the population, according to the U.N. statistics, has returned to the city of Tikrit. And that is because we have a stabilization funding mechanism through the coalition. It's funded about $100 million at any given time, so that it's able -- you can draw from it and flush resources to the local level. The government of Iraq is determined to decentralize authority as much as possible to provincial officials. And we're working to make sure that local people are organized to secure the streets.\nSo in Tikrit now, security is being provided by local police, which eventually gives people the confidence to come home. And once they start coming home, you reach a tipping point and the population returns. So in Tikrit that is going very well. The entire population is back. And in Iraq entirely now, about 700,000 people have come back to their homes.\nThis is important because one of the main challenges in this part of the world, of course, are the refugees and migrant flows. And we want to make sure that as we defeat ISIL, we are setting the conditions for people to return to their homes.\nFinal point I'll mention is seven and eight. Seven is the Euphrates Valley. This would all be green if this was an updated map because we have worked very closely, again, with the local people to liberate their own territories. And the tribes of Anbar Province, about 15,000 now, tribal fighters, organized to work with Iraqi security forces. And they have now cleared the entire Euphrates Valley from Ramadi up to Haditha. And that is significant because it would not have been done if we didn't have the support of the local people. And so that has now cleared out.\nAnd in Ramadi, we're trying to do the same thing as in Tikrit -- bringing people back to their homes. We have about $25 million allocated for the stabilization effort in Ramadi. We have 2,500 local police from Ramadi in the streets. We have tribal fighters coordinating to control Ramadi, working very closely with the governor of Anbar Province.\nWhat has made this very difficult -- and this is how barbaric ISIL is and why we have to wipe them off this map -- before they leave an area, before they left Ramadi, those who survived and retreated, they left IEDs, booby traps in almost every home. So of the 70,000 people that returned to Ramadi, about 100 of them tragically were killed to find a booby trap in their closet or in their refrigerator. So the government stopped the returnees. We then as a coalition -- we all met in Rome, with key contributors from the coalition -- we raised about $25 million to help the demining, the -- getting all these booby traps out of these homes. And there's now experts, world-renowned experts on the ground in Ramadi helping to clear meter by meter to help people come back to their homes.\nIt's a sense of just how difficult this is. It's a sense of how every single detail we are really focused on. And because we have a coalition, we can draw on resources rapidly to try to help. So Ramadi right now they are clearing the booby traps and the IEDs to help people come back to their homes.\nJust to the southeast of Ramadi, of course, is Fallujah. The Fallujah operation has been in the news, and this is very much ongoing. Overall in Fallujah, we're focused on three dimensions. One is military campaign, of course. And this is being led to actually enter the city of Fallujah -- this is very important -- it is being led by the Iraqi Army, the Iraqi Counterterrorism Service, and local tribes.\nThe overall force, about 20 percent, is local Anbari tribal fighters. And entering the city, it will be primarily the Iraqi security forces and, ultimately, those tribal forces.\nJust yesterday, the Iraqi Special Forces punched through the main crunch -- the crust of ISIL's defense and set up a foothold in the southern edge of the city in a very critical neighborhood. And our military personnel who know this land better than anybody -- I was talking to Lieutenant General Frank McKenzie yesterday, who knows this ground, it's very significant to get that foothold and then to continue to push forward. This will take weeks; it's not going to be fast. Again, they have to go block by block, clearing IEDs. But we are helping the Iraqi security forces, as they operate under the Iraqi chain of command.\nThere have been reports of some isolated atrocities committed by some of the popular mobilization forces, primarily these are Shia volunteers who are in the outskirts of Fallujah. And we've discussed this with Prime Minister Abadi. We've discussed it throughout the government. And so far, everybody is saying and doing the right thing to make sure that anyone who commits a human rights violation is held to account.\nThe Iraqi security forces, as the IDP has come out, we did the same thing -- you have to screen who is coming out, do biometrics, make sure that Daesh is not infiltrating the IDP population, but this has to be done in an organized, coordinated way. And we've worked with the local leaders in Anbar, with the governor, to make sure that there is a local representative to try to make sure that this is going well. But we're concerned about it, we're focused on it, and the government of Iraq is also focused on it.\nFinal point before I just turn to questions. Number eight is Ar-Rutbah, and that's all orange, but on the new map it would be green. And this is way out there. And this is where, in some cases, we're ahead of where we thought we would be. There's a highway from Amman into Baghdad -- I was just in Amman a couple weeks ago. And that was about tens of millions of dollars of commerce coming through there every single month. It's obviously dried up entirely since ISIL came in. And the Iraqi security forces with, again, about a thousand local tribal fighters from the local area, cleared out ISIL from Ar-Rutbah just about two weeks ago. And we're now working to secure and open that highway, which is critical for our close partner, Jordan, and also, of course, for Iraq.\nSo, again, you can see the pressure kind of coming from all directions. It's not just Iraq and Syria, but it's global. And I think, overall, while this remains a tremendous, tremendous challenge, the strategy is kicking into gear and we're making some progress. And we'll talk to the President next week about where we are and how we might further accelerate.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay. Thank you, Brett. With the detail laid down there, so why don't we go around here? Josh, do you want to start?\nQ: Great. Thanks for doing this. I wanted to ask you about Mosul. You talked about the importance of having this be led by local forces, but how concerned are you about some of the Shia militias that, with Iranian support, are taking on a lot of the action? And have you assessed the risk of there being a sectarian bloodbath against Sunnis that could have a backlash that would actually help the Islamic State?\nMR. MCGURK: So Tikrit was kind of a test for this. So Tikrit, we had -- this was about a year ago -- and you had a lot of popular mobilization units who are primarily Shia operating in that battle space. We worked out a formula in which those units would not go into the city of Tikrit itself. The units that we support, very importantly, all have to be operating strictly under Iraqi command and control. And there's a couple reasons for that. One, we're not going to support any unit that is not operating strictly under Iraqi command and control. And secondly, we don't want to make any mistakes. And sometimes it's hard to tell from the sky who is who.\nSo a lot of these units actually are operating under Iraqi command and control, they are disciplined, but there are a couple of exceptions and exceptions of units that the Iranians have tremendous influence over that are outside the Iraqi command structure. And that's a big problem for us, it's a problem for the government of Iraq. So we discussed this with the Iraqi authorities as early as -- just yesterday, I was talking to our ambassador, and it's a concern. But, again, so far, the plan for Fallujah and who is entering the city are the Iraqi security forces operating under that command and control structure.\nSo it's a concern. I will say that everybody -- if you know the Iraqi scene, I mean, the Grand Ayatollah Sistani, all the way down, even Muqtada al-Sadr -- everybody on the Shia side is saying the right things. Any human rights violation is -- cannot -- everybody who violates anyone's human rights has to be held accountable. It's not acceptable. We're working here to liberate the people of Fallujah, who are Iraqis. ISIL, it's important to remember, is holding the entire population hostage -- anyone who leaves they're trying to kill.\nAnd so everybody is saying the right thing, but in a complicated environment like this, and in the smoke and dust of it, which we are in now, there will be incidents, and it's important, then, that the government holds the people accountable.\nMR. EARNEST: Ted.\nQ: You mentioned, number four, the revenues of the Islamic State. What's the estimate of the annual oil sales now? And is that -- to what extent is it going down because the oil prices dropped or is it because of also airstrikes and the counter operation?\nMR. MCGURK: Yes, so it's a great question. So we got real insider knowledge into their finances because of an operation our Special Forces did, again, over a year ago, deep into Syria, into the town Shaddadi, which is now no longer in ISIL's hands. And it was an operation against Abu Sayyaf, who was a deputy to ISIL's main leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and their main financier. And our heroic Special Forces -- these guys are incredible -- they pulled more information off that site than any raid in their history. We learned more about how they're funding themselves through that operation than anything else we had done.\nThey were generating about a billion dollars a year, about $500 million from oil and gas, and $500 million from antiquities trade, from extortion, from what they call taxes -- just extracting revenues off the population. But based on that information from that raid, we were able to then systematically develop all that intelligence information, and working across the U.S. government into the military targeting process to go after how they're getting oil out of the ground and how they're selling it.\nSo we've reduced their production by at least 30 percent. We've substantially reduced their ability to generate revenue. The numbers are fuzzy, so I just don't want to give you a precise number, but it continues to go down. As we see them adapt, which we're seeing them do, we then get together and we go to the Situation Room with all the experts and say, how are we going to adapt and stay ahead of them, which we're going to do.\nBut it's because of -- this is why this is hard. I mean, some say, well, how come you couldn't have -- why didn't you just go after all their oil immediately? You have to get the intelligence, the specific information about exactly what they're doing so that the military effects can be precise and have the effect that you want. And it was based upon that operation, deep into Syria, that we got the intelligence we needed to begin to really target their revenue streams, and we're going to continue to do that. We'll be relentless in going after that.\nMR. EARNEST: Justin.\nQ: I wanted to ask about Libya and, obviously, I think the question of what happens next. And so I'm wondering -- there's been obvious success against ISIL there but there seems like the presence of factions continue to exist, General Haftar has not pledged allegiance to the central government. And so what's the plan for after you're hopefully able to eradicate ISIS there? And is the U.S. going to do more to help that central government? Because we've seen problems with basic services, basic finances -- sort of the core-of-government functions.\nMR. MCGURK: Yes, so Libya, I think as you know, it's obviously extremely complex. And 10, 11 weeks ago, there was hardly any traction to say how are we actually going to grapple with this. So, one, they formed a government, a U.N.-backed government, recognized by the international community -- a very important ministerial meeting held in Vienna in which the whole world really rallied to support that government. There are elements on the ground exactly as you mentioned that have not yet recognized the authority of that government, and that remains a problem. Our position is very clear that any armed actor on the field in Libya should recognize the authority of that civilian government, the Government of National Accord.\nSecretary Kerry was in Abu Dhabi just a couple days ago talking about some of this, and of course we're talking to the Egyptians about this. And we're prepared to obviously work with General Haftar under the umbrella of the Government of National Accord. So there's a lot of discussions going on about this, and I think we're making some traction. And my colleague at the State Department, our Special Envoy on Libya, Jonathan Winer, is, of course, working the political piece of this every single day together with the U.N. Special Representative Martin Kobler.\nWe have a lot of work to do in Libya, don't get me wrong. But we now have I think some traction in how to go after it. And those effects are now starting to be seen on the ground. But it will take time, and we have to work it step by step. But you're absolutely right, we want to make sure these armed actors come under a civilian umbrella. And we'll need the cooperation from our partners to make that happen.\nMR. EARNEST: Andrew.\nQ: A couple questions on Syria and one on Libya. We saw earlier this week there were thousands of people fleeing Manbij ahead of the assault, which, as you know, the town is now surrounded. What are you doing to help the people that are fleeing and to screen the people that are fleeing in case militants have infiltrated refugee flows?\nMR. MCGURK: So in Manbij, it's harder than some of what we're doing in Iraq, just because we don't have the access -- which we do from a place like Baghdad -- where we're working directly with the government.\nSo I mentioned the Manbij Military Council. There's also a Manbij Provincial Authority, an authority from Manbij that will be ready to go in and to work locally to make sure they can work the stabilization piece. The borders remain difficult. We just reopened the border with northern -- the Kurdistan region of Iraq and into northern Syria to get a lot of this humanitarian relief flowing in. That border is open for humanitarian trade, primarily for this reason -- to make sure that as areas are liberated from ISIL, the resources can be there to help people.\nBut Manbij, you're right -- so we've kind of -- completing the encirclement, and now the very difficult phase of actually liberating the city will begin. And I don't want to put a timeline on that, but we are working with local actors who have local knowledge and pooling the resources as best we can to make sure that we get the stabilization piece right.\nSyria is much harder, however, because we're not obviously working with a central government. We are not going to work with the Assad regime. Period. And so it presents different challenges than Iraq.\nBut if you look at what we've done in terms of clearing out all this territory, I think we've hit on a formula that works. Manbij will be a big test. It will be one of the most strategic blows to ISIL yet because it is their hub of foreign fighters. It is their main kind of access route from Raqqa. And so I suspect they will fight for it. But we feel pretty good about the plan -- not only the military plan, but importantly the post-ISIL plan.\nQ: And sorry, just on Libya. The Misrata Brigades and some Libyan officials are saying that Sirte has basically fallen. They're quite surprised that they've gone and the forces are basically mopping up. Is that your assessment?\nMR. MCGURK: I think it's -- I think they have some ways to go. And I just don't want to get ahead of the situation because it remains pretty fluid, but we're encouraged by the progress they're making.\nWe understand the Government of National Accord set up an operations room to organize all these fighters who are fighting against ISIL. And in Libya a few months ago when I would do conferences, and they'd talk -- analysts would talk about Libya, they'd talk about this kind of hockey-stick growth of ISIL in Libya. In fact, it's remained static at about 5,000 total fighters. Most of them are from North Africa or Sub Saharan Africa. It has not grown, And that's because the Libyan people totally reject ISIL entirely.\nSo they've been able to control Sirte by force. But once you have a credible force on the ground that moves against them, there is a chance that they could crack pretty quickly. But I don't think we're there yet.\nMR. EARNEST: Margaret.\nQ: Is there a clear read on what Baghdadi's status is? You made a point of saying you haven't heard from him in some time. Is he alive and well? And can you give us a timeline on the retaking of Raqqa?\nMR. MCGURK: So we have no reason to believe that Baghdadi is not still alive, but we have not heard from him since the end of last year. It is Ramadan. He purports to be the caliph; that's what he calls himself. And so you would think he'd be coming out with a statement to his so-called followers. But we have not heard from him. But we presume that he's still alive.\nI will say, though, as I mentioned the leaders we're taking out, we are getting closer and closer and closer to the very core. And so it's really a matter of time for him. I just can't put a timeline on any of the operations for Raqqa and Mosul. Raqqa will be extremely difficult, but I think we have a pretty good plan after Manbij to organize these local actors, Arab fighters to move down and to isolate Raqqa.\nMR. EARNEST: Michel.\nQ: If I heard you correctly, you were saying that the problem is there were more atrocities perpetrated in Fallujah than you knew. And all you have is to take the government of Baghdad at its word, that's saying everything -- we're doing the right thing.\nThese forces that -- there are several reports about summary executions from these popular mobilization forces. How concerned are you that they are probably -- there are more reports, and that they are using this push against ISIS to engage in score settling with Sunnis and you're probably unwittingly supporting them in these acts?\nMR. MCGURK: Most atrocities being committed in Fallujah are being committed by ISIL. And ISIL is killing families as they're trying to leave Fallujah. It's happening every single day. There are Yazidi slaves inside Fallujah. That is the vast bulk of the humanitarian violations.\nHowever, we are very concerned about some of these reports by some of these militia groups that are outside on the outskirts of Fallujah. And I would just say that even the leaders of these units have said this is totally unacceptable and they're going to hold people to account. And they have to hold people to account, because these types of incidents play right into ISIL's overall narrative.\nSo again, we faced this in the early days of Tikrit, and there was all sorts of projections of what might go wrong. We worked very hard with all the right actors to try to tamp things down. I think that was pretty successful. And that's what we're doing in Fallujah right now.\nI will say, the post-ISIL environment in a lot of these places is very chaotic. There's a sectarian dimension potentially, but there's also a kind of tribe-on-tribe dimension. And it is really complex.\nI told the story that last time I was here of a Yazidi who said, all I have left in my life is my revenge. There is a lot of that. And it's incumbent upon -- we're not on the ground in Fallujah. It's incumbent upon the actors and the government and the religious leaders to say the right things, to issue the right instructions, and to hold people accountable. So we are concerned about it, and we're talking to the right people almost 24/7 to try to make sure it's handled appropriately.\nQ: Do you feel that the government of Baghdad shares your concerns, that these Sunnis when they see these acts, they aren't pushed further into the arms of these extremist groups? If not ISIL, some other group that would replace ISIL in Iraq?\nMR. MCGURK: It's a great question. The government of Iraq certainly shares these concerns. Prime Minister Abadi is going to Fallujah almost every other day. And importantly he is bringing with him all the Sunni leadership of the country, the local leaders of Fallujah and Anbar province, and the national leaders in Baghdad.\nWhen I was in Baghdad about -- one of my trips recently, about six, seven weeks ago, I met with all the Anbari sheikhs, particularly in the area of eastern Anbar and Fallujah. And the driving demand to get into Fallujah and to liberate the city was coming from the Sunnis of Anbar province and from these areas. And so that is the plan. The forces to enter the city, I mentioned about 20 percent of them are local Fallujans. We're training the police to make sure the local police are controlling the streets afterwards.\nBut there are these reports of isolated incidents, which everybody is concerned about. And so, so far right now things seem to be relatively tamped down. And we have to make sure it stays that way.\nLet me just put one plug for the coalition in terms of local police. We are training now about 900 police leaders every three months. It has been a real success. It's how we've been able to get local people controlling the streets after ISIL. And we're looking to triple that number by October. That's one reason I met with the coalition today to talk about getting to that target.\nMR. EARNEST: Michelle.\nQ: Did you just say that those were local police?\nMR. MCGURK: Yes, so we want -- the idea after ISIL is that in a place like Tikrit, we want people from Tikrit to be the police controlling the streets.\nQ: -- yes, I just wanted quick clarification. But my actual question is, in about two years now, of these people being hounded by a 60-plus-member Western coalition, we really haven't seen the number of fighters go down all that much. It hasn't even been cut in half. So can you describe what the foreign-fighter flow looks like right now? How much of this 25,000-strong force are foreign fighters? Are they still pouring over the border from Syria? Maybe you could give us a sense of really how many fighters you think there have been in total since the beginning.\nMR. MCGURK: The numbers are -- so that's why there's a range, 19,000 to -- but their ability to get fighters into Syria is dramatically restricted. So our goal is to make sure that they can't get in, and once they're in, they're never going to get out.\nQ: But they're obviously still getting in, right?\nMR. MCGURK: Well, it's very hard for them to get in. So even in their own propaganda -- they have a magazine they release every couple of months called Dabiq Magazine. And in their own propaganda, they say, hey, join our great organization, but maybe don't come to Syria, go to Libya. And that was a sign that told us it's much harder for these guys to get into Syria.\nWe know from all of our sources of information it's much harder for them to get into Syria, and it's increasingly hard for them to get out. We also know from Libya, it's very difficult for them to get into Libya. The 5,000 fighters in Libya, most of them are actually North Africans or from Sub-Saharan Africa.\nSo the numbers have gone down substantially. Now, that said, as it's harder for them to get to Syria, what they're trying to do is to recruit local -- to inspire homegrown attacks. So someone who's inspired over the Internet, rather than being recruited to come into Syria, they're trying to recruit them to conduct attacks at home. They've always done that, but it's what they're increasingly trying to do.\nBut that's a very different challenge, and it's something that we all have to focus on. It will be with us for years. That's why all of us in Washington, the whole government, but across this kind of global international community have to focus on it. But it's a very different problem than what we saw in Brussels or what we saw in Paris, which are attacks organized in Raqqa by very sophisticated leaders -- organized in Raqqa, and then they send the operatives out to carry out the attack.\nSo, so long as they're pressured in Raqqa, they can't plan, they can't plot, and that's why we want to keep the pressure on them constantly.\nQ: Are these mostly foreign fighters still, though? Has the sort of demographic of who these people now are changed much?\nMR. MCGURK: I mean, ISIL is made up of a bulk. There are fighting forces all -- nearly all the suicide bombers, and they, in their own numbers, they claim to have done about 119 suicide bombs in May alone. And nearly all the suicide bombers are foreign fighters. And the suicide bombers are what gives them this kind of ruthless impact, both on the battlefield and against the civilian population.\nSome of their rank and file, they're Syrians, they're Iraqis. But there's a decreasing number of those.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay, I think we have time for one more. Richard, do you want to do the last one?\nQ: Thank you, Josh. I'd like you to tell us a little bit more about the contribution of the coalition partners. You just talked about the training being given. We can go through the daily round up by the NSC -- can you just tell us, as for the raids, is it mainly an American operation? In percentage, can you say it's like 90 percent American raids and 10 percent -- and also, as for ground troops, are we getting to a point where we'll have to ask more ground troops from coalition partners to complete the job on the ground?\nMR. MCGURK: So the coalition is -- the way we've organized the coalition, there's -- I don't want to go through it, but there's five lines of effort. There's military, there's countering foreign fighters, there's countering finance, there's countering propaganda, and then there's the humanitarian stabilization.\nOn the military, it's about 12 coalition partners are conducting air -- helping on the overall military air campaign. And the fact that it's strengthening and growing -- we've added about four partners -- Belgium, France, others are now also conducting operations with the U.K. in Syria just over the last four or five months.\nSince the Paris attacks -- I'll give you another statistic. Since the Paris attacks, we've increased the rate of strikes in Raqqa by about 100 percent, based upon additional resources from the coalition, additional support from the coalition. About 20 coalition partners have forces on the ground doing training, doing advising and assisting. And that's not all U.S.; that is a real, truly coalition effort. Even where our Special Forces are, we have a number of coalition partners together with our Special Forces. But we're organized across these different working groups.\nStabilization, which I mentioned, is led by Germany and the UAE. And this is -- it's that working group -- they meet about every month at different parts around the world to basically make sure we have this stabilization, this post-ISIL piece going as best as we can.\nOn the counter-messaging, I think I mentioned in my opening, it is U.K., Malaysia, UEA -- constant, 24/7 counter-messaging. And a huge role there, of course, with our partners in the Gulf. Because there is a religious dimension to this that obviously we can't be the leaders on.\nSo we're organized by the coalition through these multiple military, diplomatic and humanitarian lines of effort. And we hope to have a meeting here in Washington over the coming months to really bring a lot of this together. The last time we met was in Rome. I think the coalition, having just met with all the leaders of the entire 66-member coalition, we have a coherent strategy, a coherent global campaign plan. Every capital I'm in now I don't have to do a briefing of what we're doing. Everybody knows exactly what we're doing, and it's about how can we do this better and making sure that foreign fighters can't flow across borders, making sure we have the stabilization piece, making sure we're doing the counter-propaganda -- all of which supports the military campaign -- is something that is now kind of -- we're in a virtuous cycle of how it's going.\nWith that said, I close on a caveat I opened with: This is a tremendous challenge. These guys want to attack us. They want to attack us every single day. We have to remain vigilant, not just the United States of America but our coalition partners. And for the most part, we are, but of course, this is a challenge that will be with us for years.\nMR. EARNEST: Thank you, Brett.\nMR. MCGURK: Thank you.\nMR. EARNEST: Nicely done. Appreciate you coming. All right. You'll obviously have an opportunity to hear more from the President on this issue on Tuesday at the conclusion of the counter-ISIL meeting that he'll convene with his national security team at the Treasury Department.\nSo we've already taken a lot of questions today but I'll stick around and take a few more. Josh, do you want to start?\nQ: Sure. Josh, the President's decision to allow expanded airstrikes against the Taliban in Afghanistan, does the fact that we're once again focusing on the Taliban there as opposed to al Qaeda and other extremist groups like ISIS mean that the President will be more likely to approve allowing more than the 5,500 troops to stay at the end of his presidency?\nMR. EARNEST: It does not. And I would -- for a variety of reasons that I will explain, I would encourage you to not try to interpret anything about a future potential decision on troop numbers with the new authorities that have been given to our forces who are already in Afghanistan. Let me explain to you why.\nThe mission that our men and women in Afghanistan have been given and been conducting since 2015 is not any different today than it was yesterday. This mission is focused on two things. One is carrying out counterterrorism operations to protect the American people and our interests around the world. The other mission is a very important one as well, and that is to offer train, advice and assistance to Afghan security forces that are working hard to provide security in their own country.\nIt is now the responsibility, fully, of the Afghan government and the Afghan security forces to provide for the security of the nation of Afghanistan. And the United States and our NATO partners can be and have been supporting them by offering training, advice and assistance.\nIn many situations, U.S. military personnel, and, in some situations, contributions from NATO forces have been accompanying Special Operations Afghan forces on some operations. Those U.S. forces would not have a combat role per se, but rather would be offering advice and assistance even as these operations are being carried out.\nWhat these authorities will allow is it will allow U.S. forces to engage in similar efforts to accompany conventional Afghan security forces when they undertake operations. What this would allow is U.S. forces to be more proactive in supporting conventional Afghan forces as they take the fight to the Taliban. And this means, in some cases, offering close air support, or it means, in some cases, accompanying Afghan forces on the ground or in the air.\nAgain, to this point, U.S. forces and our NATO partners have, in some situations, been accompanying Afghan special operators. This authority would allow U.S. forces to accompany conventional Afghan forces in certain situations, but when they're accompanying them, they continue to be -- remain focused on the advise-and-assist mission that they've been carrying out now for almost two years.\nQ: And just quickly, Senator Perdue speaking to the Faith and Freedom group this morning suggested as a prayer for the President the verse of Psalms that says \"Let his days be few.\" And in case your familiarity with Psalms is as lacking as mine is, the next verse of that goes \"Let his children be fatherless and his wife a widow.\" Would the President like an apology from the senator for that comment?\nMR. EARNEST: I did make note of Senator Perdue's comments. As Senator Perdue considers whether or not an apology is appropriate, there are a variety of other Scripture he might consult.\nTim.\nQ: So Reuters reported that the Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman is coming to Washington next week. Can you confirm whether the Crown Prince is meeting with President Obama?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any -- I've seen some of these reports. I don't have any details about his potential travel or whether or not the details of his trip have been locked down at this point. But once we have some more updated details about his trip and about what sort of interactions he'll have with the U.S. government, then we'll provide those. But I would not anticipate that we'll have those today.\nJohn.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. The President told Jimmy Fallon he was happy that Trump is the Republican nominee. Does he believe that Secretary Clinton can easily defeat the presumptive Republican nominee, Mr. Trump?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, John, the President on a number of occasions has now made clear that it's important for Democrats to run scared and to engage in this debate fully, and not to take the results for granted. And I think the President made quite clear in the video that he released yesterday that he intends to be a forceful advocate for Secretary Clinton and the policies that this administration have been pursuing over the last seven and a half years, because he does view this as a choice facing the American people about whether or not the next President will be someone who is committed to policies that advance the interests of the middle class, that seek to advance the country's interests around the world by strengthening our alliances, or are we going to hand the keys to the White House to someone who is promising to tear down that progress.\nSo this is obviously an election that the President believes is a priority, and he'll be engaged accordingly. And he certainly will be making the case to Democrats, Republicans and independents across the country that the American people should consider this election a top priority as well.\nQ: So he's not taking the defeat of Donald Trump for granted.\nMR. EARNEST: Not at all.\nQ: Not at all. Another question, just a postscript on yesterday's meeting with Senator Sanders. Was there any discussion of Senator Sanders addressing the Democratic Convention, as many robust Democratic candidates who were nominated have addressed the convention on prime time in the past?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have a whole lot more details of their private conversation to share. If it did come up, I'm confident this was not something that they spent a lot of time discussing, primarily because the Democratic nominee is the individual who will be responsible for determining the program at the convention.\nSo presumably when -- if and when Senator Sanders and Secretary Clinton have an opportunity to meet, this will be on their agenda, but not something that President Obama would weigh in on.\nMichelle.\nQ: We saw Vice President Biden's open letter to the victim in this Stanford rape case talking about being \"filled with furious anger\" over it. Does the President share that view? And why doesn't this furious anger translate into making some comment on what is sort of the glaring issue here -- well, one of the glaring issues here that's caused so much concern is the sentence itself.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, you have heard the President I think, on a number of occasions, talk about how serious he believes the matter of sexual assault and violence against women is. And that's why the President has made clear in a variety of these settings just how wrong sexual assault is.\nThe President has made -- has stated unambiguously that there is no room for sexual assault or sexual harassment or violence against women in the United States military. There is no room for any of that on college campuses. And there surely is no room for that in our society. And the President has been unequivocal.\nAnd the President has been engaged in a number of efforts to combat sexual assault. The President and the Vice President have teamed up together to advance the It's On Us campaign. This is a grassroots effort to encourage men and women all across the country to take the It's On Us pledge, and that pledge essentially is to intervene in situations in which the risk of sexual assault might be elevated -- if you observe a situation, even in a social setting, to intervene to try to prevent a sexual assault from occurring -- and that we all have a responsibility to protect our community, to protect the people around us, and to intervene in those situations in which something like this seems like to occur.\nSo the President has quite strong feelings about this. The Vice President does too. The Vice President also has his own personal track record as a United States senator. Of course, Vice President Biden wrote the Violence Against Women Act, an historic piece of legislation that devoted significant resources to combatting violence against women all across the country.\nSo this is something that both the President and the Vice President have made a priority, not just because they believe that it matters as a policy matter, but because of their own deep personal conviction about how wrong sexual assault is.\nQ: I think it was just surprising to see some of the words and phrases that the Vice President chose. I mean, obviously he feels so strongly about this that he writes this open letter in that way. So would you say that the President is also angry about the details surrounding this case?\nMR. EARNEST: I think it is fair to say that the President feels strongly that every act of sexual assault and sexual violence and rape is wrong, and one that deserves a forceful rebuke to make clear to everyone that we have certain principles we have certain values in our country.\nNow, I'm not going to talk about any specific situation, and I'm not going to talk about the specific court decision.\nQ: Yes, but the obvious question is, when you say things like that -- \"strong feelings,\" Biden's \"furious anger,\" \"deserves a forceful rebuke\" -- the obvious question is, and what's angered so many people around America right now, is a six-month sentence a forceful rebuke?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, this is a court proceeding, and a criminal court proceeding. So I can't weigh in on it. But I think when I talk about a \"forceful rebuke,\" I'm making a clear reference to the fact that we need to just make clear to everybody that there's zero tolerance for sexual assault. There's no excuse for directing violence towards women, or engaging in sexual activity without consent. That's wrong. There's no excuse for it. There's no justification for it. There's no explaining your way out of it. And that's true in every setting.\nQ: A six-month sentence doesn't seem like zero tolerance, though.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I just can't weigh in on a specific decision that was handed down by a judge. There are legal proceedings underway here so I can't talk about any specific case.\nBut I can talk in generalities about how there can and should be no tolerance for sexual activity without consent, no tolerance for violence against women, no tolerance for sexual harassment, no tolerance for rape. And the President has been -- the President's comments and feelings about this have been unambiguous.\nQ: Okay, then just talking generally, would you say that there is not zero tolerance right there, given that somebody could get a six-month sentence for rape in America? That doesn't seem like zero tolerance. Would you agree that we're not yet at a point where there is zero tolerance?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the President's point is that anywhere in our society, when we see sexual violence taking place, it means we've got work to do. Even one instance of rape, even one instance of sexual assault is one too many. And it's not something that the President is going to accept. There is no resignation on the part of the President and the Vice President that this is just something that we're going to have to deal with as a society. It's something that we must confront seriously, and eradicate from our society. There's no tolerance for it. There's no justification for it. There's no explaining it away.\nAnd the goal of the It's On Us campaign is to make clear that we all have a responsibility for doing that. And this is something that the President feels strongly about.\nQ: Yes, I mean, but given -- you've expressed so many strong feelings right now, repeatedly saying that there's zero tolerance. So wouldn't this be a good time to speak out about a court case? I mean, what would be the harm in that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as we had an opportunity to talk about a little bit yesterday, there is -- it is important that people who are responsible for conducting criminal investigations, people who are presiding over criminal proceedings, need to feel confident that they can do so without any sort of political interference. They need to be guided by the facts and by the evidence, and by what the law says.\nAnd it's important that we avoid even the perception of a figure with significant political influence weighing in, trying to dictate or influence an outcome. That would erode confidence in our system of justice.\nAnd I guess what I would do, Michelle -- as you consider this, just as a thought experiment -- is to consider if you had a President of the United States who didn't have such strong feelings about eradicating sexual assault, and you can imagine a scenario where if that individual also failed to abide by a long tradition of respecting an independent judiciary, you can imagine a situation where that person might feel like they can influence -- or can try to influence a judge who had imposed what that person considered to be too harsh a sentence. We wouldn't have any tolerance for that, either. That certainly would erode our confidence in the justice system.\nSo we need a justice system that operates independently, and one that -- because that's the only way it can continue to have the confidence of the American people that everyone is subject to the rule of law, and the rule of law is applied fairly regardless of who you are, regardless of where you went to school, regardless of what political office you may hold.\nQ: And speaking of strong feelings, did the President sob at graduation, as he promised he would on many occasions?\nMR. EARNEST: When I walked out here, the President had not returned from graduation so I wasn't able to count the number of dirty Kleenexes he had stuffed in his pocket. (Laughter.)\nJim.\nQ: Over the past year, the Taliban in Afghanistan has made significant gains. U.S. military commanders have testified on the Hill that the situation in Afghanistan is deteriorating. So is the President's decision now to expand military authorities in Afghanistan -- airstrikes and embedding now, again, with Afghan forces -- an acknowledgement that it was a mistake to put limits on those authorities in the first place?\nMR. EARNEST: It was not, Jim. And here's the -- there continues to be concern about the security situation in Afghanistan. Afghanistan is a dangerous country. It has been for some time now, and it still is today. I don't think anybody, from the President on down, was under the illusion that after a couple of years of being responsible for the security situation of their own country, that the Afghan government and Afghan security forces would eliminate entirely the threat from the Taliban or any other extremists in that country.\nWhat we have seen, however, from Afghan security forces is a remarkable willingness to fight for their country. The forces are resilient, even in those situations where they do encounter operational or even strategic setbacks. There's been a willingness on the part of the Afghan forces to reorganize and take the fight back to their adversaries. And some of that is evidence of a successful effort on the part of the United States and our NATO partners to train Afghan forces, but some of that is also the built-in national pride of Afghan security forces to fight for their country and to counter the threat from extremists.\nAfter all, when the Taliban carries out a bombing in Kabul or anywhere else in the country, most of the victims are Afghans. So it makes sense that Afghan security forces would feel, as a point of national pride, a desire to eradicate those violent extremists from the midst of their country.\nAnd that resilience and that commitment to fighting for their country has shown on the battlefield. The question I think has simply been, what else can the United States do to support them in those efforts? The President feels strongly that the Afghans must remain in control of the security situation in their own country. The U.S. combat role in Afghanistan ended at the end of 2014, and the President is not considering restarting it.\nBut the question is, is it possible for us to be more proactive in supporting conventional Afghan security forces? And we anticipate that by offering them more support in the form of advice and assistance, and occasionally accompanying them on their operations, that they are likely to be more effective on the battlefield. And that's the goal here, and that's the goal that the United States has pledged for years now, which is to support the Afghan central government and support the Afghan security forces as they provide for the security situation in their country.\nQ: How is expanding those authorities, however, not thrusting the U.S. military back into a combat role, direct combat role, in Afghanistan?\nMR. EARNEST: Because they will be offering advice and assistance to Afghan forces, conventional Afghan forces --\nQ: But not -- airstrikes are airstrikes. They're combat operations. They're not ground combat operations, but they are combat operations.\nMR. EARNEST: Look, there have been counterterrorism operations that have been undertaken by the United States forces and by --\nQ: But the expansion of authorities, as I understand it, goes beyond what the rules were previously to go beyond the terrorism aspect and to attack large gatherings of Taliban who are not presenting a terrorist threat.\nMR. EARNEST: What the authorities allow our forces to do is to provide the kind of advice and support that they have, up to this point, been previously providing to Afghan Special Forces. Now they will be lending that assistance to conventional Afghan forces.\nAnd the President has been very clear about what their responsibilities are, and in some cases, this means providing some close air support, and in some cases this does mean accompanying Afghan forces on their mission. But when we're talking about the operations that are underway on the ground, U.S. forces that are operating on the ground do not have a combat mission. Those U.S. forces are there under a mission to offer advice and assistance.\nNow, we've had this conversation in the context of Iraq and Syria; it applies in Afghanistan too. These forces are trained for combat. They certainly are going to be armed for combat. And the reason for that is simple: They're in a dangerous situation. They're putting themselves at great risk to try to advance our efforts in Afghanistan. And that means that they are performing a remarkable service to this country. They are aiding our national security. We owe them a debt of gratitude. But this is what they do willingly because they have been given orders by the President of the United States and by their Commander-in-Chief, and they're fulfilling them.\nBut it's important for everybody to understand exactly what those orders are. For our forces that are operating on the ground, they have not been given a combat mission. They have been given a mission to offer training, advice and assistance to Afghan security forces.\nQ: Whether intended or not, like in Iraq and Syria, however, they could be drawn into a combat situation.\nMR. EARNEST: There's no denying that. And the President, when he spoke at Arlington Cemetery on Memorial Day, noted the loss of American lives, both in Iraq and in Syria and in Afghanistan. And it's a dangerous place. And we certainly don't take for granted the remarkable courage that is displayed by American servicemembers on the battlefield in Afghanistan, and we certainly do owe them a deep debt of gratitude. Because the work that they are doing there, as we learned painfully on 9/11, has a direct consequence on the national security of the United States.\nQ: And is there any time limit based on these new authorities? Because earlier it seemed to me you were avoiding a question about whether the President would be able to reduce the number of forces down to 5,000 by the end of this year. But that seems to indicate you expect this expanded authority to be over by the end of this year, because how could you possibly do it and still reduce the forces?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Jim, you've been covering these issues for a long time in more detail than I have. What my understanding is, is that even -- that if the plan to draw down U.S. forces to 5,500 by the end of this year moves forward, that would still be a sufficient -- at a sufficient level to carry out these expanded authorities where necessary. So the point that I'm trying to make is, just because these expanded authorities have been authorized by the Commander-in-Chief, that does not limit in any way our ability to follow through with the plan to draw down our troops at a level of 5,500 troops by the end of this year.\nGary.\nQ: Josh, in terms of the troop numbers without this military authority being there on the ground and actually seeing the extent to which it is implemented, how can we say at this point whether or not that 5,500 number of troops would, in fact, be adequate to carry out those operations?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, this is what -- this is based on the briefing that I received from the Department of Defense that obviously you can consult with my colleagues over there. But my understanding is that there is nothing about these expanded authorities that would prevent the drawdown of troops to the level -- to the 5,500 level by the end of this year.\nQ: And then along those lines, because the extent to which that is used is largely left to the commanders there on the ground --\nMR. EARNEST: That's correct.\nQ: -- is there concern that if it is, in fact, heavily used, that it could end up leading to or resulting in an expanded footprint there on the ground, out of necessity?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think actually what our military commanders in Afghanistan have said about this is that their intent is to use these new authorities judiciously. And the idea here is to put U.S. forces in a way -- in a position where they can be more proactively supportive of operations led by Afghan security forces on the ground. But not in every situation, but in situations where our commanders on the ground, based on their knowledge of those forces, based on their knowledge of the terrain, based on their knowledge of the operation, can determine whether or not that kind of stepped-up assistance is necessary.\nSo this is something that our -- so when we talk about expanded authorities, we're talking about authority that the President of the United States has granted to our commanders on the ground in Afghanistan to have somewhat more latitude in asking our forces and commanding our forces to carry out these advise-and-assist missions in support of Afghan-led efforts.\nQ: And lastly, can you elaborate again -- I know you touched on it earlier -- but elaborate on how this is not a reversal, in terms of strategy and policy there in Afghanistan, for the U.S. military.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, first of all, it doesn't forestall or prevent us moving forward on the strategy that the President laid out last for drawing down our troop levels to 5,500 at the end of the year. This does not reflect a change in the basic mission that our men and women in uniform in Afghanistan are performing. This is not a restarting of combat operations. Those combat operations ended in 2014.\nBut what this is, is it does allow U.S. forces to provide the kind of advice and assistance to conventional Afghan security forces that, up to this point, have already been provided to Afghan Special Forces. So that is some expanded authority. We do anticipate that this could enhance the effectiveness of conventional Afghan security forces on the ground. But, ultimately, these are decisions that will be made by U.S. commanders on the ground, but it does not change the basic mission. It does not change the trajectory that the President laid out last year for troop levels. But we do believe that it could enhance the performance of Afghan security forces that are fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan.\nQ: Because at the core, it seems like you're giving the U.S. forces more to do, with the idea of having less U.S. forces there on the ground to do it.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the way that I would describe it is we are actually giving our commanders on the ground the ability to decide to do more where it's appropriate. And that's why it is not a change in our mission, but rather it gives them the opportunity to conduct this mission of advice and assistance in slightly more areas if our commanders have concluded that it's beneficial.\nQ: And they could conclude on a widespread basis that it is necessary to carry those out, though?\nMR. EARNEST: They potentially could conclude that, but they have indicated that that is not their intent at this point.\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, you've used the word \"if\" when you talked about future decisions that might be made on troop levels. Are you just leaving the President negotiating room there -- maneuvering room? Or are you suggesting that this is something that will be looked at?\nMR. EARNEST: What I'm suggesting is -- first of all, this is not a negotiation. It's the Commander-in-Chief who will make a decision.\nQ: Maneuvering is --\nMR. EARNEST: I understood, I just --\nQ: -- self-corrected.\nMR. EARNEST: -- it's okay. I'm not clarifying you, I'm just trying to -- I'm not correcting you, I'm just trying to clarify the record here, in terms of the President's approach.\nSo he's the Commander-in-Chief. We have said all along that he gets regular updates on this situation from members of his national security team, based here in Washington, and based at Central Command down in Tampa. He'll also get some advice from our commanders on the ground, and he will take that input and consider broader strategic decisions about the appropriate troop levels in Afghanistan.\nThe current plan is for 9,800 servicemembers to remain in Afghanistan for most of this year, but to draw down that number to 5,500 by the end of the year. General Nicholson, who recently took command of operations in Afghanistan, has indicated that he was going to conduct a review of our efforts there. And the President, at this point, has not received a specific recommendation to change the troop levels in Afghanistan. But the President will certainly -- the point that I want to make, though, is -- the reason I bring that up is that the President is certainly interested in the advice from his commanders on the ground about the strategy moving forward.\nQ: So he'd consider it if that was the recommendation of the general? Reconsider troop levels?\nMR. EARNEST: That's correct.\nQ: I want to also ask you -- there was a letter published on this topic just a week or so ago by a number of prominent former military commanders, including General John Campbell, who just left command; General Petraeus -- a number of very top diplomats who had served this administration -- Ryan Crocker, Cunningham, a number of people. And they were saying basically that this President needs to leave his successor room to make his or her own decision thus freeze at 9,800. Is that something that the President is taking onboard? I mean, what do you make of that, given that this President has said he was handed a lot of very difficult circumstances coming into office, when he looks at battlefields. Wouldn't he appreciate giving his successor the decision of making the drawdown?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what is surely true is that President Obama's successor, regardless of who that person is, that person will be inheriting a situation in Afghanistan that is far improved from what President Obama inherited, both in terms of the security situation on the ground, but also in terms of the number of U.S. forces that are operating in that country.\nWhen President Obama took office, between Iraq and Afghanistan there were 180,000 U.S. troops on the ground. Now, here in the last few months of the Obama presidency, the combined number of forces in Iraq and Afghanistan is about 15,000. So less than 10 percent of the troop levels that President Obama inherited. And the truth is, the security situation in Afghanistan is improved.\nIt's still a dangerous place. I'm certainly not discounting the risk that our men and women in uniform take every single day to undertake this mission, but because of the strategic decisions that President Obama has made over the last seven years, we have succeeded in decimating core al Qaeda that was previously operating in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region. And we have an Afghan central government that is committed to the task of securing their country and is an effective partner with the United States in pursuing that goal.\nSo the next President will inherit a much better situation in Afghanistan than the one that President Obama accepted. But, look, when the President talked about -- last talked about troop numbers in Afghanistan -- I believe this was last fall -- I think the President made quite clear his thought process about designing a strategy for Afghanistan that would enhance the ability of the next Commander-in-Chief to succeed in implementing a strategy that makes the American people safer.\nAnd we've made tremendous progress in making the American people safer because of our efforts in Afghanistan. And the President is very interested in making sure that the next President is somebody who is committed to building on that progress.\nSo this is an argument that you've often heard me make in the context of the U.S. economy. I think it's very relevant and resonant in the context of the U.S. economy. But it also directly applies to the situation in Afghanistan; that we've made remarkable progress over the last seven years in making the American people safer, in improving the situation on the ground in Afghanistan, in drawing down troop levels from Afghanistan. And the President is certainly interested in making sure that the next President is somebody who is committed to building on that progress. And that means the President wants the next President to inherit a situation in which we maintain our momentum forward.\nQ: But this would be a political consideration or perhaps a conversation with the successor candidate?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I would not anticipate that the President will consult with the candidates for President as he is making this decision. The President will be making this decision in consultation with his national security team in Washington and his military commanders in Tampa and on the ground in Afghanistan.\nQ: Political -- is what I meant.\nMR. EARNEST: I see. I think it's hard to predict at this point exactly what kinds of conversations would be taking place. The President is interested in -- particularly when we get to a situation where there is a President-elect, the President would want to make sure that the President-elect understands what our strategy is and understands the strategy that we've been pursuing based on the guidance of our military -- of his military commanders.\nBut over the next several months as the strategy is designed, the President will be relying on the advice of his national security team.\nKaren.\nQ: Just quick follow-up on Michelle's question. There's a petition on Whitehouse.gov to impeach the judge in the Stanford sexual assault case. And it's surpassed the 100,000 signatures for a White House response. Will there be a White House response?\nMR. EARNEST: There will be a White House response. There is not one yet, but stay tuned. We'll make sure you all get it.\nAndrew.\nQ: In October, last year, the President urged parties in the region to get the Taliban back to the negotiating table. Does this decision reflect the reality that those talks -- the prospect of talks is dead?\nMR. EARNEST: It does not. We are continuing to urge actors in the region to be supportive of a Afghan-led reconciliation effort with the Taliban.\nA couple of weeks ago, the United States military took action in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region to take out the leader of the Taliban who was viewed as a significant impediment to the continuation of those talks. It's too early to assess at this point what impact that will have on the direction of the talks. But we're going to continue to encourage all parties to participate in that Afghan-led process.\nJustin. I'll give you the last one, Justin, here, and we'll do the week ahead.\nQ: Yes, just a quick one. I think you raised some eyebrows yesterday in your exchange with James when you referred to the FBI inquiry into Secretary Clinton's emails as a criminal investigation.\nMR. EARNEST: They seemed to be largely eyebrows at my -- at the Republican National Committee headquarters.\nQ: Well, the Clinton campaign has repeatedly said that this is not a criminal investigation. It says it on her campaign website. So I'm wondering did you sort of misspeak or --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what I've said is on a number of occasions that I have not been briefed by the Department of Justice about the investigation. So questions about the nature of the investigation should be directed to the Department of Justice. I've said that on many previous occasions.\nThe point that I was making is that the ongoing investigation at the Department of Justice is one that is being conducted independent of any sort of political interference, and any sort of -- the President has complete confidence that the individuals who are responsible for conducting that investigation -- these are career employees at the Department of Justice -- these are individuals who understand that they should not be swayed by anything that the President has to say.\nThe President of the United States wants them -- and is confident that they will, in fact, pursue the facts, follow the evidence, and lead to a conclusion that is supported by the facts and the evidence.\nQ: But you don't know whether or not this is a criminal inquiry?\nMR. EARNEST: I would have no insight into that because I'm not getting any sort of briefings from the Department of Justice about that ongoing investigation.\nThank you for giving me the opportunity to clarify.\nLet's do the week ahead. On Monday, the President will attend meetings here at the White House.\nOn Tuesday, as I mentioned, the President will convene his National Security Council over at the Treasury Department. That afternoon, on Tuesday afternoon, the President will deliver remarks at the first ever United State of Women Summit to mark the progress made by and for women and girls domestically and internationally over the course of this administration and to discuss solutions to the challenges that they continue to face. That evening the President will host a picnic for members of Congress at the White House. Senator Perdue's attendance is still TBD. (Laughter.) But his invitation remains. (Laughter.)\nOn Wednesday, the President will travel to Green Bay, Wisconsin for a Hillary For America campaign event. Additional details on the President's travel to Wisconsin will be made available in the coming days.\nOn Thursday, the President will attend meetings here at the White House.\nAnd as we announced yesterday, on Friday, the President and the First Family will travel to Carlsbad Caverns National Park in New Mexico and Yosemite National Park in California. Additional details about their travel to New Mexico and California will be made available early next week. The President and the First Family will return to Washington on Sunday evening.\nQ: Is that a graduation present? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Actually, it's an opportunity for the President and the First Family to mark the centennial of our national park system. So I suspect they'll have some fun. But also it's an opportunity to symbolically acknowledge the important role that the U.S. government has in protecting some of the most beautiful vistas and territory in the country. So the President and the First Lady are very much looking forward to the trip.\nThanks, everybody. Have a great weekend.\nEND 2:12 P.M.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122639", "text": "Today at the White House, Domestic Policy Council Director Cecilia Muсoz and Education Secretary John King will host 15 higher education public and private institutions from across the country who are standing with the Obama Administration as founding partners in launching the Fair Chance Higher Education Pledge. In total, 25 institutions have taken the pledge, including: Ancilla College, Arizona State University, Auburn University, Boston University, City University of New York, College of Saint Benedict, Columbia University, Eastern University, Howard University, New York University, North Park University, Nyack College, Raritan Valley Community College, Rutgers University (Biomedical and Health Sciences, Camden, Newark and New Brunswick), Saint John's University, San Francisco State University, State University of New York, Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York, University of California System, University of Pittsburgh at Bradford, University of Puget Sound and University of Washington. These institutions represent and serve more than one million students. More information about the pledge is available HERE.\nSince the President took office, this Administration has been committed to reforming America's criminal justice system and expanding college opportunity.\nIn July 2015, the President highlighted the importance of reducing barriers facing people who have been in contact with the criminal justice system and are trying to put their lives back on track, and emphasized that a smarter approach to reducing crime and enhancing public safety must begin with investing in all of our communities. Right now, there are 2.2 million Americans behind bars, and more than 600,000 inmates are released each year. An estimated 70 million or more Americans have some sort of criminal record -- almost one in five of all Americans; almost one in three Americans of working age.\nToo often, a criminal record disqualifies Americans from being full participants in our society -- even after they've already paid their debt to society. This includes admissions processes for educational institutions that can make it difficult if not impossible for those with criminal records to get an education that can lead to a job. As President Obama has said, \"that's bad for not only those individuals, it's bad for our economy. It's bad for the communities that desperately need more role models who are gainfully employed. So we've got to make sure Americans who've paid their debt to society can earn their second chance.\"\nToday's announcement provides higher education institutions and a broad array of coalitions with an opportunity to voice their support for the reforms needed to remove unnecessary barriers to college access.\nBy signing the Fair Chance Higher Education Pledge, these higher education institutions are:\n•      Demonstrating an ongoing commitment to take action to reduce barriers to a fair shot at a second chance, especially though an educational opportunity, including adopting fair chance admissions practices like going \"Beyond the Box\" by determining whether criminal justice-related questions are necessary to make an informed admission decision, and if so, whether these questions should be moved to a later part of the application process (e.g., after schools make an initial admission decision or after students meet the academic criteria), or whether the initial review of the application can be conducted without knowledge of the answers to the criminal-justice related questions.\n•      Taking action in their local communities by supporting professors and students who want to teach or are teaching in correctional facilities and ensuring internships and job training are available to individuals with criminal records.\n•      Setting an example for their peers. The Fair Chance Higher Education Pledge is available for more higher education institutions to sign on  at this link. The Obama Administration will highlight these additional pledge takers later this year.\nLast month the Department of Education released The \"Beyond the Box\" Resource Guide. The Guide provides information for colleges and universities to help remove barriers that can prevent citizens with criminal records from pursuing higher education. The guide also encourages alternatives to inquiring about criminal histories during college admissions and provides recommendations to support a holistic review of applicants. More information is available HERE.\nEarlier this year, the White House launched the Fair Chance Business Pledge, a call-to-action for all members of the private sector to improve their communities by eliminating barriers in employment for those with a criminal record and creating a pathway for a second chance. Over 100 organizations have joined the pledge, including: American Airlines, The Coca-Cola Company, Facebook, Georgia Pacific, Google, The Hershey Company, The Johns Hopkins Hospital and Health System, Koch Industries, PepsiCo, Prudential, Starbucks, Uber, Under Amour/Plank Industries, Unilever and Xerox. A full list of companies who have signed the Fair Chance Business Pledge is available HERE.\n* * *\nTHE FAIR CHANCE HIGHER EDUCATION PLEDGE\nWe applaud the growing number of public and private colleges and universities nationwide who are taking action to ensure that all Americans have the opportunity to succeed, including individuals who have had contact with the criminal justice system. When an estimated 70 million or more Americans — nearly one in three adults — have a criminal record, it is important to remove unnecessary barriers that may prevent these individuals from gaining access to education and training that can be so critical to career success and lead to a fulfilled and productive life. We are committed to providing individuals with criminal records, including formerly incarcerated individuals, a fair chance to seek a higher education to obtain the knowledge and skills needed to contribute to our Nation's growing economy.\nThese institutions put forth their pledges as follows:\n•      Arizona State University (AZ)\no      Arizona State University is an institution committed to making higher education accessible to the millions of individual capable of doing college level work who want to better his or her life. This is why ASU is signing the Fair Chance Pledge. We must remove barriers to success in education and employment for everyone, including individuals with criminal convictions, who have demonstrated a commitment to academic and professional success post-incarceration. We as a nation must create opportunities for these individuals if we expect them to follow a different path than the one that led them to prison.\no      The innovation and mold-breaking that are hallmarks of ASU are all in service of this broad mission of inclusiveness and opportunity. Like our partnerships with Starbucks to make college free to all their employees and the launch of the open-access Global Freshman Academy, the Fair Chance pledge represents a belief that opportunities must be given for self-improvement to all those who are willing to expend the necessary effort and commitment. It is the key to the long-term success of our nation.\no      Auburn is committed to its land-grant traditions of service and access through the rigors of academic study and a welcoming, inclusive campus community. The first priority in the Auburn strategic plan is enhancing student success and diversifying enrollment, and eliminating unnecessary barriers provides one avenue toward those objectives. Auburn's reputation for providing a challenging and practical learning experience is strengthened through integrated academic and student life programs that equip students of varied backgrounds to become leaders in their professions and communities.\n•      Auburn University (AL)\no      Auburn is committed to its land-grant traditions of service and access through the rigors of academic study and a welcoming, inclusive campus community. The first priority in the Auburn strategic plan is enhancing student success and diversifying enrollment, and eliminating unnecessary barriers provides one avenue toward those objectives. Auburn's reputation for providing a challenging and practical learning experience is strengthened through integrated academic and student life programs that equip students of varied backgrounds to become leaders in their professions and communities.\n•      Boston University (MA)\no      Boston University has a tradition of inclusiveness and service to the community that goes back to its founding charter. We believe in the power of education to elevate, nurture, and transform. BU has delivered college-level courses in correctional institutions since 1972, which makes our prison education program one of the oldest continuously operating programs in the country. While education is difficult to deliver in prison, we know that education's power to change lives is critical in prison. Today BU continues to offer a full Bachelor's degree to incarcerated individuals and provides over $1,500,000 annually for scholarships, books, instructional and administrative support. We also support scholarships for the staff of the correctional institutions. Our program improves the climate within the correctional institution and helps prisoners obtain the intellectual leverage they need to revise their view of themselves and emerge from prison better equipped to contribute positively to their families and communities.\n•      City University of New York (NY)\no      CUNY strongly believes that educational opportunity is critical to helping formerly incarcerated people re-enter society with the knowledge and skills to become productive, self-sufficient citizens. Public dollars are saved by reducing recidivism, while safer communities are created. With CUNY's John Jay College of Criminal Justice in the lead, and working in close collaboration with Hostos Community College, programs have been developed to provide academic courses to inmates. The University currently operates the Prison to College Pipeline -- known as P2CP – through John Jay's Prisoner Reentry Institute. This effort brings accredited courses, which are privately funded, to inmates at several New York State correctional facilities, and the University has plans to expand to other prisons.\n•      Columbia University (NY)\no      As an academic institution committed to inclusion and excellence, Columbia University has a particular responsibility to support enhancing access to college education and employment for those who need a second chance and, more broadly, for those from communities bearing the brunt of mass incarceration. Signing the Fair Chance pledge provides an opportunity to reaffirm the scope of Columbia's commitment in these areas:\no      Columbia is committed to policies and practices that ensure fair, equitable, and well-informed consideration of all prospective students and employees, including those with a criminal record.\no      Columbia faculty teach in prisons, jails and, on the Columbia campus, in programs that make it possible for students who have returned from prison to continue their education and to increase their opportunities for employment.\no      Columbia is committed to supporting the success of the members of its community who have experienced incarceration and to valuing their contributions to the vibrancy of our academic community and to the public discourse on criminal justice reform.\no      Faculty, students, and staff across the University carry out research that advances the analysis and understanding of social issues that have contributed to and result from mass incarceration. Many members of our academic community are civically engaged in addressing those issues as well.\n•      Cornell University (NY)\no      Cornell University was founded on egalitarian principles of providing access to higher education for all academically-qualified students, and a practical vision of higher education dedicated to a land-grant mission of public service and engagement. Cornell strives to foster diversity in our student populations by seeking, admitting, and graduating students from all backgrounds. These values are consistent with the Fair Chance Higher Education Pledge that encourages colleges and universities to commit to actions so that all American have the opportunity to succeed through pursuing advanced education. Cornell considers criminal history information of any applicant only in later stages of the admissions process and provides an opportunity for applicants to provide explanatory information. Once admitted, Cornell provides a supportive campus environment. We are proud to take action in our own region through the Cornell Prison Education Program, providing academic opportunities for incarcerated students, some of whom have been admitted to Cornell University following their affiliation with that program.\n•      Eastern University (PA)\no      Eastern University supports the Fair Chance Higher Education Pledge and appreciates the White House's efforts to ensure that our nation's many returning citizens are greeted with opportunity as they return to their homes and communities. The Fair Chance Higher Education Pledge is consistent with Eastern University's history and practice of seeking to remove barriers to educational attainment that many of our neighbors experience. Over the years, Eastern has embraced initiatives, built programs, and sought partnerships that have allowed it to better provide educational opportunities to populations side-lined by the dominant practices of higher education. This creative activity reflects our commitment to values reflected in our motto, \"Faith, Reason, & Justice.\" In a manner congruent with those ends, we are dedicated to providing all individuals who seek an Eastern University education, including those who have been incarcerated, a fair chance at gaining the knowledge and credentials they need so that they may access the opportunities they seek. One expression of Eastern University's commitment to returning citizens is a June 2016 Conference on Reentry sponsored by our Center for Urban Youth Development, a City Councilman, several area nonprofits, and a church in Philadelphia. At Eastern University, embracing the Fair Chance Higher Education Pledge is more than mere words. It is an expression of our history and core identity.\n•      Howard University (DC)\no      Since being chartered by the U.S. Congress on March 2, 1867, Howard University has been dedicated to researching and developing solutions to address the disparities and social ills that affect our communities, nation and the world, with a legacy of breaking barriers and creating opportunities. Through its admission practices, Howard University works to provide inclusive opportunity and an equal chance to all who are preparing themselves for postsecondary education. The University recognizes academic talent and potential, despite an applicant's economic or social circumstances, and already provides a broad array of support services to help students successfully complete their higher education. Howard University instills in all of its students its time honored principles of In Truth and Service.\n•      New York University (NY)\no      At NYU, we believe in second chances and in the role of universities as engines of social mobility. We are also sensitive to the concerns about how equitably our justice system serves our society. NYU reviews all candidates for undergraduate admission holistically, and criminal conviction has never been an automatic bar to admission; every year, we admit applicants who \"checked the box.\" Even as NYU remains committed to providing a safe environment for our students, we think the modifications we've made to our admissions process -- in which applications' first readings are \"box blind\" -- are an important step in the right direction. And we look forward to continuing the dialogue, posing questions, and carrying out the research about the role and value of the \"box.\"\n•      North Park University, Chicago (IL)\no      North Park University in Chicago educates students for lives of significance and service. We believe that all people desiring a high-quality education deserve the opportunity. This has meant expanding the range of students we are educating, and expanding the support services we provide. Over the past few years we have been holding courses in a state prison. Several of those students have asked if, upon their release, they can continue their education at North Park. It is important to us that they can do so. We applaud the Fair Chance Higher Education Pledge, and we will work diligently to create pathways for a second chance for people with a criminal record. We are delighted to join fellow universities in working to remove unnecessary barriers for a higher education and becoming places of hope and opportunity.\n•      Raritan Valley Community College (NJ)\no      Raritan Valley Community College, a major partner in the New Jersey Scholarship and Transformative Education in Prisons Consortium (NJ-STEP), is especially proud to applaud and to support the White House Fair Chance Business Pledge. As a mission-driven college of opportunity, Raritan Valley believes in the transformative power of education. In providing incarcerated students with a dynamic and innovative learning environment, in offering students the opportunity to earn an Associates Degree, and in building a seamless transition into a four-year college, we help to create that \"pathway for a second chance.\" We are honored to include these remarkable graduates as our alumni and as our most persuasive and eloquent examples of success.\n•      Rutgers University (NJ)\no      Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, has over 60,000 students spread across its three universities in Camden, Newark, and New Brunswick, as well as Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences. For more than a decade, Rutgers has been building new strategies for providing higher education to people with prior criminal justice histories. Our seminal effort, the Mountainview Program, was a peer, on-campus, student community for students who have previously been incarcerated. It showed that a campus support system can produce substantial educational outcomes: more than 100 students enrolled, over 40 baccalaureate degrees to date from more than 6 different Rutgers schools, 6 master's degrees from distinguished institutions around the country, and Rutgers' two most recent Truman Scholars. Today we host NJ-STEP, a consortium of New Jersey higher education institutions which offers dozens of college courses throughout New Jersey's state prison system, provides transition services to ensure that people released from prison enroll in New Jerseys colleges, and oversees the Mountainview communities now operating at all Rutgers universities.\no      Rutgers' mission is to serve New Jersey's most promising students by providing educational opportunity, and to achieve that mission we make a special effort to promote educational access for students who come from previously excluded groups. Our three different universities offer a range of options for those with previous criminal justice involvement, and we particularly note that two of our universities are located in cities whose residents are at elevated risk of criminal justice contact. Our philosophy is to make college available to any New Jersey resident who can succeed academically at Rutgers, without preconceptions about prior justice system experiences. Once students with criminal justice histories are admitted, we work hard to make sure they are supported academically and personally while they study on our campuses. This, we know, is a key to success.\no      More importantly, we take pride in the degree to which theses students participate fully in our campus life, make contributions to the broader Rutgers community while they study here, and bring credit to themselves, to Rutgers, and to the State of New Jersey in the way they use their education to build successful lives after they graduate.\n•      San Francisco State University (CA)\no      San Francisco State University applauds the growing number of public and private colleges and universities nationwide who are taking action to ensure that all Americans have the opportunity to succeed, including individuals who have had contact with the criminal justice system. When an estimated 70 million or more Americans — nearly one in three adults — have a criminal record, it is important to remove unnecessary barriers that may prevent these individuals from gaining access to education and training that can be so critical to career success and lead to a fulfilled and productive life. We are committed to providing individuals with criminal records, including formerly incarcerated individuals, a fair chance to seek a higher education to obtain the knowledge and skills needed to contribute to our Nation's growing economy.\no      Founded in 1967, Project Rebound at San Francisco State University is a special support program for students transitioning out of prison and jail which has helped hundreds of formerly incarcerated individuals to earn bachelor's degrees and beyond. Project Rebound is a proven model that reduces recidivism and empowers criminal justice-involved individuals through higher education. The CSU Project Rebound Consortium has developed a three-year plan to establish and expand programs for formerly incarcerated students across the CSU system. Each university plans to develop a campus-based re-entry program to help motivated individuals to prepare for college, apply for admission, enroll, persist, and graduate, ready to enter the workforce. Key objectives for the next three-years include:\no      Build the capacity of CSU campus administrators, faculty and staff to serve currently and formerly incarcerated students.\no      Create on-ramps between state and county correctional facilities and CSU campuses, and develop connections with reentry service providers to support student success.\no      Identify and support enrolled students and help prospective students to prepare, apply, matriculate, persist, and graduate.\no      Develop a data collection, management, and evaluation system to inform program development and to communicate program outcomes.\n•      State University of New York (NY)\no      The nation's largest comprehensive public university system, The State University of New York (SUNY), was established in 1948 to create opportunity and increase access to quality higher education. For individuals across the New York State and the nation who have a history with the criminal justice system, access to college can be a challenge due to requirements for disclosure of criminal records and other barriers - both real and perceived - throughout the application process. To combat this issue and bolster its commitment to providing educational opportunity for every New Yorker, a SUNY workgroup is consulting with campus and community stakeholders throughout the state as the 64-campus university system prepares to improve pathways to college for justice-involved individuals as recommended by \"beyond the box.\"\n•      University of Pittsburgh, Bradford (PA)\no      The University of Pittsburgh at Bradford community proudly supports the Fair Chance Higher Education Pledge. We are fully committed to creating a mutually respectful, enterprising, and intellectually curious community of students, faculty, and staff who value and embrace diversity in all of its forms, manifestations, and expressions. This pledge only strengthens our educational partnership with Bureau of Prisons (BOP) Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) McKean.\n•      University of Puget Sound (WA)\no      Puget Sound has adopted fair chance admission practices that include considering criminal justice questions only in the later part of a holistic read of all admission files, giving all prospective students an opportunity to explain criminal justice involvement and preparedness for postsecondary study, communicating clearly on the Puget Sound website (item 16) how justice and discipline involvement will be considered, and demonstrating a clear record of admitting students who have reported history of justice or discipline involvement. In faculty and staff hiring processes, contingent offers precede criminal background checks; results are considered in the context of the specific position description. We have a strong set of programs in support of campus safety, including prevention of and response to sexual assault. Our campus also supports the Freedom Education Project Puget Sound as a signature initiative in civic scholarship, which includes establishing mutual, reciprocal community partnerships to support justice-involved individuals and providing high quality liberal arts education at the Washington Correctional Center for Women. Twenty-three Puget Sound faculty to-date have taught in the program and a long list of students has served as tutors and volunteers, and – this summer – in a new internship program at the prison. The Race and Pedagogy Initiative, another signature initiative, has hosted campus-community summit sessions on race, education, and justice.\n•      University of Washington (WA)\no      The University of Washington is committed to reducing barriers and challenges to achieving a high-quality higher education — that is the foundation of our Race and Equity Initiative. The UW believes, fundamentally, that higher education allows individuals boundless opportunities. This is why the UW, through our faculty and graduate students, is a long-time active partner in University Beyond Bars and Freedom Education Project Puget Sound, which together recently applied for the pilot program allowing incarcerated individuals eligible for PELL grant funding to pursue BA degree completion. The UW leads by example in helping individuals put their lives back on track and investing broadly in our community through our Inner Pipeline Seminars, which includes a community practicum inside the King County Correctional Facility; through programs like UW's Mixed Enrollment Courses, where UW faculty teach classes combining students from campus and from inside a prison learning together; as well as on-going and expanded teacher training, volunteer teaching, and active research programs for greater collaboration to reach across prison walls and connect academic institutions, incarceration facilities, and incarcerated individuals to better understand challenges and develop better tools, training and assessments to support individuals for re-entry.\nAdditional signatories to the Fair Chance Higher Education Pledge:\n•      Ancilla College (IN)\n•      College of Saint Benedict (MN)\n•      Nyack College (NY)\n•      Saint John's University (MN)\n•      University of California System (CA)", "timestamp": "2016-06-10", "title": "Fact Sheet: White House Launches the Fair Chance Higher Education Pledge"}

Driven by their unyielding spirit and drawing inspiration from the Stars and Stripes, a string of 13 Colonies later expanded to become a united 50 States. Throughout our history, the American flag has steadfastly served as an emblem of this great experiment in democracy. On Flag Day and during National Flag Week, we pledge our allegiance to the banner that has served as a guiding symbol on our Nation's journey, and we celebrate the hope it inspires in the American people.\nWith hands over hearts, Americans of all backgrounds and beliefs have long saluted Old Glory and honored its legacy. Our flag persists as a powerful representation of freedom and opportunity. Waving high above capitol buildings and courthouses, military bases and embassies across the globe, and on the distant surface of the moon, it calls on each of us to remember our obligations to the Republic for which it stands and to carry forward the unwavering optimism that defines us. America endures because of the courage of servicemen and women who serve under this standard, and our veterans are forever draped in the red, white, and blue when they are laid to rest. Wherever the flag lies or flies, its message is clear: We rise and fall together, as one Nation and one people.\nThe American flag invokes pride in our citizens and hope in those who come to our shores in search of a brighter tomorrow. In recognition of the ways it has embodied our ideals and sustained our Nation, let us pay tribute to the Star Spangled Banner and continue striving to create a more perfect and indivisible Union—with liberty and justice for all.\nTo commemorate the adoption of our flag, the Congress, by joint resolution approved August 3, 1949, as amended (63 Stat. 492), designated June 14 of each year as \"Flag Day\" and requested that the President issue an annual proclamation calling for its observance and for the display of the flag of the United States on all Federal Government buildings. The Congress also requested, by joint resolution approved June 9, 1966, as amended (80 Stat. 194), that the President annually issue a proclamation designating the week in which June 14 occurs as \"National Flag Week\" and call upon citizens of the United States to display the flag during that week.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim June 14, 2016, as Flag Day and the week beginning June 12, 2016, as National Flag Week. I direct the appropriate officials to display the flag on all Federal Government buildings during that week, and I urge all Americans to observe Flag Day and National Flag Week by displaying the flag. I also call upon the people of the United States to observe with pride and all due ceremony those days from Flag Day through Independence Day, also set aside by the Congress (89 Stat. 211), as a time to honor America, to celebrate our heritage in public gatherings and activities, and to publicly recite the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America. In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-06-10", "title": "Proclamation 9460—Flag Day and National Flag Week, 2016"}

This honor also serves as a testament to Federation members across Florida who have unparalleled, proven success in Getting Out the Vote.\nIn her proudest voice, she announced, \"I am pleased to tell you today that the Florida Federation of Republican Women is proud to endorse Donald J. Trump for President of the United States of America.\"\nHer remarks were also historic because, \"This is the first time in the organization's 65 year history that a state Federation President has been so honored, a long-overdue recognition of the nation-wide work tens of thousands of women do day in and day out to advance the goals of the Republican Party,\" DeCamp advised.\nIn Florida, more than 60 federations across the state report to Ms. Decamp, who is also a Director of the National Federation of Republican Women headquartered outside of Washington, D.C., and one of 28 Florida Federation members across the state who have been elected by their peers as delegates to the Republican Convention being held July 18-21 in Cleveland, Ohio. In Florida, delegates are selected based upon their work on behalf of the Republican Party overall; not their political views.\nMs. DeCamp told the crowd, \"this year we already have a Winner! Mr. Trump's non-traditional campaign style and message resonates with voters both here in Florida and throughout the nation. His primary results are historic; he has broken all turnout records, and we expect a huge turnout for him again in the November General Election!\" She said women are already working hard across the nation to spread the truth and get him elected.\nShe told the audience the real truth about the so-called \"War on Women\". She said, \"there is no war on women in the Republican Party; women are fully engaged and involved. The most shameful war on women is the one Hillary Clinton has waged on her husband's ‘girlfriends'. Furthermore, Hilary Clinton has a disgraceful record of bullying, lying, cheating and hanging on to her husband's coat tails to advance her personal agenda. Informed American women will not be fooled by a candidate who disgraced our state department, refuses to hold press conferences and hides behind her husband,\" she concluded.\nMs. Decamp also began to dispel the myth that the Republican Party is not inclusive. \"This is just plain nonsense, a fairy tale fabricated by Democrats,\" and added \"here in Florida, I'm proud to announce today that three minority women in our membership have recently qualified by petition to run for the U.S. Congress in Florida.\" As state president, national federation director, and Republican delegate to the National Republican Convention, Ms. DeCamp left no doubt that the next five months will be a full-court press to see that Donald J. Trump is the next president of the United States. She pledged that she and the federation members will leave no stone unturned to assure that the State of Florida is painted \"Red.\"\n####\nDeCamp contact info:\nDena Stebbins DeCamp\nEmail: [email protected]\nPhone: 863-640-4805", "timestamp": "2016-06-11", "title": "Press Release - Donald J.

Today I want to talk with you about the crisis in Puerto Rico and why it matters to all of us. Puerto Ricans are American citizens, just like folks in Maine or Oklahoma or New Mexico. And over the last decade, Puerto Rico has suffered through a deep and painful recession, but unlike the rest of the United States, it hasn't recovered.\nToday, the island continues to face a crippling economic crisis. Schools are closing. Power is being cut off at homes and hospitals. Teachers have to choose between turning on the lights or turning on the computers. Doctors can't get medicine to treat newborns unless they pay in cash. And as the Zika virus threatens both the island and the mainland, workers dealing with mosquito control to help protect women and their unborn babies are at risk of being laid off.\nRight now Puerto Rico is spending about a third of its tax revenue on debt payments, far more than anywhere else in America. And on July 1, the island faces another $2 billion in debt payments that it cannot pay.\nThere is only one way for Puerto Rico to pull itself out of this crisis, and that's by restructuring its debt and finding a sustainable fiscal path toward growth and opportunity for its people. But here's the problem. Right now Puerto Rico doesn't have the tools it needs to restructure its debt, tools available elsewhere in America. And only Congress can fix the problem and put Puerto Rico on a path to recovery.\nThankfully, this week, the House overwhelmingly passed a bipartisan bill to address the crisis, and I now urge the Senate to move quickly to follow suit. This bill won't cost Federal taxpayers a dime. It doesn't include special interest bailouts. And it gives Puerto Rico the ability to restructure its debt, safeguard essential services, and provide important protections to public pensions that more than 300,000 folks rely on to retire with dignity.\nThis bill also includes something else: a temporary system of oversight to help implement needed reforms and ensure transparency. I know that some folks in Puerto Rico are worried about this kind of oversight. But I've always insisted that any solution to this crisis has to respect the democratic rights of the people of Puerto Rico. And I'm committed to making sure that Puerto Ricans are well represented in this process so that we can be sure we're taking steps that are in the island's best interests.\nThis bill is not a perfect solution; nobody's saying it is. That's what happens in divided government. But it's the only option on the table to save Puerto Rico from spiraling out of control. And that's exactly what would happen if Congress fails to do its job.\nThere's no question this is a trying time for folks in Puerto Rico. They've seen too many jobs lost and too many neighbors leave in search of better opportunity elsewhere. It's clear that it's time for Puerto Rico to chart a new course and make a fresh start. This bill is just a first step.\nWe all have more work to do to make sure that the people of Puerto Rico receive the health care they deserve and the good jobs and economic opportunities they need to build a better future for their kids. And I want the people of Puerto Rico to know that my administration is committed to your success, because you're vital to America's success. That's what this is all about. We don't turn our backs on our fellow Americans. We don't treat folks differently because of where they live. Instead, we treat each other as Americans. We come together, especially when it's hard. That's how we've always set ourselves on a course toward a brighter day.\nThanks everybody, and have a great weekend.", "timestamp": "2016-06-11", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}

It was the worst terrorist attack on our soil since 9/11, and the second of its kind in 6 months. My deepest sympathy and support goes out to the victims, the wounded, and their families.\nIn his remarks today, President Obama disgracefully refused to even say the words 'Radical Islam'. For that reason alone, he should step down. If Hillary Clinton, after this attack, still cannot say the two words 'Radical Islam' she should get out of this race for the Presidency.\nIf we do not get tough and smart real fast, we are not going to have a country anymore. Because our leaders are weak, I said this was going to happen – and it is only going to get worse. I am trying to save lives and prevent the next terrorist attack. We can't afford to be politically correct anymore.\nThe terrorist, Omar Mir Saddique Mateen, is the son of an immigrant from Afghanistan who openly published his support for the Afghanistani Taliban and even tried to run for President of Afghanistan. According to Pew, 99% of people in Afghanistan support oppressive Sharia Law.\nWe admit more than 100,000 lifetime migrants from the Middle East each year. Since 9/11, hundreds of migrants and their children have been implicated in terrorism in the United States.\nHillary Clinton wants to dramatically increase admissions from the Middle East, bringing in many hundreds of thousands during a first term – and we will have no way to screen them, pay for them, or prevent the second generation from radicalizing.\nWe need to protect all Americans, of all backgrounds and all beliefs, from Radical Islamic Terrorism - which has no place in an open and tolerant society. Radical Islam advocates hate for women, gays, Jews, Christians and all Americans. I am going to be a President for all Americans, and I am going to protect and defend all Americans. We are going to make America safe again and great again for everyone.\n- Donald J.

We pray for their families, who are grasping for answers with broken hearts. We stand with the people of Orlando, who have endured a terrible attack on their city. Although it's still early in the investigation, we know enough to say that this was an act of terror and an act of hate. And as Americans, we are united in grief, in outrage, and in resolve to defend our people.\nI just finished a meeting with FBI Director Comey and my homeland security and national security advisers. The FBI is on the scene and leading the investigation, in partnership with local law enforcement. I've directed that the full resources of the Federal Government be made available for this investigation.\nWe are still learning all the facts. This is an open investigation. We've reached no definitive judgment on the precise motivations of the killer. The FBI is appropriately investigating this as an act of terrorism. And I've directed that we must spare no effort to determine what—if any—inspiration or association this killer may have had with terrorist groups. What is clear is that he was a person filled with hatred. Over the coming days, we will uncover why and how this happened, and we will go wherever the facts lead us.\nThis morning I spoke with my good friend, Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer, and I conveyed to him the deepest condolences of the American people. This could have been any one of our communities. So I told Mayor Dyer that whatever help he and the people of Orlando need, they are going to get it. As a country, we will be there for the people of Orlando today, tomorrow, and for all the days to come.\nWe also express our profound gratitude to all the police and first responders who rushed to harm's way. Their courage and professionalism saved lives, and kept the carnage from being even worse. It's the kind of sacrifice that our law enforcement professionals make every single day for all of us, and we can never thank them enough.\nThis is an especially heartbreaking day for all our friends—our fellow Americans—who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. The shooter targeted a nightclub where people came together to be with friends, to dance and to sing, and to live. The place where they were attacked is more than a nightclub; it is a place of solidarity and empowerment where people have come together to raise awareness, to speak their minds, and to advocate for their civil rights.\nSo this is a sobering reminder that attacks on any American—regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, or sexual orientation—is an attack on all of us and on the fundamental values of equality and dignity that define us as a country. And no act of hate or terror will ever change who we are or the values that make us Americans.\nToday marks the most deadly shooting in American history. The shooter was apparently armed with a handgun and a powerful assault rifle. This massacre is therefore a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school or in a house of worship or a movie theater or in a nightclub. And we have to decide if that's the kind of country we want to be. And to actively do nothing is a decision as well.\nIn the coming hours and days, we'll learn about the victims of this tragedy: their names, their faces, who they were, the joy that they brought to families and to friends, and the difference that they made in this world. Say a prayer for them, and say a prayer for their families: that God give them the strength to bear the unbearable; and that He give us all the strength to be there for them and the strength and courage to change. We need to demonstrate that we are defined more—as a country—by the way they lived their lives than by the hate of the man who took them from us.\nAs we go together, we will draw inspiration from heroic and selfless acts: friends who helped friends, took care of each other, and saved lives. In the face of hate and violence, we will love one another. We will not give in to fear or turn against each other. Instead, we will stand united, as Americans, to protect our people, and defend our Nation, and to take action against those who threaten us.\nMay God bless the Americans we lost this morning, may He comfort their families, and may God continue to watch over this country that we love.

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117651", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:26 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. I apologize for the delay in getting started this afternoon. Obviously, it's been a difficult 36 hours for our country. And you've had an opportunity to hear from the President in the last 24 hours about his concerns both in terms of continuing to do what's necessary to protect the country and to get to the bottom of what exactly happened, and to make sure that our country continues to be united, and that in the face of this unspeakable act of violence, that we don't give into the temptation to turn on one another.\nAnd the President feels strongly about it. That's why you've heard from him a couple of times in the last 24 hours. And I suspect you'll have an opportunity to hear from him again tomorrow when he convenes his national security team over at the Treasury Department to get an update on our counter-ISIL efforts. This is, of course, a previously planned meeting, but it's a timely one for tomorrow.\nI know this afternoon you also had an opportunity to hear from Director Comey at the FBI about the ongoing investigation into the terrorist attack in Orlando over the weekend. I will not be able to share many details of the ongoing investigation. I'm not going to get ahead of what the FBI is doing. But I suspect if you have questions on a range of other aspects of this particular situation, I'm happy to do my best to answer them. But questions about the investigation will have to be directed to the FBI.\nSo with that lead-up -- Kevin, do you want to start?\nQ: Sure. Thank you, Josh. Is the President resigned to the prospect that these sort of mass shootings of the United States are the new normal? Is he resigned to the prospect that perhaps he's powerless to stop them?\nMR. EARNEST: Not at all, Kevin. I think the President is quite intensely frustrated that we haven't seen the kind of congressional action that we know would have an impact on the ability of individuals to carry out these kinds of mass shootings. There is no one law that we can pass that would prevent every aspect of violence, but there are some common-sense things that Congress could do that would make it harder for individuals who should not have guns from being able to get them. There are certain common-sense things that Congress could do that would make it harder for any individual to get their hands on a weapon of war.\nAnd the President has been quite frustrated -- and, in some cases, even angry -- about congressional inaction on common-sense steps that could be taken that would make our community safer, that would not undermine the basic constitutional rights to law-abiding Americans. And that has been the source of some presidential frustration.\nBut when it comes to countering violent extremism and fighting ISIL and other extremist, terrorist organizations that seek to do harm to the United States, this is the President's number one priority -- is protecting the country and protecting the American people. And that's why, on Friday afternoon at this podium, the President's special envoy to our counter-ISIL coalition spent half an hour with maps, briefing all of you about the important progress that we have made. That was obviously a briefing that was scheduled in advance of this terrible incident.\nBut it is an indication of how intensely focused the President and his team are in countering ISIL, in successfully executing our strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy that terrorist organization. And that's something that this administration is focused on, even when a lot of other people aren't. And that's okay. That's the responsibility of the President of the United States, which is to keep the country safe, and it's something that the President and his team are considered to be their number one priority.\nQ: He's frustrated about the prospect of doing anything about guns -- or he's frustrated about Congress not going anything about guns, but does he see this incident as really changing anything as far as the dynamics of getting something done?\nMR. EARNEST: That's difficult to assess, Kevin. I think there are a lot of people who suspected that seeing 20 first-graders get massacred in their classroom, that that might have sufficient pull on the nation's conscience and on the conscience of individual members in the United States Congress to get them to change some of these laws -- and it didn't.\nSo I don't know whether this profound tragedy will have more of an impact on the minds of members of the Congress. Hopefully, it will. But I think the President continues to believe that the only way we're going to see the kind of change to our gun safety laws that we would like to see, that the vast majority of our country would like to see, would be -- will be when individual Americans make clear to their representatives in Congress that this is a top priority.\nAnd the President has made clear that he's a single-issue voter on this issue, that he's not going to support or raise money for candidates -- including Democrats -- who aren't clear about their support for common-sense gun-safety legislation. And it's not until we see the same intensity of opinion, or the same intensity in expressing the opinion that the majority of Americans have about common-sense gun-safety legislation as the intensity expressed by those that are in the minority. And that's the only way we're going to bring about the kind of change that we'd like to see in the United States Congress.\nQ: And does he hope to go to Orlando later this week?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any updates on the President's travel at this point. Obviously you saw that the campaign event that the President and Secretary Clinton had planned for Wednesday in Wisconsin has been postponed. But if we have any travel to Orlando to add to the schedule we'll be sure to let you know.\nRoberta.\nQ: Donald Trump, in his comments, seemed to question the President's motivation. He said that the President has \"something else in mind\" and that there's \"something going on\" in terms of the way the President is responding to this. He said, \"He doesn't get it. Or he gets it better than anybody understands.\" He said the President \"doesn't want to see what's happening\" or that he \"doesn't want to get it.\" I'm wondering if the President saw Donald Trump's comments, or if you saw them, if you have a response, and what was the President's reaction to these comments.\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't spoken to the President about these comments. I do not know whether or not he has seen them. I can tell you that when you are focused on something as big as helping the country respond to the worst mass shooting in our nation's history, when you are focused on something as big as safeguarding the country and combatting violent extremism, it's important not to get distracted by things that are so small.\nQ: And what did you make of them? Did you interpret those comments, you yourself, as a smear against the President? Or how did you respond to them?\nMR. EARNEST: I took my own advice and I've been focused on not being distracted by something so small.\nJon.\nQ: We heard from FBI Director Comey who said that they were looking to see if there was something we should have done differently. Obviously, the FBI interviewed the Orlando shooter three times, two separate inquiries, and then stopped -- decided not to monitor him in any way. So in answering his own question, we're looking to see if we should have done something different, Director Comey said, \"So far, the answer is, I don't think so. I don't see anything in reviewing our work that our agents should have done differently.\" Does the President share that confidence that, after this horrible shooting of somebody that had been on the FBI's radar, does he share that confidence that they shouldn't have done anything differently?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Jon, I think the reference -- and again, you can speak to the FBI about Director Comey's comments -- but obviously the President has been briefed by Director Comey on a couple of different occasions now, including about the FBI's investigation into this terrorist. And what the President has been briefed on is that the FBI followed all the rules and procedures that are on the books for how an investigation like this is supposed to be conducted.\nNow, the obvious question that that raises, and I think the one that you're raising is, does that mean that the rules and regulations that are on the books are insufficient? And I think that's what Director Comey is referring to when he says that we're going to take a close look to see if we should have done something differently.\nQ: But his answer is, so far the honest answer is, \"I don't think so.\" I mean, there are 50 people dead. This is the worst shooting in American history. Something went wrong here. This was somebody that had been on the FBI's radar not once, but twice, interviewed three times.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, this is an individual that -- but the most recent investigation into this individual -- again, according to the Director of the FBI -- had been closed two years ago. And one of the particular risks associated with radicalization is that it can happen in a very compressed time period. And that's what makes it so difficult to counter.\nWe've talked about how this is an evolving threat -- and this is something that the President's top counterterrorism advisor, Lisa Monaco, has talked about -- that the kind of risk that is posed by individuals who are radicalized online is different than what we had previously confronted.\nAgain, as the FBI Director indicated, this individual is, at least based on what we know now, is not part of a broader terror network, but rather, essentially, a lone wolf, an individual who was radicalized online and carried out a heinous act of terrorism on his own. That's what we know so far. There's a whole lot more of an investigation that needs to be conducted, and I certainly don't want to get ahead of that.\nBut that's what makes this kind of threat so difficult to confront. And that's why an investigation of the sort that Director Comey has initiated is one that is taking a look both forwards and backwards to learn as much as possible about this individual, about what may have motivated them, about who this individual communicated with, and, yes, it includes a review of past interactions with this individual to determine if there is something that investigators should have done differently that could have prevented something like this from happening.\nQ: Are you aware of reports that he celebrated 9/11, the attacks on 9/11? He was in class. His classmates recall him getting up and celebrating the attack.\nMR. EARNEST: I have not seen those reports. What I suspect is likely to happen over the next few days is that there may be aspects of this investigation that leak out into the public.\nPart of this is an indication that a large number of federal law enforcement officials are working closely with a substantial number of state and local law enforcement officials to conduct this investigation. And in order to protect the integrity of the investigation, I'm going to let the FBI talk about what they learned in a way -- the FBI Director committed today to being as transparent as possible about that investigation. I think people have an understandable desire to learn what the FBI is learning, but I just don't want to get ahead of any work they may be doing.\nQ: And just one last question, because it's been raised by the President's -- this term has been raised by the President's critics. But given this killer's allegiance that he expressed to ISIS, given what we know -- the indication that he had been radicalized by propaganda online -- is it fair to say that this is an example of radical Islamic terrorism, this attack?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Jon, again, as the FBI Director said, their interactions, their investigation has uncovered references to a number of extremist organizations. And they're still trying to evaluate what impact any one terrorist organization may have had.\nBut let me -- I'll answer your question, because what is true is that many of those organizations pervert the religion of Islam to justify their murderous, nihilistic agenda. The President has said that on many occasions. He's been very blunt about what those organizations are trying to do.\nWhat they're also trying to do is to claim the mantle of Islam to describe themselves as holy warriors, or religious leaders, engaged in a conflict with the United States of America. They're wrong about that. That is a false agenda. That is a myth. That is not true. And this administration and the previous administration have gone to great lengths to debunk that myth and make clear that these organizations are seeking to perpetuate a perverted form of Islam.\nHow do we know this? We know this because the United States is actually working closely in partnership with a significant number of countries in the Muslim world to combat this organization. This organization carries out acts of violence around the world. The vast majority of the victims of those acts of violence are innocent Muslim men, women and children.\nWe know that there are American Muslims that serve this country loyally, patriotically in our armed forces and in the intelligence community to combat this threat and to protect our country. And in fact, the United States of America was founded on the principle of religious freedom, where people of all religions are welcome here, which makes it impossible that the United States could be at war with any one religion.\nAnd this administration has gone to great lengths to debunk that myth, because to perpetuate that myth only gives the terrorists what they want, which is legitimacy. And it's only going to make it harder for us to mobilize the Muslim world to fight this threat. It's only going to make it harder for us to mobilize Muslim religious leaders to make their voices heard online, as they have a responsibility to do, to counter that messaging. And it's only going to make it likely that some members of the Muslim community in the United States feel isolated and feel stigmatized, which only makes it harder to confront the threat that we face from individuals who might be radicalized.\nSo that was a long answer to your question but it was an important one, so thank you for giving me the opportunity to share it.\nApril\nQ: Josh, a couple of questions. When it comes to lone wolf, how is a lone wolf in this country identified? And how is he stopped?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, April, this is obviously something that the President and his national security team are quite concerned about. The President, I believe on a number of occasions, has noted that the most challenging threat facing our counterterrorism and homeland security officials is disruptive to the activities of a lone wolf. By definition, this is an individual that isn't communicating with too many other people. And it's hard to get a sense of exactly what they may have planned.\nI think this does go to some of the messaging that you saw from Director Comey earlier today, that it's important for people to be vigilant. He cited the experience that many FBI investigators have when following up and pursuing investigations of crimes that are committed by a lone wolf. That they often find, when they're interviewing people, that people think to themselves -- people express regret that they didn't share something sooner about something that they saw or happened to overhear or otherwise notice.\nAnd so we certainly want people to be vigilant. There are -- I'd refer you to the FBI for sort of a more detailed rundown of the kind of investigative and law enforcement strategy that they have successfully pursued in dozens if not scores of cases over the last couple of years to disrupt attempts by a would-be lone-wolf terrorist from carrying out an act of violence. There are a number of investigative methods that can be used. But this is a very significant challenge, and there's no one on the President's team that would downplay it.\nQ: So what about the Internet? What can you tell us about the Internet? Because the President in the Oval Office was talking about how the Internet plays in this lone-wolf scenario. What is being done when it comes to Internet activity of people who are beginning the radicalization process?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, April, over the last couple of years, a lot of resources have been dedicated to countering violent extremism. And the President has mandated that we mobilized resources across the federal government and worked closely with state and local governments to combat violent extremism. And there are a few things that we've learned over the last couple of years that are important to our efforts.\nThe first is we know that the government is usually not the best messenger; that the most effective way to rebut the radicalizing messaging from extremist organizations is to have other individuals with legitimacy in the community stand up and speak out against individuals who are seeking to propagate a radical ideology.\nThe other thing that the U.S. government has been able to work effectively to do is to partner with technology companies, social media companies and make it harder for those with bad intentions to use social media outlets to inspire people to carry out acts of violence. I've often used the analogy of the work that the government and technology companies have done to try to stamp out the spread of child pornography. There's been a similar effort underway on the part of the government to work with technology companies to make sure that their tools and their social media outlets aren't used to propagate hateful ideology to inspire people to carry out acts of violence.\nAnd so we've been pleased at the interest that many technology companies have shown in working with the federal government to prevent the tools that they created to promote freedom and communication and openness from being used to inspire people to carry out acts of violence.\nThe other thing that we have sought to do is to ramp up the resources that are dedicated to this effort. And the President has been quite disappointed that Congress -- Republicans in Congress have underfunded our countering violent extremist efforts. And there's a substantial increase in that funding request that's included in our fiscal year 2017 budget. And I don't have to remind you, April, that Republicans haven't -- just haven't refused to act on that request, but they refuse to even convene the traditional annual hearing to talk about that funding request with the President's budget director. That's the first time in 40 years that that hearing hasn't occurred. And I think it reflects a lack of seriousness on the part of Republicans to doing their part to counter violent extremism. There is a role for Congress to play, and thus far we have not seen enough members of Congress, principally Republicans, step up to the plate and fulfill their responsibility to keep the country safe.\nQ: Last question. People were going about their business enjoying Pride Month, enjoying cultural dancing at the LGBT nightclub. And then we hear that there could have been possibly a target of one of the -- I mean, when you think of Disney World, you think of happy, you think of family. What do you say to the American public as all of this is happening? I mean, you had this at a time when people were celebrating and feeling good about themselves. And then a possible target, one of the major amusement parks globally that people feel comfortable about going to. What do you say to the American public as we are in this era of lone-wolf attacks?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, you're making reference to one other potential aspect of the investigation that's apparently leaked. I can't confirm that piece of information, and I certainly can't give you the context to help you understand exactly what our investigators understand at this point. You need to ask them about that. But let me try to answer the spirit of your question, which is --\nQ: This is a question of life, happiness, moving forward.\nMR. EARNEST: Correct. The goal of terrorist organizations is to inspire terror in their victims and in the American people. That is the goal of these terrorist organizations. They are attacking our way of life. And it's important for us to step back and recognize that that's the case. The American people should take great confidence in the nation security professionals that work, literally, around the clock to keep the country safe. They have a President of the United States who has made his number one priority protecting our homeland. And our federal government expends significant resources in pursuit of that goal. And that's something that should give the American people great confidence to go on with their lives and to be vigilant, as the FBI director recommended, but also to not give in to the aims of terrorist organizations that are seeking to, as their name would suggest, terrorize the American people.\nOlivier.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Going back to the radicalization of the alleged shooter. First, on the medium, you talked about the Internet. Were you talking about YouTube videos, talking about e-mails from someone, you talking about discussion groups? What's the online medium that we're talking about here?\nMR. EARNEST: In this particular case?\nQ: Yes, sir.\nMR. EARNEST: That's exactly what the FBI is seeking to determine. So the FBI I think has indicated quite clearly that they are trying to learn as much as they possibly can about this individual's activity on the Internet. And they're doing that because it could give them greater insight into any other individuals who potentially may have been involved or complicit in this heinous terrorist attack. It also may give them greater clarity about this individual's motive. Director Comey acknowledged that there is still some lack of clarity about that. And so they're seeking to gain as much information as possible, including this individual's activities on the Internet to try to learn as much as they can.\nQ: So that applies then to my follow-up, which was going to be about the message, which is to say, what kind of radicalization are we talking about? Is it anti-gay, is it anti-American, is it pro-ISIS?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, again, there's so much of this that is still being uncovered. This is an investigation that's barely 24 hours old. I can assure you, however, that there is acute interest in the federal government to learn as much as possible. Director Comey I think acknowledged that at this point, it is not clear what role anti-gay bigotry may have played in targeting the Pulse nightclub. But what's clear is that the LGBT community in Florida came under attack. And, in fact, our country came under attack. Our commitment to values like inclusion and dignity and tolerance came under direct attack, and it's why it is so important for our country to respond, as the Orlando Sentinel suggests, in a fashion that is united, that preserves our commitment as a country to recognizing our diversity as a strength and to making clear that we're not just going to marginalize certain segments of our population because of who they love or who they are. That is not what this country is all about.\nAnd, again, we're still learning exactly what his motives may have been, but we can choose our response. And the President feels quite strongly about what that response should be.\nQ: All right, last one. You submitted a War Powers letter to Congress today.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes.\nQ: It gives specific numbers for the number of American troops in Afghanistan. And then it gives something called a force management number separately. You don't give specific numbers for the number of troops in Iraq and in Syria. In fact, the number in Syria that's given is -- the force management number is 300, which, my understanding is that's below where the current number of troops deployed. Why is there not a precise number attached to the troops in Iraq and Syria?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know the answer to that question, but we can get you an answer to that question. I assure you that there is a good explanation for that.\nLook, I'm glad that you mentioned the War Powers report because I think this is something that Congress requires be provided every six months. But the reason that it's particularly appropriate today is, as the country considers what steps our government is taking to protect the American people, this is a pretty detailed accounting of all of the places where our national security professionals and our men and women in uniform are taking steps, actively, to counter terrorist organizations and protect the American people all around the world.\nAnd so this is a handy reference guide for individuals who are inquiring about just what the United States and what the Commander-in-Chief has ordered to protect the country.\nKristen.\nQ: Josh, thank you. I want to go back to the debate over the term \"radical Islam\" and get your reaction to something that Secretary Clinton said this morning. She said, \"To me, radical jihadism, radical Islamism, I think they mean the same thing… I'm happy to say either, but that's not the point.\" She went on to say that it's actions, not words, that matter. But does President Obama agree with her on that one point, that they effectively mean the same thing?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think the President has been quite clear about why we choose the language that we choose to define our enemy. And we have defined the enemy, our adversary in this war, as a terrorist organization that perverts Islam. And the President has been blunt about that, and the President has been blunt about why exactly we use the terminology that we do, and it is to make crystal clear that we're not going to give those extremist organizations the legitimacy of claiming legitimate Islam.\nThe President is not going to give into them. That's exactly what they want. They want that legitimacy. They want to further this narrative that they represent Islam in a war against the West. That narrative is false. It is empty. It is a myth. In fact, most of the victims of these terrorist organizations are in fact innocent Muslim men, women and children. Many of our most important partners in our counter-ISIL effort are our partners in the Muslim world.\nKristen, you'll recall back in late summer of 2014, early fall, when the President first authorized and ordered military airstrikes against extremist targets in Syria, that the United States was not flying alone in that mission in carrying out strikes against ISIL targets. There were several -- four or five or six -- Muslim-majority countries who were flying military jets alongside American military pilots to carry out those strikes against ISIL targets. That should send a very clear signal to these extremist organizations and to the world that these extremist organizations do not represent the Muslim faith.\nQ: Would President Obama then disagree with Secretary Clinton for using that term within that context?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I would not critique what Secretary Clinton had to say.\nQ: I want to go back to what you were saying about gun legislation. You said that the President is \"not resigned,\" and I just want to be clear -- is there any possibility under which he would introduce new legislation for new gun laws, reintroduce the assault weapons ban, for example, or prohibiting those on the terror watch list from being able to access guns?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I know that there are Democrats in Congress that are discussing this right now.\nQ: Is the President discussing it, though, Josh?\nMR. EARNEST: The President is certainly interested, and will be a forceful advocate for that legislation as it's considered by the United States Congress. You've heard the President speak out on it many times in the past, and I certainly wouldn't rule out him speaking out on it in the future.\nBut I think the President has talked about using his own executive authority -- and there are a number of steps that the President took early this year -- to prevent individuals from circumventing the background check system. And the President has vowed to use his not authority, but sort of his stature, as a leading political figure in this country to make clear that he's not going to lend his political support to somebody who does not share his commitment to the pursuit of common-sense gun safety legislation.\nQ: Are there any more executive actions he's looking at that he could potentially take to try to prevent this type of tragedy from happening --\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any imminent announcement -- I'm not aware of -- I'm sorry to cut you off. I'm not aware of any imminent announcements that the President is planning to make. But the President and his team are always thinking through ways that he could exercise his authority to make our communities safer.\nAnd again, in the same way that there is no piece of legislation that would prevent every act of violence, there's no executive action that's going to prevent every act of violence, either. But the President's frustration stems from the fact that there are common-sense steps that Congress could take that aren't controversial across the country, that are strongly supported not just by Democrats but by a majority of Republicans and even a majority of gun owners that we know would have some impact in making our communities safer.\nAnd the question is, for members of Congress, why they won't take those steps, knowing that those steps aren't going to undermine or gut the constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans. They're just going to have the material effect of making our communities a little bit safer. Why wouldn't they take them?\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, Hillary Clinton talked about the need for an intelligence surge focusing in on the lone wolves in particular here. Is that something that the White House thinks is needed right now?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, this is a -- disrupting a lone wolf who's plotting a terrorist has been described by the President as the most difficult challenge facing our homeland security and counterterrorism officials. By the nature of the way those kinds of acts are carried out, it's very difficult to intervene. Now, it's a testament to the professionalism of our intelligence community and the Department of Justice that it's not fairly routine for them to make announcements about disrupting those kinds of plots. So our law enforcement and our intelligence and our national security professionals are quite skilled at doing exactly that. But I think what the President would say is, we're open to additional ideas, particularly additional resources that could be dedicated to this effort.\nAnd I defer to the intelligence community about how they would use additional resources and whether or not that would be valuable. I certainly know that the countering violent extremism strategy that we have laid out does need additional resources, and it would have additional resources and would be more effective in more communities across the country if Republicans in Congress hadn't blocked funding for it. So there's more that we would like to see Congress do. And the fact that they won't even hold a hearing on the President's budget request I think is an indication that Republicans in Congress aren't doing their part to keep the country safe, particularly when it comes to countering violent extremism.\nQ: But what she was describing seemed more than just an issue of funding. It seemed to be more about surging the existing resources, breaking down walls, getting the -- everyone running in the right direction kind of thing. Is that something that the White House is looking at right now -- I mean, recognizing that there could have been better sharing of resources in this instance?\nMR. EARNEST: I think in this instance -- again, based on the fact that we're only 24 hours into it -- I think it's too hard to tell whether or not there's one thing that could have been done differently that would have prevented this kind of incident. But I'm confident that our national security professionals are dedicated to learning as much as we possibly can about this incident -- not just to better assess the motives of the individual and to determine whether or not somebody else may have been involved, but they're also interested in learning as much as possible about this incident so that we can take steps to prevent incidents like this from happening again.\nQ: The last time something like this happened on this scale, it was San Bernardino, and there was quite a public showdown over access to information and a public showdown with Apple in terms of getting full access to the digital footprint of the alleged perpetrators. Do you see that as something happening in this case? Has the administration gotten the tools this time to sort of move on? I mean, where are we with that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think on that, I'd refer you to the FBI. I don't know whether or not they've encountered a similar problem as they're pursuing this investigation. But they could tell you more about that.\nQ: So that's not something that has come up so far in the conversations with the President during these briefings -- a lack of tools to access information?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'll just say that I'm not prepared to share any more details about the investigation at this point. But if the FBI determines that they're prepared to share more information about that, including this question about whether or not they've encountered some sort of encryption barrier, then that's something they'll talk about.\nQ: Earlier, were you meaning to indicate that the President is still open to executive action on anything related to gun control? Were you saying that had really been exhausted at this point?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what I was trying to indicate to Kristen is that the President has taken substantial steps. I'm not aware of any sort of imminent announcement of additional steps that can be taken. But I think at the same time, the President and his team are always looking for ideas and they're always open to considering new ideas about how the President could use his executive authority to take steps that would make us safer.\nQ: And the President doesn't feel powerless at this point, despite a dozen or two dozen executive actions, despite emotional appeals, despite all of the description you laid out here of being totally frustrated by Republican opposition to any and all efforts? He doesn't feel powerless?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the President is quite frustrated, and the President is going to continue to be a forceful public advocate for steps that Congress can take. They can close --\nQ: Just an advocate? It is just the bully pulpit, or is there something he can use --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not going to rule out additional steps that he may take, but I'm not aware of any impending announcements. But again, common-sense steps like closing the loophole that allows individuals who are on the no-fly list from buying a gun. The President's principle here is pretty straightforward: If it's too dangerous for to board an airplane, then it should be too dangerous for you to walk into a gun store and buy a gun.\nThe President put forward a very specific request back in January to hire 200 additional ATF agents that could be used to more effectively enforce the gun laws that are on the books. Republicans in Congress have not acted on that proposal, even though that if often the rejoinder that we hear from Republicans who are too scared to take action on common-sense gun safety legislation. They say, well, why don't we just better enforce the laws on the books. Great, let's do that. Let's hire 200 additional ATF agents that can do exactly that. Republicans in Congress haven't acted on that either.\nQ: Can you just quickly tell us if there's anything on the President's schedule with the Deputy Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia this week who's in town?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any updates on the President's schedule at this point, but we'll certainly keep you posted if something like that gets added to the schedule.\nMichelle.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. We're now months away from the President leaving office. Based on these incidents that keep happening, you would have thought that if he wanted to do something more on the gun issue, he would have done it by now. So does the President feel like he has done everything that he can do under the law on this issue?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what is clear is the President has taken substantial executive actions to using as much of his authority as he can to implement common-sense measures that would make our community safer from gun violence. I'm not going to rule out additional steps -- because if we get a good idea about how we can use that authority to take additional steps, then the President is going to want to take a close look at it, but he's not going to hesitate to act.\nThe responsibility right now lies with Congress. And whether it's closing the no-buy, no-fly loophole, hiring additional ATF agents, reinstituting the assault weapons ban, passing legislation to close the background check loophole at gun shows, these are all common-sense steps that would not fundamentally gut the constitutional right of law-abiding Americans but would have a material impact on making our community safer.\nQ: But just to be clear, the last time you took executive action, the White House was saying that that's as far as he could go -- after all of this research, that's as far as he could under the law. But now you're open to more. So has he gone as far as he can go under the law right now?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I'm not aware of any ideas that are being actively considered right now, but I'm not going to rule out any good ideas that may come across the President's desk in the future.\nQ: Okay. And you talked about -- I mean, we heard many times the lone wolf obviously being the most difficult type of suspect to spot. Given that -- I mean, just today we heard the President say that the FBI did a \"proper job\" from what he can see so far. But here's a person who has made statements relating to jihadism, who has not only access to guns but has a job that allows him easier access to guns than most people have. Wouldn't that be enough reason in the President's view to keep on monitoring this person? I mean, doesn't that alone tell you that something more could be done right there?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me answer this question a couple of ways, Michelle. The first is that the FBI Director has indicated that they're going to go back and take a look at the investigations that were conducted into this individual to determine if they should have done something differently. That certainly is an appropriate step to take, given what eventually transpired. So I think that is a --\nQ: But do you need an investigation to look back, to look at this sort of on the surface even and say -- whether the President feels that more people should be monitored, if you want to take it more generally?\nMR. EARNEST: I think what the -- again, I think what the FBI has done is the prudent thing, which is that we're only 24 hours into this particular investigation. And given the history of this individual's interactions with the FBI, and derogatory information that was passed to the FBI, it certainly merits a reconsideration of how that individual was treated and how that investigation was conducted. And so that's what the FBI is doing, and they'll take a close look at that.\nI think what we also have to acknowledge is that we're dealing in a world of limited resources. And law enforcement officials are constantly trying to prioritize cases to make sure that they get an appropriate level of attention from investigators. And again, the almost routine announcements that we see from the Department of Justice about potential -- about a potential lone wolf plot that is disrupted is a testament to how effective those kinds of investigations are, that is a testament to the professionalism of our law enforcement and our intelligence officials.\nBut the question is raised in this instance about whether or not there is something that could have been done differently. And that's a question that the FBI is seeking to answer.\nQ: I think there seems to be a different -- you can imagine if ISIS had organized this plot from overseas, had people here carrying this out, I feel like the response -- the approach would obviously be different than this having been quite possibly a lone wolf. It seems like what it always boils down to is, well, it's a lone wolf, it was impossible to find this out, they were online secretly or they had lied to investigators. It always kind of ends at the same point, with \"there wasn't really much anybody could do.\" Does the President right now, in looking at these types of cases, feel that there are some areas where more can be done right now?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, absolutely. But let me start -- you are touching on an important point that's worthy of some consideration here, which is that the threat has evolved; that in countering -- in confronting the threat that was posed by al Qaeda -- this is the organization that carried out the terrorist attacks of 9/11 -- you had a terrorist organization that was actively communicating and supporting a group of conspirators inside the United States.\nThe threat has evolved to something different now. Again, based on what we know now -- and this investigation is barely 24 hours old -- but based on what we know now, this individual is not part of a broader terror network, but rather somebody who was likely radicalized by absorbing messaging that's disseminated online. And so the question is, what more can we do to prevent that kind of threat from turning into a violent terrorist?\nSo we do have a comprehensive countering violent extremism strategy that is housed at the Department of Homeland Security. And the President reorganized these efforts back in January, located them at the Department of Homeland Security so the Department of Homeland Security can coordinate with government agencies and with state and local officials across the country to focus our efforts on this. There are pilot programs that are underway in communities like Boston and Los Angeles and the Twin Cities because we know that we have to work with state and local officials to make these kinds of programs effective.\nThis is also why we have to be cognizant of the fact that we shouldn't be stigmatizing or marginalizing anybody in this country; that to use hateful rhetoric that is directed toward Muslims, for example, only serves to drive potential recruits into the arms of terrorists. It certainly makes it harder to disrupt those kinds of plots. In fact, what our government should be doing is working closely with community leaders across the country to protect their communities from the radicalizing influence of extremist organizations. That's exactly what our strategy is oriented to pursue.\nAnd it's unfortunate that Republicans in Congress have underfunded that effort. It's unfortunate that Republicans in Congress have refused to even hold a hearing on our budget proposal that would increase funding for that effort. That is what makes clear that Congress is not fulfilling their responsibility. Republicans have not fulfilled their responsibility to do everything that is necessary to protect the country from violent extremism. And it's time for them to step up to the plate and do their job.\nQ: And sorry, but just to clarify something that's been asked before -- the President has been so steadfast in how he frames the threat of radicalism and making it clear that words matter. So to hear Hillary Clinton on CNN this morning saying that it's not really what we say or what we call it so much that matters as much as what we do, and when she said, \"We can call it radical jihadism, radical Islamism,\" does the President then feel that that was a bad idea for her to frame it in the opposite way than what the President has felt was the --\nMR. EARNEST: No, I don't think that's what she was doing. But at this point, I'm not going to critique Secretary Clinton's comments, but I feel confident in telling you that she is -- having worked in this administration for four years, she is somebody who agrees strongly with the President's approach to ensuring that we are not giving legitimacy to a terrorist organization that would love to advance the narrative that they are somehow holy warriors advancing the cause of Islam by waging war against the United States. That is an utterly baseless myth. It is false. And there are any number of ways to disprove that narrative, including that there are proud Muslim Americans that have dedicated their lives to serving in our armed forces and to serving our intelligence community to keep us safe.\nAnd the fact is there are -- our partners in the Muslim world are critical to our success in degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL. And the fact of the matter is, most of the victims of terror attacks carried out by ISIL are, in fact, innocent Muslim men, women and children.\nJulie.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. The President said earlier that, \"The FBI followed the procedures that they were supposed to and did a proper job.\" So first off, I wanted to ask you how he knows -- how he can say how he knows that, given that we know that this person had been investigated in the past and then was able to buy guns and then go and carry out this horrific act. That's the first thing.\nSecondly, if that's the case, I wonder if the President thinks, or if the national security team is discussing at all the possibility of broader surveillance on people like this who have come across the radar screen at the FBI or other law enforcement agencies as potentially having a connection with terrorism, and you're not sure what they're going to do next.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Julie, first of all, we're referring to -- you're making reference there and the President was making reference to a couple of the investigations that are more than two years old. But, look, what Director Comey acknowledged is that the FBI can and should go back and take a look at those investigations and determine if there is something that they should have done differently.\nThe President's reference, based on the multiple briefings that he's received from his team, including Director Comey, is that it appears that those investigations, again, that are more than two years old, were conducted consistent with the rules and procedures that are already in place. Again, it does beg the question -- I think Jon made reference to this earlier -- about whether or not they should do something differently. That's exactly what the FBI is going to take a close look at. And, again, this is only 24 hours old.\nBut as I mentioned earlier, our law enforcement professionals and our intelligence professionals are constantly challenged to prioritize. They're dealing with limited resources, and they're quite good at it. They're very effective at disrupting the plans of a would-be lone-wolf terrorist. Again, it is almost routine at this point for the Department of Justice to send out a news release saying that another lone-wolf plot was disrupted. That's a testament to the skill and professionalism and effectiveness of our investigators, of our law enforcement officials, and of our intelligence community.\nBut in this situation, I think the FBI director has made clear that it does make sense to go take a look at that previous investigation -- or those previous investigations -- and determine whether or not something should have been done differently.\nQ: And depending on what the outcome of that is, is the President open to the idea of broader surveillance of this kind of suspect?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President is certainly going to listen carefully to the advice from our professionals in the intelligence community and in our law enforcement community. He believes we need to take robust steps to keep the country safe. The President has ordered many of them. But the President is conscious of the fact that it's the responsibility of law enforcement organizations and the Attorney General and the President of the United States to make sure that we're also protecting the civil liberties of law-abiding Americans as well. And so the President -- we've had a pretty roiling debate over the course of this presidency about the best way to strike that balance, and the President believes strongly in the notion of protecting our civil liberties.\nQ: And just quickly -- I know someone asked about this earlier -- but when Donald Trump goes on television and basically insinuates that the President may have somehow been complicit in or not done enough to prevent this attack and past attacks because of some personal beliefs or personal approach that he thinks is inappropriate, that doesn't really seem like a small thing. So I'm wondering if you could respond to the idea that he has raised not just in the aftermath of Orlando but in the wake of Paris -- that this administration has, for whatever reason, not done enough, not done the proper things to prevent this sort of thing from happening in this country and elsewhere.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what is clear is, if you take a look at the President's record, it speaks for itself. And that record includes a lot of dead terrorists. It also includes an international coalition of 66 nations, led by the United States, that's focused on degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL. This is a coalition that, as the President's special envoy of that coalition briefed all of you on Friday, is making important progress against ISIL not just in Iraq and in Syria, but also in other places like Libya.\nThe President will get an update on those efforts at the meeting that he'll convene at the Treasury Department with his national security team tomorrow. So the fact is, this President has made his number one priority keeping the American people safe, and this President has time and time again sought to advance our interests, to strengthen our alliances, and where necessary, order our military to take action to protect the American people. And the President has done that in a way that is smart, that is tough, and has made our country safer.\nToluse.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. You've said -- a few times during this briefing you've referenced the issue of resources and the FBI having limited resources. I'm wondering if during the conversation between Director Comey and the President he's brought up that issue specifically when it comes to the issue of monitoring. You did mention earlier that the monitoring of this shooter involved recording him, following him, interviewing him, looking at his Internet use, which obviously is very costly. And they did it for a number of months. So I'm wondering if he said that they could have maybe continued doing it if they weren't struggling with resources, or if they needed more resources in order to monitor more people for a longer time.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Toluse, again, if there was any sort of request like that that was made, then it would come from the FBI Director. So for questions about that, I'd refer you to the FBI.\nBut look, I think what is clear is that the FBI does have a robust infrastructure of professionals all across the country that do important work to keep us safe every single day. And look, most days we don't even notice. Most days we don't really pay attention to that important work. But that is work that is critical to the national security of the United States.\nAnd the President is certainly focused on that work. Director Comey is certainly focused on that work. Obviously the Attorney General is as well. It's a priority, and it's the President's top priority to keep this country safe.\nQ: I was hoping you would have a reaction to the idea that these most recent mass shootings have all involved guns that have been purchased legally. They haven't involved guns that were purchased through a gun show loophole or without a background check. What's the impact of that? And secondly, what's the impact of the fact that we've seen this specific type of gun, the AR-15 assault rifle, used in a number of these mass shootings? Has that changed this White House's strategy on what needs to be done?\nMR. EARNEST: Toluse, I think the President -- I feel strongly in telling you that the President believes that it should be illegal for an individual to walk into a gun store and purchase an assault rifle. It's a weapon of war, and the President believes that it should be banned and that it should not be legal for you to walk into a gun store to buy that weapon of war.\nSecond thing is, the President has been clear that if we want to enforce the laws on the books, let's make sure that the ATF has the necessary resources to do exactly that. So let's hire 200 more ATF officers; this is a proposal the President unveiled back in January. Not clear to me that Republicans in Congress have even considered it. It certainly hasn't advanced, and that's unfortunate, particularly when you do have those same Republicans suggesting that we should be more -- doing a better job of enforcing the gun laws that are on the books. Then hire the ATF agents to make sure that we can get that done. But Republicans in Congress have refused to do that.\nBut, Toluse, the other thing that I would say is it's too early at this point to determine whether or not a different law or even a different investigative tactic might have prevented this terrible incident. The FBI is going to learn more about this individual and what they were motivated by and what they were doing in the days and hours that led up to this attack. But the President said on many occasions that there's not one law that can be passed or an executive order that can be signed that will prevent every act of gun violence.\nThe point is that there are some common-sense bills that Congress could pass that would make our communities safer, that would make gun violence less likely and less prevalent, and, in the case of banning assault weapons, would have the effect of making some of these attacks less deadly. That's not progress the President is going to be satisfied by, but it is progress that would save lives, and Republicans in Congress continue to block any effort to advance it. And that's something that's on their conscience.\nQ: One last one. You had said there are many parts of this that are too early to tell sort of what happened and make assessments, but when it comes to the idea of this person being radicalized as a lone wolf online, you guys seem to be much more definitive on that than any other issue. So I'm wondering if you have a reason to be sure that this person has not traveled to the Middle East, has not been in contact with terrorist networks overseas, or radicalized in person at a location here in the States.\nMR. EARNEST: Again, this is what the FBI Director has said about their ongoing investigation. He has indicated that there's a strong indication of radicalization, potentially inspired by a foreign organization.\nSo the FBI is conducting an investigation to try to learn more about the motives of this individual, to learn more of the details of his life. But that's the status of the FBI investigation at this point, and based on what they have learned thus far, it does not appear that he is part of a broader network. I know that law enforcement officials earlier this morning indicated that they were not concerned, that there was another individual who was linked to this attack that posed an ongoing threat to the American people.\nBut again, this investigation is barely 24 hours old, and there is more that needs to be learned. And as the FBI learns that information, they are going to do their best to share as much of it as possible.\nRich.\nQ: Josh, should the AR-15 be illegal in the United States?\nMR. EARNEST: Rich, the President is very strongly on the record in favor of banning assault weapons. This is a ban that used to be in place; the President believes that it should be reinstituted. These assault weapons are weapons of war. And they have no place in the hands of a legitimate hunter, or what's much more likely is that a weapon of war is going to end up in the hands of someone like this who will be able to carry out a much more violent act because they're using a weapon that is intended not for the streets of Orlando, but for a battlefield.\nQ: Senate Democrats today, in response to this, are pushing a bill -- it's the background check bill we've seen before. A background check very likely wouldn't have stopped this, it wouldn't have stopped San Bernardino, a handful of other shootings, mass shootings. Why connect the two? I understand the overall argument about gun control. But if an AR-15 shouldn't be in the hands of some American citizens, why not push that? I mean, this bill already failed. It's a political statement. It's not practical. It failed in December. So why not go all out here?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me just say that as a factual matter, the President does believe that legislation should be passed that would ban assault weapons. So the President is strongly in favor of that, and he believes that Congress should act accordingly. I know that there are a number of other Democrats that strongly support legislation that would do that. The only reason it's not going through right now is because Republicans are blocking it.\nI think the reason that a range of these other gun safety measures continue to be considered by Congress or should be considered by Congress the way -- the reason the President continues to advocate for the passage of these laws is not necessarily because they would have prevented the most recent terrorist attack, but because they could prevent a terrorist attack in the future.\nRight now, it is possible for an individual who, because of their ties to terrorism, or potential ties to terrorism, is not allowed to board an airplane. But that same individual can walk into a gun store and buy a gun. That doesn't make any sense.\nAnd so the President's view is this is a common-sense thing. It's not going to undermine the constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans, so why would we prevent that from being a law on the books? I really don't know. Unless you're a politician who's terrified of the NRA. And unfortunately, that description -- again, based on the position that they have taken on this bill -- appears to aptly describe a substantial majority of Republicans in the House of Representatives and the United States Senate. That's unfortunate. Our country is more dangerous because of it.\nQ: President Obama said earlier today that this could be the work of a \"perversion of Islam.\" House Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republicans called it \"radical Islamic terrorism.\" Through the prism of translation, is there really a substantial difference between the two?\nMR. EARNEST: The President chooses his language carefully, because it is quite important for the American people to understand that we are not in any way going to give an extremist terrorist organization the legitimacy that they seek.\nThere is a reason that ISIL likes to refer to them as the Islamic State. They crave the notion that they could be identified as religious leaders or holy warriors that are engaged in a war in the name of Islam against the West. They're wrong. That's a myth. That is false. They have a bankrupt ideology that they're seeking to justify by using an otherwise peaceful religion.\nThe way that I can account for that is that there are Muslim Americans who have signed up to serve in our military who are fighting ISIL to protect the United States. There are patriotic Americans, Muslim Americans who serve in our intelligence services to try to protect the country, they're fighting ISIL. The United States is leading an international coalition against ISIL that includes critically important partners in the Muslim world.\nWhen the President of the United States first authorized airstrikes inside of Syria against ISIL targets, U.S. military pilots were flying alongside military pilots of other Muslim-majority countries. They are critical to our success. And in fact, ISIL carries out acts of violence and terrorism all around the world. The vast majority of the victims of that violence are innocent Muslim men, women and children.\nSo ISIL is seeking to perpetuate a narrative that they represent ISIL -- that they represent Islam in a war against the West. They are right: They are at war with the United States. But they do not represent Islam. In fact, there are millions of Muslim Americans in this country that are mobilized in that effort to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\nQ: And finally, just a question about something you said earlier. Can you say that the White House has never reached legal determination that it has exhausted all of its efforts when it comes to unilaterally acting through executive orders and such on gun control? Has it ever reached that determination? Or is it still looking?\nMR. EARNEST: Rich, I'm not going to rule out that the President may at some point in the future take steps, but I think we made pretty clear when the President announced a series of executive actions back in January, that he had asked his team to consider every available option for using his executive authority --\nQ: In those words, \"Every available option at the time\"?\nMR. EARNEST: -- and the President's team pursued every available option. But again, they're also always looking. And if there are new ways to use executive authority to keep the American people safe, the President won't hesitate to use them.\nSarah.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. When you say assault weapon, what exactly do you mean?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, these are weapons of war. There was an assault weapons ban that was in place in the '90s that lapsed during the term of the previous President, and the President believes that that ban on assault weapons should be reinstated.\nQ: But the AR-15 is a pretty popular weapon, and it was tweaked in response to the assault weapons ban. So conceivably, with that ban, this gun would still be out there. So I guess, maybe to follow up on some of the other questions about whether you think this gun should be legal and what types of features would you want -- would the President want banned in an assault weapons ban.\nMR. EARNEST: The President feels strongly that -- I will acknowledge that the technology behind some of these firearms and the way that they comport with certain aspects of certain pieces of legislation is complicated. I'm certainly not an expert in them. But there had previously been an assault weapons ban in place that took weapons of war off our streets -- certainly did not allow an individual to walk into a gun store and walk out that same day with a weapon of war, with a weapon that belongs on the battlefield. And the President strongly supports legislation that would do that.\nI know that there are Democrats in both houses of Congress that have put forward legislation that would do that, and the President believes that the Congress should pass it. And I think that Congress would succeed in passing it if it weren't for Republicans who are blocking it.\nQ: Every time the President talks about this type of thing -- the assault weapons ban, about gun restrictions -- it just increases sales of those types of weapons because people are worried that they're not going to be available. Is that something that he's cognizant of, that you're cognizant of, especially since this conversation today has also talked about the way the White House uses terminology about terrorism can affect the way people feel about it? Is that sort of same though process happening with the way you talk about guns?\nMR. EARNEST: I think what we try to do, Sarah, is we try to be as specific and precise as possible about the goals of our policy priorities. And the President's goals are to reduce gun violence. And the President believes that our communities would be safer, our streets would be safer if there were a range of common-sense steps, including reinstituting the assault weapons ban, put in place and passed by Congress. But they're not right now because Republicans have been preventing it.\nQ: But how does demonizing the most popular gun help create that consensus?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I don't know that I'm demonizing it, and I'm not sure that it's the most popular gun.\nChris.\nQ: Josh, what is the significance of the attacks in the context of the struggle for LGBT rights and the broader civil rights movement?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Chris, I certainly don't want to get ahead of the FBI investigation. And the FBI Director did say in his statement to the media earlier today that it's not clear what role anti-gay bigotry may have played in this particular incident.\nBut what is clear is that the LGBT community in Orlando was attacked. This country was attacked. Our commitment to inclusion and dignity and diversity and tolerance came under attack. And it's critically important that we unite in the face of that threat.\nAnd, look, I think the response that we've seen from the community in Orlando has been powerful -- to see people lined up around the block to give blood, to see innocent -- to see bystanders responding to their fellow citizens lying in the street is powerful. It represents what our country is about.\nAnd I think the President is certainly hopeful that that is the kind of spirit that will continue to be on display in the days and weeks and months ahead as the community of Orlando embarks on what is surely to be a long recovery from this very painful incident.\nQ: Is the attack a setback in the aftermath of victories for the LGBT community on marriage and other civil rights victories?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't think the LGBT community or the American people are going to shrink in the face of this kind of terrorist attack. I'm not concerned about that. I think the kind of strength and perseverance that's been on display in the LGBT community for more than a generation now in the fight for equality I think is an indication that they're not going to be cowed by violence perpetrated by this terrorist.\nQ: Many Republicans issued statements yesterday condemning the violence, but few, including Speaker Ryan, omitted the fact that it took place at a gay nightclub and many of the victims were LGBT patrons. Should they be faulted for that?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not going to -- I mean, look, I'm not going to Monday morning quarterback those kinds of statements. I'll let those individual members of Congress explain their views on this. But the President certainly had an opportunity to explain his views, and the President obviously stands by them.\nQ: Do you have any idea why they declined to identify the nature of the victims in this attack?\nMR. EARNEST: I do not know why. I do not know why.\nGo ahead, Jon.\nQ: One more. Back to this question of the shooter. Obviously, as we discussed, he had been under investigation on possible terrorist ties. And then he was able to buy his guns. Does the White House favor a policy change that would say that if somebody was under investigation, an FBI investigation, even if that investigation is closed, and if that individual then goes to purchase firearms, that that should at least -- there should at least be a notification back to the FBI? In other words, that the FBI should be notified if somebody who had been under a terrorist investigation then goes out and buys guns.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't know what sort of communication there already is in this regard.\nQ: Well, FBI Director Comey says that that is not the policy right now -- that that would be up to policymakers. It would require a policy change that says somebody who has been under investigation and then goes out to buy a gun, the FBI would get informed. Shouldn't that be the policy?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I don't have a policy change to announce at this point. But obviously, as the FBI conducts an investigation and takes a look at the investigations that were previously conducted, they're going to take a look at the question about whether or not there is something they could have done differently. And the President certainly will be interested to learn what they find out.\nJordan.\nQ: Given Mr. Trump's comments about the President earlier today -- in his speech just now, he misidentified the birthplace of the suspect; he said he was born in Afghanistan -- are there any concerns here about Donald Trump receiving classified intelligence briefings once he officially becomes the party's nominee?\nMR. EARNEST: Jordan, as we discussed I think a few weeks ago, this obviously is a process that will be administered by the Director of National Intelligence, and I'm confident that the DNI's office will fulfill the important responsibility that they have to brief the major-party nominees in a way that is absent any sort of political interference and consistent with the need to protect sensitive national security information.\nQ: Do you know if comments like this factor in the decisions they make about what information they decide to give to candidates?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know what factors into those decisions.\nLet's just do a couple more. Susan.\nQ: Thanks so much, Josh. Over the weekend, The Wall Street Journal reported that there was a friendly fire attack in Syria that was not previously acknowledged by the administration, that there was a dispute about how many people were killed -- these are Syrian rebels that we trained, unfortunately -- disputes between four and ten of them were killed. You had the man in charge of the counter-ISIL operation here at the White House on Friday talking about our counter-ISIL operations, obviously, and the state that they're in. I'm wondering if you thought there should be a responsibility of him to share that information with the press every time.\nMR. EARNEST: Susan, I have to admit, I have not seen the report from The Wall Street Journal, so at this point it's hard for me to comment on it or to even confirm that their reporting is accurate. Why don't you let me take a look at this and we'll have somebody follow up with you this afternoon.\nQ: And just one more question about Mr. McGurk's presentation. He cited a lot of progress on the aspects of countering the propaganda machine that Daesh, ISIL, has been putting out. I'm wondering if you feel that same level of confidence today, considering what happened at Pulse gay nightclub.\nMR. EARNEST: It's undeniable that we've made important progress in countering their efforts online. But they're still disseminating information, and there are still places where a variety of extremist organizations are seeking to propagate their radical ideology.\nSo again, the FBI is still only 24 hours into an investigation to try to learn more about what may have motivated the individual who carried out this terrorist attack in Orlando. So it's unclear exactly what this individual may have been exposed to that may have prompted them to be radicalized and inspired them to carry out this act of violence.\nSo it's hard to say -- I guess my point is this: It's hard to say right now -- and I don't think I can say conclusively right now -- that it was only ISIL that succeeded in radicalizing him. It's possible he may have been influenced by another organization that's an extremist organization that also has put out information that could inspire people to carry out acts of violence.\nQ: I think a lot of reporters are interested in that State Department operation to counter the propaganda machine. And the White House has worked with Twitter and Facebook and other social media websites. Is there any way we could have a briefing on that aspect of it? Because it seems a little bit shrouded in secrecy. I know it involves private organizations and private companies. But I think that a lot of us are curious about where that operation is, both at State and the White House.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President certainly did have an opportunity to travel to the West Coast, I believe it was last year, to meet with a variety of Silicon Valley-based organizations to try to advance this cooperation. And I know the President gave a speech there, and there was a two-day summit, I believe, with a range of national security professionals.\nQ: It wasn't completely open to the press.\nMR. EARNEST: I think many aspects of the summit were open to the press. But we can certainly provide you with additional information. I think the other place that I would encourage you to consult is the Department of Homeland Security -- that they do have a task force, a countering violent extremism task force, that's housed at that agency to ensure that we're marshalling and effectively integrating the wide variety of federal resources that are directed against violent extremism. And that involves a lot of careful coordination with state and local officials, as well. And so that would be another place for you to check.\nQ: One last question on the friendly fire incident. Does the President believe that the friendly fire incident should be acknowledged publicly?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I just don't know enough about the individual report, so let me take a look at it and we'll circle back with you.\nJared.\nQ: Josh, a follow-up to Michelle's question about the comments Secretary Clinton made earlier. You declined to criticize the candidate that the President has endorsed to succeed him. Will you acknowledge that there's some sunlight when she's willing to say phrases like \"radical jihad\" or \"radical Islamism\" and he is not?\nMR. EARNEST: I feel confident in saying this for Secretary Clinton: I am confident that she agrees 100 percent with the President's approach to fighting ISIL and strongly supporting this goal of making clear that Muslims in the United States should not be stigmatized or marginalized, and that we actually need to work effectively with state and local leaders all across the country in a way that the President has to make clear that Muslims are welcome in the United States.\nThe President gave a really powerful speech about this at the Baltimore-area mosque back in February, where the President made a direct appeal to young people and to young Muslims in the United States, making clear that they don't have to choose between being Muslim and American. They're Muslim -- they're both. They're Muslim Americans. And there are proud, loyal, patriotic Muslim Americans that we interact with every day, and they are part of what makes America that greatest country on the planet.\nQ: Is the President concerned that Clinton's choice to use language that is different and distinct from the language that he is carefully choosing to use -- does that risk giving the legitimacy that he is trying very hard not to confirm?\nMR. EARNEST: No, the President is not concerned about that.\nQ: Let me ask you about -- the President said the terrorism issue or a gun safety issue, he said it doesn't have to be an either/or, it can be a both/and. And yet you earlier in today's briefing and the President for months now has been saying that this should be the single issue -- that voters should use this as a litmus test; the President will use it as one to determine support for candidates. Which is it? Is it that voter -- that terrorism and gun safety should be considered equally? Or is the gun safety concern the primary concern that voters should use as a litmus test?\nMR. EARNEST: Jared, I think you're making it a little more complicated than it needs to be. I think the President is making clear that as a matter of policy, we don't have to choose between protecting the homeland and fighting terrorism and making our communities safer from gun violence. We can do both.\nQ: Josh, what the President has made clear is that as a political matter, the logic gate is that gun safety is the first and, as far as we've heard, only issue upon which he's willing to apply this litmus test. So how do we not take that lesson from it, if he's being so clear?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I guess I'm losing you on the logic gate business.\nQ: One last one about logistics. You said that you weren't able to give us any update about travel to Orlando. The President has got a congressional picnic, travel to Carlsbad. Anything else that's in flux on the calendar this week?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President's travel to Wisconsin is no longer on the books, but we'll keep you posted if there's anything else.\nLauren, I'll give you the last one here.\nQ: In these situations there's a lot of blame that goes around. And people are blaming Muslims, and people are also blaming Christians -- Christian conservatives responsible for creating an anti-gay climate. What is the White House position on Christians being blamed, Muslims being blamed -- on this blame game that we seem to be playing?\nMR. EARNEST: I strongly associate myself with the comments that were published on the front page of the Orlando Sentinel today. And the President has spoken to this in the past, as well, that when faced with adversity, there can be a temptation -- and it's a dangerous one -- to turn against one another. The President believes that it's important for our country to remain united, particularly around a set of core principles, particularly in the face of violent terrorists.\nAnd we can have our political differences. I don't think I've glossed over many political differences in the context of this briefing. But there's a community in Orlando that's grieving right now. They've sustained a terrible blow. But the rest of this country is grieving alongside with them.\nPeople all across this country have been touched by this terrible tragedy, by this terrible act of violence. And we don't allow the differences of race or religion, sexual orientation, gender identity to prevent us from being able to grieve alongside our fellow Americans. I think that's a pretty powerful statement about our country.\nAnd as our political leaders comment on this in the days and weeks ahead, I hope they'll follow the example of people in Orlando that haven't allowed those differences to divide that community. And the overwhelming outpouring of love and support and comfort has been inspiring. And I hope that people all across the country and even around the world can take some inspiration from that spirit of generosity that we've seen on display.\nQ: Last question on blame. At the top of the briefing, you pivoted to blaming Congress. Congress is also blaming the White House. One of the candidates is calling for the resignation. That is also another symptom in our country of the problems that exist. Why the blame?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Lauren, here's the thing. I don't think that there's anything that I've said here today that blames members of Congress for the terrible tragedy that occurred. If anybody came away with that impression, please let me know, because I'd like to have the opportunity to correct the record.\nBut I do think that we can and, in fact, should have a detailed consideration of what policies we're going to pursue as a country that prevent that kind of violence. And it is just a simple fact that Republicans have blocked common-sense steps that would make that kind of violence less frequent and could certainly potentially prevent those kinds of acts from taking place.\nI'm not at all suggesting that that means that somehow Republican members of Congress celebrate that violence. I don't think they do. I think that there were Democrats and Republicans in Orlando that came together and have come together to support that grieving community. They came together across party lines. I'm certainly not questioning the patriotism of any Republican in the United States Congress. I'm not questioning the commitment of Republicans in the United States Congress to caring about the death of innocent Americans.\nBut we do have an honest disagreement about some basic policy choices that does have significant and profound implications for our country's national security and for the safety of our communities across the country. And the nature of this engagement and the nature of our politics is that we're going to have a debate about those policies.\nSo, yes, I do hold Republicans accountable for blocking smart policies that would make us safer. And I'm going to continue to advocate for them to do so. The President certainly will, as well. We can do that without impugning their motives or questioning their patriotism. And that's certainly what I'm going to try to do.\nBut I think what's also true is that at some point this comes down to a level of just humanity. And it is important. And I think this was reflected in the statements from even some -- many Republicans in Congress. And we may quibble with some of the wording that was included in them, but I think, by and large, the comments -- even from Republicans in Congress with whom we have significant political differences -- have indicated that their concerns are with the people of Orlando. And that is how it should be. And that is what makes this country great. And I hope that people will continue to be inspired by that spirit and what for the city of Orlando and certainly for the LGBT community across the country will be some difficult days ahead.\nAll right, thanks, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 2:54 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2016-06-13", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}
{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117775", "text": "Thank you for joining me today.\nThis was going to be a speech on Hillary Clinton and how bad a President, especially in these times of Radical Islamic Terrorism, she would be.\nEven her former Secret Service Agent, who has seen her under pressure and in times of stress, has stated that she lacks the temperament and integrity to be president.\nThere will be plenty of opportunity to discuss these important issues at a later time, and I will deliver that speech soon.\nBut today there is only one thing to discuss: the growing threat of terrorism inside of our borders.\nThe attack on the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Florida, was the worst terrorist strike on our soil since September 11th, and the worst mass shooting in our country's history.\nSo many people dead, so many people gravely injured, so much carnage, such a disgrace.\nThe horror is beyond description.\nThe families of these wonderful people are totally devastated. Likewise, our whole nation, and indeed the whole world, is devastated.\nWe express our deepest sympathies to the victims, the wounded, and their families.\nWe mourn, as one people, for our nation's loss – and pledge our support to any and all who need it.\nI would like to ask now that we all observe a moment of silence for the victims of the attack.\n[SILENCE]\nOur nation stands together in solidarity with the members of Orlando's LGBT Community.\nThis is a very dark moment in America's history.\nA radical Islamic terrorist targeted the nightclub not only because he wanted to kill Americans, but in order to execute gay and lesbian citizens because of their sexual orientation.\nIt is a strike at the heart and soul of who we are as a nation.\nIt is an assault on the ability of free people to live their lives, love who they want and express their identity.\nIt is an attack on the right of every single American to live in peace and safety in their own country.\nWe need to respond to this attack on America as one united people – with force, purpose and determination.\nBut the current politically correct response cripples our ability to talk and think and act clearly.\nIf we don't get tough, and we don't get smart – and fast – we're not going to have a country anymore -- there will be nothing left.\nThe killer, whose name I will not use, or ever say, was born to Afghan parents who immigrated to the United States. His father published support for the Afghan Taliban, a regime which murders those who don't share its radical views. The father even said he was running for President of that country.\nThe bottom line is that the only reason the killer was in America in the first place was because we allowed his family to come here.\nThat is a fact, and it's a fact we need to talk about.\nWe have a dysfunctional immigration system which does not permit us to know who we let into our country, and it does not permit us to protect our citizens.\nWe have an incompetent administration, and if I am not elected President, that will not change over the next four years -- but it must change, and it must change now.\nWith fifty people dead, and dozens more wounded, we cannot afford to talk around the issue anymore -- we have to address it head on.\nI called for a ban after San Bernardino, and was met with great scorn and anger but now, many are saying I was right to do so -- and although the pause is temporary, we must find out what is going on. The ban will be lifted when we as a nation are in a position to properly and perfectly screen those people coming into our country.\nThe immigration laws of the United States give the President the power to suspend entry into the country of any class of persons that the President deems detrimental to the interests or security of the United States, as he deems appropriate.\nI will use this power to protect the American people. When I am elected, I will suspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we understand how to end these threats.\nAfter a full, impartial and long overdue security assessment, we will develop a responsible immigration policy that serves the interests and values of America.\nWe cannot continue to allow thousands upon thousands of people to pour into our country, many of whom have the same thought process as this savage killer.\nMany of the principles of Radical Islam are incompatible with Western values and institutions.\nRadical Islam is anti-woman, anti-gay and anti-American.\nI refuse to allow America to become a place where gay people, Christian people, and Jewish people, are the targets of persecution and intimidation by Radical Islamic preachers of hate and violence.\nIt's not just a national security issue. It is a quality of life issue.\nIf we want to protect the quality of life for all Americans – women and children, gay and straight, Jews and Christians and all people – then we need to tell the truth about Radical Islam.\nWe need to tell the truth, also, about how Radical Islam is coming to our shores.\nWe are importing Radical Islamic Terrorism into the West through a failed immigration system -- and through an intelligence community held back by our president.\nEven our own FBI Director has admitted that we cannot effectively check the backgrounds of the people we are letting into America.\nAll of the September 11th hijackers were issued visas.\nLarge numbers of Somali refugees in Minnesota have tried to join ISIS.\nThe Boston Bombers came here through political asylum.\nThe male shooter in San Bernardino – again, whose name I won't mention -- was the child of immigrants from Pakistan, and he brought his wife – the other terrorist - from Saudi Arabia, through another one of our easily exploited visa programs.\nImmigration from Afghanistan into the United States has increased nearly five-fold in just one year. According to Pew Research, 99% of people in Afghanistan support oppressive Sharia Law.\nWe admit many more from other countries in the region who share these same oppressive views.\nIf we want to remain a free and open society, then we have to control our borders.\nYet, Hillary Clinton – for months and despite so many attacks – repeatedly refused to even say the words \"radical Islam,\" until I challenged her yesterday to say the words or leave the race.\nHowever, Hillary Clinton – who has been forced to say the words today after policies she supports have caused us so much damage – still has no clue what Radical Islam is, and won't speak honestly about what it is.\nShe is in total denial, and her continuing reluctance to ever name the enemy broadcasts weakness across the world.\nIn fact, just a few weeks before the San Bernardino slaughter, Hillary Clinton explained her refusal to say the words Radical Islam. Here is what she said: \"Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people, and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism.\"\nHillary Clinton says the solution is to ban guns. They tried that in France, which has among the toughest gun laws in the world, and 130 were brutally murdered by Islamic terrorists in cold blood. Her plan is to disarm law-abiding Americans, abolishing the 2nd amendment, and leaving only the bad guys and terrorists with guns. She wants to take away Americans' guns, then admit the very people who want to slaughter us.\nI will be meeting with the NRA, which has given me their earliest endorsement in a Presidential race, to discuss how to ensure Americans have the means to protect themselves in this age of terror.\nThe bottom line is that Hillary supports the policies that bring the threat of Radical Islam into America, and allow it to grow overseas.\nIn fact, Hillary Clinton's catastrophic immigration plan will bring vastly more Radical Islamic immigration into this country, threatening not only our security but our way of life.\nWhen it comes to Radical Islamic terrorism, ignorance is not bliss – it's deadly.\nThe Obama Administration, with the support of Hillary Clinton and others, has also damaged our security by restraining our intelligence-gathering and failing to support law enforcement. They have put political correctness above common sense, above your safety, and above all else.\nI refuse to be politically correct.\nI will do the right thing--I want to straighten things out and to Make America Great Again.\nThe days of deadly ignorance will end, and they will end soon.\nAs President I will give our intelligence community, law enforcement and military the tools they need to prevent terrorist attacks.\nWe need an intelligence-gathering system second to none. That includes better cooperation between state, local and federal officials – and with our allies.\nI will have an Attorney General, a Director of National Intelligence, and a Secretary of Defense who will know how to fight the war on Radical Islamic Terrorism – and who will have the support they require to get the job done.\nWe also must ensure the American people are provided the information they need to understand the threat.\nThe Senate Subcommittee on Immigration has already identified hundreds of immigrants charged with terrorist activities inside the United States since September 11th.\nNearly a year ago, the Senate Subcommittee asked President Obama's Departments of Justice, State and Homeland Security to provide the immigration history of all terrorists inside the United States.\nThese Departments refused to comply.\nPresident Obama must release the full and complete immigration histories of all individuals implicated in terrorist activity of any kind since 9/11.\nThe public has a right to know how these people got here.\nWe have to screen applicants to know whether they are affiliated with, or support, radical groups and beliefs.\nWe have to control the amount of future immigration into this country to prevent large pockets of radicalization from forming inside America.\nEven a single individual can be devastating, just look at what happened in Orlando. Can you imagine large groups?\nTruly, our President doesn't know what he is doing. He has failed us, and failed us badly, and under his leadership, this situation will not get any better -- it will only get worse.\nEach year, the United States permanently admits more than 100,000 immigrants from the Middle East, and many more from Muslim countries outside the Middle East. Our government has been admitting ever-growing numbers, year after year, without any effective plan for our security.\nIn fact, Clinton's State Department was in charge of the admissions process for people applying to enter from overseas.\nHaving learned nothing from these attacks, she now plans to massively increase admissions without a screening plan, including a 500% increase in Syrian refugees.\nThis could be a better, bigger version of the legendary Trojan Horse.\nWe can't let this happen.\nAltogether, under the Clinton plan, you'd be admitting hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East with no system to vet them, or to prevent the radicalization of their children.\nThe burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why she believes immigration from these dangerous countries should be increased without any effective system to screen who we are bringing in.\nThe burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why we should admit anyone into our country who supports violence of any kind against gay and lesbian Americans.\nThe burden is also on Hillary Clinton to tell us how she will pay for it. Her plan will cost Americans hundreds of billions of dollars long-term.\nWouldn't this money be better spent on rebuilding America for our current population, including the many poor people already living here?\nWe have to stop the tremendous flow of Syrian refugees into the United States – we don't know who they are, they have no documentation, and we don't know what they're planning.\nWhat I want is common sense. I want a mainstream immigration policy that promotes American values.\nThat is the choice I put before the American people: a mainstream immigration policy designed to benefit America, or Hillary Clinton's radical immigration policy designed to benefit politically-correct special interests.\nWe've got to get smart, and tough, and vigilant, and we've got to do it now, because later is too late.\nAsk yourself, who is really the friend of women and the LGBT community, Donald Trump with his actions, or Hillary Clinton with her words? Clinton wants to allow Radical Islamic terrorists to pour into our country—they enslave women, and murder gays.\nI don't want them in our country.\nThe terrorist attack on the Pulse Night Club demands a full and complete investigation into every aspect of the assault.\nIn San Bernardino, as an example, people knew what was going on, but they used the excuse of racial profiling for not reporting it.\nWe need to know what the killer discussed with his relatives, parents, friends and associates.\nWe need to know if he was affiliated with any radical Mosques or radical activists and what, if any, is their immigration status.\nWe need to know if he travelled anywhere, and who he travelled with.\nWe need to make sure every single last person involved in this plan – including anyone who knew something but didn't tell us – is brought to justice.\nIf it can be proven that somebody had information about any attack, and did not give this information to authorities, they must serve prison time .\nAmerica must do more – much more – to protect its citizens, especially people who are potential victims of crimes based on their backgrounds or sexual orientations.\nIt also means we must change our foreign policy.\nThe decision to overthrow the regime in Libya, then pushing for the overthrow of the regime in Syria, among other things, without plans for the day after, have created space for ISIS to expand and grow.\nThese actions, along with our disastrous Iran deal, have also reduced our ability to work in partnership with our Muslim allies in the region.\nThat is why our new goal must be to defeat Islamic terrorism, not nation-building.\nFor instance, the last major NATO mission was Hillary Clinton's war in Libya. That mission helped unleash ISIS on a new continent.\nI've said NATO needs to change its focus to stopping terrorism. Since I've raised that criticism, NATO has since announced a new initiative focused on just that.\nAmerica must unite the whole civilized world in the fight against Islamic terrorism, just like we did against communism in the Cold War.\nWe've tried it President Obama's way. He gave the world his apology tour, we got ISIS, and many other problems, in return.\nI'd like to conclude my remarks today by again expressing our solidarity with the people of Orlando who have come under attack.\nWhen I am President, I pledge to protect and defend all Americans who live inside of our borders. Wherever they come from, wherever they were born, all Americans living here and following our laws will be protected.\nAmerica will be a tolerant and open society.\nAmerica will also be a safe society.\nWe will protect our borders at home.\nWe will defeat ISIS overseas.\nWe will ensure every parent can raise their children in peace and safety.\nWe will make America rich again.\nWe will make America safe again.\nWe will make American Great Again.\nThank you.\nThe media talks about \"homegrown,\" terrorism, but Islamic radicalism, and the networks that nurture it, are imports from overseas.\nYes, there are many radicalized people already inside our country as a result of the poor policies of the past. But the whole point is that it will be much, much easier to deal with our current problem if we don't keep on bringing in people who add to the problem.\nFor instance, the controversial Mosque attended by the Boston Bombers had as its founder an immigrant from overseas charged in an assassination plot.\nThis shooter in Orlando was the child of an immigrant father who supported one of the most repressive regimes on Earth. Why would we admit people who support violent hatred?\nHillary Clinton can never claim to be a friend of the gay community as long as she continues to support immigration policies that bring Islamic extremists to our country who suppress women, gays and anyone who doesn't share their views.\nShe can't have it both ways. She can't claim to be supportive of these communities while trying to increase the number of people coming in who want to oppress them.\nHow does this kind of immigration make our life better? How does this kind of immigration make our country better?\nWhy does Hillary Clinton want to bring people here—in vast numbers—who reject our values?\nImmigration is a privilege, and we should not let anyone into this country who doesn't support our communities – all of our communities.\nAmerica has already admitted four times more immigrants than any country on earth, and we continue to admit millions more with no real checks or scrutiny.\nNot surprisingly, wages for our workers haven't budged in many years.\nSo whether it's matter of national security, or financial security, we can't afford to keep on going like this. We owe $19 trillion in debt, and no longer have options.\nAll our communities, from all backgrounds, are ready for some relief. This is not an act of offense against anyone; it is an act of defense.\nI want us all to work together, including in partnership with our Muslim communities. But Muslim communities must cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad – and they do know where they are.\nI want to fix our schools, roads, bridges and job market. I want every American to succeed. Hillary Clinton wants to empty out the Treasury to bring people into the country that include individuals who preach hate against our own citizens.\nI want to protect our citizens – all of our citizens.", "timestamp": "2016-06-13", "title": "Remarks at Saint Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118131", "text": "UNITED STATE OF WOMEN SUMMIT\nTomorrow, ahead of the first-ever United State of Women Summit, the Obama administration, private-sector companies, foundations and organizations are announcing $50 million in commitments, along with new policies, tools and partnerships that will continue to expand opportunity for women and girls. These announcements include a pledge by more than two dozen leading companies to take actions to continue to close the gender pay gap, new resources to empower community college students to negotiate their first salaries, new campaigns to change how our country values caregiving and improve portrayals of women in media, and enhanced global efforts to promote gender quality worldwide. Each of these new efforts build on the work that President Obama and his administration have done since the day he took office ensure that women and girls have equal rights, treatment and protections. He's signed major pieces of legislation like the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act - the first major bill he signed into law in January of 2009 - and the Affordable Care Act. He's dramatically expanded fair pay and paid leave protections. And his administration has systematically encouraged cities and states to embrace policies like higher minimum wage and paid leave.\nUnderpinning these actions, the President has spoken out and driven a conversation? about treating women fairly. He convened the first-ever  White House Summit focused on working families to help build 21st century workplaces that better support the needs of families and companies. He has pushed for cultural change that gives women the respect they deserve in schools and in workplaces, and joined advocates in dramatically changing our country's approach to sexual assault on campus and elsewhere. That conversation has spurred changes in cities and states, businesses big and small, and schools from pre-K to college.\nTo continue this conversation, tomorrow the President and Vice President will participate in the United State of Women Summit to highlight the progress that has been made over the course of this Administration, and discuss public and private sector solutions to the challenges that still lie ahead. The First Lady will join Oprah Winfrey for a conversation aimed to inspire the next generation of women, shedding light on the progress the First Lady and Ms. Winfrey has seen women achieve and to encourage young women to take action so that progress continues for generations to come.\nThe primary goal of the Summit is to build a roadmap for future policymakers, stakeholders and advocates to continue to expand opportunities for women and girls. The Summit is being convened by the White House Council on Women and Girls, hosted in partnership with the Department of State, the Department of Labor, the Aspen Institute, and Civic Nation, and will bring together leaders across a wide array of public and private sector industries, along with students, advocates, entertainers, and athletes, to explore six issue areas that are critical for women and girls: economic empowerment, violence against women, health and wellness, civic engagement, education and entrepreneurship. Learn more about the work of the White House Council on Women and Girls here.\nThe new commitments, resources and initiatives being unveiled tomorrow will build on the progress we have made over the past seven and a half years - both domestically and internationally - on behalf of women and girls. They include:\nCommitments from leading companies to join new White House equal pay pledge\n• Tomorrow, highlighting the critical role that businesses must play in reducing the national gender pay gap, the White House will announce a new private sector engagement, called the White House Equal Pay Pledge, for companies who share this commitment - many of which are already taking steps on their own. Each company signing this pledge commits to take action within their organizations by conducting an annual company-wide gender pay analysis across occupations, reviewing their hiring and promotion processes, embedding equal pay efforts into broader enterprise-wide equity initiatives, and identifying and promoting other best practices that will help ensure wage fairness for all workers. As part of this announcement, 28 companies have signed on to the pledge, including Accenture, Airbnb, Amazon, American Airlines, BCG, Buffer, Care.com, CEB, Cisco, Deloitte, the Dow Chemical Company, Expedia, Inc., Gap Inc., Glassdoor, GoDaddy, Jet.com, Johnson & Johnson, L'Orйal USA, PepsiCo, Pinterest, Popcorn Heaven, PwC, Rebecca Minkoff, Salesforce, Slack , Spotify, Staples, and Stella McCartney. Additional companies are invited to join this effort in the coming months. The pledge and additional commitments and statements from signatories can be found here. Read more about the gender wage gap in an updated report released by the White House Council of Economic Advisors, available here.\nModernized protections against gender-based discrimination in the workplace\n• The Department of Labor will publish a final rule comprehensively updating its sex discrimination guidelines for federal contractors (including subcontractors) for the first time since the 1970s. The rule newly addresses a variety of sex-based barriers to equal opportunity and fair pay in the workplace, including pay discrimination; sexual harassment; pregnancy-related accommodations; family caregiving discrimination; and discrimination on the basis of gender identity or transgender status.\nNew collaboration with Harvard Negotiating & Mediation Clinic to expand career readiness resources through making available negotiation training for community college students nationwide\n• Negotiation training can be critical in helping workers of any age secure a good job, salary and benefits - but many workers, especially women and those newly entering the job market, can face distinct barriers. Tomorrow, the Department of Education and Harvard Law School's Negotiation and Mediation Clinical Program - as part of their program in negotiation training - are announcing the development of a new toolkit for community college students around the country to equip them with the knowledge and tools that will better prepare them for starting a career and successfully negotiating their first salary. In addition to being available for community college students, the toolkit will be made publicly available later this year - so will be an important readiness resource for all those newly entering the job market.\n• The Department of Labor will award more than $54 million in grants to give working parents the ability to train for higher wage jobs while addressing barriers faced by those with child care responsibilities. This will help working parents address key barriers to participating in and successfully completing training for middle-and high-skilled jobs in in-demand fields, as well as help bridge the gap between the workforce development and child care systems. By leveraging additional public and/or private funding, the grants promote activities that address barriers to accessing training and employment including co-location of training and child care services; increased access through unconventional training delivery times or locations; flexibilities related to scheduling and child care exigencies; and improved access to child care and other related participant supportive services. This more than doubles the grant awards previously announced as part of the Department's Strengthening Working Families Initiative grant program.\nA New Coalition to Change How We Value Care in the 21st Century\n• Child and elder care are key to the economic growth of our country and the wellbeing of our families, but too often, we overlook the needs - and vital economic and social contributions - of paid and unpaid caregivers. Today Care.com, Caring Across Generations, and New America are launching the \"Who Cares Coalition,\" a unique partnership bringing together a corporation, advocacy campaign, and think tank to spearhead a broad-based social change movement redefining the cultural norms, behaviors, business practices, and policies around caregiving in the US. The \"Who Cares Coalition\" will reach millions of families and caregivers by uniting the world's largest online marketplace for family care; the nation's top advocate for families, caregivers and aging Americans; and the leading, nonpartisan civic enterprise focused on creating new data and policy analysis on caregivers and changing the narrative around care.\nNew advertiser-led campaign to improve portrayals of women and girls across advertising and media\n• The Association of National Advertisers (ANA) Alliance for Family Entertainment (AFE) will announce a new initiative called \"#SeeHer\" to incentivize advertisers, content creators and the media to develop and showcase content that portrays diverse women and girls authentically. The ANA is the largest representative body for the marketing community in the United States, including over 650 member companies with 10,000 brands who collectively spend more than $250 billion in marketing and advertising each year. The AFE is a coalition of ANA members with family-driven brands. With the launch of #SeeHer, the ANA will share toolkits to support the campaign and lay out the roles of partner organizations to ensure success.\nNew foundation-backed initiative to invest in young women of color\n• Seven women's foundations are announcing their commitment to launch a Young Women's Initiative in 2016, which will invest and catalyze resources to improve equal opportunity and the prosperity of young women, with a focus on young women of color and those experiencing the greatest disparities in outcomes in our communities. The Young Women's Initiative will be built on cross-sector partnerships, including: government; philanthropies; nonprofits; corporations; and, most importantly, the young women themselves. The foundations announcing this commitment include the Women's Foundation of Minnesota, California Women's Foundation, Washington Area Women's Foundation, Dallas Women's Foundation, The Women's Fund of Greater Birmingham, Women's Foundation for a Greater Memphis and The Women's Fund of Western Massachusetts. The New York Women's Foundation previously launched a Young Women's Initiative in 2015.\nAcademics and Advocacy Groups Launch a Policy Platform to support Marginalized Girls\n• The Girls at the Margin Alliance, a group of more than 150 alliance members, steered by The National Crittenton Foundation, Rights4Girls, the National Women's Law Center, Georgetown Center on Policy and Inequality and Girls Inc, will launch a policy platform that will propose concrete, actionable recommendations to ensure that marginalized girls and young women are met with system responses that honor their experiences and voices, provide opportunities for them to heal, develop their strengths, overcome challenges, ensure their safety, and support them in building thriving lives. This platform will provide a framework for change for all organizations and individuals dedicated to the potential of girls and young women. The Alliance was created to advance the best interest of girls who are marginalized by their communities, and often by their families and by the systems charged with their care.\nNew report and convening on early educator compensation\n• Tomorrow, the Departments of Health and Human Services and Education are releasing a new report on the compensation of the early care and education workforce. The report examines the low - and often poverty level - wages that child care providers and early educators receive, the vast majority of whom are women, the growing demand for high-quality early education to both support working families and foster children's early brain development, and the key role that early educators and child care providers play in preparing the next generation of girls, and all young children, for success. To organize around solutions that address this issue, the Obama Administration will co-host a convening on June 15th with early childhood stakeholders, in partnership with the National Head Start Association, the National Association for the Education of Young Children, the National Women's Law Center, and the Service International Employees Union.\nEnhanced global efforts to empower women and promote gender equality worldwide\n• The U.S. Department of State will release a new strategy for women's economic empowerment across the globe. The strategy will outline four broad policy objectives: promoting women's equal access to resources and services, promoting women's equal access to decent work, promoting women's entrepreneurship, and addressing overarching issues that impede women's economic participation, such as gender-based violence. The State Department's overseas missions and domestic offices and bureaus will use the strategy to guide their efforts to support women's economic participation and pursue gender integration across their portfolios.\n• The White House will announce updates to two global strategy cornerstones of the U.S. Government's commitment to advancing human rights and promoting gender equality worldwide. The updated U.S. Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based Violence Globally, jointly led by USAID and the State Department, reflects our growing understanding of gender-based violence, including historic provisions for vulnerable populations, such as lesbian and transgender women. Established in a 2012 Executive Order in order to prioritize U.S. foreign policy and programs to combat gender-based violence worldwide using a whole-of-government, interagency approach, it lays out the tools the U.S. Government is employing to prevent and combat this scourge. Annually, the  State Department and  USAID contribute approximately $150 million to support projects all over the world that support women's and community groups broadly. USAID alone has reached more than five million survivors of GBV with vital, sometimes life-saving services in more than 40 countries worldwide, and has awarded more than $17 million in dedicated incentive funds to support innovative pilot programs, research, and scaled best practices to address GBV in 15 countries.\n• Likewise, the newly updated National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security will provide the framework for U.S. efforts to increase participation of women in peace processes, prevent sexual violence in conflict, empower women to prevent violence, and ensure that women and girls have equal access to relief and recovery resources.\nMore than $20 million in new commitments to the Let Girls Learn Initiative to support the 62 million girls around the world who are out of school with the opportunity to attain an education:\n• CARE is committing to reach three million adolescent girls, by investing $15 million dollars in six countries through its Udaan \"Second Chances\" school program. Through this new commitment, Second Chances will broaden from India into Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Somalia, and Malawi to double its reach. This program provides an intensive, nine month curriculum to help girls who were unable to finish primary school, catch up to their peers. Through Second Chances, some of the world's most marginalized girls have returned to school and some have even gone on to college. With a 95 percent success rate, CARE plans to broaden this program with the support of ministries of education, corporations, foundations, and local organizations.\n• Oracle is committing to invest more than $3 million in direct and in-kind funds over the next 12 months to promote and support educational opportunities for adolescent girls around the world. Under this Let Girls Learn commitment, Oracle Academy, Oracle Women's Leadership (OWL) communities, Oracle's Diversity & Inclusion program, and Oracle Volunteers will offer more than 65 direct educational events and support conferences, summer computing camps, and codefests for girls, reaching more than 55,000 students around the globe and inspiring them to explore and pursue opportunities in STEM fields. The Oracle Education Foundation and Oracle Volunteers will teach girls coding, electrical engineering, and project management through four immersive girls-only workshops. Oracle also plans to expand the work of its Oracle Academy program in Egypt by making an additional investment of nearly $1 million in resources and services over the next four years as part of a new partnership with the Ministry of Education in Egypt to expand computer science education for girls in nine newly developed STEM schools. These schools, also supported by USAID, will provide three years of paid secondary education for each girl.\n• The International Rescue Committee (IRC) is committing to deliver new programs worth $1 million to adolescent girls in the most conflict-affected states in Africa and the Middle East, including programming that addresses how violence impacts girls' learning and their ability to access education services. Through its education and GIRL SHINE programs, IRC will target the hardest-to-reach adolescent girls with an in-school and out-of-school enhanced package of services, including girl-only safe spaces and discussion groups, life skills and social and emotional skill development curricula, remedial support in math and reading, parent and caregiver support groups, and an interactive visioning program that breaks down barriers, reduces violence, and ensures increased access to education.\n• The Hershey Company is committing to support projects that will empower and educate adolescent girls through a $250,000 three-year commitment to the Peace Corps' Let Girls Learn Fund. The Hershey Company has a long history of giving underserved children the resources they need to be successful. Tomorrow, the company will advance this shared social purpose through this new commitment to Peace Corps' Let Girls Learn Fund.\n• PayPal is featuring Peace Corps' Let Girls Learn Fund in its Back to School charitable giving campaign this August as part of an effort to raise awareness and encourage millions of PayPal U.S. users to support Let Girls Learn projects around the world. In addition to encouraging customers in the U.S. to support the Peace Corps' Let Girls Learn Fund, PayPal will add 1 percent to each donation, ensuring that 101 percent of every gift made by PayPal U.S. users reaches Let Girls Learn projects.\n• American Airlines, through its Change for Good partnership with UNICEF, commits to expanding support for adolescent girls' education by working with UNICEF's \"Let Us Learn\" initiative. American commits to build upon Let Us Learn's successes to-date, including awarding more than 4,000 scholarships to girls in Madagascar to help them enroll and stay in school through the lower secondary level, and helping over 8,000 out-of-school adolescent girls enroll in non-formal classes that provide flexible learning opportunities in Nepal.\n• Just Like My Child Foundation (JLMC) is committing to reach an additional 10,000 vulnerable adolescent girls with their Girl Power Project© in Central Uganda, thereby doubling their current program reach by 2020. An initial investment from the Toni Ko Foundation will launch the JLMC's $250,000 commitment. The Girl Power Project© was created to empower adolescent girls and to reduce barriers that prevent adolescent girls from completing secondary school. The Girl Power Project© (GPP) \"System in a Box\" is an evidence¬-based, innovative, targeted, and scalable mentoring program totaling more than 60 hours of training over two years. It addresses the complex needs of vulnerable adolescent girls' aged 10¬-15, by ensuring that they stay in school and avoid obstacles in the transition to secondary school.

This grant to Equal Justice Works will be the first ever army of new lawyers and paralegals to help victims of those who prey on our nation's elders.\n• The Department of Justice, through its Office on Violence on Women (OVW), is investing $3.2 million in new initiatives to prevent domestic violence homicides. This includes $700,000 for the establishment of a new National Resource Center on Domestic Violence and Firearms to improve the criminal justice system's response to domestic violence homicides involving firearms, as well as a new $900,000 technical assistance grant award to a consortium of organizations that will work closely with OVW to provide enhanced training and technical assistance to implement an effective firearms response at the local, state, and tribal levels. OVW has also entered into a partnership with the National Network for Safe Communities (NNSC) at John Jay College of Criminal Justice to launch the new $1.6 million National Intimate Partner Violence Intervention Initiative (NIPVII). NIPVII will work with three cities, to be selected as part of the demonstration pilot, to replicate a successful strategy for reducing intimate partner violence and homicides. The National Institute of Justice will oversee an evaluation of the initiative through a grant to Yale University. Additionally, OVW will announce the addition of two new cities, Miami, FL and Winnebago County, IL, as replication sites for the Lethality Assessment Program model. This model was included as part of OVW's Domestic Violence Homicide Prevention Demonstration Initiative, established in 2012.\n• The Department of Justice, through its Office on Violence Against Women, will award nearly $1.2 million to two organizations to help jurisdictions implement the Department of Justice Guidance on Identifying and Preventing Gender Bias in Law Enforcement Response to Sexual Assault and Domestic Violence, which was released by the Attorney General in December 2015. Through training and technical assistance, these grants will develop resources and build the capacity of law enforcement and advocacy organizations to improve responses to domestic and sexual violence victims.\n• Tomorrow the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) will release a special report, Down the Road: Testing Evidence in Sexual Assaults. It highlights findings from NIJ-supported action research projects in Houston and Detroit, where two multidisciplinary teams of criminal justice professionals developed effective strategies to address the large numbers of sexual assault kits that had not been submitted for DNA testing. The report offers key lessons for improving responses to sexual assault based on research findings from Houston and Detroit and discusses NIJ's forensic and social science research portfolios as they relate to using biological evidence to solve sexual assaults.\n• The Department of Health and Human Services' Administration for Children and Families Office on Trafficking in Persons has partnered with the Office on Women's Health to create a training for healthcare and social service providers offering trauma-informed services to survivors of human trafficking. This will be complemented by a new initiative to collect data to improve understanding of how trafficking survivors interact with the health system and with social service providers, and will begin in August 2016.\n• The Department of Justice Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) will invest $1.35 million in holistic services for American Indian and Alaska Native victims of sex trafficking in urban settings. Organizations awarded funds through this investment will be supported by Project Beacon, a training and technical assistance project that will help service providers' work to promote the healing of sex trafficking victims. OVC will support Project Beacon through an additional investment of $450,000.\n• The Department of Justice Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, through its National Girls Initiative, will provide an additional $700,000 in funds to support eleven community programs in Iowa, Hawaii, New York, California, Texas, Connecticut, Washington state, and the District of Columbia, that are working with young women and girls at-risk of entering the juvenile justice system. These programs are culturally-responsive, and build on girls' strengths to empower them to build brighter futures.\n• The Department of Justice Office of Violence Against Women will release a report summarizing the sustained impact of the Violence against Women Act (VAWA) throughout communities across the country, drawing from conversations with domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking service providers from over twenty states and tribes.", "timestamp": "2016-06-13", "title": "Fact Sheet: Government, Businesses and Organizations Announce $50 Million in Commitments to Support Women And Girls"}

New breakthroughs in treating cancer and ending the wait for organ transplants... That's some of what America can do.\"\nPresident Obama, May 19, 2016\nEvery 10 minutes, someone is added to the waiting list for a life-saving organ transplant in the United States. And every day, 22 people die while waiting. Today, the Obama Administration, as well as dozens of companies, foundations, universities, hospitals, and patient advocacy organizations are taking steps to change that by announcing a new set of actions that will build on the Administration's efforts to improve outcomes for individuals waiting for organ transplants and support for living donors. Some of the actions being announced aim to increase the number of people who register to become organ donors, some aim to increase the number of transplants and improve outcomes for patients, and others are focused on changing what might be possible for future patients by facilitating breakthrough research and development.\nBuilding on A Record of Supporting Patients and Increasing Access to Organ Transplantation\nToday's commitments build on earlier Administration actions to improve outcomes for individuals waiting for organ transplants and support living donors.\n• Each year, approximately 6,000 Americans make the selfless decision to become a living organ donor, facilitating life-saving kidney and liver transplants. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, individuals who have donated organs have access to health insurance without worrying whether their donation will be considered a pre-existing condition.\n• The Hope Act signed by President Obama in 2013 legalized the use of organs from HIV-positive donors for use in HIV-positive recipients, in the setting of clinical research. Earlier this year, surgeons at Johns Hopkins University performed the first-in-the-United-States HIV-positive to HIV-positive liver and kidney transplants. As this research continues, we will understand more about the success of these transplant procedures, and the potential for the use of organs from HIV-positive donors to increase access to all patients on the waiting list.\n• HHS launched a nationwide kidney paired donation program in 2010 to build on the transformative innovation of pooling living donors and recipients to increase the likelihood of matches.\n• Drawing on the spirit of innovation that President Obama spoke about in this year's State of the Union address, seven government agencies have invested nearly  $3 billion over a 3-year period in the future of bioengineering to advance our understanding of wound repair and organ and tissue regeneration and preservation.\nNew actions announced today\nFacilitating breakthrough research and development with almost $200 million in investments\nJust a few generations ago, living without kidneys was unimaginable. But that diagnosis changed thanks to Dr. Willem Kolff, a Dutch immigrant who brought his invention of the dialysis machine to the United States after World War II. New breakthroughs in bioengineering, transplantation, and organ preservation can further increase the number of organ transplants and improve outcomes. Researchers have the potential to repair or replace tissues and organs, reduce waitlists for organ transplants, and potentially reduce health care cost for treatments - but we must continue to invest in breakthrough research and development. For example, consider that most organs can only be stored for three to twelve hours, which means that many viable transplant organs are discarded. If even half of all unused donated hearts and lungs could reach transplant patients in time, experts estimate that the waiting list for hearts and lungs could end in two to three years. Announcements include, among others:\n• The Department of Defense (DOD) is announcing more than $160 million in public-private investment in a new Advanced Tissue Biofabrication Manufacturing Innovation Institute to research and develop next-generation manufacturing techniques that can be used to repair and replace cells and tissues and that may one day lead to organ replacement. DOD also is announcing $7 million in awards to small businesses working to advance the science and technology of organ and tissue preservation.\n• The American Society of Nephrology (ASN) commits the first $7 million toward the design, launch, and execution of a potential Kidney Disease XPRIZE, in partnership with the XPRIZE Foundation.\n• The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) announces $15 million for projects dedicated to improving outcomes after lung transplantation.\n• The Laura and John Arnold Foundation (LJAF) is announcing a $4.2 million grant to test donor interventions that maximize the quantity and quality of life-saving organs that each donor is able to give.\nClosing the gap between the 95 percent of Americans who support organ donation and the roughly 50 percent who are registered organ donors\nThe donor registration system was first built in 1968 and has been run almost exclusively through states' Departments of Motor Vehicles. Despite data showing 95 percent of Americans support organ donation, only approximately half are registered as organ donors. Now, with new technologies available, there is an opportunity to re-imagine the donor registration system in more seamless and effective ways, with the goals of increasing registrations and life-saving transplants. Today, more than 20 entities—from organ procurement organizations (OPOs) to patient advocacy organizations to major technology companies—have committed to help reduce the agonizing wait for an organ transplant. Announcements include, among others:\n• More than 12 organizations including Facebook, ORGANIZE, Tinder, and Twitter are developing new tools and public advocacy campaigns to increase the options and ease of registering to be an organ donor, with a goal of achieving 1 million new registrations and social declarations by the autumn of 2016.\n• Amy Poehler's Smart Girls will create content and use its social channels to promote organ donation and registration throughout summer and autumn of 2016.\nInvesting in clinical research and innovation that could potentially increase the number of transplants by almost 2,000 each year and improve outcomes for patients\nFederal agencies are taking new actions to improve outcomes in transplantation, by improving support for veterans-who experience kidney failure at a higher rate than the general public-and helping more Americans access life-saving transplants through kidney paired donation, which pools living donors and recipients to increase the likelihood of matches. Private sector organizations are developing better resources and tools that are critical to ensuring access to life-saving transplantation opportunities. Announcements include, among others:\n• Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (Walter Reed Bethesda) today announces a pilot to pioneer kidney paired donation chains started via the military share program-in which families of active duty military service members donate one of their kidneys to patients listed for transplant at Walter Reed-to help those who are hard to match to receive kidney transplants.\n• More than 30 transplant centers are today announcing a collaboration to share data and best practices for kidney transplants for hard-to-match patients, which has the potential to help almost 1,000 more people a year access transplants.\n• Johns Hopkins University is working with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease to launch a multicenter study of HIV-positive to HIV-positive organ transplants; as protocols are developed to use the HIV-positive donor pool, this could lead to as many as 1,000 more transplants per year.\n• The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), the nation's Organ Procurement and Transplant Network, will increase efficiencies in the organ procurement and transplant system as well as the potential number of transplants through new technology and data tools that are open to transplant centers and the research community.\nReducing the Organ Waiting List\nRevolutionary medical breakthroughs in the 20th century—such as advances in organ transplantation, tissue typing, and the development of immunosuppressant drugs—have led to hundreds of thousands of life-saving organ transplants and a longer survival rate for recipients.\nTransplants of kidneys, livers, hearts, pancreata, intestines, and lungs are now considered achievable medical successes.\nAdvances in medicine and technology and increased awareness of the need for organ donation and transplantation have increased national rates of these interventions. Last year there were more than 30,000 transplants in the United States—representing the most annual transplants ever and the largest year-over-year percentage increase in transplants since 2004. Despite this progress, there are still more than 120,000 people on the waiting list for an organ in the United States.\nThe vast majority—almost 100,000—of the people on the organ waiting list are waiting for a kidney transplant. In addition to the tremendous human cost, the kidney waiting list carries a huge cost to the public purse: Medicare pays more than  $34 billion per year to care for patients with end-stage kidney failure. According to the  2013 Economic Report of the President, on average, the Government would save $60,000 a year for every patient who receives a kidney transplant rather than continuing to receive dialysis. Those patients also would see appreciable gains in life expectancy. For example, the life expectancy of a living donor kidney recipient increases by 10-15 years after a transplant, again relative to dialysis treatment.\nToday's announcements represent an essential step toward increasing access to organ transplants and reducing the organ waiting list. But there is more to be done. The Administration is committing to providing an update in the next 180 days, which will outline common-sense steps to reduce the organ transplant waiting list and improve outcomes for patients and will report on continued progress on public and private actions like those announced today. This update will be a roadmap for more opportunities in the three areas described in this Fact Sheet, including narrowing the gap between the 95 percent of Americans who support organ donation and the roughly 50 percent who are registered organ donors; new clinical research and innovations that can increase the number of transplants and improve outcomes for patients; and facilitating breakthrough research and development.\nFull details on all of today's announcements can be found  here.", "timestamp": "2016-06-13", "title": "Fact Sheet: Obama Administration Announces Key Actions to Reduce the Organ Waiting List"}

Roof, accused gunman in the shootings at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, SC, on June 17, 2015.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117894", "text": "The President. I just had the opportunity to get the latest briefing from FBI Director Comey, as well as Deputy Attorney General Yates and the rest of my national security team, about the tragedy that took place in Orlando. They're going to be doing a more extensive briefing around noon, just a little bit after noon, over at FBI headquarters. So I will allow them to go into all the details, but I thought it was important for you to hear directly from me.\nFirst of all, our hearts go out to the families of those who have been killed. Our prayers go to those who have been wounded. This is a devastating attack on all Americans. It is one that is particularly painful for the people of Orlando, but I think we all recognize that this could have happened anywhere in this country. And we feel enormous solidarity and grief on behalf of the families that have been affected.\nThe fact that it took place at a club frequented by the LGBT community, I think, is also relevant. We're still looking at all the motivations of the killer. But it's a reminder that regardless of race, religion, faith, or sexual orientation, we're all Americans, and we need to be looking after each other and protecting each other at all times in the face of this kind of terrible act.\nWith respect to the killer, there's been a lot of reporting that's been done. It's important to emphasize that we're still at the preliminary stages of the investigation, and there's a lot more that we have to learn. The one thing that we can say is that this is being treated as a terrorist investigation. It appears that the shooter was inspired by various extremist information that was disseminated over the Internet. All those materials are currently being searched, exploited so we will have a better sense of the pathway that the killer took in making a decision to launch this attack.\nAs Director Comey, I think, will indicate, at this stage, we see no clear evidence that he was directed externally. It does appear that, at the last minute, he announced allegiance to ISIL, but there is no evidence so far that he was in fact directed by ISIL. And there also at this stage is no direct evidence that he was part of a larger plot. In that sense, it is—appears to be similar to what we saw in San Bernardino, but we don't yet know. And this is part of what is going to be important in terms of the investigation.\nAs far as we can tell right now, this is certainly an example of the kind of homegrown extremism that all of us have been so concerned about for a very long time. It also appears that he was able to obtain these weapons legally because he did not have a criminal record that, in some ways, would prohibit him from purchasing these weapons. It appears that one of those weapons he was able to just carry out of the store—an assault rifle, a handgun—a Glock—which had a lot of clips in it. He was apparently required to wait for 3 days under Florida law. But it does indicate the degree to which it was not difficult for him to obtain these kinds of weapons.\nDirector Comey will discuss the fact that there had been some investigation of him in the past that was triggered, but as Director Comey, I think, will indicate, the FBI followed the procedures that they were supposed to and did a proper job. At the end of the day, this is something that we are going to have to grapple with—making sure that even as we go after ISIL and other extremist organizations overseas, even as we hit their leadership, even as we go after their infrastructure, even as we take key personnel off the field, even as we disrupt external plots—that one of the biggest challenges we are going to have is this kind of propaganda and perversions of Islam that you see generated on the Internet and the capacity for that to seep into the minds of troubled individuals or weak individuals and seeing them motivated then to take actions against people here in the United States and elsewhere in the world that are tragic. And so countering this extremist ideology is increasingly going to be just as important as making sure that we are disrupting more extensive plots engineered from the outside.\nWe are also going to have to have to make sure that we think about the risks we are willing to take by being so lax in how we make very powerful firearms available to people in this country. And this is something that obviously I've talked about for a very long time.\nMy concern is that we start getting into a debate, as has happened in the past, which is an either-or debate. And the suggestion is, either we think about something as terrorism and we ignore the problems with easy access to firearms, or it's all about firearms and we ignore the role—the very real role that that organizations like ISIL have in generating extremist views inside this country. And it's not an either-or, it's a both-and.\nWe have to go after these terrorist organizations and hit them hard. We have to counter extremism. But we also have to make sure that it is not easy for somebody who decides they want to harm people in this country to be able to obtain weapons to get at them.\nAnd my hope is, is that over the next days and weeks that we are being sober about how we approach this problem, that we let the facts get determined by our investigators, but we also do some reflecting in terms of how we can best tackle what is going to be a very challenging problem not just here in this country, but around the world.\nAgain, my final point is just to extend our deepest sympathies to the families of those who were affected and to send our prayers to those who are surviving and are in hospitals right now, with their family members hoping that they get better very soon.\nBut in the meantime, you can anticipate sometime around noon that Director Comey and Deputy Attorney General Yates will provide you with a more full briefing about this. Okay?\nIslamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) Terrorist Organization/Discrimination Against Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender People\nQ. Mr. President, is there anything more on the LBGT angle to this?\nThe President. Well, I think we don't yet know the motivations. But here's what we do know, is, organizations like ISIL or organizations like Al Qaida or those who have perverted Islam and created these radical, nihilistic, vicious organizations, one of the groups that they target are gays and lesbians, because they believe that they do not abide by their attitudes towards sexuality.\nNow, we also know these are organizations that think it's fine to take captive women and enslave them and rape them. So there clearly are connections between the attitudes of an organization like this and their attitudes towards tolerance and pluralism and a belief that all people are treated equally regardless of sexual orientation. That is something threatening to them. Women being empowered is threatening to them. So, yes, I'm sure they're going to—we will find that there are connections—regardless of the particular motivations of this killer—there are connections between this vicious, bankrupt ideology and general attitudes towards gays and lesbians. And unfortunately, that's something that the LGBT community is subject to not just by ISIL, but by a lot of groups that purport to speak on behalf of God around the world.\nGun Control\nQ. What are your thoughts about the fact that after all of these incidents over these years, that there has not been any move to reform gun control in this country?\nThe President. April, I think you know what I think about it. The fact that we make it this challenging for law enforcement, for example, even to get alerted that somebody who they are watching has purchased a gun—and if they do get alerted, sometimes, it's hard for them to stop them from getting a gun—is crazy. It's a problem. And we have to, I think, do some soul searching.\nBut again, the danger here is, is that then it ends up being the usual political debate. And the NRA and the gun control folks say that, oh, Obama doesn't want to talk about terrorism. And if you talk about terrorism, then people say, why aren't you looking at issues of gun control?\nThe point is, is that if we have self-radicalized individuals in this country, then they are going to be very difficult oftentimes to find ahead of time. And how easy it is for them to obtain weapons is, in some cases, going to make a difference as to whether they're able to carry out attacks like this or not. And we make it very easy for individuals who are troubled or disturbed or want to engage in violent acts to get very powerful weapons very quickly. And that's a problem.\nIt's a problem regardless of their motivations. It's a problem for a young man who can walk into a church in South Carolina and murder nine people who offered to pray with him. It's a problem when an angry young man on a college campus decides to shoot people because he feels disrespected. So it's certainly a problem when we have organizations like ISIL or Al Qaida who are actively trying to promote violence and are doing so very effectively over the Internet, because we know that at some point there are going to be, out of 300 million, there are going to be some individuals who find for whatever reason that kind of horrible propaganda enticing. And if that happens, and that person can get a weapon, that's a problem.

Biden, Jr., President of the Senate.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118006", "text": "Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)\nI am providing this supplemental consolidated report, prepared by my Administration and consistent with the War Powers Resolution (Public Law 93-148), as part of my efforts to keep the Congress informed about deployments of U.S. Armed Forces equipped for combat.\nMILITARY OPERATIONS IN SUPPORT OF U.S. COUNTERTERRORISM OBJECTIVES\nIn furtherance of U.S. counterterrorism efforts, the United States continues to work with partners around the globe, with a particular focus on the U.S. Central Command's and U.S. Africa Command's areas of responsibility. In this context, the United States has deployed U.S. combat-equipped forces to enhance the counterterrorism capabilities and support the counterterrorism operations of our partners and allies. Specific information about counterterrorism deployments to select countries is provided below, and a classified annex to this report provides further information.\nMilitary Operations Against al-Qa'ida, the Taliban, and Associated Forces and in Support of Related U.S. Counterterrorism Objectives\nSince October 7, 2001, U.S. Armed Forces, including special operations forces, have conducted counterterrorism combat operations in Afghanistan against al-Qa'ida, the Taliban, and associated forces. Since August 2014, these operations have targeted the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), which was formerly known as al-Qa'ida in Iraq. In support of these and other overseas operations, the United States has deployed combat-equipped forces to a number of locations in the U.S. Central, Pacific, European, Southern, and Africa Command areas of operation. Such operations and deployments have been reported previously, consistent with Public Law 107-40 and the War Powers Resolution, and operations and deployments remain ongoing. These operations, which the United States has carried out with the assistance of numerous international partners, have been successful in seriously degrading al-Qa'ida's and ISIL's capabilities and brought an end to the Taliban's rule in Afghanistan. These operations also included an airstrike conducted by U.S. forces on May 21, 2016, against Taliban leader Mullah Mansur in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region. If necessary, in response to terrorist threats, I will direct additional measures to protect U.S. citizens and interests. It is not possible to know at this time the precise scope or the duration of the deployments of U.S. Armed Forces necessary to counter terrorist threats to the United States.\nAfghanistan. As I previously announced, U.S. Armed Forces have transitioned the lead for security to Afghan security forces while striking significant blows against al-Qa'ida's leadership and preventing Afghanistan from being used to launch attacks against the United States. A limited number of U.S. forces remain in Afghanistan for the purposes of training, advising, and assisting Afghan forces, conducting and supporting counterterrorism operations against the remnants of al-Qa'ida, and taking appropriate measures against those who directly threaten U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan or provide direct support to al-Qa'ida. The United States currently remains in an armed conflict against al-Qa'ida, the Taliban, and associated forces, and active hostilities against those groups remain ongoing.\nThe mission to help train, advise, and assist the Afghan National Security Forces and Afghan ministries and institutions continues through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization-led Resolute Support Mission. The United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2189, dated December 12, 2014, which welcomed the Resolute Support Mission and underscored the importance of continued international support for the stability of Afghanistan.\nToday, there are approximately 9,300 U.S. forces in Afghanistan, consistent with the Force Management Level of 9,800. (The actual number of U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan may exceed this Force Management Level due to, for example, overlap during rotations of units, and the continued presence of forces with the single mission of supporting the retrograde of U.S. equipment, both of which are excluded from the Force Management Level.)\nIraq and Syria. As part of a comprehensive strategy to degrade and ultimately defeat ISIL, U.S. Armed Forces are conducting a systematic campaign of airstrikes and other necessary actions against ISIL forces in Iraq and Syria. United States Armed Forces are also conducting airstrikes in Syria against operatives of al-Qa'ida, including those who are involved in al-Qa'ida's plotting against the West. In Iraq, U.S. Armed Forces are advising and coordinating with Iraqi forces and providing training, equipment, communications support, intelligence support, and other support to select elements of the Iraqi security forces, including Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga forces. In February 2016, U.S. Armed Forces captured Sulayman Dawud al-Bakkar, also known as Abu Dawud, an ISIL \"emir\" of its chemical and conventional weapons manufacturing, in Iraq. On March 10, 2016, Dawud was transferred to Iraqi government custody. United States Armed Forces remain postured to support or conduct further similar operations in Iraq and Syria. Additionally, small teams of U.S. special operations forces have deployed to northern Syria to help coordinate U.S. operations with indigenous ground forces conducting operations against ISIL. The Force Management Level for U.S. Armed Forces in Iraq currently is 4,087. The Force Management Level for U.S. Armed Forces in Syria is 300.\nThese actions are being undertaken in coordination with and at the request of the Government of Iraq and in conjunction with coalition partners.\nTurkey. In July 2015, the Government of Turkey agreed to the U.S. request to deploy U.S. combat aircraft to Turkey to conduct air operations in support of counter-ISIL operations. Strike and combat support aircraft, with associated U.S. military personnel, deployed to Turkey to support counter-ISIL operations and Turkish air sovereignty operations at the Turkish government's request.\nSomalia. In Somalia, U.S. forces continue to counter the terrorist threat posed by al-Qa'ida and associated elements of al-Shabaab and to provide advice and assistance to regional counterterrorism forces, including Somali National Army and African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) forces. On March 31, 2016, U.S. forces conducted an airstrike against an al-Shabaab senior leader, Hassan Ali Dhoore, who is part of al-Qa'ida. On May 27, 2016, U.S. forces carried out an airstrike against Abdullahi Haji Da'ud, one of al-Shabaab's most senior commanders, who is also part of al-Qa'ida and served as the principal coordinator of al-Shabaab's attacks in Somalia and Kenya. United States forces also conducted strikes in defense of U.S. forces, and in defense of partnered Somali and AMISOM forces between March 5 and May 13, 2016, notably including the March 5 airstrike against an al-Shabaab training facility where fighters posed an imminent threat to U.S. and AMISOM forces. Yemen. The U.S. military has also been working closely with the Government of Yemen to operationally dismantle and ultimately eliminate the terrorist threat posed by al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), the most active and dangerous affiliate of al-Qa'ida today. Our joint efforts have resulted in direct action against a limited number of AQAP operatives and senior leaders in that country who posed a terrorist threat to the United States and our interests. United States forces have conducted a number of airstrikes against AQAP combatants in Yemen since December 2015, including on February 3, February 29, March 30, April 23-28, and May 19. Notably, on March 22, 2016, U.S. forces conducted an airstrike targeting an AQAP training camp in Yemen. In April 2016, small numbers of U.S. military personnel were authorized to deploy to Yemen to support operations against AQAP.\nDjibouti. United States forces continue to partner with Government of Djibouti authorities, which have permitted use of Djiboutian territory for basing of U.S. forces. United States forces remain deployed to Djibouti, including for purposes of posturing for counterterrorism operations in the Horn of Africa and Arabian Peninsula.\nLibya. On February 19, 2016, U.S. forces conducted an airstrike targeting an ISIL training camp near Sabratha, Libya, and a senior ISIL facilitator, Noureddine Chouchane, also known as Sabir.\nCuba. Combat-equipped forces, deployed since January 2002 to the Naval Base, Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, continue to conduct humane and secure detention operations for detainees held at Guantánamo Bay under the authority provided by the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force (Public Law 107-40), as informed by the law of war. There were 80 such detainees as of the date of this report.\nMilitary Operations in Niger in Support of U.S. Counterterrorism Objectives\nUnited States military personnel in Niger continue to provide support for intelligence collection and to facilitate intelligence sharing with French forces conducting operations in the Sahel and with other partners in the region. The total number of U.S. military personnel deployed to Niger is approximately 420.\nMilitary Operations in Cameroon in Support of U.S. Counterterrorism Objectives\nApproximately 250 U.S. military personnel are deployed to Cameroon, with the consent of the Government of Cameroon, to conduct airborne intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations in the region. These forces are equipped with weapons for the purpose of providing their own force protection and security, and they will remain in Cameroon until their support is no longer needed.\nMILITARY OPERATIONS RELATED TO THE LORD'S RESISTANCE ARMY\nUnited States military personnel with appropriate combat equipment remain deployed to various countries in the central Africa region to serve as advisors to regional forces of the African Union Regional Task Force that are working to apprehend or remove Joseph Kony and other senior Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) leaders from the battlefield and to protect local populations. Additional information about military operations related to the LRA is provided in the classified annex.\nMILITARY OPERATIONS IN EGYPT\nApproximately 700 military personnel are assigned to or supporting the U.S. contingent of the Multinational Force and Observers, which have been present in Egypt since 1981.\nMILITARY OPERATIONS IN JORDAN\nAt the request of the Government of Jordan, approximately 2,200 U.S. military personnel are deployed to Jordan to support the security of Jordan and promote regional stability. These forces will remain in Jordan, in full coordination with the Government of Jordan, until the security situation becomes such that they are no longer needed.\nU.S./NATO OPERATIONS IN KOSOVO\nThe U.N. Security Council authorized Member States to establish a NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR) in Resolution 1244 on June 10, 1999. The original mission of KFOR was to monitor, verify, and, when necessary, enforce compliance with the Military Technical Agreement between NATO and the then-Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (now Serbia), while maintaining a safe and secure environment. Today, KFOR deters renewed hostilities in cooperation with local authorities, bilateral partners, and international institutions. The principal military tasks of KFOR forces are to help maintain a safe and secure environment and to ensure freedom of movement throughout Kosovo. The U.S. contribution to KFOR is approximately 660 U.S. military personnel out of the total strength of approximately 4,475 personnel.\nI have directed the participation of U.S. Armed Forces in all of these operations pursuant to my constitutional and statutory authority as Commander in Chief and as Chief Executive (including the authority to carry out Public Law 107-40 and other statutes), as well as my constitutional and statutory authority to conduct the foreign relations of the United States. Officials of my Administration and I communicate regularly with the leadership and other Members of Congress with regard to these deployments and we will continue to do so.\nSincerely,\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-06-13", "title": "Letter to Congressional Leaders on the Global Deployment of United States Combat-Equipped Armed Forces"}

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117640", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n**Please see below for a correction, marked with an asterisk.\n1:11 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. After hearing the President's comments, I think it should be apparent to you what's on the President's mind today. It includes, obviously, making sure that we follow through on our strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL, to continue to press Congress to take common-sense but meaningful gun safety steps that would actually strengthen our homeland security, and also to make sure that even as we are in the midst of an important campaign and political debate across the country, that we don't confuse political talking points for a counterterrorism strategy.\nSo I think the President's comments largely stand for themselves, but if you have questions on this or other topics I'm happy to take them. So, Darlene, do you want to start?\nQ: They do stand for themselves, but would you give us a little bit of insight into what it is that led the President to sort of go off at the end of his statement there about Donald Trump -- without naming Donald Trump -- and everything that he's had to say about Muslim Americans?\nMR. EARNEST: I think there's a tendency, based on those who have been covering this political debate for the last several months, to focus in on one candidate. But many Republicans have been making exactly the case that the President has expressed concern about. It was Governor Bush who initially advocated for a religious test on individuals who are entering the country. It was Senator Cruz who made the reference to enhanced surveillance of Muslim communities. It is Chris Christie who expressed concerns about admitting Syrian refugees to the United States. This is not -- unfortunately, it's not just about one politician in the Republican Party who is reacting out of fear and using language that the President is concerned could undermine our homeland security.\nSo the President is quite passionate, I think as was evident, about doing what's necessary to protect the American people. He took a solemn oath, twice, in the last seven years, seven and a half years, to faithfully execute the duties of the office of the presidency and to fulfill his number one priority, which is protecting the American people.\nAnd that commitment to our national security and to our homeland security, and to making sure that all Americans enjoy that protection is something the President gets quite passionate about, particularly because, as he also discussed, he sees firsthand the substantial commitment and sacrifices that are made by our men and women in uniform, that are made by our men and women in the intelligence community, that are made by our diplomats, that are made by our law enforcement professionals, that are made by officials at the Department of Homeland Security to keep us safe.\nThey, too, have taken an oath. They put their lives on the line, many of them every single day, to protect our country. And as the leader of the country and as the Commander-in-Chief, the President feels strongly about making sure that we're executing a strategy that is consistent with the sacrifice that they're making. And that would explain the President's passion today.\nQ: Some of the other candidates that you did mention -- Bush, Cruz, Christie -- they've all said things against Muslim Americans, but Donald Trump is the Republican presidential -- presumptive Republican presidential nominee.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, so to be clear --\nQ: He is the loudest voice out there.\nMR. EARNEST: That's right, but he's not the only one. And that's the problem. That is the problem. There is a tendency to just reduce this to one person, and that is to deny the reality about what's happening.\nQ: On another question, regarding the Orlando shooting, Governor Scott of Florida said earlier today that he hasn't heard from the President since Sunday. Are there any plans for him to reach out to Governor Scott, given that he's going to Florida on Thursday?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, first of all, the President has had the opportunity to speak with Buddy Dyer, who is the mayor of Orlando. Other senior White House officials have been in touch with Governor Scott directly, and there have been a number of conversations between Obama administration officials and their counterparts in Florida to ensure that we are effectively coordinating the efforts of federal authorities with state and local authorities as well.\nSo that is an important principle here, to make sure that all our efforts are concentrated on investigating this situation, getting to the bottom of it, but also standing in solidarity with a community that's grieving. And, as we announced last night, the President will be traveling to Orlando on Thursday. And, as we always do, we will invite the governor to be a part of the President's arrival. And hopefully the President will have the opportunity to see Governor Scott there.\nRoberta.\nQ: The DNC has said it was hacked by Russian hackers. I'm wondering how concerned the President is about this. Has he been briefed about it? What do you make of that?\nMR. EARNEST: I've seen those reports. I do not know at this point whether or not the President has been briefed, but this administration obviously takes our cybersecurity -- our nation's cybersecurity quite seriously. As you've heard me discuss before, there is actually a very specific proposal included in the President's budget to enhance our cybersecurity, including by increasing resources that are dedicated to that pursuit.\nAs has been well-documented, Republicans, for the first time in 40 years, have declined to even hold a hearing on that specific budget proposal, which means that the President has put forward a specific plan, laid out exactly how he believes we should pay for it to enhance our nation's cybersecurity, and Republicans in the House and Senate have indicated they don't even want to talk about it. So that's rather disappointing.\nAs you know, standing from here, I do not make a habit of discussing ongoing criminal or national security investigations. So questions related to how or even whether the federal government is investigating this situation, I'd refer you to the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI.\nQ: There was another horrific attack in France, and I'm wondering whether the White House has reached out to officials there and whether the President has been briefed on that.\nMR. EARNEST: The President is aware of reports that a French police officer and his partner were killed outside Paris. This is obviously a concerning situation. It is only enhanced by the fact that there are indications that the killer may have had a terrorist affiliation. So U.S. officials have been in touch with French authorities. As you know, the United States and France are allies, and our counterterrorism partnership is critical to the national security of both of our countries. So I would anticipate that the United States will do what we can to assist French authorities as they conduct this investigation and as they take the steps that they believe are necessary to continue to protect their country.\nJustin.\nQ: I first wanted to ask about the President's comments today. It seemed like they were matched nearly verbatim by Secretary Clinton, both on Twitter and in the speech that she gave right after the President's. And so I'm wondering if you can talk at all about if there's coordination on the messaging point today, kind of against Republicans, between the White House and Secretary Clinton about the discussion, who might have begun that conversation, and any kind of insight you could shed on that.\nMR. EARNEST: No, I'm not aware of any advance coordination or notification that was provided by the White House to the Clinton campaign of the President's comments today. That said, I don't think you should be particularly surprised that the President's comments and views on this topic are similar to the views and principles that are articulated by the woman who served as his Secretary of State during his first term in office.\nYou often hear me indicate that the President believes it's important for his successor to build on the progress that our country has made and not scrap it. I often make that argument in the context of our country's success in digging out of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. And it's certainly true in that context.\nIt also happens to be true in the context of our homeland security and our national security. The President does believe it's important that his successor is somebody who recognizes that our country is safer than it was eight years ago; that we've enhanced our standing around the world; that we've strengthened our alliances; that we have refined and improved and strengthened our homeland security.\nAnd we will -- the American people do face a question about whether or not they want to build on that progress because there surely is more that can be done to protect the American people. The President made the direct reference to making it harder for would-be homegrown extremists to get their hands on a gun. So there certainly are steps that we can take. But the question for the next President will be, do you want to build on the progress that we made over the last eight years or do you want to tear it down? It doesn't just apply when it comes to the economy; it also applies when it comes to protecting the American people.\nQ: Five straight public opinion polls in the UK have shown voters favor now leaving the European Union. They're set to head to the polls in about a week. I'm wondering -- obviously the President went there, spoke repeatedly about why he thought the UK should stay in the EU. Now that the tide seems to have turned against that position, is there anything more that we can expect him to do in the coming days to sort of make a last-ditch effort to persuade voters? And, secondly, is there anything the Treasury Department or the White House is doing to sort of prepare for what could happen to the financial markets if this sort of uncertainty is injected into them?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Justin, as you often hear me say, I'm confident there are well-compensated individuals in the United States that provide public analysis of polling data here in this country. I'm confident the same is true in the UK. So, again, maybe that's -- so I'll leave that analysis to them.\nWhat I will say is that the President did have an opportunity to travel to London six or eight weeks ago, and in the context of a conference with Prime Minister Cameron described how the United States benefits from having the UK as well-integrated with Europe. We have a special relationship with the United Kingdom. So the United States has an opinion, and it's an opinion that the President has shared publicly.\nBut the President also was quick to add, as I am, that this is a decision for the British people to make. It's a substantial one. It's a consequential decision. And we're confident that the British people will consider their options carefully. And it certainly is important for them to weigh in on this decision. It's a weighty one, and it's one that they alone will make.\nQ: Last one. Reuters yesterday reported that the administration had ruled out sort of additional executive actions to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. I know that there are a wide array of things that the President has already been doing, and also that your preference is for Congress to come up with a solution here. So kind of granting those, has the administration kind of ruled out kind of additional steps or an executive action that we hadn't yet heard about to close the prison?\nMR. EARNEST: Justin, I'm not going to take any options that are available to the President off the table. We do continue to believe that Congress should coordinate and cooperate with the administration in pursuit of a bipartisan national security goal, which is closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay. Even if there are some Republicans that don't support that bipartisan goal, they should at least be interested in trying to save taxpayers money. And there are many indications that a substantial sum of money could be saved without enhancing or increasing the risk to the American people by closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\nSo we're going to continue to implement that strategy that we've been focused on for quite some time, which is carefully reviewing the case files of the individuals that are currently housed there. And we're going to continue to work with our partners all around the world to find appropriate security circumstances in which those individuals can be safely transferred. And that work continues. I don't have any transfer announcements to make today, but we'll certainly keep you informed if there are any upcoming.\nRon.\nQ: Just to follow up on this question of Secretary Clinton's comments and the President's, there was a phrase that the Secretary used, that somehow there are magic words once uttered will stop terrorism, she said about Trump. And the President said, there's no magic in the words that radical -- magic words. They were both used around the same time in Pittsburgh. So there was no discussion at all between the campaign and the White House about this day? It just seems such an unlikely coincidence that they would use phrases like \"magic words,\" \"Islamic terrorism\" at the same time --\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I'm not aware that anyone at the White House gave the Clinton campaign advance notice of the President's comments. But I'm also not sitting here telling you that it's a coincidence. I think it should be apparent to all of you that President Obama and Secretary Clinton have similar approaches and consider the homeland security of the United States a top priority. So I'm not making the case that it's a coincidence. I'm actually making a pretty bold case that they agree that these are principles that are worth fighting for and articulating, and that the use of the word \"radical Islam\" is a political talking point. That is not a counterterrorism strategy. And, in fact, to use that political talking point only gives our enemies the legitimacy that they are desperately craving, and giving them that legitimacy only makes it easier for them to recruit. And making it easier for them to recruit makes it harder for us to keep the country safe.\nQ: But clearly there is some discussion going on between the White House and the Clinton campaign about various things at some level?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, there are appropriate confines within the law where the Clinton campaign can be in communication with the White House. I think that was evident when we released a video from the President last week through the campaign to announce his support for her in the general election. But when it comes to the President's comments today, I'm not aware of anyone at the White House providing anybody at the Clinton campaign advance notice of the President's comments.\nQ: And what is the President's expectation about what Senator Sanders will do or say after the vote is completed tonight in the District and elsewhere?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, it's my understanding -- and again, this is just based on published reports -- that Senator Sanders and Secretary Clinton are planning to get together here in the not-too-distant future. So I wouldn't get ahead of what their meeting is.\nQ: From the discussions that Senator Sanders had with the President last week, what would you say was the understanding that the President had as to what the Senator would do after, given that he said that Secretary Clinton had already clinched the votes needed for the nomination?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I think the President came away from the meeting with the impression that Senator Sanders understands exactly how important the general election is. And Senator Sanders addressed all of you right outside that window and made clear how important it is that the Republican nominee for President not be elected next President of the United States. And that was a view that he expressed. So he clearly understands the stakes.\nAt the same time, the President walked into his meeting with Senator Sanders well aware of the fact that Senator Sanders has more than earned the right to make his own decisions on his own timeframe about the future of his campaign. And the President is certainly respectful of that.\nQ: He has no -- the President has no expectation about when the campaign will end?\nMR. EARNEST: The President's expectation is that that's a decision that will be made by Senator Sanders.\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, often these post-NSC meeting briefings are very much just sort of battlefield assessments and a check-in. This had a very different feel to it. There was anger, there was frustration coming through from the President. And part of it really did feel like a political speech. Would you say that's a fair assessment?\nMR. EARNEST: That's not my assessment. Look, I think what was different about this meeting is the fact that this meeting was convened 48 hours after the worst mass shooting in American history. That is, as the President and the FBI Director have indicated, is likely the result of an individual who became radicalized.\nSo, yeah, I think it's fair to say that this meeting took on a different flavor than it usually does. At the same time, the President's national security team was able to report to him important and critical progress in implementing our strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. In terms of reducing the flow of foreign fighters, reducing the ranks of ISIL fighters, reducing the amount of territory that they can control, reducing their ability to fund their operations -- ISIL is under increasing pressure because of the strategy that has been led by the United States and effectively implemented by our 65 coalition partners.\nSo there's no denying that we're making progress -- and that's important. But there's also no denying that the American people are grieving after a terrible tragedy. And there is intense focus on what steps we can take to prevent something like that from ever happening again. And some of those steps include closing the loophole that allows individuals who are currently on the no-fly list from being able to walk into a gun store and buy a gun. If it's too dangerous for you to board an airplane, it should be too dangerous for you to buy a firearm.\nThe President believes that we should reinstitute the assault weapons ban. Right now, it's too easy for a would-be homegrown extremist to get his or her hands on a weapon of war. The President also believes it's important not to confuse political talking points for a counterterrorism strategy. And when it comes to protecting the American people, the President is quite passionate about that. And I think that passion was on display over at the Treasury Department about an hour ago.\nQ: But the things that the President got the most heated about in those remarks were not the sort of practical things in terms of confirming Adam Szubin or the gun control debate, or everything he had on that --\nMR. EARNEST: That's a good example of something I left out.\nQ: -- on that long, long laundry list. Things he was getting heated up about, at least as a viewer, were about the ban on Muslims. He specifically mentioned a nominee tweeting, in particular. He mentioned basically scapegoating of the Muslim community. And it was couched as a defense of American values, which is something you have said would really be the message on the campaign trail, that this is, the President thinks, his role to defend American values, and that's what he's going to be doing alongside Hillary Clinton.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think what is clear is that there is a basic question about American values; that to discriminate against people because of their religious views undermines American values. The President is quite passionate about defending American values.\nBut the President also is quite passionate about protecting the American people. And there are consequences for using political rhetoric that alienates or marginalizes or targets Muslims. It only serves to feed the narrative and confer legitimacy on ISIL's argument. That is the thing that ISIL desperately craves.\nWe know that ISIL leaders wake up every morning desperate to try to find ways to convey to the rest of the world that they are fighting the West in the name of Islam. They call themselves religious leaders. They label the individual who are in their ranks as holy warriors. And they're seeking to perpetuate this notion that they represent the world's Muslims, more than a billion of them, in the fight against the West. They're wrong about that.\nAnd that's why the political rhetoric that we too often hear on the campaign trail is so disconcerting. It feeds the false narrative and the myth that our enemies depend on for their survival. And the President feels strongly about that. And the President is concerned that there are some who are willing to cynically overlook that fact just because it might be good politics.\nAnd again, I think it's important to just step back here -- I'm not just talking about a candidate, or several candidates, for President. It's not uncommon to turn on cable television and see some Republican congressman I've never heard of talking about the President's non-use of the word \"radical Islamic extremism\" to define our enemy. Those are facts. And the President wants to make clear why that matters.\nQ: But aren't these the very same things we're going to hear him say on the campaign trail? I mean, isn't this inherently a political speech?\nMR. EARNEST: No, this is inherently a speech about what is necessary to protect our values and keep the country safe. And that is the subject of intense political debate right now. I'm not denying that. And it should be that way. We should have a debate about what's important to keeping the country safe.\nQ: But that's why Ron and others are asking you -- parsing phrasing, because it feels like this is perhaps parts of this we would have heard tomorrow in Wisconsin, if the President had gone there.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think the President feels quite strongly about making sure that his successor is someone who wants to build on the progress that we have made in strengthening our country and protecting our homeland. And the rhetoric that we hear from a large number of Republicans undermines that. And the President I think gave a pretty concise explanation for why exactly that is. And it's not just the great offense that I think many Americans take at undermining core American values. Religious liberty is a founding principle of the United States of America. We don't discriminate against people because of the way they worship God. We don't treat them differently just because of where they attend religious services. That is something that we do not do. And the President is quite passionate about protecting that value.\nBut it doesn't stop there. I think the President's passion that was on display earlier this afternoon is not just a reflection of the way that our values have been undermined. It is a reflection of the risk associated with pursuing that cynical strategy. It is a strategy that undermines our ability to protect the American people in a very tangible way, particularly when we're talking about an attack that was carried out two days ago by an American citizen who had been radicalized by an enemy whose narrative is only advanced when we hear that kind of rhetoric from politicians.\nQ: Just a quick question. Saudi Arabia, a very key ally in this fight against ISIS -- will the President be meeting with the Deputy Crown Prince, who is in town and met with the Secretary of State yesterday?\nMR. EARNEST: Obviously, we've seen in the last couple of days some changes to the President's schedule over the course of this week, so we'll keep you posted as things get added to the President's schedule. But I don't have anything to announce at this point.\nQ: And not coming to the White House at all?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I just don't have any announcements about the President's schedule at this point. We obviously had to change Wednesday -- we cancelled the trip. The President added this trip to Orlando on Thursday. So the next few days, in terms of the President's schedule, are in flux. But if anything gets added, including the meeting that you're referring to, then we'll let you know.\nLesley.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I was hoping you could flesh out a little bit more about what the President might do on Thursday in Orlando. And Governor Scott mentioned -- you were asked -- that the President hasn't called Governor Scott. Is there a reason he has not called him? He has called the governors of other states before or after a similar event. And the Governor has been pretty critical of the President. He said he wants a federal plan for a Zika response by Wednesday and he has not heard anything. And there's also not been a response to a federal emergency declaration after the Orlando shooting.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what I'll tell you, Lesley, is the fact that -- Lesley, I do anticipate that the President will have an opportunity to see Governor Scott when he travels to Florida on Thursday. Governor Scott will certainly be invited, and hopefully he'll be there. But obviously I'd make clear that senior officials at the White House have been in touch not just with Governor Scott's office but with Governor Scott directly. President Obama has been in touch with Mayor Dyer directly, obviously, and a range of federal officials have been in touch with their state and local counterparts to ensure a seamless, coordinated response to this terrible situation.\nQ: What about an emergency declaration? Is that being considered?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I know that it's going through the regular process. It is rather extraordinary to make a specific request like this for an event that is not ongoing. But that will be considered through the regular channels, and once a determination has been made about that request we'll obviously let you all know.\nQ: And would your response to this at all be anything to do with Governor Scott, who has endorsed the President? Or is that a conflict between the President and the Governor?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I'll leave it to the Governor to describe how he may or may not be influenced by politics. But President Obama certainly believes that in terms of mobilizing federal resources to respond to a grieving community, politics needs to be set aside. And that certainly has been President Obama's approach to the situation.\nQ: Zika?\nMR. EARNEST: On Zika, I think that we've made quite clear that this is a serious situation and our public health professionals almost four months ago put together a package that was submitted by the White House to Congress of the resources that they believe are necessary to do everything possible to protect the American people from the Zika virus. And Democrats have strongly supported the request that was made by our public health professionals, but for reasons that are difficult to explain, Republicans in Congress have resisted offering up the support that our public health professionals say is necessary to do everything possible to protect the American people.\nSo we would certainly welcome Governor Scott's advocacy with his fellow Republicans to get Congress to provide the resources that public health professionals and states, particularly a big state like Florida, need to fight the Zika virus and to protect the American people.\nMichelle.\nQ: So there's the war against ISIS and then there's this political war of words that seems to have reached strange proportions. In the President's address today, he seemed to be acknowledging that, that this is -- at times, he seemed to be ridiculing his critics for focusing on this. But then again, the President devoted a big chunk of this address to those words. So, I mean, this has been said for a long time, ever since the war against ISIS started. Why is he so angry about the rhetoric now? I mean, you yourself said you'll turn on cable television and see some congressman that you've never heard of before. So why does this matter so much? Why is he so furious about this today?\nMR. EARNEST: I think, Michelle, what I would describe is a President who is passionate about doing everything that's necessary to protect the American people. And too often we heard Republicans -- some we've heard of, some we've never heard of -- making an argument that what's necessary to protect the country is for the President to describe the threat as the threat of radical Islamist extremism. And here's why that's important: That is used as a substitute for actions that Congress can and should take that would enhance our national security -- because again, maybe there is a Republican argument to be made about how using the magic words will somehow prompt ISIL to melt away. I don't think that's true, but they're welcome to make that argument.\nWhat the President actually thinks is that Congress should act to prevent people who are on the no-fly list from being able to buy a gun. That would make us safer. That would certainly make it harder for somebody who is suspected of being involved in terrorism from being able to get a gun, that doesn't undermine the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans, but it would make us safer. We certainly could see Congress say, well, you know, we're scared of the NRA so we don't want to do that. But you know what, why don't we confirm Adam Szubin? This is the financial expert who served in Democratic and Republican administrations who's responsible for a critical element of our counter-ISIL strategy, which is shutting off their funding. But for more than a year, this financial expert, who served in Democratic and Republican administrations, has been blocked by Republican members of the United States Senate for reasons that they admit are only related to politics.\nQ: Does the President, or you, as well, not see a distinction, though, between calling what happens \"Islam\" and calling certain acts \"radical Islamic terror\"? I mean, some people would say, really, what's the difference? And if you're getting specific enough to call something \"radical Islamic terror\" when it clearly is, why is that such a big deal?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Michelle, to the extent that it would be helpful, we could provide you the numerous instances in which the President has acknowledged that what ISIL and other extremist organizations represent is a perversion of Islam. The President, on a number of occasions, has made clear that part of their strategy is to recruit potentially vulnerable members of the Muslim community in the United States and around the world. The President, on a number of occasions, has talked about the responsibility that leaders in the Muslim community -- both here in the United States and around the world -- have to speak out against those radical elements that are seeking to recruit people in their communities.\nSo the President certainly doesn't misunderstand that. Here's the problem, Michelle: The counterterrorism strategy articulated by Republicans is that the President should utter the magic words to defeat ISIL. That's their strategy. And the President says, let's define our enemy and let's make sure we define our enemy precisely. Our enemy is not the religion of Islam. Our enemy are radical, violent extremists that seek to pervert Islam and seek to advance a narrative that they are representing Islam in a war against the West. That's false. That's a myth. That's not true.\nSo the question really is, why aren't those Republicans in Congress actually focused on things that aren't just magic words but are a tangible contribution to our homeland security? Let's close the no-buy, no-fly loophole. Let's confirm Adam Szubin. Let's hire 200 additional ATF officers. Let's pass an AUMF that has actually authorized the Commander-in-Chief and our men and women in uniform to win this war against ISIL. There are tangible things that Congress could do, but yet, time and time and time again, they refuse because they think that somehow the magic words are somehow more important.\nQ: Are you sure that anyone sees those magic words as a strategy, though, and they're not just pointing out the fact that the President hasn't wanted to say them for a very long time, even though others have, and now including Hillary Clinton? Is just seems like, when he talks about people painting this with a very broad brush, it seems maybe as if you're painting this with a broader brush than some of those critics mean from the beginning.\nMR. EARNEST: What other critiques have those critics offered in terms of fighting ISIL? They haven't. This is the thing that they constantly come back to. I'm not the one who constantly brings up \"radical Islamic extremism.\" That's not me. That's not the guy who usually stands here. It's the Republicans, many of whom I've never heard of, who book themselves on cable television so they can make this argument. And again, it's cynical. They know it's not true. They know that -- well, I don't know if they know this, but the President knows that it undermines our ability to defeat ISIL. It undermines our ability to prevent ISIL from recruiting in the United States.\nQ: But when Franзois Hollande says the words \"radical Islamic terror\" very specifically, and Hillary Clinton says it, and she says she's happy to say it, are they then undermining values and strategy?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't heard them criticize the President for not using the magic words. And I think that's the point. The President has been very specific and precise about how to define our enemy. And for people who say that the only reason we haven't defeated ISIL is the President hasn't used the magic words that they have chosen, that's cynical politics there, and it doesn't do anything to protect the country. And, in fact, as was on display tragically on Saturday night, it potentially makes the nation more vulnerable.\nQ: Was that really necessary, though, to make this speech political? What did the President think it was adding to make something that is about fighting the kind of act that we just saw about fighting Republican rhetoric? What did he think that was going to add? Or does he feel like that Republican rhetoric is so strong and so powerful out there that he needs to counter it when he's talking about countering terrorism?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President believes that it is worth having a debate about the most effective way to protect our country. And it's worth having a debate about who's the person that will sit in the Oval Office, charged with making the most important decisions about how to protect the country, and there will be ample opportunity for the President to engage in that debate through the fall. And I think the American people are going to care what he has to say about it, because he's been the person in charge of making those decisions over the last seven and a half years.\nBut what the President was talking about today is making sure that we don't repeat mistakes that we've made in our history when we acted out of fear. And a willingness to compromise our values, even in the face of fear, is something that our nation and our leaders have previously regretted. And the President wants to prevent that mistake from happening again.\nJC.\nQ: To continue along the lines just a little bit -- whether it was a political speech or not, it was directed to a domestic audience, to the American people. And perhaps more than ever, leaders of terrorist groups such as ISIL and al Qaeda, and their emissaries across the world, are really now focusing on what the President has to say. In fact, they're also focusing on what you have to say in your briefings. As the President's spokesperson, what continued message does President Obama want to deliver on behalf of the American people directly to these individuals who would like to see Americans harmed and their allies as well?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, I think some of what the President had to say today is a message that was focused on the U.S. audience, but it's hopefully a message that the world will see. The world should understand that the United States is committed to the founding principles that make our country great -- a protection of free press, protecting freedom of speech, protecting the ability to worship God in the way that we choose. Those are central to the founding of our country. And to compromise them because we're scared or fearful is something that we're going to regret.\nQ: Josh, are these individuals that are terrorists that are doing such harm, are they the same kind of people who understand Jeffersonian democracy and would understand what freedom of the press and freedom of religion mean in their world, in their environment?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, if you're talking about ISIL leaders, I think the President's message to them is quite direct -- is we're going to succeed in mobilizing the international community to degrade and ultimately destroy your organization. And if you threaten or harm Americans, we're going to find you and we're going to hold you accountable for it.\nAnd I made reference yesterday to the President's record speaking for itself, and part of the President's record is a long list of dead terrorists. So the President hasn't shied away from using force to protect the American people, and he's not going to shy away from using force to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\nBut there are also complicated questions about what we're going to do here in the United States to protect the homeland and to protect the American people. And that does have a direct impact on our commitment to core American values and a commitment to a society that reflects the diversity of our country, and that prizes things like dignity and inclusiveness and tolerance.\nAnd these are the profound concepts that in some ways we take for granted in our day-to-day life that are what make America the greatest country in the world.\nKenneth.\nQ: Josh, thank you. Yesterday you said the administration and President Obama won't be distracted by what you called \"small remarks\" by Donald Trump and Republicans when it comes to saying \"radical Islam\" or refusing to say it, and the President should resign if he doesn't. So what happened in the past 24 hours? What changed? And is it safe to say the President is annoyed by those criticisms?\nMR. EARNEST: Kenneth, I know that we all have to endure the challenge of differentiating the variety of charges that are lobbed on the campaign trail. And there was a suggestion -- I think this was what I was asked about yesterday -- that somehow the President may have been complicit or not concerned about the terrorist attack that occurred in Orlando on Saturday night, early Sunday morning.\nAnd I think the -- that's what I was responding to when I made those comments yesterday. But I think the President's comments today speak for themselves when it comes to making sure we don't confuse a political talking point for a counterterrorism strategy.\nQ: Josh, the White House reaction to what happened on the House floor yesterday after the moment of silence -- there was protest, House Democrats wanted to find out the status of some legislation on gun control after the Charleston church massacre, the legislation that was drafted. In the next -- probably right now, Democrats are trying to force a vote on no-fly, no-buy. The White House response on that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President and the administration strongly support common-sense, meaningful gun safety legislation. The Secretary of Homeland Security said it today. Meaningful gun control, gun safety legislation is critical to our homeland security. This is a homeland security issue now. It is a source of concern by our homeland security professionals that it is too easy for would-be terrorists to get their hands on weapons of war and use them against innocent Americans.\nThis is a homeland security issue, every bit as much as it is a question about protecting the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans. And the good news is simply this: We can take common-sense steps that will do more to protect the American people and protect our communities without undermining or gutting the basic constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans.\nSo I think the question really for Republicans in Congress is, given this moment, given what we have endured, why wouldn't they act on it?\nQ: And, Josh, finally on Orlando, on the trip on Thursday, do we know exactly where the President -- will he meet with the doctors who were heroes and saved those lives? We heard from a few of them today, and the victims as well -- the victims' families. Do we know if he actually is going to meet with those impacted and, obviously, the first responders and the doctors as well?\nMR. EARNEST: The President is certainly interested in spending time with people in the Orlando community that were touched by this terrorist attack and by people who were -- acted quickly to save lives. The plans for the President to travel to Orlando were initiated at the end of the day yesterday, so our advance team has only arrived in Orlando this morning. So we're still in the early stages of planning this trip. But as more details come together, we'll certainly keep you posted on what the President plans to do when he's in Orlando.\nChris.\nQ: Josh, yesterday you said seeing after the Orlando shooting individuals lining up to donate blood was powerful and represented what this country is all about. But under the Obama administration policy, gay and bisexual men are prohibited from donating blood unless they've been celibate for a year. That means a gay person who wanted to donate blood to a wounded friend or a partner or spouse in Orlando was probably unable to. Are there any plans to revisit that policy in the aftermath of the shooting?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Chris, as you know, this is a decision that was made by the FDA, and it was made consistent with the advice that our scientists have offered about the best way to ensure the safety of the blood supply.\nSo you do know, and I think you've covered this, that there was a policy decision that was made to change what had been a lifetime ban on gay men donating blood to a one-year deferral that you described. So there has been a policy change. Again, that is a policy change that was made consistent with the advice of our best scientists and public health professionals. But the President believes that when it comes to these kinds of questions, that we're going to rely on scientific advice.\nQ: Based on what your knowledge is, is there an opportunity for a further change on this policy? Or would that have to happen during another administration?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, if there are any additional changes that are made, it's going to be rooted in the advice that we're getting from the scientists at the FDA.\nRich.\nQ: Josh, when did the President decide to expand his remarks from what are often the statistics of war following these types of briefings -- 13,000 airstrikes, troop movements in Iraq and Syria? It appeared to be two separate speeches in a way. And when did he decide to do that? Did he go to the Treasury Department -- did the White House arrange that on-camera availability with that in mind -- with that message, the one about American values, in mind?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Rich, no. This meeting the President convened with his national security team to get an update on our progress against ISIL is one that has been on the books for a couple of weeks now. And as you know, the President every two or three weeks sits down with his national security team to review our strategy, to review our progress, and look for ways to intensify those elements of our strategy that are showing promise against ISIL. So this is a previously scheduled meeting, but obviously it occurred at a rather poignant moment -- just about 48 hours after the worst incident of -- the worst mass shooting incident on American soil in our history.\nAnd there are indications that the individual who perpetrated that shooting was radicalized. So it is not uncommon for the President to speak to all of you on-camera after that meeting occurs. But yes, those comments were necessarily different, given the context in which he was delivering them. I know the President spent some time working on his remarks both last night and again this morning, so it's certainly something the President has been thinking about.\nQ: House Speaker Paul Ryan earlier today said, I do not think a Muslim ban is in the country's best interest. There are other Republicans who have said the same. Does the President see a difference between a Republican who says they will vote for Donald Trump but opposes this type of -- or these types of proposals that have come out of this campaign?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Rich, I think it's an interesting question, but it's a much more interesting question for the individuals who do have concerns about imposing a religious test on people entering the United States but yet insist that they're going to advocate for the election of a candidate that supports that ban. So I think that's a very difficult pair of positions that they'll need to figure out how they're going to reconcile.\nQ: Does the President bring this up when he speaks with -- when he has his regular conversations with House and Senate Leadership on the Republican side?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know the degree to which this particular issue or the challenge of reconciling these two positions have come up in his private conversations with individual congressional leaders.\nQ: And you mentioned earlier that you want Congress -- the administration has asked for Congress to pass an AUMF to confirm Adam Szubin so we can win this war. The administration is operating, still under a very old AUMF, designed for a different fight in a way. Adam Szubin is working under an acting capacity. Isn't it a bit misleading to say that? I mean, is it going to change things tomorrow drastically? The responsibility lies with the White House, no?\nMR. EARNEST: There's no denying that despite the fact that Congress has been AWOL when it comes to these critically important issues related to our war against ISIL, our men and women in uniform continue to perform their duties and do their job against ISIL, even when Congress won't. Mr. Szubin and the individuals in his office continue to do their job to figure out how to shut down ISIL's financing even though Congress won't do their job and actually confirm him.\nQ: Will it make it dramatically easier for any of those parties to do their job?\nMR. EARNEST: I think our men and women in uniform would certainly appreciate knowing that the United States Congress supports their efforts on the battlefield. I know that our allies would certainly appreciate seeing Congress weigh in with their support of our strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. I know that when Adam Szubin is doing meetings with his counterparts all around the world, it's going to only enhance his negotiating position and only enhance his leverage in conversations if the individuals that are sitting across the table know that Adam has the strong bipartisan support of the Congress. The only reason he doesn't have that now, the only reason he can't take the strongest possible negotiating position into those conversations that are critical to our efforts to defeat ISIL is because a bunch of Republicans in the Senate are playing politics. That's shameful. It intensely disrespects the government service of a financial expert who served this country in the Bush administration and continues to serve the country in the Obama administration.\nSo it's rather unfortunate the way that he's been treated. And I hope that it doesn't dissuade other dedicated, talented, qualified individuals like him from serving the American people in our government. Hopefully it won't.\nFred.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Two topics, actually. California lawmakers have decided to extend the health care exchanges there to illegal immigrants. That's something that the President said throughout 2009, 2010 would not happen under the ACA. Is this something that the White House actually would oppose? Is this something that the President or someone with the White House might talk to Governor Brown about?\nMR. EARNEST: This is a state policy. I'm not aware of the policy decision that they've made, so I'd refer you to my counterpart in Governor Brown's office for an answer about why they've chosen to pursue it.\nQ: But wouldn't this be counter to what the administration policy was pushing when they were arguing in favor of the health care law?\nMR. EARNEST: It is correct that it is different than the policy that the federal government has pursued. So that fact is true. But again, as a variety of Republican governors have not hesitated to demonstrate, they are, in many cases, willing to use their own authority as they choose.\nQ: And the other topic -- beyond being a policy priority as far as gun control goes, have there been any national security studies, reports that have said that gun control would be a counterterrorism measure, an effective counterterrorism measure?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the Director of Homeland Security said it today, so I think that's a pretty good endorsement. It's also ironic that you ask this question, Fred, because, as you know, Republicans have routinely prevented the CDC from actually even conducting any studies about the impact of gun violence. So the answer to your question is something that Republicans I think are scared to learn.\nQ: But beyond the possible ban on semi-automatic rifles, would any of these measures have prevented what happened in Orlando?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Fred, the investigation into what happened in Orlando is barely 48 hours old. So I think it's too early to assess at this point exactly what could have been done differently or what different laws or regulations would have prevented this terrible, tragic terrorist incident from occurring.\nBut look, the truth is the Secretary of Homeland Security I think made a pretty intuitive argument. He certainly has a lot of expertise in this area, but there's also a lot of common sense that informs his position. If any individual -- just about any individual can walk into a gun store, buy a weapon of war and walk out that same day, that certainly enhances the ability of a would-be terrorist to kill even more innocent Americans. Why wouldn't we prevent that from happening? I don't know why Republicans *[don't] want to prevent that from happening.\nLauren.\nQ: You and the President have been talking a lot about religious liberty, the importance of not having a litmus test. And yet, there's been a great debate in the Supreme Court about the HHS mandate controversy and religious liberty. No timetable has been set to end that. And given that both sides have indicated to the Supreme Court that there is a way to satisfy all parties, what's the holdup?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have an update in terms of -- as you know, the Supreme Court remanded this back down to a lower court to try to arrive at this compromise that we've been seeking for a number of years now. And I just don't have an update on that process. You might check with either DOJ or HHS and they can give you some more insight into where that currently stands.\nQ: And one other question. An indictment was dismissed against David Daleiden and the Center for Medical Progress today for taking videos of a Planned Parenthood employee talking about selling fetal parts. Is this a good time to look at what Planned Parenthood does and says in selling fetal baby parts?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, this is obviously something that has cropped up a fair amount over the last year or so. What the Obama administration has made clear are a couple of things. The first is that Planned Parenthood is an organization that provides needed health care services to millions of Americans. This is a valuable service that many Americans rely on.\nThe administration has also made clear that there are important rules and laws, consistent with our moral obligations, that are on the books. And we expect everybody to follow them. I know that Planned Parenthood has indicated that they do follow them, but I'd refer you to them for a more specific statement about that.\nMark, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Okay. Josh, was there a point in recent hours or days where the President just slammed his fist down on the Resolute Desk and said, I've had enough of Donald Trump's criticism and he said, I've got to answer back? Was there a straw that broke the camel's back, leading to today's remarks?\nMR. EARNEST: No, not that I'm aware of. I think the President does continue to be concerned by the rhetoric that we hear from a variety of Republicans, including the presumptive Republican nominee. This is rhetoric that isn't just contrary to our values; it actually undermines our homeland security. And as somebody who swore an oath to protect our homeland security and to protect our values, the President has quite strong feelings about it. And after convening a meeting with his national security team to discuss what we're doing to protect the country from ISIL, after spending the last 48 hours being briefed on the worst mass shooting in American history, I think the conditions came together for the President to deliver a forceful and passionate message about what's necessary to protect the country.\nAnd political rhetoric, magic words aren't going to address the threat that is posed by ISIL. If anything, ironically it could make that threat even more dangerous because it only serves to advance the narrative that our enemy is seeking to perpetuate.\nQ: Considering the mood that the President reflected earlier today, is he in any mood for a picnic tonight -- (laughter) -- that includes Republican members of Congress coming by to chow down?\nQ: It's National Bourbon Day.\nMR. EARNEST: I was just going to say, is there ever a bad night for barbecue? (Laughter.)\nQ: Did you guys have a picnic last night for staff? The Vice President mentioned that in his speech.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, what typically happens when the South Lawn is set up to host members of Congress, I think either the day before or the day after administration officials will also enjoy a picnic to thank them for their service to the country and the government in the same way that we're thanking members of Congress and their staff and their families for their commitment to serving the government. So there was an event last night, much like the one that all of you will see the President speak to tonight.\nQ: Do you get RSVPs from members of Congress who will or will not come tonight?\nMR. EARNEST: I think there are RSVPs that are collected everywhere. I can't account for all of them, so I'd refer you to individual offices about whether or not they're going to attend. But yeah, I would not be disappointed if I, for instance, ran into Senator Perdue in the hallway, for example.\nQ: Do you think that's likely?\nMR. EARNEST: Probably not. But we'll see.\nQ: You got any Bible verses for him? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Maybe I should prepare just in case I happen to. So hopefully he's been studying up himself.\nThanks, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 2:13 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2016-06-14", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118003", "text": "STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY\n(House Rules)\n(Rep. Rogers, R-KY)\nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 5293, making appropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, 2017, and for other purposes.\nWhile the Administration appreciates the Committee's support for certain investments in our national defense, H.R. 5293 fails to provide our troops with the resources needed to keep our Nation safe. At a time when ISIL continues to threaten the homeland and our allies, the bill does not fully fund wartime operations such as INHERENT RESOLVE. Instead the bill would redirect $16 billion of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds toward base budget programs that the Department of Defense (DOD) did not request, shortchanging funding for ongoing wartime operations midway through the year. Not only is this approach dangerous but it is also wasteful. The bill would buy excess force structure without the money to sustain it, effectively creating a hollow force structure that would undermine DOD's efforts to restore readiness. Furthermore, the bill's funding approach attempts to unravel the dollar-for-dollar balance of defense and non-defense funding increases provided by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA), threatening future steps needed to reverse over $100 billion of future sequestration cuts to DOD. By gambling with warfighting funds, the bill risks the safety of our men and women fighting to keep America safe, undercuts stable planning and efficient use of taxpayer dollars, dispirits troops and their families, baffles our allies, and emboldens our enemies.\nIn addition, H.R. 5293 would impose other unneeded costs, constraining DOD's ability to balance military capability, capacity, and readiness. The Administration's defense strategy depends on investing every dollar where it will have the greatest effect. The Administration's FY 2017 proposals would accomplish this by continuing and expanding critical reforms that divest unneeded force structure, balance growth in military compensation, modernize military health care, and reduce wasteful overhead. The bill fails to adopt many of these reforms, including through measures prohibiting the use of funds to propose or plan for a new Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) round. The bill also continues unwarranted restrictions regarding detainees at Guantanamo Bay that threaten to interfere with the Executive Branch's ability to determine the appropriate disposition of detainees and its flexibility to determine when and where to prosecute Guantanamo detainees based on the facts and circumstances of each case and our national security interests.\nIn October 2015, the President worked with congressional leaders from both parties to secure the BBA, which partially reversed harmful sequestration cuts slated for FY 2017. By providing fully-paid-for equal dollar increases for defense and non-defense spending, the BBA allows for investments in FY 2017 that create jobs, support middle-class families, contribute to long-term growth, and safeguard national security. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to enact appropriations that are consistent with that agreement, and fully support economic growth, opportunity, and our national security priorities. However, the bill is inconsistent with the BBA, and the Administration strongly objects to the inclusion of problematic ideological provisions that are beyond the scope of funding legislation. If the President were presented with H.R. 5293, the President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.\nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill.\nDepartment of Defense (DOD)\nReduction and Misuse of OCO Funds. The Administration strongly objects to the Committee's proposal to substitute $16 billion of DOD's OCO request in the FY 2017 Budget with $16 billion of unsustainable base budget programs that do not reflect the Department's highest joint priorities. This approach creates a hollow force structure and risks the loss of funding for critical overseas contingency operations. This gimmick is inconsistent with the BBA, which provided equal increases for defense and non-defense spending as well as the certainty needed to prosecute the counter-ISIL campaign, protect readiness recovery, modernize the force for future conflicts, and keep faith with servicemembers and their families. Shortchanging wartime operations by $16 billion would deplete essential funding for ongoing operations by the middle of the year, introducing a dangerous level of uncertainty for our men and women in uniform carrying out missions in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere. Our troops need and deserve guaranteed, predictable support as they execute their missions year round, particularly in light of the dangers they face in executing the Nation's ongoing overseas contingency operations.\nGuantanamo Detainee Restrictions. The Administration strongly objects to sections 8097, 8098, 8099, and 8130 of the bill, which would restrict the Executive Branch's ability to manage the detainee population at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba detention facility. Section 8098 would prohibit the use of funds for the construction, acquisition, or modification of any facility to house Guantanamo detainees in the United States. Sections 8097 and 8099 would continue prohibitions and restrictions relating to transfers of detainees abroad. In addition, section 8130 would restrict the Department's ability to transfer U.S. Naval Station functions in support of national security. The President has repeatedly objected to the inclusion of these and similar provisions in prior legislation and has called upon the Congress to lift the restrictions. Operating the detention facility at Guantanamo weakens our national security by draining resources, damaging our relationships with key allies and partners, and emboldening violent extremists. These provisions are unwarranted and threaten to interfere with the Executive Branch's ability to determine the appropriate disposition of detainees and its flexibility to determine when and where to prosecute Guantanamo detainees based on the facts and circumstances of each case and our national security interests. Sections 8097 and 8099 would, moreover, violate constitutional separation-of-powers principles in certain circumstances.\nMilitary End Strength. The Administration strongly objects to the unnecessary funding for end strength levels above the FY 2017 Budget request. The bill would force the Department to take additional risk in the training and readiness of the current force, as well as investment in and procurement of future capabilities. Adding unnecessary end strength in the manner proposed in the bill would increase military personnel and operation and maintenance support costs by approximately $30 billion (FY 2017 through FY 2021). This would also invite a significant, unacceptable risk of creating a future hollow force, in which force structure exists, but the resources to make it ready do not follow. The Administration urges support of the Department's plan, which reflects sound strategy and responsible choices among capacity, capabilities, and current and future readiness.\nMilitary Compensation Reform. The Administration is disappointed that the Committee has rejected the pay raise proposal and most of the health care reform proposals included in the FY 2017 Budget request. The FY 2017 Budget request includes a set of commonsense reforms that would allow the Department to achieve a proper balance between DOD's obligation to provide competitive pay and benefits to servicemembers and its responsibility to provide troops the finest training and equipment possible. The Administration strongly encourages the Congress to support these reforms, which would save $500 million in FY 2017 and $11 billion through FY 2021.\nAvailability of Funds for Retirement or Inactivation of Ticonderoga-Class Cruisers or Dock Landing Ships. The Administration strongly objects to section 8124 of the bill, which would prohibit the Navy from executing its phased modernization approach for maintaining an effective cruiser and dock landing ship force structure while balancing scarce operating and maintenance funding. It also would significantly reduce planned savings and accelerate the retirement of all Ticonderoga-Class cruisers. The Navy's current requirement for active large surface combatants includes 11 Air Defense Commander ships, one assigned to each of the active carrier strike groups. This requirement is met by the modernization plan proposed in the FY 2017 Budget request. Furthermore, section 8124 would require an additional $3.2 billion across the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) to fund manpower, maintenance, modernization, and operations when compared to the FY 2017 Budget request.\nRestoration of Tenth Navy Carrier Air Wing. The Administration strongly objects to restoration of the Carrier Air Wing in Title IX of the bill. The tenth Carrier Air Wing is no longer needed, and results in ineffective use of the aircraft and pilot inventory in the Navy. The plan proposed in the FY 2017 Budget request optimizes Carrier Air Wing force structure to meet the Global Force Management Allocation Plan demand in a sustainable way. As an additional benefit, the plan also generates $926 million in FYDP savings. Furthermore, if forced to retain the tenth Carrier Air Wing, the bill's current military personnel funding levels are insufficient. The Navy would require an additional $48 million in FY 2017 for military personnel above the levels already in the bill, as well as an end strength increase of 1,167 above the Navy end strength in the bill.\nRestoration of Third Littoral Combat Ship. The Administration strongly objects to the Committee's proposal to increase the purchase of Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) in FY 2017 from two to three. The FY 2017 Budget request reduced from 52 to 40 the total number of LCS and Frigates (FF) the Navy would purchase over the life of the program. A combined program of 40 LCS and FF would allow DOD to invest in advanced capabilities across the fleet and would provide sufficient capacity to meet the Department's warfighting needs and to exceed recent presence levels with a more modern and capable ship than legacy mine sweepers, frigates, and coastal patrol craft they would replace. By funding two LCS in FY 2017, the Budget request ensures that both shipyards are on equal footing and have robust production leading up to the competition to select the shipyard that would continue the program. This competitive environment ensures the best price for the taxpayer on the remaining ships, while also achieving savings by down-selecting to one shipyard. The bill prevents the use of resources for higher priorities to improve DOD's warfighting capability, such as undersea, other surface, and aviation investments.\nProhibition on Proposing, Planning, or Conducting an Additional Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Round. The Administration strongly objects to section 8121 of the bill and the proposed $3.5 million reduction to funds that would support a 2019 BRAC round. By forcing the Department to spread its resources more thinly, excess infrastructure is one of the principal drains on the Department's readiness, which the Committee recognizes as a major concern. In addition to addressing every previous congressional objection to BRAC authorization, the Department recently conducted a DOD-wide parametric capacity analysis, which demonstrates that the Department has 22 percent excess capacity. In addition, the Administration's BRAC legislative proposal includes several changes that respond to congressional concerns regarding cost. Specifically, the revised BRAC legislation requires the Secretary to certify that BRAC would have the primary objective of eliminating excess capacity and reducing costs, emphasizes recommendations that yield net savings within five years (subject to military value), and limits recommendations that take longer than 20 years to pay back. The Administration strongly urges the Congress to provide BRAC authorization as requested so that DOD can make better use of scarce resources to maintain readiness.\nAsia-Pacific Rebalance Infrastructure. The Administration strongly objects to the exclusion of a general provision requested in the FY 2017 Budget that would allow for $86.7 million of the amounts appropriated for the Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide account to be available for the Secretary of Defense to make grants, conclude cooperative agreements, and supplement other Federal funds. This critical provision addresses the need to provide assistance for civilian water and wastewater improvements to support the military build-up on Guam, as well as critical existing and enduring military installations and missions on Guam. A key aspect of the Asia-Pacific rebalance is to create a more operationally resilient Marine Corps presence in the Pacific and invest in Guam as a joint strategic hub. This funding supports the ability and flexibility of the President to execute our foreign and defense policies in coordination with our ally, Japan. In addition, it calls into question among regional states our commitment to implement the realignment plan and our ability to execute our defense strategy.\nProhibition of Funds to Enforce Section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The Administration strongly objects to section 8132 of the bill, which would prohibit DOD from using FY 2017 funds to enforce section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. Section 526 provides an environmentally sound framework for the development of future alternative fuels.\nEvolved Expendable Launch Vehicle. The Administration objects to the reductions to both the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle and the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle Infrastructure requested in the FY 2017 Budget. The Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle reduction would eliminate three launch service procurements, instead of the two procurements the Committee intended. Further, the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle Infrastructure reduction exceeds the amount ascribed to these two procurements, and would cause the Government to default on the current contract and the block buy, unnecessarily introducing costs and schedule risk for national security space payloads.\nMissile Defense Programs. The Administration objects to the reduction of $324 million from the FY 2017 Budget request for U.S. ballistic missile defense programs, including $49 million to homeland defense programs, $91 million to U.S. regional missile defense programs, $44 million to missile defense testing efforts, and $140 million to missile defense advanced technology programs. These programs are required to improve the reliability of missile defense system and ensure the United States stays ahead of the future ballistic missile threat. Furthermore, the Administration opposes the addition of $455 million above the FY 2017 Budget request for Israeli missile defense procurement and cooperative development programs.\nCoalition Support Fund (CSF). The Administration objects to section 9020 of the bill, which would rescind funds available for CSF by $300 million. Reducing CSF would limit DOD's ability to reimburse key allies in the fight against ISIL and other extremist groups in the region. The rescission is especially harmful because it would reduce funds available for programs that are already underway and would limit DOD's flexibility to continue to program these funds for critical needs. The Administration urges the Congress to retain the authority to make certain funds available to support stability activities in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas as provided in section 1212(f) of the FY 2016 National Defense Authorization Act.\nCounterterrorism Partnerships Fund (CTPF).  The Administration objects to the reduction of $250 million from the FY 2017 Budget request for CTPF because it would restrict the resources required to empower and enable partners in responding to shared terrorist threats around the world. The Administration also objects to the $200 million rescission in FY 2016 CTPF resources in the bill. Both of these reductions would preclude DOD from continuing important security assistance programs begun in FY 2016. The Administration strongly encourages the Congress to provide the $1 billion originally requested to continue support for CTPF activities in FY 2017 and restore the rescinded FY 2016 funding.\nElimination of Joint Urgent Operational Needs Fund (JUONF) Funding. The Administration objects to the elimination of the $99 million JUONF base funding requested in the FY 2017 Budget. This funding is vital to the Department's ability to quickly respond to urgent operational needs. Eliminating this funding may increase life-threatening risks to servicemembers and contribute to critical mission failures.\nRapid Prototyping, Experimentation and Demonstration. The Administration objects to the reduction of $42 million from the FY 2017 Budget request for the Navy's research and development funding to support the Rapid Prototyping, Experimentation and Demonstration (RPED) initiative. RPED is an essential element in the Navy's strategy to employ successful innovation technologies to help pace the dynamic threat of our adversaries, more quickly address urgent capability needs, accelerate our speed of innovation, and rapidly develop and deliver advanced warfighting capability to naval forces. This reduction would render the initiative ineffective in promoting rapid acquisition, hindering the Navy's ability to determine the technical feasibility and operational utility of advanced technologies before committing billions of dollars toward development. This reduction hinders the Department-wide goal of employing new techniques to make the acquisition process more agile and efficient.\nInnovation and Access to Non-Traditional Suppliers. The Administration objects to the reduction of $30 million for programs that seek to broaden DOD's access to innovative companies and technologies. Specifically, the Administration is concerned about the elimination of the investment funding associated with the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx), as well as the reduction in funding for In-Q-Tel's efforts to explore innovative technologies that enable the efficient incorporation into weapons systems and operations capabilities. These investments would enable the development of leading-edge, primarily asymmetric capabilities and help spur development of new ways of warfighting to counter advanced adversaries.\nReduction of Funds for Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Situational Awareness System. The Administration objects to the reduction of $27 million from the FY 2017 Budget request for the development of a CWMD situational awareness information system, known as \"Constellation.\" The Department is developing and fielding this system in response to requirements articulated by all Combatant Commands and validated by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council. This capability is critical to anticipating WMD threats from both nation-state and non-state actors and sharing information between DOD and its U.S. interagency and international partners. Funds were appropriated in FY 2014-2016 specifically to develop and field the Constellation system, which would be deployed in July 2016 as an initial prototype. A reduction of $27 million would effectively terminate this initiative and prevent DOD from developing a high priority capability needed to counter WMD threats.\nNavy High Energy Lasers. The Administration objects to the reduction of $20 million from the FY 2017 Budget request for the Power Projection Advanced Technology program, which would delay by one year fielding of the High Energy Laser (HEL) program laser and demonstration of its technology maturation. The HEL technology is a means of countering low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles and small surface vessels.\nLimitation on Intelligence Community General Transfer Authority (GTA). The Administration objects to section 8096 of the bill, which reduces the Intelligence Community's (IC's) FY 2016 enacted GTA cap from $1.5 billion to $1.0 billion for FY 2017. This proposed cap would place severe limits on the IC's flexibility to manage resources and could compromise the ability to meet critical intelligence priorities at a time of shifting and dynamic worldwide threats, especially in urgent circumstances. This flexibility is especially important given the broad applicability of the GTA constraints to the appropriation accounts that fund IC.\nAvailability of Funds for Improvement of IC Financial Management. The Administration objects to section 8066 of the bill, which places limits on the ability of IC to review and take action on financial management improvement measures. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence and DOD are engaged in a comprehensive review of financial management practices that may result in recommendations for changes to financial management or appropriations structures.\nConstitutional Concerns\nSeveral other provisions in the bill raise constitutional concerns. For instance, sections 8055, 8071, 8121, and provisions under the headings \"Operations and Maintenance—Defense-wide\" and \"Joint Improvised Threat Defeat Fund\" may interfere with the President's authority as Commander in Chief.\nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2017 appropriations process moves forward.", "timestamp": "2016-06-14", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 5293 - Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2017"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118004", "text": "STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY\n(Senate)\n(Sen. Cochran, R-MS)\nThis Statement of Administration Policy provides views on S. 2837, making appropriations for the Departments of Commerce and Justice, Science, and Related Agencies for the fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, 2017, and for other purposes.\nThe Administration welcomes the bill's investments in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's observational infrastructure, including funding for the next generation of polar orbiting satellites that are critical to providing accurate and timely weather forecasts. In addition, the Administration appreciates the Committee's support for investments that would increase the International Trade Administration's trade enforcement and compliance efforts, which help ensure that U.S. businesses compete on a level playing field in the global economy. The Administration also appreciates the Committee's support for investments in State and local assistance, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Commercial Crew program. Finally, the Administration is pleased that the bill supports the construction of a new consolidated FBI headquarters facility to support the agency's national security and law enforcement missions.\nHowever, the bill's inadequate funding of research, testing, and implementation activity for the 2020 Decennial Census would undermine the Census Bureau's efforts to reduce the costs of administering the 2020 Decennial Census by more than $5 billion. The bill also fails to provide the funding necessary for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) to hire the requested 200 additional agents and investigators to help enforce existing gun laws and keep guns out of the wrong hands. In addition, the Administration is deeply concerned that the bill adds more than $1 billion above the FY 2017 Budget request for NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion capsule while underfunding other key NASA programs—an approach that would result in an unbalanced exploration program that is unable to achieve shared exploration goals.\nThe Administration also urges the Congress to enact the mandatory research and development (R&D) funding requested in NASA, the National Science Foundation, and the Department of Commerce to support the critical role that R&D plays in expanding the frontiers of human knowledge, tackling the Nation's biggest challenges, and driving the economy forward.\nIn October 2015, the President worked with congressional leaders from both parties to secure the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA), which partially reversed harmful sequestration cuts slated for FY 2017. By providing fully-paid-for equal dollar increases for defense and non-defense spending, the BBA allows for investments in FY 2017 that create jobs, support middle-class families, contribute to long-term growth, and safeguard national security. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to enact appropriations that are consistent with that agreement, and fully support economic growth, opportunity, and our national security priorities. However, the Administration strongly objects to the inclusion of problematic ideological provisions that are beyond the scope of funding legislation. If the final bill that is presented to the President includes such provisions, the President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.\nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill.\nDepartment of Commerce\nCensus Bureau Periodic Censuses and Programs (including 2020 Decennial Census). The Administration objects to the inadequate funding provided for the Census Bureau's Periodic Censuses and Programs account. The FY 2017 Budget proposed a robust funding level for the Census Bureau to continue the research, testing, and implementation of new design changes that have the potential to save more than $5 billion in the 2020 Decennial Census compared to repeating previous methods. The bill's funding level puts these design changes at risk, potentially increasing the cost to the taxpayer for administering the 2020 Decennial Census or requiring unsustainable reductions in other critical surveys such as the American Community Survey, the Economic Census, or the Census of Governments.\nNational Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI) Funding and Coordination. The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request for manufacturing institutes and coordination. The FY 2017 Budget request builds on the momentum of the first Department of Commerce-led manufacturing institute, which will launch later this year, by providing the funding to launch two more institutes in FY 2017. These institutes, which will be part of the NNMI, are designed to bridge the gap between basic research and product development to advance U.S. manufacturing capacity in critical technology areas. These institutes have already demonstrated an ability to encourage investment and production in the United States, creating good jobs now and preparing American workers for future opportunities in the advanced manufacturing sector.\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Labs. The Administration urges the Congress to support increased funding for high priority research initiatives at the NIST labs proposed in the FY 2017 Budget request. These initiatives allow NIST to conduct the research necessary to strengthen U.S. leadership in the industries of the future, such as advanced communications, quantum computing, and advanced manufacturing. The Administration notes that the bill provided $24 million more than requested for lab construction and believes these funds would be better directed to the new research initiatives proposed in the FY 2017 Budget request.\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for NOAA's observational infrastructure, including high priority weather and next generation polar satellites, and urges the Congress also to support critical investments in climate and oceans research. These investments, such as Arctic observations, the Climate Resilience Toolkit, and ocean acidification, provide information to help communities around the United States prepare for the effects of natural disasters and other ramifications of climate change and provide the science necessary to inform their preparations.\nInternational Trade Administration (ITA). The Administration urges the Congress to provide the requested funding level of $521 million, which would allow for the expansion of SelectUSA and ITA's trade promotion operations both internationally and within the United States. These investments support U.S. companies trying to compete in a global economy by opening up new markets and helping secure new overseas investment in U.S. businesses.\nDepartment of Justice (DOJ)\nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Headquarters Consolidation Project. The Administration appreciates the Committee's strong support for the new consolidated FBI headquarters facility by providing the FY 2017 Budget request of $646 million. This funding—together with prior year funding and resources in the FY 2017 Budget requested for the General Services Administration's Federal Buildings Fund—would allow the project to proceed in a timely manner. The project will culminate in a modern headquarters facility that is tailored to fully support FBI's national security and law enforcement missions.\nFederal Law Enforcement. While the Administration appreciates the funding provided for the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration, the bill underfunds other law enforcement components of DOJ. The Administration is especially concerned with the Committee's funding level for ATF, which is insufficient to hire the requested 200 additional agents and investigators to help enforce existing gun laws and regulations designed to take violent criminals off the street, deter other unlawful activity, and prevent guns from getting into the wrong hands.\nBureau of Prisons. The Administration is disappointed that the bill does not fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request for the Bureau of Prisons to improve post-incarceration outcomes. The Administration seeks to expand mental health and substance abuse programs, provide additional vocational and educational opportunities, and to add community-based reentry programs. These programs are needed to reduce barriers to successful re-entry.\nCommunity Policing Initiative.While the bill partially supports the Strengthening Police-Community Relations initiative, which includes elements of the Administration's Community Policing Initiative (CPI) proposal, it falls short of the funding necessary to ensure the success of central components of the FY 2017 Budget request. Improving community-police relations is crucial to maintaining public safety and confidence in the criminal justice system. The Administration appreciates the $50 million the bill provides for CPI funding, including partial funding of the request for Smart Policing, Body Worn Cameras (BWC), and the Collaborative Reform Initiative. However, the Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request, which would expand the Building Community Trust and Justice Initiative, further increase the use of BWCs, and enable the Office of Community Oriented Policing (COPS) to partner with more law enforcement agencies and cities that may need assistance on a wide variety of criminal justice issues.\nState and Local Grants.The Administration appreciates the overall funding level provided for criminal justice assistance. The bill provides $2.3 billion for State and local grants, which is approximately $235 million above the FY 2017 Budget request. The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the request for the COPS Hiring program, which would support hiring for more than 1,200 community policing officers nation-wide. The Administration is also concerned with the significant reduction to juvenile justice programs. These programs help reduce juvenile delinquency and crime, protect public safety, hold offenders accountable, assist missing and exploited children and their families, and provide treatment and rehabilitative services tailored to the needs of juveniles and their families.\nViolence Against Women. The Administration appreciates the support for Violence Against Women Act programs as well as the Community Teams to Reduce the Sexual Assault Evidence Kit Backlog and Improve Sexual Assault Investigations Program. However, the Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the request for the Grants to Encourage Arrest Policies Program and the Legal Assistance Program in order to address critical needs in the fight to stop violence against women. Investments in these programs would help to improve victim safety, save lives, and establish practices that can be sustained in the coming years.\nGeneral Legal Activities. The Administration is concerned that the bill fails to provide any of the increases requested in the FY 2017 Budget to enhance the efforts of legal divisions, including: the Civil Rights Division to improve police-community relations, protect the rights of servicemembers, and expand access for people with disabilities; the Environment and Natural Resources Division to improve environmental protection in Indian Country and enhance the safety of America's workforce; the Civil Division to enhance elder justice efforts and enforce immigration laws; and INTERPOL Washington to keep pace with increasing requests for international law enforcement information sharing and coordination. The bill provides $893 million for General Legal Activities, which is $64 million below the FY 2017 Budget request.\nGuantanamo Detainee Restrictions. The Administration strongly objects to sections 527 and 528 of the bill, which would prohibit the use of funds for the transfer of detainees to the United States and for the construction, acquisition, or modification of any facility to house Guantanamo detainees in the United States. The President has repeatedly objected to the inclusion of these and similar provisions in prior legislation and has called upon the Congress to lift the restrictions. Operating the detention facility at Guantanamo weakens U.S. national security by draining resources, damaging U.S. relationships with key allies and partners, and emboldening violent extremists. These provisions are unwarranted and threaten to interfere with the Executive Branch's ability to determine the appropriate disposition of detainees and its flexibility to determine when and where to prosecute Guantanamo detainees based on the facts and circumstances of each case and U.S. national security interests. Moreover, section 527 would violate constitutional separation-of-powers principles under certain circumstances.\nRestrictions on Combatting Unlawful Gun Trafficking. The Administration strongly objects to numerous provisions that would inhibit efforts to combat illegal gun activities, including unlawful trafficking, particularly where there has been little or no meaningful engagement with ATF on the provisions and their application. These include restrictions preventing ATF from curtailing the importation of \"curio or relic\" firearms or ammunition and denying applications to import shotguns that do not meet the statutory \"sporting purposes\" test. The Administration also urges the Congress to repeal a number of other unnecessarily restrictive provisions made permanent in prior years.\nLegal Services Corporation (LSC)\nThe Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the $475 million requested in the FY 2017 Budget for LSC, supporting grants for high-quality civil legal assistance to low-income Americans. LSC grantees represent the working poor, veterans, homeowners and renters, families with children, farmers, people with disabilities, and the elderly. Women—many of whom are struggling to keep their children safe and their families together through restraining orders and custody challenges—comprise 70 percent of clients. At the reduced level of $395 million provided in the bill, thousands of otherwise eligible low-income Americans would be denied legal assistance, impacting their due process rights and fair treatment in the courts.\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)\nFunding Balance. The Administration appreciates the Committee's robust overall funding level for NASA. However, the Administration is deeply concerned that the bill adds more than $1 billion above the FY 2017 Budget request for the SLS rocket and Orion capsule while underfunding other key NASA programs. Continued congressional focus on these large-scale development programs at the expense of the technologies and capabilities needed to make space exploration affordable and future missions achievable would result in an unbalanced exploration program that is unable to achieve shared exploration goals.\nExploration R&D.The Administration strongly urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request for Exploration R&D, including funds to initiate a public/private partnership to create a deep space habitat and to proceed with the Asteroid Redirect Mission. Underfunding the request would leave the SLS and Orion without missions and needed capabilities when their testing is complete.\nSpace Technology.The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request for NASA Space Technology. Compared to the request, the bill reduces funding for these investments by $140 million, or 17 percent, and includes programmatic direction that further reduces the funding available for planned missions. Impacts would likely include delaying development of a cutting-edge laser communication system, advanced, high power solar electric propulsion, and other space technology demonstrations, slowing progress on the journey to Mars, and reducing the international competitiveness of the U.S. commercial space industry.\nAeronautics. The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request for Aeronautics. The bill's reduction of $190 million from the request would likely force NASA to abandon its new series of experimental aircraft intended to make aircraft faster, greener, and more efficient and to ensure the U.S. aerospace industry's leadership.\nScience. The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request for NASA Science programs. Compared to the request, the bill reduces funding by over $200 million, potentially delaying or cancelling space science missions in development, terminating operating missions, and reducing new funding for research grants.\nSpace Operations. The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request for NASA Space Operations, for which the bill provides $125.2 million below the request.\nNational Science Foundation (NSF)\nAgency Operations and Award Management. The Administration is concerned that the bill underfunds the required costs associated with the agency's plans to move its headquarters in FY 2017 and would therefore impact the agency's ability to carry out its mission.\nMajor Research Equipment and Facility Construction. The Administration is concerned that the Committee provided $53 million more than requested for the Major Research Equipment and Facility Construction account and believes these funds would be better directed to other NSF initiatives.\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)\nTopline Funding. The Administration is disappointed that the bill underinvests in EEOC by freezing the agency at last year's funding level, which is $12 million below the FY 2017 Budget request, and urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request. A freeze in funding would result in EEOC's fourth year of essentially flat funding, which would compromise EEOC's ability to target and remedy employment discrimination and ensure that individuals alleging discrimination have timely access to justice. This level would impede EEOC's ability to reduce its private-sector charge backlog and leverage technology to increase efficiency and customer service.\nOther Issues\nU.S. Digital Service Team.The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request for the Departments of Commerce and Justice, NASA, and NSF to develop a U.S. Digital Service team. This funding supports efforts to improve digital services that have the greatest impact on citizens and businesses.\nConstitutional Concerns\nSeveral provisions in the bill, particularly sections 509 and 519, would raise constitutional concerns in certain applications by intruding upon the President's constitutional authority over international diplomacy.\nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2017 appropriations process moves forward.", "timestamp": "2016-06-14", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: S. 2837 - Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies"}
{"author": "Michelle Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=120902", "text": "MS. WINFREY: Hi, everybody! (Applause.) We are here for the United State of Women! (Applause.)\nMRS. OBAMA: Now, I know you all have had a busy, packed, full day -- very inspiring, right? (Applause.) And hopefully, our conversation will live up to the hype. But before we begin, of course, I want to take a moment to just acknowledge what has happened in Orlando -- that even as we gather here today and we talk about the challenges that women face, we have to remember those that we lost in Orlando, as well as those who were injured, and all of their loves ones, and know that we will all continue to keep them in our thoughts and prayers.\nBut the one thing I just want us all to know -- that in tragic times like these, in this country, it's time for us to come together, to love each other, to support each other and not tear each other down. (Applause.) So I hope that that is one of the many takeaways that we move forward with. And I just love you all for the work -- the amazing work you all have done today and that you do every single day.\nSo I'm going to turn it over to Oprah.\nMS. WINFREY: Hello.\nMRS. OBAMA: We have Oprah Winfrey here. (Applause.)\nMS. WINFREY: And our First Lady of the United States. (Applause.)\nMRS. OBAMA: Of America.\nMS. WINFREY: Of America, not just of women, yes. (Laughter.) So I think that the fact that -- I've been watching this being streamed all day, and the fact that there are men here, women here of all ages -- young women, maturing women -- and all walks of life is a move in the right direction, would you not say?\nMRS. OBAMA: Absolutely, absolutely. I'm just proud of all the work that's been done here. So I agree.\nMS. WINFREY: Well, I wanted to start with the issue of self-value and self-worth. Because over the years, I've interviewed thousands of people, most of them women, and I would say that the root of every dysfunction I've ever encountered, every problem has been some sense of a lacking of self-value or of self-worth. And I know that we all know that we live in a world where you are constantly being bombarded by images that encourage you to be liked, literally. And it's a lot to live up to. And I wonder, particularly you, who have had to face this as your own woman and as a candidate's wife, the pressure of other people's expectations -- and what can you share with our audience here and online that would help us stand more inside ourselves and own that space?\nMRS. OBAMA: Very good question. Well, one of the things that I always -- I tell my mentees, I tell my daughters is that our first job in life as women, I think, is to get to know ourselves. And I think a lot of times we don't do that. We spend our time pleasing, satisfying, looking out into the world to define who we are -- listening to the messages, the images, the limited definitions that people have of who we are. And that's true for women of color for sure. There is a limited box that we are put in, and if we live by that limited definition we miss out on a lot of who we are.\nBut it takes taking the time to know who you are to be able to deal with the onslaught of negative messages that you're bound to get. So for me, I came into this with a pretty clear sense of myself. And some of that comes with age. Some of that comes with experience. Some of that comes from being fortunate enough to have been raised by a loving mother, strong, focused, and a father who loved me dearly.\nSo I fortunately came into this situation with a really clear sense of who I was. So when you hear the smack-talking from outside the world, it's easy to sort of brush that off. Because I know who I am. (Applause.)\nMS. WINFREY: But when you came in, there were the world's expectations, there were other expectations. What did you really expect?\nMRS. OBAMA: It's interesting, I really tried not to limit myself by expectations.\nMS. WINFREY: Because nobody grows up thinking \"I'm going to be a First Lady.\"\nMRS. OBAMA: Absolutely not. And as you all know, when Barack was talking about running, I was like, are you crazy? I mean, would you just, like, chill out and do something else with your life? (Laughter.)\nSo I was working hard to try to get him to do the other thing, so -- whatever that was. So, yeah, absolutely, it wasn't something that I could have planned for, could have expected from myself. But one of the things I knew -- because people asked all throughout the campaign what are your issues going to be, what are you going to be like as First Lady, and I said, I have to wait until I get there to figure out what that's going to feel like for me. I specifically did not read other First Ladies' books, because I didn't want to be influenced by how they defined the role. I knew that I would have to find this role -- (applause) -- very uniquely and specifically to me and who I was.\nSo I came in thinking about who I wanted to be in this position and who I needed to be for my girls, first of all. So you remember, Malia and Sasha were little itty-bitties when we came into office. I mean, it still moves me to tears to think about the first day I put them in the car with their Secret Service agents to go to their first day of school. And I saw them leaving and I thought, what on Earth am I doing to these babies? So I knew right then and there my first job was to make sure they were going to be whole and normal and cared for in the midst of all this craziness. (Applause.) And then I started to understand that if I was going to protect them, I had to, number one, protect myself and protect my time.\nSo I knew going into this role that I didn't want to waste any time; that any time I spent away from my kids -- and I actually took this on even before I became First Lady, even as a lawyer, as a vice president at a hospital. One of the things I realized is that if you do not take control over your time and your life, other people will gobble it up. If you don't prioritize yourself, you constantly start falling lower and lower on your list, your kids fall lower and lower on your list.\nMS. WINFREY: So by the time you got here you knew how to do that.\nMRS. OBAMA: I knew how to do that.\nMS. WINFREY: I think that's one of the number-one issues with women. I never, in all my years of interviewing, have ever heard a man say, you know, I just don't have the time, I just don't, I don't find a way to balance.\nMRS. OBAMA: You know why? Because they don't have to balance anything. Sorry. (Laughter and applause.) And I hope that that is changing, but so many men don't have to do it all.\nMS. WINFREY: So how did you figure it out? I've read the story -- I'm sure many of you have heard the story of early on, you were going to a job interview and you took Sasha with you to interview.\nMRS. OBAMA: Oh, yeah.\nMS. WINFREY: We never heard, did you get that job?\nMRS. OBAMA: I did. I did.\nMS. WINFREY: Okay.\nMRS. OBAMA: I was the vice president of community outreach for the University of Chicago Hospital. (Applause.) And I got that job because I didn't compromise. Because before getting -- working at that job, I was working as an associate dean. I had had Malia, Barack was in the U.S. Senate, so I was basically mothering part time on my own, having -- I had a full-time job. So I tried part time -- I've talked about this before -- I tried part time because I thought, I have to figure this out, I have to be able to pick the kids up, I've got to be able to do all this. So I tried part time. So the only thing I found out from part time was that you just get paid part time. (Applause.) Because I was still doing a full-time job --\nMS. WINFREY: Everything, yeah.\nMRS. OBAMA: -- I was just cramming it all into the few hours that I was there and driving myself crazy. So I had vowed that if I continued to work, that I would never settle for part time. I knew what my time and energy was worth.\nSo when I went into that -- the president's office to interview for that job, I thought, I have a little baby, I don't have babysitting, so here we go, we're all going to go in to see the president because this is who I am. (Laughter.) And I said, and if I take this job, I need flexibility and I need full pay. So if you want me to leave my baby and my kids, then you're going to have to pay me, because I'm going to do the job -- that was never a question. I could deliver. But I knew then I wasn't going to sell myself short. And I had the leverage, at the time, to make that decision.\nMS. WINFREY: Well, that comes from a sense of -- and you said you arrived here knowing who you were. I think that is the journey. That is the journey. And there is a question from FarmFreshGal.\nMRS. OBAMA: FarmFreshGal.\nMS. WINFREY: She must have her own garden.\nMRS. OBAMA: I hope.\nMS. WINFREY: Like we do, yes. And FarmFreshGal says, \"As a woman leader in the corporate world, I feel like I have to be brave a lot,\" -- and what you just described was brave -- \"any advice or tips on bravery?\"\nMRS. OBAMA: That's a good question. Gosh, I don't know. If I ever -- I don't ever view it as bravery.\nMS. WINFREY: You didn't think that was brave? Saying, look, I'm going to be paid full time?\nMRS. OBAMA: Right.\nMS. WINFREY: I think that's brave.\nMRS. OBAMA: I just viewed it as I'm not going to be taken advantage of. (Applause.) I am just not going to keep selling myself --\nMS. WINFREY: You knew your value.\nMRS. OBAMA: Value. That's absolutely right.\nMS. WINFREY: You knew your value. I was just saying that to a friend recently.\nMRS. OBAMA: And that goes back to knowing who you are. And I think as women and young girls, we have to invest that time in getting to understand who we are and liking who we are. (Applause.) Because I like me. I've liked me for a very long time. (Applause.) So for a long time I've had a very good relationship with myself.\nMS. WINFREY: I know.\nMRS. OBAMA: And we like -- we all like ourselves in here. But you've got to work to get to that place. And if you're going out into the world as a professional and you don't know who you are, you don't know what you want, you don't know how much you're worth, then you have to be brave. And then you have to count on the kindness and goodness of others to bestow that goodness on you when you should be working to get it on your own. Because you deserve it.\nMS. WINFREY: Because you know your own value.\nMRS. OBAMA: Know your own value. Absolutely.\nMS. WINFREY: Okay. So when you're saying \"I know who I am\" -- and I'm telling you, it's the thread that runs through everything. It's the thing that allows you to stand in your own truth. And one of the things for years that Maya Angelou used to say to me, is \"Baby, you need to know that you are alone are enough. You alone are enough.\" (Applause.)\nSo how do we get there? You were there. You've loved yourself a long time. What is that process?\nMRS. OBAMA: I think it's different for everyone. And I can't say that I've loved myself for a long time, but there was a journey to get there. And some of it starts as a young girl -- when you confront your first bully, the first time somebody calls you out -- your name, as we would say. The first disappointments and failures that you have, how do you deal with that? What supports systems do you set up for yourself?\nI always tell young girls, surround yourself with goodness. I learned early on how to get the haters out of my life. (Applause.) You've got to just sort of surround yourself with people who uplift you, who hold you up. And for whatever reason -- well, I was lucky I had people like -- I had parents who held me up. I had a father that valued me.\nMS. WINFREY: I think people who have good parents are -- they come into the world with a strength, yes, and an advantage.\nMRS. OBAMA: And that was an advantage. But if you don't have that parent -- that mother, that father -- then you've got to find it. You've got to find those people. Because they're out there. I tell my mentees all of -- there is somebody out there who loves you and who is waiting to love you, and you just have to find them. And that means you have to make room for them. And if you're surrounded by a bunch of low-life folks who aren't supporting you, then there is no room for the people who do love you. (Applause.)\nMS. WINFREY: You mentioned a moment ago \"the haters.\" How do you handle the haters, particularly in this office, where haters have to be handled politically correctly and with discretion? (Laughter.) And I know so many people are faced with it -- we know this about social media -- people say just the meanest things, and you're faced in your life with people who can tear you down a lot -- the haters, hateration.\nMRS. OBAMA: Well, when it comes to social media -- there are just times I turn off the world, you know. There are just some times you have to give yourself space to be quiet, which means you've got to set those phones down. You can't be reading all that stuff. I mean, that's like letting somebody just walk up and slap you, you know? (Laughter.) You would never do that. You would never just sit there and go, slap me in the face and I'm good with it. No. So why would you open yourself up to that?\nSo that's one thing. With social media and -- I don't read that stuff. I learned that early in the campaign. I couldn't keep reading stuff about my husband and what people thought and -- because I knew who he was. I knew what was going on in our home, in our lives. So I didn't need to read about it from somebody else.\nBut the other thing that I have found, particularly in this job, that it's -- people won't remember what other people say about you, but they will remember what you do. So my strategy -- and I've always been like this. When a teacher would come and tell me that I couldn't do something, I would get so much satisfaction proving them wrong. I'd be like, okay, all right, oh, you don't think I'm going to do X, Y and Z, well I'm going to be the best X, Y, Z you can imagine.\nSo when it came to this role, I just said, you know, let me just be First Lady. Let me wake up every day and work hard to do something of value, and to do it well, and to do something consequential, and to do something that I care about. And then let that speak for itself. And that would shut up the haters, because I would have a whole portfolio of stuff that defined me because it's what I did, not what you called me. (Applause.) So the best revenge is success --\nMS. WINFREY: Is success, yes.\nMRS. OBAMA: -- and good work. You don't have to say anything to the haters. You don't have to acknowledge them at all. You just wake up every morning and be the best you you can be. And that tends to shut them up.\nMS. WINFREY: You know, I've always thought too, that the best success comes when you can actually shift your paradigm to service. And obviously, you are in a position of public service. Was it a conscious, intentional decision to sort of sit still, be with this place, and then allow your passion to fuel your interest, allow your passion to lead you to all the things you've been able to do with international girls' education, with health and wellness? Was that a conscious, intentional decision?\nMRS. OBAMA: Absolutely. Because in this -- particularly when you're in public service, you're First Lady, the President and you're interacting with the world, people can smell inauthenticity. They know when you are not what you appear to be. And that was always something that I said in this role that -- I want people to know me, know Michelle, Michelle Robinson Obama, not the First Lady. In every interaction I have had with anybody who's had some connection with me, I have tried to be authentically myself. And in order to do that, I learned that I have to do things that I authentically care about. Because if I fundamentally, deep down have a belief in the cause, and I -- it moves me, then I'm going to be excited about it. That excitement is going to be conveyed to the people that I'm trying to reach. It's not going to be a heavy lift.\nThat's why people say, how can you speak in front of all these people and do this every day? Look, I get energy from people. And not everybody in politics, in public service are people-people. Barack and I really do -- we are energized by the people we meet, by the military spouses that I meet out there. I picked working with military families because they moved me. I met them out on the campaign trail and I didn't know that there were millions of military families out there serving and sacrificing in ways that we take for granted in this country. And I vowed then and there, just from meeting them, that if I got to be First Lady I would try to be that voice for them, I would try to shine that light on them. (Applause.)\nSo that came out of a direct passion for who those people were and what I learned about them.\nMS. WINFREY: And I remember when you all first arrived at the White House, you said to the country that this is your house, and we're going to open this up as your house. And so when I saw all those Girl Scouts out on the lawn, I went, you all really did open up the house. (Laughter.)\nMRS. OBAMA: Yes, yes. That's been some of the most fulfilling things we've been able to do in the White House. It's really bringing people here who would never, ever get to set foot on that lawn and walk into those doors. (Applause.) I tell my mentees all the time -- you know, one of the things I want them to take away when they come -- because they come regularly; they come at least once a month and we sit down and we talk, and they have seminars -- and I want them all to know you walk into the White House every day, and you walk up to the First Lady of the United States and say, \"Hey, Michelle, what's going on?\" And if you can do that, you can do anything. If you can exist in this space at this time in this moment -- (applause) --\nMS. WINFREY: Yes.\nMRS. OBAMA: And there is no class that you can't handle. There's no school whose rejection will make you fold or make you crumble. You've been here. And I've watched so many kids come through those gates and really be in that space -- picking tomatoes with me in the garden, getting to sit in and have tastings at the state dinner, being invited to watch Hamilton. I mean, just watching their eyes just experiencing things that really only the privileged get to experience, but having it be kids and people who would never believe they would set foot in that house.\nMS. WINFREY: You see them get empowered --\nMRS. OBAMA: Oh, gosh, yeah.\nMS. WINFREY: -- and transformed in the process.\nMRS. OBAMA: So many kids, you think their world view will never be the same. And that's the least we can do as President and First Lady. I think that's the obligation of anyone who lives in that house. (Applause.)\nMS. WINFREY: How do you feel -- I always feel that until you take your last breath you're always growing, and that every experience that you encounter in your life -- just all of you being together here today and being in a room with people who are like-minded, who share the same vision -- all of that is so stimulating. You leave here and you feel like you can be better and do better. What has the experience -- or how has the experience of being First Lady actually grown you?\nMRS. OBAMA: Wow. So many ways. I mean, first of all, there is absolutely nothing I can't do, right? (Applause.)\nMS. WINFREY: Because you walk in that --\nMRS. OBAMA: That's right, that's right.\nMS. WINFREY: You live in the White House.\nMRS. OBAMA: We've been to the mountain top, and it was a hard climb but we made it. (Laughter.) We made it! (Applause.)\nSo you just -- again, you begin to understand how much you can tolerate, how much growth you can have, how much potential there is, how much opportunity there is to help people, how fulfilling it is. I mean, that's been the thing that I've learned, that\nMS. WINFREY: Fulfilling in it.\nMRS. OBAMA: Oh, it feels -- public service -- I left the practice of law to go into public service for selfish reasons. I wanted to be happy and feel good every single day. I wanted to wake up inspired and ready to do something greater than myself. And that's what service and giving and -- that's what this room means to so many.\nAnd I just want to make sure that when people leave here they don't go back into their isolation; that they don't go back to their phones, looking down. Because this relationship isn't enough. You need to have people in your lives that you're connecting with, that you're helping. I mean, there is nothing that makes me feel better than knowing that I helped to change somebody's life -- Oprah, you know this more than anyone else. And if you're doing that every single day, the haters, the doubters -- none of that matters, because you are getting so much by the -- from the work that you're doing.\nMS. WINFREY: Well, you know, I figured this out -- early on in the show I had read this quote from Dr. King, one of my favorite quotes from him, that says, \"Not everybody can be famous, but everybody can be great, because greatness is determined by service.\" And I literally shifted -- I used that quote to help me shift the way I saw the platform of television. Instead of like, oh, I'm going to -- I'm on TV, how do I use that platform as a platform of service, is what I did.\nMRS. OBAMA: Amen.\nMS. WINFREY: Yeah.\nMRS. OBAMA: Yeah, we know. And you did that pretty well too. (Laughter and applause.)\nMS. WINFREY: But when you think about growing and being empowered yourself, it is what you've been able to do for other people that leaves you the fullest.\nMRS. OBAMA: Yes, absolutely. That is really the thing. So I don't know, I don't sort of -- my growth is incidental. It's the lucky gift I get for giving. And, like you said, I'm still growing. We are all still growing.\nI used to tell some of the young people I worked with way back in Chicago days that I used to hate the question \"What do you want to be when you grow up?\" because it assumes that at some point you stop becoming and you just are something. And that would be a sad thing to think that this is it.\nAnd that's one of the things I've learned -- that there are so many phases to life that this is just -- even as big as being First Lady and living in the White House has been, this is still just a portion of a very bigger journey that I have yet to know the outcome. And I won't know it until I'm laying down. It's just ever-evolving. (Applause.) And I think that reality -- this experience has helped me to see that. These are just phases. And this has been a very interesting phase, and a very impactful phase, but there's more to come.\nMS. WINFREY: I love you saying that -- I'm not through.\nMRS. OBAMA: We ain't through! (Laughter.)\nMS. WINFREY: We aren't through! (Applause.) Okay, so, yes, I believe in service. I believe in helping people. I want people to feel fulfilled and empowered in their life. But still, somedays I think it's just cool to be me. (Laughter.)\nMRS. OBAMA: And I think that too -- some days it's just cool to be Oprah. (Laughter.)\nMS. WINFREY: So I want to know, what are those days when you just say, mmm, mmm, mmm -- (laughter) -- look at me in the White House. (Laughter.)\nMRS. OBAMA: There are so -- yeah, just sitting up here, mmm, mmm, mmm. (Laughter.) There are a lot of those moments. Prince and Stevie Wonder singing in the East Room, just -- may he rest in peace. I mean, those rare gifts of entertainment, the kind of music we have been able to bring into the White House. Sitting with the Pope, watching my mother and my daughters talk to the Pope. That's like a --\nMS. WINFREY: Mmm, mmm, mmm.\nMRS. OBAMA: Mmm, mmm, mmm. (Laughter.) Dinner with the Queen of England, just like, mmm, mmm, mmm. (Laughter.)\nMS. WINFREY: Mmm, mmm, mmm.\nMRS. OBAMA: You know, you try to play these moments off, like oh, yes, yes, I know what I'm doing -- and inside you're going, mmm, mmm, mmm.\nMS. WINFREY: Mmm, mmm, mmm.\nMRS. OBAMA: Good lord. Watching my husband walk off of Marine One and go to the Oval Office, it's like, mmm, mmm, mmm. (Laughter and applause.)\nMS. WINFREY: Mmm, mmm, mmm. (Laughter.)\nMRS. OBAMA: And you know he's got that walk, right?\nMS. WINFREY: I know! (Laughter.)\nMRS. OBAMA: Like, mmm, mmm, mmm.\nMS. WINFREY: He's got the swag. (Laughter.) Did he always have that swag? Or has he gotten swaggier?\nMRS. OBAMA: No, he was very swagalicious. (Laughter.) Look, I told people this from the very start, when I -- started running -- Barack Obama is exactly who he says he is. We both are. That's what I've been trying to tell people. Ain't no surprises. We're telling you who we are, and no tricks up our sleeves. We're regular folks. We care about people. We care about family. We want to do well. We want to make our country proud. We don't want to waste our talents just making money for ourselves.\nBarack Obama hasn't changed, not as a person. Because he is an authentic man who came in, and he's going to leave that same person. (Applause.) So it's not the office that changes you, it's just -- it amplifies who you are. I think I said that at the last convention. Being President doesn't change who you are, it reveals who you are. And that's something that we should all remember. (Applause.)\nMS. WINFREY: This is the United State of Women. There are a lot of cool men out here. I love the --\nMRS. OBAMA: Let's give it up for the brothers, for the men out here. (Applause.)\nMS. WINFREY: There's a lot of cool men out here. I love the President's speech saying you're looking at a feminist. What can men do leaving here?\nMRS. OBAMA: Be better. (Laughter and applause.) Be better at everything. (Applause.) Be better fathers. Good lord, just being good fathers who love your daughters and are providing a solid example of what it means to be a good man in the world, showing them what it feels like to be loved. That is the greatest gift that the men in my life gave to me.\nAnd we've talked about this -- the fact that I never experienced abuse at the hands of any man in my life. And that's sad to say that that's a rare reality. So men can be better at that.\nMen can be better husbands, which is -- be a part of your family's life. Do the dishes. (Applause.) Don't babysit your children. You don't babysit your own children. (Applause.) Be engaged. Don't just think going to work and coming home makes you a man. Being a father, being engaged, all that stuff is important.\nBe a better employer. When you are sitting at a seat of power at a table of any kind and you look around you just see you, it's just you and a bunch of men around a table, on a golf course, making deals, and you allow that to happen, and you're okay with that -- be better.\nMS. WINFREY: Be better.\nMRS. OBAMA: Be better.\nMS. WINFREY: Be better. (Applause.) I love that.\nMRS. OBAMA: Just be better. (Laughter and applause.) I could go on but I'm not. (Laughter.) You get the point, fellas, right? Fellas? (Applause.) What are you going to be?\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: Better!\nMRS. OBAMA: There you go.\nMS. WINFREY: There you go. (Applause.) So here's the question that comes up over and over and over -- we talked a little bit about it -- this idea of balance. Is that a false notion for women? Because can we really -- are we ever going to have it all? I used to say you can have it all you just can't have it all at one time. Is that a false notion?\nMRS. OBAMA: I am always irritated by the \"you can have it all\" statement. And I grew irritated with that phrase and that expectation the older I got, as you're trying to have it all. And you're beating yourself up, and feeling less than because you aren't having it all. Because it's a ridiculous aspiration.\nMS. WINFREY: Especially if you're looking at everybody else's Facebook page.\nMRS. OBAMA: Oh, god, everybody has it all. Everybody is lying. They're lying. (Laughter and applause.) You all need to stop lying. Be real about the fact that -- no one gets everything. That was one of the first rules you learned as a little kid. You don't always get your way. Come on, people. You don't always get what you want all the time. And that's true in life.\nSo what I've told many young people is that you can have it all, but oftentimes it's hard to get it all at the same time.\nMS. WINFREY: Yeah, I believe that.\nMRS. OBAMA: So it's just a matter of managing expectations. So for me, for example, you know, when your husband is President of the United States and you have children, something has got to give. I've made compromises in my life and my career, but I've also, in exchange, gained a wonderful platform to do some great work. Who would have ever imagined that we would make the inroads we've made on healthy eating and changing the way our kids are fed in school? (Applause.) I can point to so many things that I've had -- that I've been able to do. If I want to be heavily involved in my girls' lives that means that sometimes I have to put some things on the back burner to give them what they need.\nSo it's hard to have it all. But that's where you go back to knowing who you are, and knowing that you're really living through phases. And if you're compromising through one phase of your journey, you're not giving it all up, you're compromising for that phase. There's another phase that's coming up where you might be able to have more of what you thought you wanted. You get to know yourself a little bit more.\nSo, no, I don't want young women out there to have the expectation that if they're not having it all that somehow they're failing. Life is hard. But life is long if you maintain your health, which is one of the reasons why we talk about health, talk about taking care of yourself. Because you want to get to the next phases in life where you can do more of what you want to do at any given time.\nMS. WINFREY: You want to be wherever you are right now. And, just like you say, I'm not through.\nMRS. OBAMA: Mmm hmm. You're not through.\nMS. WINFREY: Not through. So 5,000 women and men in this room. (Applause.) Thousands and thousands of others streaming us online -- hey. (Laughter.) Hey, everybody streaming. What is the one thing -- because I think it's really easy when you come to a conference like this and you get so inspired and you see Marley and Mikaila, those young women, and you see Billie Jean King, and Gloria Steinem, and Shonda Rhimes, and Kerry Washington.\nMRS. OBAMA: It's amazing gathering --\nMS. WINFREY: You see all these women and you're just like, I just want to be more of a woman! And you're going to be overstimulated. (Laughter.) What is the one thing you want us to leave here with? What is the one charge or one offering? What do you want to say?\nMRS. OBAMA: It's hard to think of one thing.\nMS. WINFREY: Okay, a couple.\nMRS. OBAMA: But the work always continues. And by that I mean we're never done. We can never be complacent and think that we've arrived now as women. Because I hear this from young women. Some of you young women who aren't feeling the pains that many of our predecessors have felt -- you think, well, there aren't any problems, women's rights, we've got this all figured out, I'm already equal, I'm good -- I'm just like, oh, just you wait, you'll feel it.\nSo the work continues. And for all the young women in this room, all the young men, we can never be complacent. Because we have seen in recent times how quickly things can be taken away if we aren't vigilant, if we don't know our history, if we don't continue the work. (Applause.)\nSo my hope is that people leave here inspired and ready to do something. Again, remember, it's not what people say about you, it's what you do. So the question is what are you going to do? How are you going to be better? What are you going to change in your office, in your life, in your relationships? What are you going to change in your family dynamic? And how are you going to empower yourself with the knowledge that you need to know what work needs to be done?\nWe can't afford to be ignorant. We can't afford to be complacent. So we have to continue the work.\nMS. WINFREY: I think that's powerful. Because the question that you just offered to us is what did this mean, and what can I do with what I have received from all the stimulation, all of this energy -- what can I do, that's the question.\nYou were talking about the next phase. I heard you say that when you all are done -- we saw your new house -- when you're --\nMRS. OBAMA: We're neither confirming or denying. (Laughter.)\nMS. WINFREY: Okay. (Laughter.) When you all are done -- okay, when you're done and you move out of the White House, I've heard you say that you look forward to riding around with the windows down. You're still going to be Michelle Obama.\nMRS. OBAMA: Yeah, I know.\nMS. WINFREY: And we're going to know who you are. And it won't matter how many baseball caps you put on, we're going to say, \"Hey, Michelle.\"\nMRS. OBAMA: \"Hey, Michelle.\" (Laughter.) I get that, I see --\nMS. WINFREY: So what is the one thing that you think you really want to do? And can we go shopping?\nMRS. OBAMA: Yeah, girl, let's go shopping.\nMS. WINFREY: Let's go shopping.\nMRS. OBAMA: You and me. That will be a scene. (Laughter.) You know, it's --\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: -- go shopping!\nMRS. OBAMA: What? You want to go shopping with us? (Applause.) It's really the little things. And you feel this -- fame can be confining. And then you start missing the little things.\nWhat do I want to do? I want to walk out -- I want to open my front door without discussing it with anyone -- (laughter) -- and I want to walk out that door and just walk. (Laughter.) Just want to walk by myself, or with a semblance of feeling like I'm by myself, because that's what you learn how to do -- it's like, I'm alone with 800 people walking behind me. (Laughter.) But I've learned how to -- \"I'm by myself.\"\nBut I do, I want to walk down a street. I want to sit in a yard that is not a national park. (Laughter.) I do want to drop into Target. I want to -- I do, I want to go to Target again! (Laughter.) I've heard so many things have changed in Target! (Laughter.) I tell my friends they're going to have to give me a re-entry training for like, okay, what do you do at CVS now? How do you check out? (Laughter.) It's like I've been living in a cave.\nBut it is, it's the small things -- fresh air. In the White House you can't open a window. Sasha opened her window once -- there were calls. (Laughter.) \"Shut the window!\" It never opened again. (Laughter.) So it's the little things that you --\nMS. WINFREY: The things that we all just take for granted.\nMRS. OBAMA: Take for granted. I won't even ask for anonymity, because I think that's forever gone.\nMS. WINFREY: Yes.\nMRS. OBAMA: But one of the things that I've learned is that if you just flow into a pattern of life with people, they give you space to come in. That's happened at my kids' school and the places where I go and work out. Once people get used to the fact that you're going to be there --\nMS. WINFREY: \"It's the First Lady!\"\nMRS. OBAMA: Then it's sort of like it's over. It's like you do it a few times, it's like \"It's the First Lady.\" So I hope to find a way to seamlessly work my way into a normal life. And it's going to take time, but I'm going to slowly --\nMS. WINFREY: It's going to happen. And we're going to go shopping.\nMRS. OBAMA: We're going to shop!\nMS. WINFREY: We're going to go shopping. And you will leave here most proud of?\nMRS. OBAMA: You know, truly, I am most proud of my daughters. (Applause.) I mean, I could go down the list of my initiatives, and we have done a lot -- changed the way our kids eat. We've supported military families, we made that conversation part of the community. The work that we're doing on girls' education will be something that I do for the rest of my life. This is all work that will continue. It is there. Those problems won't be solved in my lifetime.\nBut raising two girls -- like I said at the beginning, when I sent them off in the car that first day and they were so little, and the bulletproof glass was so thick -- I thought, oh, my god, I just want them to grow up feeling a sense -- knowing that they're loved by us. Feeling confident. Feeling a sense of normalcy, feeling a sense of obligation to do something outside of themselves. Just being good people.\nAnd we just went to Malia's high school graduation, and we're watching Sasha move her way through high school. And I am very proud of those two and how they've managed this situation and how they have continued to be themselves, regular little girls just trying to figure it out. And as all mothers do, you breathe that sigh of relief that you didn't mess up your kids. And every day I cross my fingers and hope that I'm doing right by them, and I'm providing them with a good foundation so that they can be great people.\nMS. WINFREY: Thank you. (Applause.) And I just want to say, the way you've handled this office, the way you carry yourself, have presented yourself to the United States of America, and the women of the United States of America, and men of the United States of America, reminds me of a line that Maya used to say -- it's actually in the beginning of one of her books -- she says \"You make me proud to spell my name W-O-M-A-N.\" (Applause.) Michelle Obama.\nAnd I would like to add to that: Mmm, mmm, mmm. (Laughter.)\nMRS. OBAMA: Ms. Oprah Winfrey!

(Laughter.) I understand it's been a long day. But it is a pleasure to be here with all of you tonight.\nOf course, I want to start by thanking Ayo for that very kind introduction. And I have to say, she is an outstanding businesswoman because I walked in the back, I met her, we took a picture, and she said, \"You have to try one of my bean cakes.\" (Laughter.) And they were all laid out, and let me tell you, they were delicious! (Laughter.) Oh, my goodness. Good job. (Applause.) And I was hungry so it hit the spot. (Laughter.) I haven't eaten yet. But we're all so impressed with everything she has achieved and everything she will continue to achieve in the years ahead. So let's give Ayo another round of applause. (Applause.)\nI also want to recognize Evan Ryan and John Rogers for their outstanding leadership. Where is everybody? I kind of popped in. Hi, how are you? (Applause.) Yay. Thank you all for the work you've done and for being here today.\nAnd of course, I want to give a huge thank you to everyone who made the United State of Women Summit such an incredible success. Thanks to everyone -- oh, yes. (Applause.) You all worked so hard. And I just left -- Oprah and I did our conversation. I don't know -- did you see it? Sorry, I know. (Laughter.) I would give you a synopsis, but it was really good. (Laughter.)\nBut I want to thank everybody from the White House Council on Women and Girls, and everyone all across the administration who helped to plan this event, including so many folks here at the State Department. It's been an amazing day. People were energized. They may have been a little tired but we didn't feel it. And I've had a few girlfriends give me an update; they said they were inspired, they're ready to change the world. So you should be very proud of the work that you've done. I know you've spent a lot of time and energy. So again, congratulations. (Applause.)\nI want to thank all of the amazing speakers, many of whom are here with us today. I'm seeing a few people in the audience. You guys, I heard you were wonderful.\nAnd finally, thanks so much to Goldman Sachs for being such a vitally important part of this summit and for their extraordinary work to empower women across the globe through 10,000 Women. What an amazing initiative. And Ayo is a good representative. I also want to congratulate them on their new effort to help 100,000 women get the financing they need to grow their businesses.\nOver the past eight years, 10,000 Women has given so many women the business skills, the mentoring, the networks they need to blossom from struggling entrepreneurs into successful businesswomen -- oftentimes doubling, on average, the number of employees on their payrolls and quintupling their revenues.\nAnd efforts like these don't just boost women's balance sheets, they also transform the way women see themselves and how their communities see them as well. Because when we empower women economically, they come to view themselves not just as business owners, but as leaders –- as people who should have a say in the workings of their companies, but also in the affairs of their families and their communities and their countries.\nAnd as they start making their voices heard and taking their rightful place in their societies, that has a ripple effect, particularly on our young people -– both our daughters and our sons -- who receive an unambiguous message that women are not property, they are not second-class citizens, but instead they are breadwinners. They're change agents. They're people whose voices and contributions matter. (Applause.) Absolutely.\nAnd really, more than anything else, that is the idea behind the work that I've been doing as First Lady through Let Girls Learn to help adolescent girls worldwide go to school. Because I know what these girls have to offer -- we all know. In my travels as First Lady, I have met so many amazing young women, and I've seen firsthand how smart and how strong and determined they are to fulfill their promise.\nBut as we all know, so often they face such overwhelming obstacles to getting an education -- poverty, opposition from their families, cultural practices like female genital mutilation and forced child marriage. And girls in conflict situations face barriers that many of us couldn't even begin to imagine -- unbearable instability, horrific violence, the loss of loved ones –- barriers that often make it nearly impossible for them to get the education they need.\nBut we all know that whether or not these girls go to school –- not just primary school, but secondary school and beyond -- I want to emphasize that that will absolutely determine how they grow up, who they'll be -- whether they'll grow up healthy. Whether they can provide for themselves and their kids. Whether they can take advantage of programs like 10,000 Women and chart their own course in the world.\nAnd that's why, through Let Girls Learn, the U.S. government has been investing in girls across the globe -- providing scholarships and leadership training, building bathrooms for girls at school, taking on issues like female genital mutilation and forced child marriage, and so much more. And since we launched Let Girls Learn, dozens of major companies and organizations have come forward to support this work. And tonight, I am thrilled to announce a number of amazing, new commitments from private and nonprofit sectors. These are big, bold commitments that will have a real impact on the girls around the world that we're trying to help\nFor example, CARE -- we all know CARE. It's a wonderful organization that fights global poverty. They're going to be providing intensive schooling for girls –- yay for CARE -- (applause) -- including working with girls in conflict areas who dropped out of primary school to help them catch up and complete secondary school and even college.\nThe International Rescue Committee will be expanding their education programs to reach hundreds of thousands of girls in conflict countries. Oracle will be funding STEM education efforts in Egypt -- yes! (Applause.) And that includes summer computer camps and girls' codefests, and all that cool kind of stuff.\nThe Hershey Company is working with the Peace Corps to fund girls' education programs broadly, and we're thrilled to have them on board. American Airlines is supporting girls' education efforts through UNICEF. PayPal is featuring Let Girls Learn in its back-to-school charitable-giving campaign -- yay. AOL is launching a Let Girls Build challenge to inspire girls here in the U.S. to use technology to close the education gap for girls around the world. And the Just Like My Child Foundation will be helping 10,000 girls in Uganda stay in school by educating them about issues that lead girls to drop out –- things like sexual violence, HIV, early pregnancy.\nNow, altogether, these commitments represent more than $20 million of investment in the lives of adolescent girls across the globe. And I think we should give them all a round of applause. (Applause.) This is the kind of wonderful work we can do and be inspired by. These new efforts will have a ripple effect far beyond the girls who are impacted directly. Because we've seen time and again that when educated girls grow into successful women, they don't just pat themselves on the back and enjoy the fruits of their successes -- no, as they should, they reach back and they help other women and girls along after them.\nAnd I could give you so many examples to illustrate this point, but tonight, I'm going to share just one. Of course, we've heard Ayo's story, but the story -- there's another story of a woman who is here with us tonight at this dinner, Ciiru Waithaka. Ciiru, where are you? Because I didn't get a chance to meet you. Hi, sweetie, how are you? (Applause.) You go, girl! (Laughter.) Ciiru is from Kenya. So we're family. (Applause.)\nCiiru started a business called FunKidz -- with a \"Z\" -- to create furniture, accessories and educational tools for children that are based on African stories. Yes, that's you! (Laughter.) But while there was plenty of demand for her products, she found that as a woman, it was hard for her to get the capital she needed to meet that demand. But then, thanks to a business loan that 10,000 Women provided, Cirru was able to double her production capacity, hire new employees and start selling her products around the world.\nAnd Ciiru didn't just sit back and enjoy her success. Instead, she stepped up and founded a program for kids from struggling families to teach them about innovation and technology, and she's already reached more than 350 children. So there you go. There you go. (Applause.) Ciiru, come up here! Come up here! (Applause.) This is worth stopping for a second. (Applause.) (A photo is taken.)\nAs we've seen time and again, women and girls who are out there working, they are truly force multipliers, spreading opportunity through their families and communities -– and not just by creating programs and nonprofit organizations, not just by hiring other women, but also by serving as role models themselves. And when girls –- and boys -– across the globe see their mothers and grandmothers and their aunts and their sisters creating their own products, and running businesses to put those products out into the world, and taking control of their own destinies with the money they earn -- well, that's a whole new model of what it means to be a woman. And it's a whole new paradigm for these kids to grow up in.\nThat is the power of the dreams that it will take for our kids to embrace themselves and to do great things in the world. And I can't even begin to imagine the impact that so many of you will have as you continue your efforts to lift up women and girls here in America and around the world. And I'm excited about the impact that we can have together through Let Girls Learn as we keep expanding our efforts to more villages, to more schools and more girls who are hungry to learn and bursting with promise.\nBecause while my time as First Lady may soon be coming to -- I shouldn't say \"may,\" it is soon coming to -- (laughter) -- let's not get that confused. (Laughter.) When it comes to the issue of global girls' education, believe me, I am just getting started. (Applause.) I am so excited to continue working on this issue not just for the next seven months as First Lady, but for the rest of my life. And it's going to be good work, because there are a lot of good partners in this room. And I am so looking forward to really diving in.\nAnd I hope that every single one of you here will join me in this work if you haven't already. If you're a leader in a company, I hope you will make girls' education a priority in your philanthropic efforts, like so many of the companies have done here tonight. If you're a nonprofit organization, I hope that you'll get engaged in this issue, or expand the work that you're already doing, or find others to join in.\nAnd as powerful, influential individuals -- who all of you are in this room -- we need every single one of you out there serving as champions for these girls and raising awareness about this issue all across the country and around the world. Your voices and your platform can make such a transformational difference for these amazing young girls. And many of us have met these girls. We have spent time with them. We have seen them fighting for every bit of opportunity that they have. They don't take anything for granted. And they deserve our help.\nAnd tonight, I want to end as I started –- really by thanking you, thanking you for helping to lead this movement. Because many of you were doing this long before anybody knew anything about Michelle Obama. Thank you for the work that you're doing for girls across the globe. Thank you for devoting your resources and your expertise and your passion to help women and girls pursue their ambitions and fulfill their dreams.\nI am always inspired when I come into a room like this, and when I meet these amazing women. I'm inspired by everything you all achieve. And I can't wait to see everything that we'll continue to achieve in the years ahead.\nSo thank you all. Enjoy your dinner, you've earned it. Are you eating? (Laughter.) Good for you. You all, thank you so much. Have a great night.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=121447", "text": "WASHINGTON, DC – Today, as Congress continues to consider legislation related to the prescription opioid and heroin epidemic, the White House released the estimated amount of funding each State could qualify for under the new cooperative agreements proposed in the President's Budget to expand access to opioid treatment, particularly medication-assisted treatment. Under the President's $1.1 billion proposal to help Americans with opioid use disorders who want treatment get the help they need, States would receive funding based on the severity of the epidemic in their communities and the strength of their strategy to respond to it. The final funding amounts will depend on these factors and Congressional action.\nThe President has made clear that addressing this epidemic is a priority for his Administration. Without the resources necessary to prevent opioid use disorders and increase access to treatment and recovery services, pending legislation this year would do little to help the thousands of Americans struggling with addiction get the treatment they urgently need.\nThe President's Budget builds on  current Administration strategies to prevent drug use, pursue targeted drug enforcement activities, improve prescribing practices for pain medication, increase access to treatment, work to reduce overdose deaths, and support the millions of Americans in recovery.\nFor example:\no  The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration released a proposed rule to expand access to opioid treatment by increasing the number of patients physicians can treat with the opioid use disorder treatment medication buprenorphine.\no  The President signed a memorandum requiring Federal Departments to provide training on appropriate opioid prescribing to Federal health care professionals and requiring Departments to develop plans to address barriers to opioid use disorder treatment in Federal programs.\no  The Health Resources and Services Administration released $94 million in new funding to 271 Community Health Centers across the country to increase substance use disorder treatment services, with a specific focus on expanding medication-assisted treatment of opioid use disorders in underserved communities.\no  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a new Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain. Following its release, hundreds of medical, nursing and pharmacy schools have committed to prescriber training for their students.\no  CDC expanded the Prescription Drug Overdose program to support prevention efforts in 29 States to help end the prescription drug overdose epidemic.\no  The Office of National Drug Control Policy expanded its heroin initiative among regional High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTAs) by adding Ohio and Michigan to the effort. These States join the Appalachia, New England, Philadelphia/Camden, New York/New Jersey, and Washington/Baltimore HIDTAs in accelerating local partnerships between law enforcement and their counterparts in public health to combat heroin use and overdose.\no  The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) held its 11th National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day in April, providing a safe, convenient, and responsible way of disposing of unneeded prescription drugs. Millions of pounds of medication have been collected over the last ten Take Back Days. Local communities are also establishing ongoing drug take-back programs.\nThe State-by-State breakdown of the President's requested funding can be found here:  https://www.whitehouse.gov/factsheets-prescription-opioid-abuse-and-heroin-use", "timestamp": "2016-06-14", "title": "Press Release - White House Releases Estimated State Opioid Treatment Funding Levels Under President's Budget Proposal"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "The President spoke at 12:18 p.m. in the Cash Room. In his remarks, he referred to Omar Mateen, suspected gunman in the terrorist attack at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, FL, on June 12; Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph F. Dunford, Jr., USMC; Shakir Waheib, an ISIL operative also known as Abu Wahib who was killed in a U.S. airstrike in Anbar Province, Iraq, on May 6; a U.S. citizen and ISIL defector known publicly as \"Mo\"; President Bashar al-Asad of Syria; Donald J. Trump, chairman and president, Trump Organization, in his capacity as a Republican Presidential candidate; and Nidal M. Hasan, a former Army psychiatrist who was convicted in the shootings at Fort Hood, TX, on November 5, 2009. He also referred to the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) of Pakistan.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117892", "text": "I just met with my National Security Council as part of our regular effort to review and intensify our campaign to destroy the terrorist group ISIL. Our meeting was planned before the terrible attack in Orlando. But obviously, that tragedy—the awful loss of life—shaped much of our work today. In all of our efforts, foremost in our minds is the loss and the grief of the people of Orlando—those who died, those who are still recovering, the families who have seen their loved ones harmed, the friends of ours who are lesbian and gay and bisexual and transgender who were targeted. I want to remind them that they are not alone. The American people and our allies and friends all over the world, stand with you and are thinking about you and are praying for you.\nAs Director Comey has said, we currently do not have any information to indicate that a foreign terrorist group directed the attack in Orlando. It is increasingly clear, however, that the killer took in extremist information and propaganda over the Internet. He appears to have been an angry, disturbed, unstable young man who became radicalized. As we know all too well, terrorist groups like ISIL have called on people around the world and here in the United States to attack innocent civilians. Their propaganda, their videos, their postings are pervasive and more easily accessible than we want. This individual appears to have absorbed some of that. And during his killing spree, the shooter in Orlando pledged allegiance to ISIL.\nAs I've said before, these lone actors or small cells of terrorists are very hard to detect and very hard to prevent. But across our government, at every level—Federal, State, and local, military and civilian—we are doing everything in our power to stop these kinds of attacks. We work to succeed a hundred percent of the time. An attacker, as we saw in Orlando, only has to succeed once. Our extraordinary personnel—our intelligence, our military, our homeland security, our law enforcement—have prevented many attacks and saved many lives. And we can never thank them enough. But we are all sobered by the fact that, despite the extraordinary, hard work, something like Orlando can occur.\nIn our meeting today, Director Comey updated us on the investigation in Orlando. Secretary Johnson reviewed the measures we continue to take on behalf of our homeland security. Secretary Carter and Chairman Dunford reviewed the military campaign against ISIL. And I want to thank Secretary Lew and his team here at Treasury for hosting us and for their tireless efforts to cut off the money that ISIL relies on to fund its terror network.\nAt the outset, I want to reiterate our objective in this fight. Our mission is to destroy ISIL. Since I last updated the American people on our campaign 2 months ago, we've seen that this continues to be a difficult fight, but we are making significant progress. Over the past 2 months, I've authorized a series of steps to ratchet up our fight against ISIL: additional U.S. personnel, including special forces, in Syria to assist local forces battling ISIL there; additional advisers to work more closely with Iraqi security forces and additional assets, including attack helicopters; and additional support for local forces in northern Iraq. Our aircraft continue to launch from the USS Harry Truman, now in the Mediterranean. Our B-52 bombers are hitting ISIL with precision strikes. Targets are being identified and hit even more quickly, so far, 13,000 airstrikes. So this campaign at this stage is firing on all cylinders. And as a result, ISIL is under more pressure than ever before. ISIL continues to lose key leaders. This includes Salman Abu Shahib, the senior military leader in Mosul; Abu Sa'ad al-Sudani, who plotted external attacks; Shakir Waheib, ISIL's military leader in Iraq's Anbar Province; and Maher al-Bilawi, the top ISIL commander in Fallujah. So far, we've taken out more than 120 top ISIL leaders and commanders. And our message is clear: If you target America and our allies, you will not be safe. You will never be safe.\nISIL continues to lose ground in Iraq. In the past 2 months, local forces in Iraq, with coalition support, have liberated the western town of Rutbah and have also pushed up the Euphrates River Valley, liberating the strategic town of Hit and breaking the ISIL siege of Haditha. Iraqi forces have surrounded Fallujah and begun to move into the city. Meanwhile, in the north, Iraqi forces continue to push up the Tigris River Valley, making gains around Makhmour and now preparing to tighten the noose around ISIL in Mosul. All told, ISIL has now lost nearly half of the populated territory that it once controlled in Iraq, and it will lose more.\nISIL continues to lose ground in Syria as well. Assisted by our special operations forces, a coalition of local forces is now pressuring the key town of Manbij, which means the noose is tightening around ISIL in Raqqa as well. In short, our coalition continues to be on offense. ISIL is on defense. And it's now been a full year since ISIL has been able to mount a major successful offensive operation in either Syria or Iraq.\nAs ISIL continues to lose territory, it also continues to lose the money that it is—that is its lifeblood. As a result of our strikes against its oil infrastructure and supply lines, we believe that we've cut ISIL's revenue from oil by millions of dollars per month. In destroying the storage sites where they keep their cash, we've deprived ISIL of many millions more.\nThanks to the great work of Secretary Lew and many others here today—and working with nations and financial institutions around the world—ISIL is now effectively cut off from the international financial system. Cutting off ISIL's money may not be as dramatic as military strikes, but it is critically important. And we're seeing the results. ISIL's cash reserves are down. It has had to cut salaries for its fighters. It's resorting to more extortion of those trapped in its grip. And by ISIL's own admission, some of its own leaders have been caught stealing cash and gold. Once again, ISIL's true nature has been revealed: These are not religious warriors, they are thugs, and they are thieves.\nIn continuing to push on this front, I wanted to mention that it is critical for our friends in the Senate to confirm Adam Szubin, my nominee for Under Secretary of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. Adam has served in Democratic and Republican administrations. Everyone agrees he's eminently qualified. He has been working on these kinds of issues for years. It's now been more than a year since I nominated him—more than 420 days—and he still has not been given a full vote. There is no good reason for it. It is inexcusable. So it's time for the Senate to do its job, put our national security first, and have a vote on Adam Szubin that can lead our financial fight against ISIL and help keep our country safe.\nISIL's ranks are shrinking as well. Their morale is sinking. As one defender—as one defector said, ISIL \"is not bringing Islam to the world, and people need to know that.\" Thanks to international efforts, the flow of foreign fighters—including from America to Syria and Iraq—has plummeted. In fact, our intelligence community now assesses that the ranks of ISIL fighters has been reduced to the lowest levels in more than 2½ years. Even as we continue to destroy ISIL militarily, we're addressing the larger forces that have allowed these terrorists to gain traction in parts of the world. With regard to Iraq, this means helping Iraqis stabilize liberated communities and promote inclusive governance so ISIL cannot return.\nWith regard to Syria, it means our continued support for the fragile cessation of hostilities there. The cessation of hostilities has not stopped all or even most of the hardship on the Syrian people, the hardship on civilians. And the Asad regime has been the principal culprit in violating the cessation of hostilities. ISIL and al-Nusra, which is Al Qaida's affiliate in Syria, also continue to terrorize Syrians. But as fragile and incomplete as the cessation is, it has saved lives and it has allowed the delivery of some lifesaving aid to Syrians who are in desperate need. And as difficult as it is, we will continue to push for a political process that can end the civil war and result in a transition away from Asad.\nBeyond Syria and Libya—beyond Syria and Iraq, ISIL is also losing ground in Libya. Forces of the Libyan unity Government are going after ISIL in their stronghold in Sirte. And we'll continue to assist the new Libyan Government as it works to secure its country.\nLastly, here at home, if we really want to help law enforcement protect Americans from homegrown extremists, the kind of tragedies that occurred at San Bernardino and that now have occurred in Orlando, there is a meaningful way to do that. We have to make it harder for people who want to kill Americans to get their hands on weapons of war that let them kill dozens of innocents. It is absolutely true, we cannot prevent every tragedy. But we know that, consistent with the Second Amendment, there are common-sense steps that could reduce gun violence and could reduce the lethality of somebody who intends to do other people harm. We should give ATF the resources they need to enforce the gun laws that we already have. People with possible ties to terrorism who aren't allowed on a plane shouldn't be allowed to buy a gun.\nEnough talking about being tough on terrorism. Actually be tough on terrorism, and stop making it easy as possible for terrorists to buy assault weapons. Reinstate the assault weapons ban. Make it harder for terrorists to use these weapons to kill us. Otherwise, despite extraordinary efforts across our Government—by local law enforcement, by our intelligence agencies, by our military—despite all the sacrifices that folks make, these kinds of events are going to keep on happening. And the weapons are only going to get more powerful.\nAnd let me make a final point. For a while now, the main contribution of some of my friends on the other side of the aisle have made in the fight against ISIL is to criticize this administration and me for not using the phrase \"radical Islam.\" That's the key, they tell us. We can't beat ISIL unless we call them \"radical Islamists.\" What exactly would using this label accomplish? What exactly would it change? Would it make ISIL less committed to trying to kill Americans? Would it bring in more allies? Is there a military strategy that is served by this? The answer is none of the above. Calling a threat by a different name does not make it go away. This is a political distraction. Since before I was President, I've been clear about how extremist groups have perverted Islam to justify terrorism. As President, I have repeatedly called on our Muslim friends and allies at home and around the world to work with us to reject this twisted interpretation of one of the world's great religions.\nThere has not been a moment in my 7½ years as President where we have not been able to pursue a strategy because we didn't use the label \"radical Islam.\" Not once has an adviser of mine said, man, if we really use that phrase, we're going to turn this whole thing around. Not once. So if someone seriously thinks that we don't know who we're fighting, if there's anyone out there who thinks we're confused about who our enemies are, that would come as a surprise to the thousands of terrorists who we've taken off the battlefield.\nIf the implication is that those of us up here and the thousands of people around the country and around the world who are working to defeat ISIL aren't taking the fight seriously, that would come as a surprise to those who have spent these last 7½ years dismantling Al Qaida in the FATA, for example, including the men and women in uniform who put their lives at risk and the special forces that I ordered to get bin Laden and are now on the ground in Iraq and in Syria. They know full well who the enemy is. So do the intelligence and law enforcement officers who spend countless hours disrupting plots and protecting all Americans, including politicians who tweet and appear on cable news shows. They know who the nature of the enemy is.\nSo there's no magic to the phrase \"radical Islam.\" It's a political talking point; it's not a strategy. And the reason I am careful about how I describe this threat has nothing to do with political correctness and everything to do with actually defeating extremism. Groups like ISIL and Al Qaida want to make this war a war between Islam and America or between Islam and the West. They want to claim that they are the true leaders of over a billion Muslims around the world who reject their crazy notions. They want us to validate them by implying that they speak for those billion-plus people; that they speak for Islam. That's their propaganda. That's how they recruit. And if we fall into the trap of painting all Muslims with a broad brush and imply that we are at war with an entire religion, then we're doing the terrorists' work for them.\nNow, up until this point, this argument about labels has mostly just been partisan rhetoric. And sadly, we've all become accustomed to that kind of partisanship, even when it involves the fight against these extremist groups. And that kind of yapping has not prevented folks across government from doing their jobs, from sacrificing and working really hard to protect the American people.\nBut we are now seeing how dangerous this kind of mindset and this kind of thinking can be. We're starting to see where this kind of rhetoric and loose talk and sloppiness about who exactly we're fighting, where this can lead us. We now have proposals from the presumptive Republican nominee for President of the United States to bar all Muslims from emigrating to America. We hear language that singles out immigrants and suggests entire religious communities are complicit in violence. Where does this stop? The Orlando killer, one of the San Bernardino killers, the Fort Hood killer—they were all U.S. citizens.\nAre we going to start treating all Muslim Americans differently? Are we going to start subjecting them to special surveillance? Are we going to start discriminating against them because of their faith? We've heard these suggestions during the course of this campaign. Do Republican officials actually agree with this? Because that's not the America we want. It doesn't reflect our democratic ideals. It won't make us more safe, it will make us less safe, fueling ISIL's notion that the West hates Muslims, making young Muslims in this country and around the world feel like no matter what they do, they're going to be under suspicion and under attack. It makes Muslim Americans feel like their Government is betraying them. It betrays the very values America stands for.\nWe've gone through moments in our history before when we acted out of fear, and we came to regret it. We've seen our government mistreat our fellow citizens. And it has been a shameful part of our history. This is a country founded on basic freedoms, including freedom of religion. We don't have religious tests here. Our Founders, our Constitution, our Bill of Rights are clear about that. And if we ever abandon those values, we would not only make it a lot easier to radicalize people here and around the world, but we would have betrayed the very things we are trying to protect—the pluralism and the openness, our rule of law, our civil liberties—the very things that make this country great, the very things that make us exceptional. And then, the terrorists would have won. And we cannot let that happen. I will not let that happen.\nTwo weeks ago, I was at the commencement ceremony at the Air Force Academy. And it could not have been more inspiring to see these young people stepping up, dedicated to serve and protect this country. And part of what was inspiring was the incredible diversity of these cadets. We saw cadets who are straight applauding classmates who were openly gay. We saw cadets born here in America applauding classmates who are immigrants and love this country so much they decided they wanted to be part of our Armed Forces. We saw cadets and families of all religions applaud cadets who are proud, patriotic Muslim Americans serving their country in uniform, ready to lay their lives on the line to protect you and to protect me. We saw male cadets applauding for female classmates who can now serve in combat positions. That's the American military. That's America: one team, one Nation. Those are the values that ISIL is trying to destroy, and we shouldn't help them do it.\nOur diversity and our respect for one another, our drawing on the talents of everybody in this country, our making sure that we are treating everybody fairly—that we're not judging people on the basis of what faith they are or what race they are or what ethnicity they are or what their sexual orientation is—that's what makes this country great. That's the spirit we see in Orlando. That's the unity and resolve that will allow us to defeat ISIL. That's what will preserve our values and our ideals that define us as Americans. That's how we're going to defend this Nation, and that's how we're going to defend our way of life.\nThank you very much.", "timestamp": "2016-06-14", "title": "Remarks on United States Strategy To Counter the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) Terrorist Organization at the Department of the Treasury"}

Hello, everybody! Can you please give it up again for Mikaila? What an amazing young lady. I will be back on the job market in 7 months, so I hope she is hiring. [Laughter]\nI was just told backstage, when she was asked to introduce me, there were some folks who were organizing this amazing event that said, is she going to feel a little nervous speaking in front of 5,000 people? And so they asked her, and she said, oh, no, I just spoke to 11,000 last week. [Laughter] So she was—we were looking backstage—she was on her tippy-toes with her entrepreneurial self. [Laughter]\nSo I know you're really here to see Michelle. Or Oprah. Actually, they're together, so you're here to see both of them. [Laughter] I cannot compete with them.\nAudience members. We love you, Michelle.\nThe President. [Laughter] But I did want to stop by and make one thing very clear: I may be a little grayer than I was 8 years ago, but this is what a feminist looks like. Of course, in my household, there's no choice. [Laughter]\nIt is great to be with so many friends. One of my first acts as President was to establish the White House Council on Women and Girls, led by Tina Tchen and Valerie Jarrett, and they've worked with a lot of you very closely. We're so appreciative of those of you who've helped not just make this event possible, but have guided a lot of our thinking across our administration.\nWe've got some outstanding Members of Congress, of course, including my dear friend and one of the finest Speakers we've ever had and hope to soon have again, Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi. And I want to thank all of you who worked so hard to make this event happen. Because this is an opportunity to reflect on how far we've come, and why it is we've got to keep going.\nIt was almost a hundred years ago that Alice Paul and her fellow suffragists were arrested for picketing outside the White House for the right to vote. Today, women make up more than half of the electorate. For the first time in history, a woman is a major party's presumptive Presidential nominee. And we are here at the first-ever White House Summit on the United State of Women.\nBecause of all of you, over the past 7 years, we have significantly improved the lives of women and girls not just here at home, but around the world. And I could not be prouder of what we've accomplished. I want to talk about why it matters and why we've got to do more.\nSome of you may know that on Friday, my older daughter Malia graduated from high school. And I sat in the back and wore dark glasses. [Laughter] And only cried once, but it was—[laughter]—I made this weird sound because I was choking back tears. [Laughter]\n[At this point, the President made a crying sound.]\nAnd people looked at me; the people sitting in front of us turned back. And then, I suppressed it. [Laughter] But I was thinking about how she is graduating at this extraordinary time for women in America. The year I was born, in 1961, women made up less than 40 percent of college students. Today, you earn almost 60 percent of college degrees, make up roughly half of the workforce. Back then, the pill was still illegal in some States. And today, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, birth control is free. In the old days, women actually needed a husband to open a credit card. Today, more women are choosing to be single, and all Americans are able to marry whoever they love.\nFifty-four years ago, Katherine Johnson did the behind-the-scenes math to put a man on—to put a man in orbit. Today, almost 60 women have blasted into space themselves. When I was growing up, fewer than 300,000 girls played high school sports. Today, because of title IX, more than 3 million girls are on the field. And women are leading America at every level of society, from Hollywood to Silicon Valley, from the C-suite to the Federal bench to the Federal Reserve.\nAnd that is progress. It's real, and we have to celebrate it, but we also have to remember that progress is not inevitable. It's the result of decades of slow, tireless, often frustrating and unheralded work by people like Dorothy Pitman Hughes and Gloria Steinem, who is here today, people who opened our eyes to the discrimination, both subtle and overt, that women face; people like Pauli Murray and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who insisted on equal justice under the law; people like Wilma Mankiller and Patsy Mink, who redefined what leadership looks like; and yes, people like Hillary Clinton who have raised the expectations of our daughters—and our sons—for what is possible.\nIn other words, our progress has been the result of countless ordinary women and men whose names will never be written into the history books or chiseled on monuments, but who dedicated their lives to ensuring that America lives up to its promise of liberty and justice for all.\nAnd what's also true is, is that despite all that incredible progress, we are living at a time of great change, a time where people are economically anxious. Unemployment has dropped below 5 percent. Wages are growing again. But while we've made progress in narrowing the gap between rich and poor, it is still too big and the trend lines, because of globalization and automation, are still upon us.\nYou hear politicians peddle the fiction that blocking immigrants or cutting off trade or quote, unquote, big Government are all to blame, but we know what the causes are. The rise of global competition, the weakening of the labor movement and participation in unions, the automation of more jobs, the race of technology—all these trends have the potential of leaving workers behind. They let a few at the top do even better. And we see some of those divisions not just between groups, but within groups. There are women who have never had more opportunity, but there are a lot of women who are still stuck in the toughest of economic circumstances.\nThere is an important reason that so many working families feel like the system is rigged, and it's because the economy hasn't caught up to some of the enormous changes that have transformed America over the past 50 years. Those days when the average family was a dad who went to work every day and a mom who stayed at home and did all the unpaid labor, that's not what our economy looks like anymore. Household and work arrangements come in all shapes and all combinations, and yet our workplace policies still look like they're straight out of \"Mad Men.\" I will tell you, a lot of the problems that cross my desk are really hard to solve. If they end up on my desk, it's because other people couldn't solve them. [Laughter] But this issue of how we support working families, the policies that we could put in place that would make a meaningful difference, here we actually have solutions right in front of us. Just as we know what the problems are, we know what some of the solutions are.\nWe need equal pay for equal work. We need paid family and sick leave. We need affordable childcare. We've got to raise the minimum wage. If we're truly a nation of family values, we wouldn't put up with the fact that many women can't even get a paid day off to give birth. We should guarantee paid maternity leave and paid paternity leave too. That's how you value families. That's how employers retain great workers. And it's good for women, because when childcare falls disproportionately on mothers, as it often does, it makes it that much harder to advance in their careers.\nSo we've got to retool our system so that modern families and modern businesses can thrive. And let me be clear, this is not about big Government or expanding some fictional welfare-and-food-stamp state or the 47 percent mooching off the Government. It is accounting for the realities of how people live now, today: the necessities of a 21st-century economy.\nWe've gotten some things done through executive actions. When we had a cooperative Congress, we got a whole lot more done. So far, a lot of Republicans in Congress have been unwilling to act on these agenda items that I just mentioned. But we just keep on looking for ways to get stuff done. They keep on waiting for this whole lame duck thing to happen. I don't—[laughter]. Let me tell you, it will happen as soon as I've elected a really good successor to carry on our policies. But until then, we're working pretty hard. [Laughter]\nBut we've made progress. The first bill I signed into law was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. And I know some of you have seen Lilly here today. We passed the Affordable Care Act to give more Americans the security of health care coverage so that not only people without health insurance could finally get it, but people who had health insurance were treated fairly so that, for example, no insurer could charge you more just for being a woman. Dry cleaners are next. [Laughter] Valerie, we need to work on that, don't we? [Laughter] Those little blouses of yours. [Laughter] I don't know why they charge so much. [Laughter]\nSo my administration has taken what action that we can. And we've strengthened equal pay protections and paid sick leave for Federal contractors, enhanced work flexibility for all Federal employees, raised the minimum wage for Federal contract workers, extended overtime pay protections to over 4 million workers across the country. We try to set a good example, providing my staff with 12 weeks of paid parental leave. And by the way, we've been having a lot of babies, I notice, in the White House—[laughter]—which I'm happy about. I love babies. They bring them into the Oval Office; they make me feel good. [Laughter]\nThis is the right thing to do; it's the smart thing to do. And the great news is, we're not the only ones doing it. You've got cities and States and businesses across the country that are adjusting to meet the needs of today's workers. In fact, today we can announce that 28 of America's leading businesses are committed to closing the gender pay gap. We should encourage more businesses to join them. We should shop and frequent those companies that are doing the right thing because the truth is, most folks agree with each other on this. We don't have to have Congress agree with us, we can go ahead and make progress without waiting for them. They'll catch up eventually. They're usually a lagging indicator on these issues. [Laughter]\nIf we really want workplace policies that work for everybody, I will say, though, it would help if we had more women in Congress. It would help if we had more women in the corner suite. I have a corner suite, by the way. [Laughter] Just making that connection for you. [Laughter]\nIf we are going to truly change our policies and our politics, then we're also going to have to change something else though. We're going to have to be honest with ourselves. We're going to have to change something else. We're going to have to change the way we see ourselves. And this is happening already, but I want us to be more intentional about it. I know I'm preaching to the choir here, but we're still boxed in by stereotypes about how men and women should behave.\nAs the great Shirley Chisholm once said, \"The emotional, sexual, and psychological stereotyping of females begin when the doctor says, 'It's a girl.'\" And that has consequences for all of us, whether we're men or women, Black, White, gay, straight, transgender, or otherwise.\nWe need to keep changing the attitude that raises our girls to be demure and our boys to be assertive, that criticizes our daughters for speaking out and our sons for shedding a tear. We need to change the attitude that punishes women for their sexuality, but gives men a pat on the back for theirs. We need to change an Internet where women are routinely harassed and threatened when they go online. We need to keep changing the attitude that congratulates men for changing a diaper, stigmatizes full-time dads, penalizes working moms. We need to keep changing the attitude that prioritizes being confident, competitive, and ambitious in the workplace, unless you're a woman.\nWe need to keep changing a culture that shines a particularly unforgiving light on women and girls of color. About how they look, about how they feel, about what they should or should not do. Michelle will talk about this a little bit. She's talked about this. Despite her extraordinary achievements and success, the fact that she is—she is an American original, she is unique, but she still had times where she's had doubts, where she's had to worry whether she was acting the right way or looking the right way or whether she was being too assertive or too angry. You remember that?\nSo we've been working to change these stereotypes. That's why we're encouraging more girls to pursue their love for science and technology and engineering and math. That's why we've highlighted women trailblazers and encouraged media to depict more examples of women in STEM, because it's hard to be what you can't see. It's why we've launched a movement of women and men to fight campus sexual assault, because it's on all of us to stop it.\nIt's why we're changing the culture in our military, from the top down, to take this issue seriously. It's why we're working with communities and businesses and foundations to rethink workplace policies and fund women entrepreneurs and expand female leadership and create more opportunities for girls and women of color. Everybody has a role to play in America.\nAnd even as we make progress at home, we look abroad and we know that any country that oppresses half the population—that doesn't let them go to school or work and does not give them control over their own bodies—that's a society that will not work over the long term. It will not reach its potential. And this is a national security issue. As Commander in Chief, I've seen how the ideology that leads Boko Haram to kidnap schoolgirls and leads ISIL to enslave and rape women is the same ideology that leads to instability and violence and terrorism. There's a connection there. And so we need to be clear about what we're about, what we stand for. Because organizations and ideologies that are repressive and cultivate violence and anger, those are—there's a running thread, that is dangerous and poses a threat to pluralism and tolerance and openness.\nSo I've made advancing gender equality a foreign policy priority. And we've implemented a comprehensive strategy to end gender-based violence around the world, from prevention, to treating survivors, to bringing perpetrators to justice. And we're helping to remove barriers that prevent women from participating fully in their societies. We're empowering the next generation of women by investing in adolescent girls and advancing the \"Let Girls Learn\" initiative to get 62 million girls into school.\nThis is the future that we're building, one where all of us here at home and around the world are free to live out our dreams; where our children's aspirations aren't segregated into pink and blue; where working families don't have to choose between taking care of a loved one and earning a paycheck; where women and girls, no matter where they live, are free from fear of violence, including gun violence; where hatred against women or hatred against the LGBT community that doesn't neatly fit into some predetermined notions of how people should be or how they love, where that is no longer the operative rule in any society; a future where women lead half our businesses, make up half of Congress; where our girls know they can hold any job and run any company and compete on any field and perform on any stage and science the heck out of any challenge. That's the future we're trying to build.\nAnd the good news is, this is the future my daughters' generation already believes in. They believe every door is open to them. They're not engaging in any kind of self-censorship. They're not going to hold themselves back. It couldn't occur to them that they couldn't rise to the top of whatever field they choose. It wouldn't occur to them not to accept all people, no matter how they identify or who they love. They think discrimination is for losers. They think it's weird that we haven't already had a woman President. They expect the world to catch up to them.\nThey expect the world to catch up to them, and I have no doubt that we will. It will take leadership. It will take the right policies. It's going to take creating more opportunities. It requires us telling each other and our children the right stories, because the stories we tell matter.\nWe admire the men who shaped our country and rightfully so, the men we see as heroes—from Alexander Hamilton to Muhammad Ali—for their confidence and their courage in believing they could change our Nation that—this idea of self-creation, that there's nothing holding us back. In them, we see America itself, constantly reinventing itself, fearless, looking out over the horizon at the next frontier.\nBut our country is not just all about the Benjamins, it's about the Tubmans too. We need all our young people to know that Clara Barton and Lucretia Mott and Sojourner Truth and Eleanor Roosevelt and Dorothy Height, those aren't just for Women's History Month. They're the authors of our history, women who shaped our destiny. They need to know that.\nA woman did not magically appear on a space shuttle. It took Sally Ride's relentless commitment, Mae Jemison's boundless courage, to shatter that glass ceiling. A group of California farmworkers, they weren't just handed their rights. It took Dolores Huerta organizing and mobilizing, fighting for the dignity and justice they deserved. Rosa Parks wasn't simply a tired seamstress who sat down by accident, she was a civil rights leader with the eye of a strategist and the heart of a warrior. She had the confidence to board on that bus, the courage to risk her own life and liberty for the sake of ours. History did not fall into her lap, she seized that moral arc and she bent it with her bare hands in the direction of justice.\nThat's the story that's still being written, today, by our modern day heroes like Nancy Pelosi or Sonia Sotomayor or Billie Jean King or Laverne Cox or Sheryl Sandberg or Oprah Winfrey or Mikaila Ulmer or Michelle Obama, the countless ordinary people every day who are bringing us closer to our highest ideals. That's the story we're going to keep on telling, so our girls see that they, too, are America: confident and courageous and, in the words of Audre Lorde, \"deliberate and afraid of nothing.\"\nThat's the country we love, and I've never been optimistic—as optimistic as I am now that we're going to create a country where everybody, no matter who they are or what they look like or where they come from or who they love, can make of their lives what they will. And together, we can build a world that's more just and more prosperous and more free. That's the job for all of us.\nGod bless you. God bless the United States of America. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2016-06-14", "title": "Remarks at the United State of Women Summit"}

I am also pleased to transmit my written approval, authorization, and determination concerning the Agreement, and an unclassified Nuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement (NPAS) concerning the proposed Agreement. (In accordance with section 123 of the Act, as amended by Title XII of the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-277), a classified annex to the NPAS, prepared by the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, summarizing relevant classified information, will be submitted to the Congress separately.) The joint memorandum submitted to me by the Secretaries of State and Energy and a letter from the Chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission stating the views of the Commission are also enclosed. An addendum to the NPAS containing a comprehensive analysis of Norway's export control system with respect to nuclear-related matters, including interactions with other countries of proliferation concern and the actual or suspected nuclear, dual-use, or missile-related transfers to such countries, pursuant to section 102A(w) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3024(w)), is being submitted separately by the Director of National Intelligence.\nThe proposed Agreement has been negotiated in accordance with the Act and other applicable law. In my judgment, it meets all applicable statutory requirements and will advance the nonproliferation and other foreign policy interests of the United States.\nThe proposed Agreement contains all the provisions required by section 123 a. of the Act, and provides a comprehensive framework for peaceful nuclear cooperation with Norway based on a mutual commitment to nuclear nonproliferation. It would permit the transfer of unclassified information, material, equipment (including reactors), and components for nuclear research and nuclear power production. Norway has no nuclear power program, and no current plans for establishing one, but the proposed Agreement would facilitate cooperation on such a program if Norway's plans change in the future. Norway does have an active nuclear research program and the focus of cooperation under the proposed Agreement, as under the previous agreement, is expected to be in the area of nuclear research. The proposed Agreement would not permit transfers of Restricted Data, sensitive nuclear technology, sensitive nuclear facilities or major critical components of such facilities.\nThe proposed Agreement would provide advance, long-term (programmatic) consent to Norway for the retransfer for storage or reprocessing of irradiated nuclear material (spent fuel) subject to the Agreement to France, the United Kingdom, or other countries or destinations as may be agreed upon in writing. The United States has given similar advance consent to various other partners, including to Norway under the previous U.S.-Norway Peaceful Nuclear Cooperation Agreement that was in force from 1984 to 2014. The proposed Agreement would give the United States the option to revoke the advance consent if it considers that it cannot be continued without a significant increase of the risk of proliferation or without jeopardizing national security.\nThe proposed Agreement will have a term of 30 years from the date of its entry into force, unless terminated by either party on 1 year's advance written notice. In the event of termination or expiration of the proposed Agreement, key nonproliferation conditions and controls will continue in effect as long as any material, equipment, or component subject to the proposed Agreement remains in the territory of the party concerned or under its jurisdiction or control anywhere, or until such time as the parties agree that such items are no longer usable for any nuclear activity relevant from the point of view of safeguards.\nNorway is a non-nuclear-weapon State party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Norway has concluded a safeguards agreement and additional protocol with the International Atomic Energy Agency. Norway is a party to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, which establishes international standards of physical protection for the use, storage, and transport of nuclear material. It is also a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group, whose non-legally binding guidelines set forth standards for the responsible export of nuclear commodities for peaceful use. A more detailed discussion of Norway's domestic civil nuclear activities and its nuclear nonproliferation policies and practices is provided in the NPAS and the NPAS classified annex submitted to the Congress separately.\nI have considered the views and recommendations of the interested departments and agencies in reviewing the proposed Agreement and have determined that its performance will promote, and will not constitute an unreasonable risk to, the common defense and security. Accordingly, I have approved the proposed Agreement and authorized its execution and urge that the Congress give it favorable consideration.\nThis transmission shall constitute a submittal for purposes of both sections 123 b. and 123 d. of the Act. My Administration is prepared to begin immediately consultations with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee as provided in section 123 b. Upon completion of the 30 days of continuous session review provided for in section 123 b., the 60 days of continuous session review provided for in section 123 d. shall commence.\nBARACK OBAMA\nThe White House,\nJune 14, 2016.", "timestamp": "2016-06-14", "title": "Message to the Congress Transmitting a Proposed Agreement for Cooperation Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Kingdom of Norway Concerning Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "The President spoke at 6:54 p.m. on the South Lawn at the White House.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117868", "text": "The President. Hello, everybody! Well, first of all, let's give a big round of applause to the best house band in the world, our outstanding Marine band. Give them a big round of applause. They can play anything. Bruno Mars. [Laughter] Yo-Yo Ma. It doesn't matter. I mean, they sounded great. I was rocking out a little bit in the Oval Office.\nIt is so good to see all of you at what is just a wonderful event. One of the only things that I don't like about this event is, each year, I see some of the same kids, and they're getting a lot taller—[laughter]—which means I'm getting a lot older. But for Members of Congress to be able to bring their families together on an incredible day like this is a true blessing.\nObviously, this has been a difficult week for America because all of us are still grieving for those who were lost in Orlando. All of us still have our thoughts and prayers for the families of those who were killed, but also for those who are still recovering and for the city of Orlando. And one of the things that—when I was talking to the mayor, Buddy Dyer, down there—I emphasized is that this is something that could happen anywhere. And these could be our kids or our brothers or our cousins or nephews, nieces.\nAnd at moments like this, it's critically important for us to remind ourselves of what binds us together as a people: that regardless of race or ethnicity or religion or sexual orientation, we're all Americans, and we look out for each other. We celebrate those things we hold dear and have in common, like love of family and love of country. We mourn together when part of that family is hurt. And I know that that's something that all of you feel, whenever things like this happen, we squeeze our families a little more tightly, and we're reminded of what's important in life.\nI'm not going to talk long because I want to shake as many hands as possible, although I've still got to apply the no selfie rule—[laughter]—because otherwise, I'm here for like 4 hours. But I do want to just say thank you to all of you. I want to say thanks to the Members of Congress who are here. I know that we're at a contentious time in our political life in this country. The truth is, though, it's important not to romanticize the past. Democracy has always been contentious, and it's always messy, because we're a big country and we're a diverse country. And people are not going to agree a hundred percent of the time on some of the big issues that we care about.\nBut one of the things I've tried to emphasize—and I spoke at a couple of commencements this past month—I said that one of the things about democracy is, is that it works because we try to compromise, even when you think you're a hundred percent right. In that sense, it's a lot like marriage. [Laughter] The—because as fierce and as important as the debates are, the institutions that we built, the Constitution upon which we're founded, the traditions and the habits of the heart that have allowed us to live in this greatest country on Earth—those are what's lasting. Those are more permanent and more important than any immediate difference or debate.\nI think it's also important for us to remember at a time when partisanship is seemingly at an alltime high, that none of us are born Democrat or Republican. And the labels we apply to ourselves, they mean something. They indicate commitments or sets of principles that may not always mesh up. But the things that really matter in our lives, they can't be captured by a party label. The things that bind this country together transcend political party. And it's useful for us to remember that as well, when we are engaging in these debates.\nAnd I'm only going to be here a little bit longer——\nAudience members. Aww.\nThe President. No, my lease is running out. [Laughter] And I'm already trying to look at the carpet and the walls to make sure I get my deposit back. [Laughter] But the—what I've told my staff—and I hope those of you who are serving are keeping in mind every single day—is that this is an extraordinary privilege, our chance to serve the American people; our chance to, in some very small way, shape history in ways that we hope are better. It's precious, and it's a privilege. And we should every single day count our blessings and apply ourselves to the work with an enthusiasm and a vigor that is appropriate for the privilege that the people of America bequeathed upon us.\nAnd the last point I want to make is just, to the families, I want to say thank you. Because certainly, one thing that binds Democrats and Republicans together is that their families carry an enormous burden. You miss stuff. Time flies. You're away for a soccer game or a birthday party or a dance recital. And as somebody who just saw—I cried at my older daughter's graduation. [Laughter] It's a reminder that we a lot of times put our families in a tough situation, thinking that perhaps we can do some good. And they may believe in us real hard and make a lot of sacrifices, but they are sacrifices nonetheless.\nSo to the spouses, to the kids, we just want to say thank you. And that, too, should make us sober and serious about the work that we do, because if we're not actually making this country better, then it's not worth the sacrifice. And we owe it not just to the people who elected us, but also to our own families to make sure that we make the very best of it.\nSo I want to thank all of you. I want to thank again the Marine band. I want to point out that sometimes people don't realize, our Marine band, these are Active Duty folks. They're serving our country. Our hearts go out to the people of Orlando. But our hearts also are filled with gratitude for those men and women in uniform who serve us every day, those law enforcement and first responders who, at times of desperate need like what we saw in Orlando, are there on the spot, trying to make sure that they're keeping us safe. We are extraordinarily grateful to them.\nAll right? Have a great time, everybody. God bless you. God bless America.", "timestamp": "2016-06-14", "title": "Remarks at the Congressional Picnic"}

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117647", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:14 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. I apologize for keeping you waiting today. I don't have any comments at the top, so we can go straight to your questions.\nQ: I wanted to start with the meeting with the Dalai Lama. If you could just give us a sense of what they talked about. And is the White House worried at all about damaging the relationship with Beijing? I'm sure you saw their statement.\nMR. EARNEST: I've seen reports about it. I don't know that I saw it in its entirety. What I would point out is this is actually the fourth opportunity that President Obama has had to meet with the Dalai Lama here at the White House over the last eight years. Just to give you a sense of the meeting, the President thanked the Dalai Lama for his expression of condolences about the terrorist attack in Orlando over the weekend. The President has spoken publicly in the past about his warm personal feelings for the Dalai Lama. The President has articulated his appreciation for the Dalai Lama's teachings and believes in preserving Tibet's unique religious, cultural and linguistic traditions.\nThe personal nature of their meeting would explain why the President received the Dalai Lama in the White House Residence as opposed to the Oval Office, for example. And I would just reiterate once again that the U.S. position as it relates to Tibet has not changed. Tibet, per U.S. policy, is considered a part of the People's Republic of China, and the United States has not articulated our support for Tibetan independence.\nBoth the Dalai Lama and President Obama value the importance of a constructive and productive relationship between the United States and China. All of those were policy positions of the United States before the meeting occurred and our policy hasn't changed after the meeting.\nQ: And then I wanted to turn to tomorrow. Can you give us a better sense of what the President is going to do while he's in Orlando, how long he'll be there, and what his primary message is to the families of the victims?\nTHE PRESIDENT: The President will spend the bulk of tomorrow afternoon in Orlando. The details about where he's going to go and what precisely he will do are still being worked out. Typically when the President makes a trip to another American city we've got a week or so to plan it, and in this case, we've had about 48 hours to plan it. So there's still a lot of important work to be done to nail down the specifics of his itinerary while he's there.\nBut the President is interested in traveling to Orlando to meet with the families of those who were killed in the terrorist attack on Saturday night. The President certainly wants to offer his condolences and comfort to the families of those who were killed and to those who survived.\nMany of your news organizations I think have done important reporting, talking to those who were there that night, and the profound sense of survivor's guilt that some people are expressing is painful just to read. And I think it's important for the President of the United States, on behalf of the country, to show his support for these families and for these individuals.\nThe President, of course, will also spend some time talking to first responders, to medical professionals -- EMTs, nurses, doctors, surgeons -- who acted heroically, courageously, and in some cases with disregard for their own safety, to try to save innocent lives. And their efforts -- based on the reporting that we've seen, their efforts were successful. Dozens of lives were saved as a result of this heroic action. And the President wants to thank them for those demonstrations of professionalism and courage and patriotism.\nSo this will be I think an emotional trip. And the President, while he's there, will also have an opportunity to speak publicly about what he sees and also about the message that he's preparing to deliver on behalf of the country to make clear that the country stands with the people of Orlando, stands with the LGBT community in Orlando as they grieve for their loss.\nQ: The shooter's motivations still seem sort of unclear, or there's sort of a murky mix of influences. Does that make the President's job more complicated in helping the families and others sort of explain exactly what happened?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I don't think it makes the President's charge more complicated because the President's visit to Orlando has nothing to do with the individual who perpetrated this terrible attack. The President's visit is about offering comfort and support to a community that's grieving. And he's going down there to make clear that he speaks for the country when he says that we're going to be with the people of Orlando, and we share in their grief, and that they're not alone even as they endure what surely have been several dark nights.\nTim.\nQ: Mr. Trump has said he's going to meet with the NRA about people on the watch list and the no-fly list, and not allowing them to buy guns. Does the White House have any hope that a conversation like that could lead to some route to get Republican lawmakers to fight against this -- people on the list getting access to guns?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Tim, we'll see. Right now, basically every Republican in the Senate is on the record protecting a loophole that allows individuals who are suspected of having ties to terrorism and their ability to purchase a gun.\nI'm not really sure why Republicans have that position. But the President believes that our country is safer if there are laws that prevent individuals who are on the no-fly list from being able to buy a gun. And I think that's a pretty common-sense proposition. If it's too dangerous for you to board an airplane, it's too dangerous for you to buy a gun. That's the President's view. And that is not the view that Republicans have expressed, because they had an opportunity to vote on this, and Democrats were quite clear about the wisdom of passing such a law and that law would have passed except it was voted down by Republicans.\nSo I think it's too early to tell at this point whether or not Republicans have changed their position, come to their senses and mustered some courage to stand up to the NRA. We certainly would welcome that kind of change if it materializes because it would make the country safer.\nQ: Obviously, there are a lot of things to get done with Congress before the President leaves in January. Where does gun control kind of fit in with all the different things?\nMR. EARNEST: Gun control has been a priority for a long time, and unfortunately -- well, let me say it this way. Gun control has been -- common-sense gun control that would make our community safer without undermining the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans has been a priority for the President for a long time. Unfortunately, Republicans have blocked every effort to make progress on that priority. Even in the face of a massacre of 20 first-graders in Connecticut, even in the face of the shooting of a fellow congressman, even in the face of other terrible mass shootings incidents in Oregon, in Aurora, in other places -- Republicans have resisted those kinds of common-sense steps.\nAnd the President is concerned because these kinds of common-sense steps, while certainly not preventing every act of gun violence, would make our country safer. And we've heard even the Secretary of Homeland Security indicate that common-sense, meaningful gun safety legislation is a matter of homeland security. But that has not yet persuaded Republicans, much to the frustration and even anger of the President of the United States.\nQ: And just on the Dalai Lama again. Did the issue of the South China Sea come up? Because the Dalai Lama was in town earlier this week saying that the dispute could be resolved through dialogue and reconciliation with other Asian countries.\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have more detail to read out of their conversation to share. Obviously, the position that the President has articulated on a number of occasions is that any sort of territorial disputes in the South China Sea should be resolved through diplomacy. So it sounds like the position that the Dalai Lama had articulated is consistent with the position that we have maintained for quite some time. But I don't know whether or not it came up in the context of their meeting.\nJulianna.\nQ: Thanks. Just a follow-on to Mr. Trump's meeting with the NRA on not allowing people on watch lists or no-fly lists to buy a gun. Does the President think that Donald Trump is an effective messenger on this issue?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't know that the President has many views about the effectiveness of the Republican nominee's message. What I think I would just say is this: The President does believe that the notion of preventing people who are on the no-fly list from buying a gun is a pretty common-sense proposition. It is the kind of thing that even people who have profound political differences should be able to agree on. Thus far, Republicans have not. And Republicans have protected a loophole that does allow people who are on the no-fly list the ability to purchase a firearm. That doesn't make sense. That doesn't make our country safer. So that's why the President believes that a change is long overdue, and we would welcome support from anybody in pursuit of that goal.\nQ: Does he think that Mr. Trump's support for this might help tip the scale in favor?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think it's unclear at this point exactly what his intentions are. So we've been very clear. Democrats have put forward a specific piece of legislation that would definitively close this loophole, and that's what we would like to see Democrats and Republicans come together around. And we would welcome the support of anybody, including the presumptive Republican presidential nominee for that effort.\nJordan.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Again, to follow up on guns. In its statement, the NRA seemed to voice its support for a proposal that Senator Cornyn put forward last December that would have this 72-hour I guess wait period where the Justice Department can investigate folks on the watch list trying to purchase firearms. I know that Democrats were not for that last time around. Is there some -- are you willing to give that consideration this time around, now that there seems to be some more support behind it?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, the experts that have taken a look at this have concluded that Senator Cornyn's bill would do very little to prevent people who are on the no-fly list from being able to buy a gun. Just to extend the analogy here, the rule is not that these individuals who are suspected of having significant links to terrorism are prevented from boarding a plane for 72 hours. They're prevented from boarding a plane, period, full-stop, until any concerns about their links to terrorism have been resolved.\nIf we conclude that's necessary to protect the country, we should have a similar policy when it comes to buying a gun. And that's the policy that is included in the legislation that was put forward by Democrats and it's a common-sense proposal that we believe Republicans should support, too.\nRon.\nQ: Just on this list, how many people again are on this list -- this no-fly list?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know the answer to that question. I'd encourage you to check with DNI. I don't even actually know if there is a number that they put out publicly, but you can check with them.\nQ: So would someone who is on this list not be allowed to buy a gun forever? Or what -- how do you see this working? Because this is I guess one of the problems with this whole idea, is that isn't there some limit. For example, the gunman in Orlando apparently was under some sort of investigation and it ended, and the FBI Director said this can't go on indefinitely. So you're on this list, A, you're suspected of a crime, you're not -- it's a gray area. How do you see clarifying exactly where this list begins and ends and so on and so forth?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let's start by -- there are a lot of things to unpack here because there are multiple lists. So when it comes to the no-fly list, this is something that we actually did talk about back in December when the Republicans in the Senate voted down this proposal to close the loophole. There is a process in place for individuals who believe that they are wrongly included on the list that they can go through to clear their name. And I think most individuals who believe they are wrongly included on that list go through the effort to clear their name so that they can board an airplane. And there is a well-established process for doing exactly that.\nThere's been a separate question that has been raised about how should individuals who have been the subject of an investigation that's now closed be treated if they go to purchase a firearm. And while the situation in Orlando continues to be under investigation, this is something that apparently is in question in this situation. The individual who carried out this terrorist attack in Orlando over the weekend is an individual who had previously been investigated by the FBI -- an investigation that had been closed for more than two years.\nThe question is, should an individual like that whose previously been investigated by the FBI but the investigation is closed -- should his decision to walk into a gun store and purchase a firearm be something that triggers a notification to the FBI. And I think --\nQ: What's the answer to that?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the answer to that is basically this. We're still -- Director Comey has indicated that the FBI is going to take a close look at this individual's previous interactions with the FBI to determine whether or not the FBI could have or should have done something differently. And so this raises questions both in terms of were the procedures that are on the books followed in conducting this investigation. It also raises the question about whether or not those procedures should be changed.\nQ: At the other day, the President said that he was \"satisfied\" I think was the word that the FBI had done what it needed to do in this particular case.\nMR. EARNEST: Again, what the President had been briefed -- and again, this was basically 24 hours after the incident -- is he had been briefed by the FBI that based on what they had known up to that point, that the relevant procedures had been followed. But that doesn't answer the question about whether or not those procedures should be changed. But separate from that then is, even if you do change the procedures in some way and the investigation is closed, is there some kind of lingering policy that you can put in place that ensures some notification to the FBI that an individual who had previously been the subject of a now-closed investigation is notified if they try to purchase a gun.\nAnd so I know that there are some proposals on Capitol Hill that consider this and -- look, considering this question is something the President believes is worthwhile. In considering this question, in considering a policy change, it's important to factor in what impact this would have on ongoing investigations, what impact this would have on the finite resources of the FBI. But the President does believe it's something that is worth careful consideration.\nQ: Just more generally speaking, in terms of initiatives that the President may have in the final months of office, I think the feeling that you'd expressed was essentially that the President had exhausted whatever executive authority he had in this area of common-sense gun safety, as you call it. Given what's happened in Orlando, can we expect some sort of renewed effort by the President to try and push something else in the coming months, in the coming weeks?\nMR. EARNEST: You mean with regard to executive action?\nQ: With regard to executive action. Aside from using the bully pulpit, as he did yesterday, aside from saying this is something Congress should do, does the President -- is there anything more the President can do, and tell the people of Orlando he's going to do when he goes down there tomorrow, to try and move forward on this issue of common-sense gun control? Or is it just -- has he reached his wits' end on this?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I think the President, when he announced a set of executive actions back in January, was pretty clear that he was taking aggressive executive action to try to make the country safer and to try to move the country in the direction of a more common-sense set of gun safety policies.\nAnd as I mentioned earlier this week, I'm not aware of any upcoming policy announcements or policy announcements that are being prepared for additional steps that the President could take using his executive authority. The President is always open to new ideas. And if somebody comes to him with a specific suggestion of an additional step that we could take using his executive authority that would fall into the category of common-sense gun safety legislation, the President won't hesitate to implement it.\nBut the responsibility really now lies at the feet of Congress. Is Congress prepared to close the loophole that allows people on the no-fly list to buy a gun? Is Congress prepared to ban assault weapons, weapons of war? Is Congress prepared to definitively through legislation close the gun show loophole?\nThese are all common-sense steps that are strongly supported by a majority of Americans. In some cases, there's polling evidence to indicate that these are steps that are supported by not just a majority of Republicans, but actually a majority of gun owners. So these are common-sense steps. These do not gut the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans. And they would have a material impact on enhancing the safety of communities all across the country. They won't prevent every act of gun violence, but the President believes they would make the country safer, and Congress needs to act them.\nQ: So if I hear you correctly, he's basically -- he's done what he thinks he can do.\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I think the President is not going to rule out additional steps. But at this point, the ball is in Congress's court because the President has already taken bold, aggressive action using his executive authority to try to protect the country.\nDoug.\nQ: Josh, The New York Times published a graph fairly recently which showed how gun sales spike after each of these shootings and after calls by the President, by the administration for stricter gun control. And the spike in sales is profound and dramatic. I think a new record of gun sales was set last December after the San Bernardino attack. The previous record was set in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook attack. I suspect a new record will be set this month. The irony is that the President, any time he speaks about this, becomes, as Forbes magazine said a couple years ago, the world's greatest gun salesman. Care to comment?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, there are a lot of things that come to mind. I think this is a graphic illustration of the lie that the NRA says that having more guns on the streets is going to make us safer. We have these terrible incidents; more guns are sold; there are more guns on the streets; and these kinds of terrible mass shootings continue to happen -- to say nothing of the kinds of shootings that don't involve nearly as many people but are still tragic.\nSo I saw a report -- just today I was commenting on it. I think this was a vox.com report. On the night of the shooting in Orlando that claimed 49 innocent lives there were 43 other shootings in America. On that one day -- 43 different shootings on the same day.\nThe incident in Orlando is the worst mass shooting in American history, so I certainly understand why it's getting outsized attention. It should. But it shouldn't come at the expense of what is a widespread gun violence problem that doesn't get as much attention as I think it should. And it certainly doesn't get as much attention from members of Congress who can actually do something about it as it should. And hopefully it will.\nQ: There's a report in some Belgium and French publications today that an operation is underway by ISIS fighters who have recently left Syria with the intention of carrying out attacks in Belgium and France on soft targets. Have you heard any of these reports? Can you confirm them? Did the President speak with President Hollande in his conversation recently about these?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not in a position to comment on any ongoing operations in France or Belgium. For years now, and certainly in the aftermath of the Paris attacks last fall, the United States has redoubled our efforts to support our allies in France and Belgium as they confront what is a quite significant homeland security threat from extremists that may be trying to enter their country. In some cases, these are extremists who already live in their country.\nAnd so there are a whole host of things that we have done to further enhance our coordination, further enhance our information-sharing, and a set of other steps that will make them more effective in protecting their country.\nWhat we've also done -- and this is something that the President's Special Envoy to our Counter-ISIL coalition, Brett McGurk, talked about from this podium -- is that we have put more intense pressure, we're ramping up the pressure against the ISIL leaders in Iraq and in Syria, and we are engaged in an effort to more effectively shut down the border between Turkey and Syria and make it harder for ISIL leaders to get in and out of some key cities in Iraq and in Syria, including Mosul and Raqqa. There are currently operations underway in both of those locations that are led by local forces to encircle those cities. All of that -- shutting down the border and encircling those cities -- is going to apply pressure against ISIL leaders and make it harder for them to move fighters into and out of that area.\nBut obviously -- so this is important because we know that the individuals who were linked to -- at least some of the individuals who were linked to the attacks in Paris and later in Belgium had spent time in Syria. So being able to shut down those routes, or at least put pressure on the leaders who might be interested in sending people on those routes is an important part of our strategy to counter ISIL's ability to carry out acts of violence not just in Iraq and in Syria, but in other places, too.\nThat said, ISIL does pose a unique threat in that they are using social media and other Internet-based resources to try to inspire people to carry out acts of violence, even if they're not planned and directed by ISIL leaders in Iraq and in Syria. So this is an unwieldy threat, and we are dedicating significant resources to counter it and to protect the American people and to protect our allies.\nQ: Lastly, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter, at the NATO meeting today, said that there is more NATO can do in this fight against ISIS. Is that at odds with what the administration's position is in this fight?\nMR. EARNEST: No. We have regularly made the case that we are going to continue to ask our partners in the counter-ISIL effort to contribute more. And in some cases, that is financial resources. In some cases, that is intelligence capabilities. In some cases, that is Special Operations Forces. In some cases, that is trainers. And in some cases, that is financial resources to assist the Iraqi government as they rebuild those areas that have been retaken from ISIL. So there are a variety of ways. We even asked NATO members and other partners in our counter-ISIL coalition to make substantial financial contributions to address the humanitarian situation caused by ISIL to provide for the basic humanitarian needs of refugees.\nSo there are a lot of ways that our partners can contribute to this effort, and we've been pleased that we found 66 other countries around the world who have made substantial and important contributions to our success in degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL. But we're always on the lookout for additional commitments that can be made. I know this is the subject of regular conversation between Secretary Carter and his counterparts around the world, including his counterparts in NATO. And I wouldn't be surprised if this is the subject of additional discussion when the President meets with his NATO counterparts next month.\nQ: One last question. NATO has its hands full these days not only with the fight against ISIS and terrorism, but also with various operations that take place in the Baltic right now. I know that you've positioned 4,000 troops along the Baltic States to counter potential Russian aggression. There's an operation going on underway in the Black Sea right now. There's that expression that, \"Nature abhors a vacuum\" and so does the statecraft. One sense is that there is this escalation and tension not only in Europe and not in the Middle East, but certainly in China. Is this administration responsible for the heightened tension because of its withdrawal from the international stage?\nMR. EARNEST: Doug, I think over the course of President Obama's tenure in office we have solidified and strengthened our alliances around the world. The President, frankly, has been effective in enhancing our ability to advance our interests around the world. That's why the President has made things like TPP such a critical priority. That will expand our influence in the Asia Pacific region. The President has built an international coalition of 66 nations that are focused on degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL. The President did rally the international community to come together by imposing tough sanctions and enforcing them rigorously, and eventually compelling Iran to sign on the dotted line on a deal that essentially prevents them from obtaining nuclear weapons. And we have a system in place, working with the international community, to verify that Iran is living up to their end of the bargain.\nSo the President is quite proud, as he should be, of his record of making the country safer, of expanding and strengthening our influence around the globe, in part by strengthening our ability to work hand in glove with our allies to advance our shared interests.\nToluse.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Yesterday, the President, during his speech, said that we're now seeing how dangerous this type of predator can be. And he talked about the Republican nominee and his Muslim ban. Sitting -- or standing next to the President was Director Clapper, who will be charged with deciding how much classified information to give the Republican nominee. Was the President, by saying that Donald Trump is dangerous, sending a signal to Director Clapper about what kind of information he should divulge when he's giving classified briefings to the Republican nominee?\nMR. EARNEST: The President was sending a very explicit and direct warning about the danger of that kind of rhetoric that we've heard from a number of Republicans, including the presumptive Republican nominee. But the President has complete confidence in the judgement that Director Clapper will exercise, free of political interference, about how to effectively brief both parties' presidential nominees.\nAndrew.\nQ: Going back to the issue of the Dalai Lama's visit. How do you define what's a private meeting and what isn't?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I don't think I described the Dalai Lama meeting as private, I guess.\nQ: You said it was in the Residence because it was a private meeting --\nQ: Personal.\nQ: Personal.\nQ: Personal.\nMR. EARNEST: Personal. Look, in this case, the Dalai Lama is not a head of state and so the visit was handled differently.\nWhen there's a head of state, typically there will be a meeting in the Oval Office; typically there will be some kind of joint statement to the media. But in this case, the interaction was different, primarily because the Dalai Lama is not a head of state.\nBut the President does have personal affection for the Dalai Lama and for his teachings. The President does support the preservation of Tibet's unique religious, cultural, linguistic traditions. So that's why the President had the meeting. But the meeting was treated differently than his meetings with other heads of state because the Dalai Lama is not a head of state.\nQ: Is there a risk that the manner in which these meetings always take place could encourage the Chinese government to think that it can influence if not who the President meets, at least the manner in which he meets them?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Andrew, based on the reaction from the Chinese government that somebody referred to earlier, it sounds like if they're hoping to have that kind of influence, they're not succeeding.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, Afghanistan. Secretary Carter told the NATO allies apparently that the President is, indeed, reconsidering the whole notion of how many troops to leave behind at the end of the year. He'd hoped to get down to 5,500 and I think it's 9,000-plus now.\nMR. EARNEST: 9,800.\nQ: Yes, 9,800. What are the considerations there? And is the President resigned that whatever number he settles on, that whatever hope he had to substantially have wound down Afghanistan before he leaves office is not to be?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there's a lot there. Let me decide -- but a totally legitimate series of questions. Let me try to answer it in this way. What General Nicholson has indicated is that he's conducting a review of our strategy in Afghanistan based on what he's seeing on the ground. And that's something that he's discussed publicly, and I'm confident that the President will be briefed on that review once it's been completed. And I'm sure that part of that review will be a consideration about the personnel required to implement the strategy that the Commander-in-Chief has given our armed forces.\nNo recommendation at this point has been presented to the President. But as the President makes any sort of strategic decision with regard to Afghanistan, he will listen carefully to the advice that he's receiving from his commanders on the ground, as well as the other members of his national security team at the Pentagon, at the White House, and other agencies that are critical to our success in Afghanistan.\nSo as decisions on that get made, we'll obviously keep all of you posted. We obviously also value the important contribution that our NATO allies are making to that effort. And we would not have made the kind of progress that we have seen in Afghanistan without the substantial contribution and, in some cases, sacrifices that our NATO allies have made in pursuit of our interest in Afghanistan.\nWhat is also true -- and I guess this may be the part of your question that I would quibble with a little bit -- is at one point earlier in President Obama's tenure in office, there were more than 100,000 U.S. troops on the ground in Afghanistan, and now the question is are we going to reduce the number of our troops from 9,800 to 5,500? That, of course, is more than a 90-percent reduction of our military personnel in Afghanistan.\nSo I think the situation in Afghanistan has profoundly changed, not just if you quantify based on troop levels, but what's also true is we have succeeded in decimating core al Qaeda that previously operated with virtual impunity in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region. So that also I think is an indication of the important progress that we've made in Afghanistan. What's also true is that there is a government in Afghanistan that, frankly, just to put it like really bluntly is a much better partner with the United States than the previous one.\nNow, of course, it was the Afghan people who chose their leadership. But based on our effective work, we now have a much more effective partner and a much more effective partnership in trying to bring about the kind of changes that we'd like to see in Afghanistan.\nNow, what's also true -- and I think this is the part where I would not quibble with what you said -- is that Afghanistan is a dangerous place and there is a real risk that the progress that we have made could quickly unravel. And that's why a sustained commitment on the part of the United States and our NATO allies not just to a military presence but also to an effective coordination with the Afghan government, with things like intelligence-sharing, economic support, and investments and development in Afghanistan -- all those things are critical to Afghanistan's future. And because of the commitment that the United States and our NATO partners have made to Afghanistan's future, it's important that we maintain those commitments.\nQ: I believe the numbers that we have there now, and the ones originally projected to the end of the year were higher than what he -- the President had originally planned himself and he had to revise those.\nMR. EARNEST: That is true.\nQ: Suffice it to say that this is not where he'd hoped to be as he exits the White House, isn't it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I don't think there's anybody that would describe the situation in Afghanistan right now as ideal. So the President I think has acknowledged for some time that continued work and a sustained commitment to Afghanistan will be required after his presidency. There's no denying that.\nBut I also think there's no denying the remarkable progress that we have made in Afghanistan to decimate core al Qaeda, to build up the governing institutions of Afghanistan, and to reduce the military commitment and military sacrifices that our country and our military was making before President Obama took office.\nQ: And quickly on timetable. We've got a NATO summit coming up next month. Is he hoping to have a decision by then? Or this is something that could stretch on into the fall?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have a specific timetable to share. But once the President has been presented with a recommendation, then he'll make a decision. But I don't have a time frame to share in terms of when that recommendation will be presented or when the President would make a decision based on it.\nJulie.\nQ: Thanks. A couple on this proposal that you said the President thinks should be considered to basically change policy so that if a person who had been investigated for terrorism tried to buy a gun that there would be some sort of flag. Does the White House have a legislation proposal? Or is there one on the Hill that the President particularly supports? Or is this just something that he thinks needs to be made a priority of the Hill right now?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, so one of the things that's challenging about this, Julie, is that this is an issue that has gotten very careful attention just in the last 72 hours and it is important to carefully consider the impact of such a policy change.\nI know that Senator Feinstein has been circulating a proposal on Capitol Hill. That's obviously a proposal that we'd want to take a close look at. I don't know that I can render a judgement on her specific proposal, but she is putting forward the kinds of ideas that are worthy of consideration. And that consideration should include what impact it would have on our national security, but also what impact it would have on the ability of federal law enforcement officers to effectively manage their workload and conduct investigations.\nQ: So that's the second time you've mentioned that. Has he heard directly from the FBI or other law enforcement officials at the federal level that this could be really unwieldy for them and something that would actually make people less safe rather than safer? Does the FBI -- have there been specific concerns communicated to him by the FBI Director or others about what this could mean going forward?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have additional information to share about the President's conversations with the FBI Director. But the FBI Director I think has been quite explicit about his commitment to taking a look at how the investigation of this individual was conducted to understand exactly whether or not there's something that the FBI could have or should have done differently. And again, that's something that they've just been doing for the last 72 hours, so it's premature at this point to arrive at any conclusions about that.\nI think the observation that I'm making is an intuitive one, one that does not require necessarily a sophisticated understanding of exactly the way the FBI works. I think the practical consideration is just this: Any sort of investigative enterprise is going to have finite resources, and those resources are, of course, dedicated to pursuing open and active investigations. And additional information about closed investigations could potentially have an impact on the FBI's ongoing ability to pursue their open and active investigations that are on their desk. So that is just a consideration that needs to be factored into all of this.\nBut, look, I think in the President's mind, an entirely legitimate question has been raised and it's one that's worthy of careful consideration. And Senator Feinstein is somebody that's doing that.\nQ: And just on the visit tomorrow, this has, unfortunately, become the pattern for this President to have to go to these communities and spend hours meeting with these families. Can you talk a little bit about how he approaches it, the toll that it takes on him, and what he thinks his role is in what is a very private and horrible moment for these people -- to go in there as somebody they've never met before, he's the President of the United States, how he presents himself to them in that situation? Can you just kind of give us insight into how he takes that in?\nMR. EARNEST: The President understands that he is a symbol of the country. And when he travels to a community and meets with a family that has endured a terrible tragedy, he's offering a message of condolence and comfort on behalf of the American people. And the President takes that responsibility quite seriously. This is a solemn responsibility.\nThis is a responsibility that's all the more important when you're talking about the way that the LGBT community in Orlando came under attack on Saturday. And signs of support and comfort from the President of the United States should be a powerful affirmation for those American citizens. So this is an important visit I think in the President's mind.\nThe other thing I would say is the President's life has been personally touched by his interactions with people who have endured terrible tragedy. The President recognizes that he is a symbol for the rest of the country. But it would be impossible for him to not be personally affected by these kinds of conversations and these kinds of interactions. And I'll let the President speak more about it, but I think the President in the past has indicated that he draws on his faith as he considers fulfilling these kinds of responsibilities.\nKen.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Sticking with Orlando and the President's faith. Since the President has experience with comforting grieving families after something of this -- after a mass shooting, do you know if the Dalai Lama gave him any spiritual guidance before the President heads down to Orlando?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know if the Dalai Lama expressed any -- offered any spiritual guidance on this specific matter. Obviously the Dalai Lama did present a condolence letter to the President to receive on behalf of the American people for the terrible tragedy that occurred in Orlando. But I don't know if there was any specific spiritual advice that was shared.\nQ: Following up on the DNC hack, you said yesterday you didn't know if the President had been briefed on how it happened, the details of it. Has that changed in the past 24 hours? Has the President been briefed?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know if he's received a detailed briefing. I know that he's aware of the situation. But for any sort of discussion about a federal government response, I'd refer you to the FBI. I know that the FBI has already said that they are aware of the evolving cyber threat. The FBI certainly sees criminal and nation state actors targeting all sectors and data, including personally identifiable information, trade secrets and other confidential information. But they can speak more directly to how or whether they may be involved in looking at this particular situation. And I'm just not able to comment on this in much detail because I don't weigh into even potential law enforcement or international security investigations.\nQ: And finally, on FBI resources for investigations, et cetera. Funding for the FBI -- I know Democrats -- Senate Democrats are trying to boost funding for the FBI. Is that something the White House has weighed into as far as increasing the funding for the FBI? And is it having an impact on investigations, especially in light of the Orlando terror investigation?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I know that FBI Director Comey has addressed this a little bit and he expressed a lot of confidence in the important work that the FBI is responsible for when it comes to keeping the country safe. I know that he has made reference to the fact that there are about a hundred joint terrorism task forces at work in communities across the country. These joint terrorism task forces are organizations that integrate federal, state and local law enforcement resources to protect those communities. And so this is a way that the FBI can work in partnership with other law enforcement agencies to protect the country.\nSo I know that is critical to their work and it's critical to protecting the country. But for any specific resource requests or consideration of increases, I'd encourage you to check the Director Comey to determine to what extent that is necessary. I guess I would just observe that the discussion I was just having with Julie about changing the policy for the way in which closed investigations could have an impact on resource considerations. So if it becomes necessary based on policy changes or a different assessment being reached about the threat that the FBI has to protect against, then a change in resources or even a request for increased resources could be made.\nAthena.\nQ: Speaking of Congress and guns, I'm sure you're aware of the fact that the Senate Democrats are conducting a filibuster right now. It's been going on since before we got in here, and I'm told it's still going on. Stressing an action on no-fly, no-buy and on expanded background checks, was the White House given any heads-up about plans to begin this filibuster? And what is your reaction? Do you support it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, I think what is clear is that Democrats in the Senate have for a long time been fighting very hard to try to persuade Republicans in the Senate to support common-sense gun safety legislation. And unfortunately, those Republicans have been solid in blocking common-sense proposals that would make the country safer. And we've spent a lot of time talking in here about how frustrated and even angry the President has been about that. Senate Democrats have been too. And I know that Senator Murphy, who represents the great state of Connecticut, represents a community that has been uniquely touched by a terrible mass shooting incident. So I know that Senator Murphy's feelings are quite strong on this. I know there are other Democrats in the Senate who have similarly strong feelings.\nAnd so obviously we're supportive of any effort to try to get Congress to act on common-sense gun safety legislation. And you wouldn't think it would be so hard. The kind of measures that Senator Murphy is strongly advocating for, alongside a number of other Senate Democrats, are common-sense measures that wouldn't prevent every act of gun violence, but also wouldn't undermine the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans. These are common-sense proposals that are strongly supported by, according to some polls, a majority of Republicans and even a majority of gun owners. This is common sense. And it's unfortunate that Republicans aren't willing to use that common sense, even when it comes to something that our Secretary of Homeland Security has described as a legitimate homeland security issue.\nQ: And still on this issue of guns, the President was talking in the last couple of days about reinstating the assault weapons ban. Can we expect -- I guess the question is, what is the White House prepared to do to try to make this happen? Or should we expect this to be something that comes up on the stump, on the campaign trail, something the President continues to talk about and continues to focus on through the next several months as President?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, the President stood at this podium in the aftermath of one of the many mass shooting incidents that he's had to address and said it's time for advocates of common-sense gun safety legislation to politicize this issue. We've seen opponents of common-sense proposals politicize this issue to the extreme. And it's time for supporters of common-sense gun safety legislation to demonstrate the same kind of passion in a political context.\nAnd one measure of this is the President's commitment to essentially become a single-issue voter when it comes to common-sense gun safety legislation; that the President has unequivocally said that he will not endorse, campaign for, raise money for, or vote for a candidate or an officeholder who doesn't support common-sense gun safety legislation that would protect the country but not undermine the constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans.\nQ: So he'll keep talking about it on the campaign trial and at various events, we assume.\nMR. EARNEST: I think this is an entirely legitimate issue for debate, particularly as the American people are considering who should represent them in the Congress. And the question really I think is, are the vast majority of Americans that support these common-sense measures prepared to make their voices heard at the ballot box? That's the only way that we're going to see the kind of legislative change that the President believes is long overdue.\nQ: And last question on a different topic. I just want to make sure I'm clear on this -- and forgive me if this is something that has been addressed in past briefings -- but does the White House feel, does the administration feel that there is a qualitative difference between a group like ISIS or al Qaeda or whatever, a terrorist group, specifically telling someone like the shooter in Orlando to attack this specific nightclub versus these groups saying to all of their followers, hey, go attack wherever you can? Is there a qualitative difference or a distinction that's important that would change the way things are done, operationally, would change kind of the U.S. response? How important is it to decide between those two?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Athena, I think what our intelligence professionals and our national security professionals have told us is they're aware of this evolving threat. If there is direct communication between an ISIL leader and an individual directing them to go carry out an act of terrorism, there is an opportunity for the United States to use our resources to intercept that communication and interrupt the threat.\nThat opportunity is not presented when the communication is so diffuse; when it's individuals who are self-radicalizing. That is a different kind of threat that we must counter. And it poses a unique one because, as unfortunately as we have learned in Orlando, those threats can eventually result in a significant act of violence that, in this case, claims dozens of lives. Now, what's also different about this, Athena, is that the pre-9/11 threat that we faced in some ways was easier to disrupt because of the network of communications that was required to engineer that terrorist conspiracy, but those kinds of conspiracies have the potential to carry out even larger acts of violence.\nThere were thousands of Americans that were killed on 9/11 as a result of that terrorist conspiracy. So the threat that we face now is different, but one that, again, as we learned in Orlando, continues to be dangerous, one that we have to be vigilant about, and one that in some ways is harder to counter. And I don't think you've seen resignation on the faces of anybody in this administration or anybody in law enforcement or any of our national security professionals about their determination to do what is necessary to protect the country, to counter these threats, and to keep America safe.\nLauren.\nQ: Is there an overall strategy right now, coming out of the White House, for Democrats on gun control? We see the filibuster. I'm wondering if there are larger plans to move this issue forward.\nMR. EARNEST: Lauren, here's the thing: Republicans have the majority in the House of Representatives and in the United States Senate. Republicans are the ones that set the agenda. Republicans are the ones who are able to effectively vote down bills. So this is on them. This is part of the responsibility of governing. In the same way that Republicans, for instance, will be responsible if they don't pass a budget and the government gets shut down, they have a basic responsibility to pass legislation, it's Republicans who ran for and worked hard to try to get the majority in both Houses of Congress so that they could exercise this kind of control and have this kind of responsibility.\nThe same is true when it comes to gun-safety legislation. It's Republicans who are responsible if these kinds of common-sense measures aren't put into place that would, for example, prevent a suspected terrorist from walking into a gun store and buying a gun. It's Republicans who are responsible for that, because they have a majority in the Congress. That's how our system works. And even though you have a Democratic President in place advocating for that legislation, ultimately it's Republicans who exercise this authority.\nQ: After every terrorist attack, it seems that people think, this is it, we're finally going to move on the issue of gun control. Now you have Donald Trump saying he's willing to talk to the NRA. Is there movement? Do you see light? Is this it? Is this that moment?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President I think has made the observation that as terrible as these incidents of mass shootings are, they are emotional, and that's certainly true of the situation in Orlando. It's difficult to imagine a more gut-wrenching, emotional event that would tug at one's conscience more than the massacre of 20 first-graders in their classroom. And in the aftermath of that act of unspeakable violence that years later people are emotional about, Republicans still blocked common-sense gun safety legislation, even with that on their minds, on the minds of the nation. Even with that unspeakable act of violence tugging at their conscience, Republicans sided with the NRA.\nSo I would like to be optimistic that this unspeakable act of violence will sufficiently tug at the conscience of Republican senators. Maybe seeing the suffering in Orlando will inspire them with some courage to stand up to the NRA. Maybe it will help them put aside their political fears and insecurities and say, I'm going to put the safety and security of the American people ahead of any personal political consequences. And we'll just have to see if that's what happens. I hope it will.\nFrancesca.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. While you were talking, the Dalai Lama posted to his Instagram -- yes, the Dalai Lama has an Instagram -- but beyond that, he posted to his Instagram a photo of him and the President warmly embracing, and the photo credit on that was Pete Souza, and it's an official White House photo. My question is, was that a photo that he was given permission to release from the White House? Or was that meant to be a parting gift that was supposed to be private?\nMR. EARNEST: What typically happens after the President does have a meeting with the Dalai Lama is that the White House typically does distribute an image of that meeting. I believe that's happened the three previous times that the Dalai Lama visited with the President at the White House.\nQ: Distributed an image to the Dalai Lama?\nMR. EARNEST: No, distributed an image publicly.\nQ: Publicly. Why was that sent out then through the Dalai Lama's Instagram and not the White House's Instagram?\nMR. EARNEST: I wouldn't rule out it being distributed through the White House Instagram.\nQ: Okay. And if -- sorry, final question -- if there is a photographer that's allowed -- in this case, the White House photographer -- why was there not a pool spray? Why were we not allowed in there, for instance?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, the way that this event was -- or this meeting was handled is consistent with the way that it was handled the three previous times the Dalai Lama visited the White House. And that meant that it's handled differently than when a head of state visits the White House.\nGregory, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thank you. You've talked about the increased number of mass shootings, and you've also talked about the role of the President of the United States after these events to articulate this sense of national mourning after a national tragedy like this. And another way that he does that is through these proclamations to lower the flag to half-staff at the White House and other federal buildings. And it turns out that President Obama has issued more of those proclamations than any other President in history, in large part because of the terrorist attacks and the mass shootings that we've seen.\nSo I have a couple questions. One is, can you talk at all about the thought process that goes into determining which events warrant that special symbolism? You seemed to struggle a little bit last year when you were asked why it took five days to issue a proclamation for the Chattanooga military recruiting office shooting, for example. But then also, more philosophically I guess, what does that say about America in the Obama era, that we've had -- 6 percent of his presidency has been during a state of national mourning. Should future generations of Americans look back at the Obama years and think of them as a time of repeated national tragedy? Is that part of his legacy?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Gregory, I think the lowering of the flag, and an order from the President of the United States to order the lowering of the flag, is a symbolic expression of national mourning. And it certainly is a way, symbolically, to demonstrate that the country is united in our support for a community that's mourning. I think that what we also see is that over the course of generations that symbolism is expressed in different ways. And so I can't really speak to how this may have been considered by the Reagan White House, for example.\nBut I think what is true is that America has shown great perseverance in the face of these tragedies -- not just during the Obama administration, but throughout our history. And I think -- I'm hopeful -- that as people look back on the Obama presidency, while there certainly have been tragedies that our country has had to confront, but there's also a powerful story to tell about the resilience that the United States of America has displayed in the last seven years.\nOur country has fought back from the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. The American auto industry was on the brink of bankruptcy but came back stronger than ever, and manufactured and sold more cars last year than ever before. Our country has made profound progress when it comes to the acceptance of LGBT Americans in our society. Our country has made profound progress in strengthening our relationships and our alliances around the world. Our country has made significant progress in fighting climate change and doing that in a way that actually has positive economic benefits for our country.\nOur country has reformed our relationship with Cuba. It's overhauled -- after five decades of a failed policy toward Cuba, this new openness and this effort to normalize relations between our two countries has yielded a lot of optimism about the kinds of opportunities that are now available to Americans and Cubans. It's also transformed our relationships with countries throughout the Western Hemisphere. I could go on and on. And some day I'm sure the President will.\nBut I think there's -- as you heard the President say, there's a lot of reason to be really optimistic about the direction of our country and the people who live here. And these kinds of tragedies that we have encountered have prompted us to mourn, but they've not set us back. And I think the kind of perseverance and resilience that we've see in those communities that have been scarred by violence are an inspiration to the rest of us.\nJust to use a pertinent example, many of the Newtown families are actually in Washington today. There is an event later this evening that the Vice President will be speaking at. These are parents who have gone through the unthinkable, and they've lost their first-grader in a terrible act of violence. But yet, these families summon the courage and the perseverance and the will to organize in support of policies that would prevent other families from having to face that same kind of situation.\nAnd they don't do that out of spite or bitterness -- though surely as human beings they feel that -- but they do that because they're invested in our country, and they care about other citizens, even citizens that they haven't met, and to make our country more perfect and to pursue the kind of policy proposals that would make our country safer, safer for other first-graders. And they do that even though their first-graders were taken from them. That's inspiration. And I think that's a pretty good testament to the way that our country, not just in the Obama presidency but throughout our history, has confronted tragedies, has mourned the loss but has refused to be divided in the face of those challenges.\nWe've come together and come back stronger because we're committed to our fellow citizens. And that's among the many things that makes America the greatest country in the world, and it's among the many things that makes the President so proud to have served as our 44th President.\nThanks, everybody.\nQ: Are the families coming here at all?\nMR. EARNEST: I know that there are some families that will be here at the White House. I think that there is a screening of a recently released documentary that is planned for later today. But I don't expect at this point that that screening would involve the President.\nAll right, thanks, everybody. Have a good day.\nEND 2:23 P.M.

This assistance package will continue our support for Ukraine's efforts to strengthen democratic institutions and the rule of law, reinforce the foundations for sustainable economic growth, and respond to humanitarian needs. The new assistance will also support other key areas of Prime Minister Groysman's ambitious reform agenda, including:\n• Accelerating customs reform, including by providing legal, regulatory, infrastructure, and e-customs support; creating a new customs monitoring center; and assisting in implementing reforms of the recruitment, selection, vetting, training, and equipping of new customs officers, based on the successful patrol police model.\n• Fighting corruption through support for key justice sector reforms, including implementation of the constitutional amendments adopted by the Rada on June 2 and Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko's reform agenda, and by expanding our partnerships with the National Anti-Corruption Bureau, Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office, and National Police, as well as support for independent media and civil society.\n• Extending decentralization across Ukraine, helping to improve service delivery, increase citizen engagement and oversight, and raise public awareness of the benefits of reforms.\n• Expanding support for energy security through programs that establish competitive and transparent gas and electricity markets in line with EU standards, diversify sources of energy, improve energy efficiency, support privatization, and enhance cybersecurity.\nIn addition, on June 9, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) approved up to $62.5 million in financial support to two private equity funds that will invest in Ukraine across a number of sectors including agribusiness, healthcare, infrastructure, retail, consumer goods, and real estate. These two investments are in addition to OPIC's total exposure to Ukraine of $185 million, including $73 million in insurance coverage, $97 million in finance exposure, and an estimated $15 million in indirect exposure to Ukraine through other multi?country investment funds.\nThe United States is also helping Ukraine improve its business environment to attract more foreign investment through implementation of banking reforms, simplified regulations, enhanced investor rights, and greater transparency. The United States will continue to work closely with the Ukrainian Government to help ensure that the practical experience of U.S. industry is taken into account in Ukraine's ongoing efforts to prioritize and implement reforms that will improve the business climate and attract private capital.\nThese initiatives and new commitments are part of more than $1.3 billion in foreign assistance the U.S. government has committed to Ukraine since 2014 to advance reforms, strengthen democratic institutions and civil society, stimulate economic growth, strengthen its defenses, and help Ukraine more safely monitor and secure its borders and defend its territorial integrity.\nThis includes more than $112 million in humanitarian assistance provided to date to conflict-affected civilians in Ukraine. This funding helps provide emergency shelter, relief commodities, protection activities for children and the elderly, psychosocial support, repair to water infrastructure, and support for short-term job creation for internally displaced persons.\nThe U.S. government has also provided Ukraine $2 billion in loan guarantees, and signed an agreement on June 3 to allow for the issuance of a third, up to $1 billion loan guarantee in the coming months, pending completion of certain conditions and the Congressional notification process.

Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) has given DREAMers the freedom to provide for their families, further their educations, and live their lives without fear of being deported from the country they know and love. This policy is good for our economy–and it is true to our values as Americans. We are proud of our heritage as a nation of immigrants. We believe every young person deserves the chance to live up to his or her God-given potential. We know we are stronger together.\n\"This anniversary also reminds us of how high the stakes are in this election. Right now, the United States Supreme Court is set to rule on the recent expansion of DACA and the creation of Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA). I strongly believe that these executive actions that are rooted in law and precedent will be upheld, but the fate of these policies, and of the millions of people who were impacted by them, will be in the hands of the next President.\n\"If Donald Trump is that president, he has pledged to eliminate DACA and DAPA on day one. He has said he will create a 'deportation force' to round up 11 million people. He will tear apart families, separate parents and children, rip young people out of school and workers from their jobs. He has even said he will undermine that most fundamental American value–that if you are born here, no matter who your parents are or where they came from, you are an American.\n\"I believe America is stronger together. When we embrace immigrants, not denigrate them. When we protect families, not tear them apart. When we build bridges, not walls.\n\"It is why I co-sponsored legislation to protect DREAMers throughout my time in the senate as well as legislation to enact comprehensive immigration reform, and it is why I will do everything in my power as president to protect President Obama's executive actions, go further to provide relief for families, and introduce comprehensive immigration reform with a path to full and equal citizenship within my first 100 days in office.\"", "timestamp": "2016-06-15", "title": "Hillary Clinton Statement on the 4th Anniversary of DACA"}

One in ten seniors in America experiences mistreatment or abuse—including domestic and sexual violence—and because these incidents are vastly underreported, only a limited number of victims are able to get the help they need. Today, we join our international partners in renewing our commitment to combat and raise awareness of elder abuse, and in striving to ensure security and dignity for all seniors.\nWorldwide, millions of people—predominantly women—experience different forms of elder abuse, including physical, emotional, and sexual abuse. Theft, fraud, and other types of financial exploitation also affect seniors across socioeconomic lines, and neglect and abandonment can cause great harm to vulnerable older individuals. My Administration is dedicated to addressing this serious problem by providing care to survivors of abuse, transforming our Nation's criminal justice systems to better understand elder abuse as a criminal issue, and increasing public awareness of warning signs and prevention strategies. Additionally, because the majority of elder abuse victims are women, we are working to support women domestically and abroad and to combat gender-based violence around the world.\nOne of the best measures of a country is how it treats its older citizens. My Administration is devoted to strengthening Medicare, Medicaid, the Older Americans Act, and Social Security. Together, these programs have significantly reduced the rate of seniors living in poverty, helped older Americans access health care and quality care services, and allowed older Americans to remain independent as they age. The Elder Justice Act, enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act, took new steps to address elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation and established an Elder Justice Coordinating Council through which Federal agencies are working together to address elder abuse and neglect. And our commitment to supporting survivors of all ages is reflected in the Violence Against Women Act, which dedicates Federal funds to victim service providers, law enforcement, and prosecutors working to respond to domestic and sexual violence experienced by older adults.\nLast year, I was proud to host the White House Conference on Aging to identify ways we can improve the quality of life for older Americans and enable them to live in retirement with dignity. Held once a decade, this conference brought together older Americans, their families, caregivers, and advocates to focus on key issue areas, including the importance of elder justice. In addition to taking new steps to expand protections against financial exploitation, assist victims of crimes, and review the science of understanding and preventing abuse through better screening tools, we have built on many of the Federal efforts already underway and are working to support aging Americans for decades to come.\nOn World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, let us resolve to give all people the tools and support they need to live out their golden years in peace and security. Let us fight cruelty against seniors wherever it exists, and together, let us stamp out all forms of elder abuse—here at home and across the globe.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 15, 2016, as World Elder Abuse Awareness Day. I call upon all Americans to observe this day by learning the signs of elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation, and by raising awareness about this important public health issue.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-06-15", "title": "Proclamation 9462—World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, 2016"}

EDT\nMR. SCHULTZ: Good morning, everyone. Welcome aboard Air Force One en route to Orlando. I actually don't have any announcements at the top, so I'm happy to go right to your questions.\nQ: Any additional details that you can share with us about what the President plans to do while he's in Orlando today?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Josh, as you know, putting together the President's public schedule has been challenging, but I think it's fair for you all to report that he and the Vice President will be able to meet with family members of those we lost over the weekend, some of the survivors who were there at the club over the weekend, and local law enforcement personnel to express his profound gratitude for their acts of heroism over the weekend.\nI think the President believes that there's no more tangible way to show support than by traveling to the city where this horrific incident occurred. He'll be standing with the citizens of Orlando during this difficult time, during this path to recovery. Make no mistake about it, this was a horrific attack, one filled with hate. The victims who were killed were enjoying a fun Saturday night out, singing and dancing, and suddenly they were taken from us. So the President understands the grief that family and friends feel is unthinkable right now. And even if you didn't know anyone personally, this can still be a very painful time. And that's why the President and Vice President wanted to be there.\nI think you'll also have an opportunity to hear the President's personal reflections on what he has observed over the course of the visit. I wouldn't expect an expansive speech or anything, but I do think he'll be able to express publicly that Americans stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the people of Central Florida during this difficult time.\nQ: Eric, how does the President prepare for something like this?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Roberta, it's a good question. And I think that, generally speaking, the President understands that part of his job is representing the American people. That's often most evident when we're traveling abroad, but it's also at times like these. And the President wants to make sure he pays tribute to those we lost, to express profound gratitude to the local law enforcement, and mostly, above all else, to show solidarity with the people of Orlando during this time.\nObviously each of the visits you're referencing are different. But the President's goal is to remind Americans that, even in the wake of terrible tragedy, that we're stronger as a nation when we're unified, and the entire country in this instance is standing with the people of Orlando.\nQ: Eric, the President typically waits a few days before going to the scene of an event like this or to the city where an event like this happened. In this case, he's going more quickly. Can you talk about why that is? And there are some logistical things about this trip that seem different from past ones. Is that because he's trying not to stress out the state and local officials who have to host his visit, in addition to manage their incident?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Thank you, Christi. We are working very closely with Mayor Dyer's office of Orlando. The Mayor and his team have been instrumental in helping us plan this visit. Like you said, we don't want to do anything to overly tax local law enforcement, which is already strained in the wake of the attack from the weekend.\nSo the President -- in terms of the timing, the President wanted to send a very clear signal that in the wake of this horrific incident, the people of the United States of America stand with the people of Orlando, shoulder-to-shoulder and by their side. And there's no more tangible way to do that than to show up in person.\nQ: Is Governor Scott going to be part of this? Is he meeting him at the --\nMR. SCHULTZ: Margaret, my understanding is Governor Scott, along with the Mayor of Orlando and the Mayor of Orange County, will be greeting us at the tarmac.\nQ: So that's --\nMR. SCHULTZ: On arrival.\nQ: Okay.\nQ: Eric, I wanted to ask you about the President's feelings about the 15 hours that Senator Murphy and his colleagues stood on the Senate floor. And specifically, the White House obviously has a robust Legislative Affairs office. Can you shed any light on the apparent deal between Senate Democratic and Republican leaders to hold a vote on these two pieces of stricter gun measures that Senator Murphy wants to see?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Josh, thank you for the question. We have been very clear on this, that if our homeland security officials determine you are too dangerous to fly on an airplane, we believe you should not be allowed to purchase a gun. That is our bottom line, and it's a position that has the virtue of common sense.\nUnfortunately, Republicans, back in December, disagreed. They were united in blocking legislation that would have fixed this loophole. And at the same time, back in December, they were also united in blocking universal background checks. So we want this loophole closed. We also believe the assault weapons ban should be renewed. We also want universal background checks mandated by federal law. We also want to make sure that our federal law enforcement officials have the resources they need to be enforcing the laws on the books.\nWe often hear from Republicans that gun safety laws on the books are not being fully enforced. Well, we have a proposal that would fund 200 additional ATF agents to do just that. Unfortunately, Senate Republicans have not moved at all to get that done.\nSo if there's progress on these fronts, that will be a remarkably positive development. But the President is acutely aware of the political realities that we face. Maybe some of that has changed in the wake of the horrific attack this past weekend in Orlando. But heretofore, Republicans have carried the water for the NRA and blocked common-sense gun safety reforms. We hope that changes. And perhaps the effort led by Senate Democrats yesterday does change that. Maybe the lives of those afflicted and taken from us in Orlando over the weekend will change that.\nBut the President has also said that the politics of this issue have to change. And that's why he's led by example. He has pledged to not campaign, support, or raise money for any candidate who doesn't support common-sense gun safety reforms. And he believes that the more people who do that, the more people who follow his lead, the better chance we'll have of success in actually making our gun laws safer.\nIn terms of the actual legislative pieces that I think you've asked about, I know that things are moving in real time. I can tell you that when it comes to Senator Feinstein's amendment -- I believe that's 4720 -- this morning, the Department of Justice released a statement indicating that the Attorney General and the administration would support this measure. We believe this will make a substantive difference in keeping guns out of the hands of individuals believed to be engaged in terrorism. We believe this is a provision that gives the Justice Department important additional tools to prevent the sales of guns to suspected terrorists.\nQ: Do you know if the President watched any of the filibuster on the Senate floor?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I know the President is aware of this and, again, appreciates anything Senate Democrats are doing to give visibility to an issue that he feels so strongly about.\nQ: May I ask you on a slightly different subject? There are reports from Middle Eastern news outlets about a meeting tomorrow. I'm wondering, could you confirm this for us -- the President to meet with the Saudi's Deputy Crown Prince?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Yes, I can, Margaret. The visit of Deputy Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman is an extension of discussions the President had in Riyadh in April with King Salman and other GCC leaders. As you know, the Deputy Crown Prince met with Secretary Kerry on Monday evening and will have a meeting with Secretary Carter this afternoon at the Pentagon. He's also going to come to the White House this afternoon to meet with the National Economic Council at the White House. And then tomorrow afternoon *[morning], he'll be meeting with President Obama in the Oval Office.\nWe believe this visit serves to underscore the deep strategic partnership between the United States and Saudi Arabia. Mostly, it's going to give us an opportunity to further discuss issues of mutual concern and cooperation, including the situations in Yemen and Syria, our campaign against ISIL, Saudi Arabia's national transformation program of reforming its economy -- so all of the issues that were discussed at the GCC Summit in April.\nQ: It might shock you that I have a 2016-related follow-up to this. But Secretary Clinton, earlier this week, said it was \"long past time\" for the Saudis and the Qataris and the Kuwaitis to stop allowing citizens to fund extremist groups and supporting mosques in schools that teach that sort of extremism ideology. Is this a sentiment that the President agrees with? And whether or not he agrees with it, is it anything that he would actually directly articulate in a meeting like this? Or is that not really the way diplomacy works? Can we expect that to come up?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Margaret, I haven't seen those comments, so I'm not going to be able to offer a reaction from here. But I can tell you that the bulk of the agenda tomorrow between the President and the Deputy Crown Prince are going to be about the issues I just mentioned, namely restoring some stability to the regional conflicts we've seen both in Yemen and in Syria, our cooperation with the Saudis in the campaign against ISIL, Saudi Arabia's own national transformation program for reforming its economy. That's actually a program that the Deputy Crown Prince himself announced.\nSo a lot of our economic officials this afternoon will be meeting with him about how to move that program forward and adopt best practices. I know that our Chairman of the Council, Zients -- Jeff Zients will be there. And Secretary Lew and Secretary Pritzker will also be in the meeting, as well as Secretary Moniz.\nQ: Is Susan Rice in tomorrow's meeting? And is Vice President Biden in tomorrow's meeting?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I don't have a full manifest, Margaret, but I do know that we can provide a readout of that meeting after it happens. So hopefully we'll be in a better position to answer some of those questions about the meeting after the meeting.\nQ: If something comes up, will you let us know?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Margaret, I'll do my best to get you as most detailed of a readout as possible.\nQ: Is anybody else -- any other government officials flying with the President today?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Yes. Senator Rubio is on the plane with us. Congresswoman Corinne Brown is on the plane with us. Senator Nelson is actually flying on the Vice President's plane with the Vice President down to Florida. So he'll be with us today as well.\nQ: Does the White House share any of the concerns that were raised by Director Comey of the FBI in the past, with the Hill, about some of these gun restrictions that have been proposed interfering with FBI terrorism investigations?\nMR. SCHULTZ: David, you're right, Director Comey has articulated some very specific views on this, and we take all of that into account, as does the Attorney General when she issues a statement of support.\nSo I know there's different proposals sort of floating about on the Hill right now. As I mentioned, we're able to articulate specific support for the Feinstein amendment that I know is being debated. But our view is consistent with the Attorney General and Director Comey in that we -- there is limited bandwidth and we have to make sure our law enforcement officials are prioritizing the right threats. And that's why the President has so much confidence in Director Comey to do just that.\nQ: Is Senator Rubio going to meet with -- will the other lawmakers on board also be part of the family meetings that the President is having, or no, not so much?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I don't want to speak for Senator Rubio. I know that he's flying down there --\nQ: -- come back after you're done --\nMR. SCHULTZ: If he's interested in speaking with all of you.\nQ: Is the President planning on speaking with Senator Rubio while they're in flight? Is he looking forward to speaking with him?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Yeah, I anticipate them having a conversation.\nQ: Does he have any advice about Senator Rubio seeking reelection?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I suspect the conversation between the President and Senator Rubio will be much more focused on the events of today and the aftermath of the tragedy of this weekend, and making sure that the people of Orlando understand the solidarity that this President wants to show even with someone who is at other times a political rival. But I think this is a moment where Democrats and Republicans can come together and show that, in the wake of a horrific attack, when one community is attacked in the United States of America, the United States of America stands together and united to help.\nQ: Eric, often when the President goes to memorials like this one, he speaks at a podium with lengthy, prepared remarks. This seems to be a different response. Can you talk about why something shorter and more quiet in nature is called for at this time?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Christi, it's a fair question. I quibble with one aspect of it, which is although, as Roberta mentioned, the President has had to embark upon these trips with too much regularity, there's no playbook for how these trips come together. So I know that in some instances there are preexisting memorial services that the President is invited to join, and we accept that invitation. This is an instance where the President wanted to meet privately with the families that are grieving, with some of the survivors from the nightclub, and with local law enforcement and pay his respects. He wants to make sure that those families who are going through this unimaginable pain know that the President of the United States is there with them.\nQ: Do you have any idea how many people he might be meeting with today and how long that might go on?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I don't have any numbers. Obviously, you will travel with him to the site, so you'll be able to have a sense of the time duration. If I have a sense of the numbers, I'll try and get that to you. And we should just acknowledged the reality that a lot of those conversations are going to be private. So for I think understandable and obvious reasons, those conversations will not be in front of the cameras.\nQ: Eric, is the President aware of the British lawmaker that was shot this morning? And do you have any information about that incident?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Josh, I don't have any updates on that. I know that's something we've been following, but I'd refer you to the British authorities on that.\nQ: Can we go back the Deputy Crown Prince for a minute?\nMR. SCHULTZ: We can.\nQ: I'm wondering whether the President plans to speak with the Deputy Crown Prince about the pressure that the U.N. said the Kingdom placed upon it to remove the Kingdom from a blacklist over children that have been killed in Yemen.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Roberta, I don't know if that specific item is going to be on the agenda. I know that the situation in Yemen broadly, and Syria, will be a topic of discussion. I think that you've seen cooperation between the Saudis and the Americans on deescalating a lot of the conflicts in the region, so we're going to continue those discussions. We've seen progress in some areas, but there's a lot of work to be done. And so that's why the President wants to have this conversation tomorrow.\nQ: And on the national economic plan, does the President feel that the plan to wean the Kingdom off oil as sort of its main economic driver is feasible?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, I think that's going to be a large part of the conversation that our economic team is having this afternoon. I think that the Deputy Crown Prince had a conversation with Secretary Kerry earlier this week and is meeting with Secretary Carter today, so I wouldn't be surprised if it came up in that meeting.\nBut obviously, helping Saudi Arabia through this is important. And the plan that they release is one that includes a lot of important economic reforms as well as diversifying their economy. And those are objectives that we think that our experts can be helpful with, and that's why they'll be meeting later this afternoon.\nQ: Just one more question. You said that there was a lot of politics going on around this, but his message will largely stay out of the fray, if you will, and will there be any -- will he be listening to the family members too about their concerns or their opinions about how to handle things like discrimination or against LGBT communities?\nMR. SCHULTZ: You all have heard the President actually speak about this incident a number of times since it happened over the weekend. And I think it was late Sunday morning, early Sunday afternoon where the President went to the podium in the White House Briefing Room and talked about how this is an attack, it's a terrorist attack, and it's a hate-filled attack. And it's one that targeted a community that has struggled for decades for equality.\nAnd I think that is certainly front of mind for the President, so I would not be surprised if that comes up in conversations with the family. And I think that's all the more reason why the President wanted to be in Orlando, to stand shoulder to shoulder with members of the LGBT community as they make their way through this.\nThis healing process is not going to happen overnight. It's not going to be a quick one. It's one that is difficult and challenging. But that's all the more reason why the President wanted to be there in person.\nQ: Eric, has the White House settled on a date for the rescheduled first appearance with Clinton?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Josh, I don't believe we have. As you know, that was a scheduled campaign appearance for Wednesday in Green Bay, Wisconsin. I know that the campaign and our Office of Political Strategy and Outreach are coordinating on different possible dates. Clearly, Secretary Clinton and the President have busy schedules, but I know that they are working in real time to get a new date back on the books.\nQ: Do you have a better sense today whether Donald Trump's attempt to discuss gun control with the NRA is a sincere effort, or just political posturing?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Dave, the last thing I would want to do is assess the sincerity of that effort. I think that our focus right now is on the United States Senate and if Republicans can muster the courage to stand up to the NRA. Heretofore, they have not. But possibly in the wake of this horrific attack in Orlando, or in the wake of the reality that there are 30,000 gun deaths in America each year, that over 20,000 children under 18 are killed by -- have been killed by firearms in the last decade, and over 500 law enforcement officials have been shot and killed by firearms in the last decade -- maybe those realities will finally sink into Republicans, and they will take and support some of the common steps -- common-sense gun safety legislation that the President has been championing for years.\nQ: Anything not related to the Orlando tragedy that the President will do? Any phone calls, any meetings while he's in Florida?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I don't believe there's anything on the President's schedule, but if there's anything like that that appears that we can read out, we will.\nQ: Thanks, Eric.\nQ: Oh, by the way, if you wouldn't mind letting Senator Rubio know that we'd all love to see him that would be --\nEND 12:11 P.M.

Under his leadership, transformations in how we produce and consume electricity are decreasing carbon pollution, scaling up renewable energy, and generating savings on consumers' energy bills. Since 2009, renewable energy generation has increased at a record pace, while costs have decreased dramatically. Building on this progress, smart electricity market reforms, enhanced transparency, and flexible energy resources such as storage and demand response have the potential to further accelerate the development of a cleaner and smarter grid. In fact, in 2015 alone, the United States doubled the installed capacity of advanced energy storage to 500 megawatts (MW) and deployment of this key resource is projected to continue to expand.\nWith this dynamic progress as the backdrop, today the White House is hosting a Summit on Scaling Renewable Energy and Storage with Smart Markets. The Summit brings together regulators, power companies, municipalities, and energy developers that are leading efforts to promote smart electricity markets and greater grid integration of renewable energy and flexible resources such as energy storage.\nThe Administration is announcing new executive actions and 33 state and private sector commitments that will accelerate the grid integration of renewable energy and storage. Together, these announcements are expected to result in at least 1.3 gigawatts of additional storage procurement or deployment in the next five years. These actions include:\n• A new report by the White House Council of Economic Advisers on the technical and economic considerations and opportunities relating to the grid integration of renewable energy resources.\n• The federal government committing to increasing its storage and microgrid capacity through programs that will make our federal and military bases more resilient and provide funding for microgrids in rural communities.\n• The U.S. Department of Energy promoting access to and standardization of energy data.\n• Sixteen developers and power companies in at least eight states announcing new storage procurement and deployment targets for the next five years.\n• Investors announcing $130 million in new funding commitments for energy storage.\n• In aggregate, these new procurement, deployment, and investment commitments announced today could lead to approximately $1 billion in investments in energy storage.\n• Power companies and developers committing to deploy smart water heaters, smart meters, and demand response programs.\nFederal Executive Actions on Smart Markets and Energy Storage\n• White House Council of Economic Advisers is releasing a report titled \"Incorporating Renewables into the Grid: Expanding Opportunities for Smart Markets and Energy Storage.\" One of the report's key findings is that current and projected levels of variable renewable energy resources are opening up opportunities for technologies such as energy storage and demand response to ensure the reliable and cost-effective supply of electricity. The report also finds that wholesale market reforms are already helping to enable these technologies to participate in some markets. Ongoing cost reductions and advancements in communication infrastructure are expected to further enhance the potential for these technologies going forward.\n• Increasing the Federal Government's Storage Capacity: U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) announces that it intends to issue a Request for Information about building-level energy storage to explore a number of possible storage solutions, in particular for emergency back-up (potentially to replace diesel generators), for enhancing resiliency, and for aiding in demand response management of peak loads.\n• Making Our Military Facilities More Resilient: The Navy's Renewable Energy Program Office (REPO) and U.S. Air Force announce the following new projects and activities:\no U.S. Navy:\n§ A new 50-100 MW grid-scale battery project that will be developed by a third-party developer at Naval Weapons Station Seal Beach in California.\n§ A new 7 MW solar photovoltaic (PV) system with a 6 MW (18 MWh) battery system that will be developed by a third-party developer on the local grid at Naval Base Ventura County (NBVC) in California. The project will serve NBVC during electric outages, covering over 65% of the base's peak loads for up to 3 hours.\n§ A battery second use (B2U) pilot project in Indiana with Naval Support Activity Crane, Duke Energy, and other stakeholders. The project will repurpose the Navy's fleet of decommissioned submarine batteries into distributed energy resources to serve mission-critical loads. If the battery fleet is repurposed rather than recycled, the Navy's overall battery capacity is projected to grow to 44 MWh by 2019.\no U.S. Air Force\n§ The Air Force's Resilient Energy Demonstration Initiative (REDI) announces the release of a Request for Information to energy developers and technology companies to provide energy assurance services to critical facilities at Beale Air Force Base (AFB) in California. Concurrently, the REDI program is announcing the launch of a new energy assurance collaboration with industry at Beale AFB. The REDI program, which develops and deploys innovative energy resilience technologies and business models, will create a comprehensive energy assurance plan for Beale AFB by the end of 2016.\n§ The Air Force Research Laboratory and the Hawaii Air National Guard announce the launch of the design phase of a new distributed energy microgrid project at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam. The project will demonstrate the ability to integrate and demonstrate multiple renewable energy and energy storage technologies, and provide the ability to power critical mission assets during energy disruptions.\n§ The Air Force announces the launch of the Forward Operating Base of the Future project at Joint Base San Antonio (JBSA). The project will integrate renewable energy, energy efficiency, and energy storage technologies into a simulated deployed environment. The project is expected to reduce the amount of fuel required to power forward operating bases by more than 85%.\n• Promoting Microgrids in Rural Communities: Navy's Office of Naval Research announces funding for the Alaska Microgrid Innovation and Commercialization project at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. The project will develop practical and cost-effective solutions for operating microgrids that incorporate significant renewable power generation, with a focus on the Arctic and other remote locations and austere conditions. This project builds on the Administration's Clean Energy Solutions for Remote Communities initiative.\n• Enhancing Data Access and Sharing: The Department of Energy (DOE) announces the following pilots, studies, partnerships and other actions to continue enhancing data sharing and access for utilities and consumers:\no DOE's Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability, in keeping with the Administration's commitment to Smart Disclosure, will undertake an analysis of the private sector Green Button Alliance effort to ensure the pilot program is responsive to the consumer protection and privacy principles embodied in the DataGuard energy data privacy program. This analysis will promote confidence among customers who consent to contribute their data to the effort that their wishes for anonymity are respected, and among participating utilities that customer data privacy is part of the fundamental design of the program.\no National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has developed a sophisticated model of the Eastern Interconnection to understand power system operations with hundreds of gigawatts of wind and solar meeting 30% of electricity needs. NREL commits to releasing in August 2016 the results of its study, including the power system model and visualization tools to enable academia and industry to explore the transition to renewable energy with more resolution than ever before.

Upon receiving the endorsement, Clinton released the following statement:\"I am honored to have earned the endorsement of the AFL-CIO.\n\"The AFL-CIO is one of America's most vital organizations, having been on the front lines of the fight for good-paying jobs and careers with benefits and dignity for more than a century. AFL-CIO member unions contribute to virtually every sector of our economy and are on the job in every corner of our country—building our infrastructure, teaching our children, sowing our fields, operating our ports, and entertaining us on stage and screen.\n\"Members of the AFL-CIO know, as I do, that we are stronger together. We are stronger when we are investing in our country and our future. As President, I will make the biggest investment in infrastructure since the Interstate Highway System—because to build a 21st century economy, we need 21st century roads, ports, transit systems, water systems, and electric grids. We will fight for good schools in every ZIP code—because all of our children deserve a chance to live up to their God-given potential. And we will fight to raise the federal minimum wage back to the highest it's ever been, to finally join all other industrial nations in guaranteeing paid family leave for workers, and at last secure equal pay for women.\n\"And we know we are stronger when we have each other's backs. Workers' rights to organize, to bargain collectively, to be safe on the job, and to retire with dignity and security after years of hard work are fundamental to our country and to our economy. In too many statehouses across the country—and even in the halls of Congress—these rights are under concerted attack by Republicans and big corporations who have forgotten that a strong economy requires a strong workforce. As President, I will stand proudly with the AFL-CIO and fight to protect the rights and values that helped build the mighty American middle class. Workers will always have a seat at the table and a champion in the White House—because when unions are strong, workers are strong, and when workers are strong, America is strong.\"", "timestamp": "2016-06-16", "title": "Hillary Clinton Statement on AFL-CIO Endorsement"}

That's why I have a comprehensive manufacturing agenda to create good-paying jobs and spur new industries—because we can and we will \"make it in America.\" I was honored to meet with BCTGM members in Chicago earlier this year who had been trying to work with Nabisco to keep good-paying jobs in America. For years, Nabisco had received tax breaks and investments from the people of Chicago and the people of Illinois to expand production—only to turn their backs on their workers and on the community by announcing plans to lay off 600 workers and move their production line to Mexico. That's wrong. And that's why I have called for creating a \"clawback\"—if a company turns its back on America, they should have to pay back every penny of the tax breaks they have received, and we'll use that money to reinvest in affected workers and communities.\n\"As President, I will always have workers' backs.

Today we are reminded of what is good; that there is compassion and empathy and decency, and most of all, there is love. That's the Orlando that we've seen in recent days, and that is the America that we have seen.\nThis afternoon the Vice President and I had the opportunity to meet with many of the families here. As you might imagine, their grief is beyond description. Through their pain and through their tears, they told us about the joy that their loved ones had brought to their lives. They talked about their sons or their daughters: so many young people, in their twenties and thirties; so many students who were focused on the future. One young woman was just 18 years old. Another, said her father, was a happy girl with so many dreams.\nThere were siblings there talking about their brothers and their sisters and how they were role models that they looked up to. There were husbands and wives who had taken a solemn vow, fathers and mothers who gave their full heart to their children. These families could be our families. In fact, they are our family; they're part of the American family. And today the Vice President and I told them, on behalf of the American people, that our hearts are broken too and that we stand with you and that we are here for you and that we are remembering those who you loved so deeply.\nAs a nation, we've also been inspired by the courage of those who risked their lives and cared for others: partners whose last moments were spent shielding each other, the mother who gave her life to save her son, the former marine whose quick thinking saved dozens of lives.\nJoe and I had the chance to thank Mayor Dyer, Chief Mina, Sheriff Demings, all of whom responded in heroic ways; the outstanding police and first responders who were able to, through their professionalism and quick response, rescue so many people. We also owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to all the doctors and all the nurses who have worked day and night to treat the injured, save lives and prevent even more anguish. As one of the doctors here said, \"After the worst of humanity reared its ugly head . . . the best of humanity came roaring back.\" Let me get that quote more precisely: \"After the worst of humanity reared its evil head . . . the best of humanity came roaring back.\"\nNow, if we're honest with ourselves, if in fact we want to show the best of our humanity, then we're all going to have to work together at every level of government, across political lines, to do more to stop killers who want to terrorize us. We will continue to be relentless against terrorist groups like ISIL and Al Qaida. We are going to destroy them. We are going to disrupt their networks and their financing and the flow of fighters in and out of war theaters. We're going to disrupt their propaganda that poisons so many minds around the world.\nWe're going to do all that. Our resolve is clear. But given the fact that the last two terrorist attacks on our soil—Orlando and San Bernardino—were homegrown, carried out, it appears, not by external plotters, not by vast networks or sophisticated cells, but by deranged individuals warped by the hateful propaganda that they had seen over the Internet, then we're going to have to do more to prevent these kinds of events from occurring. It's going to take more than just our military. It's going to require more than just our intelligence teams. As good as they are, as dedicated as they are, as focused as they are, if you have lone wolf attacks like this, hatched in the minds of a disturbed person, then we're going to have to take different kinds of steps in order to prevent something like this from happening.\nNow, those who were killed and injured here were gunned down by a single killer with a powerful assault weapon. The motives of this killer may have been different than the mass shooters in Aurora or Newtown, but the instruments of death were so similar. And now, another 49 innocent people are dead. Another 53 are injured. Some are still fighting for their lives. Some will have wounds that will last a lifetime. We can't anticipate or catch every single deranged person that may wish to do harm to his neighbors or his friends or his coworkers or strangers. But we can do something about the amount of damage that they do. Unfortunately, our politics have conspired to make it as easy as possible for a terrorist or just a disturbed individual like those in Aurora and Newtown to buy extraordinarily powerful weapons, and they can do so legally.\nSo today, once again, as has been true too many times before, I held and hugged grieving family members and parents, and they asked, why does this keep happening? And they pleaded that we do more to stop the carnage. They don't care about the politics. Neither do I. Neither does Joe. And neither should any parent out here who's thinking about their kids being not in the wrong place, but in places where kids are supposed to be.\nThis debate needs to change. It's outgrown the old political stalemates. The notion that the answer to this tragedy would be to make sure that more people in a nightclub are similarly armed to the killer defies common sense. Those who defend the easy accessibility of assault weapons should meet these families and explain why that makes sense. They should meet with the Newtown families—some of whom Joe saw yesterday, whose children would now be finishing fifth grade—on why it is that we think our liberties requires these repeated tragedies. That's not the meaning of liberty.\nI'm pleased to hear that the Senate will hold votes on preventing individuals with possible terrorist ties from buying guns, including assault weapons. I truly hope that Senators rise to the moment and do the right thing. I hope that Senators who voted no on background checks after Newtown have a change of heart. And then, I hope the House does the right thing, and helps end the plague of violence that these weapons of war inflict on so many young lives.\nI've said this before: We will not be able to stop every tragedy. We can't wipe away hatred and evil from every heart in this world. But we can stop some tragedies. We can save some lives. We can reduce the impact of a terrorist attack if we're smart. And if we don't act, we will keep seeing more massacres like this, because we'll be choosing to allow them to happen. We will have said, we don't care enough to do something about it.\nHere in Orlando, we are reminded not only of our obligations as a country to be resolute against terrorism, we are reminded not only of the need for us to implement smarter policies to prevent mass shootings, we're also reminded of what unites us as Americans, and that what unites us is far stronger than the hate and the terror of those who target us.\nFor so many people here who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, the Pulse nightclub has always been a safe haven, a place to sing and dance and, most importantly, to be who you truly are, including for so many people whose families are originally from Puerto Rico. And Sunday morning, that sanctuary was violated in the worst way imaginable. So whatever the motivations of the killer, whatever influences led him down the path of violence and terror, whatever propaganda he was consuming from ISIL and Al Qaida, this was an act of terrorism, but it was also an act of hate. This was an attack on the LGBT community. Americans were targeted because we're a country that has learned to welcome everyone, no matter who you are or who you love. And hatred towards people because of sexual orientation, regardless of where it comes from, it's a betrayal of what's best in us.\nJoe and I were talking on the way over here. You can't break up the world into \"us\" and \"them\" and denigrate and express hatred towards groups because of the color of their skin or their faith or their sexual orientation and not feed something very dangerous in this world.\nSo if there was ever a moment for all of us to reflect and reaffirm our most basic beliefs that everybody counts and everybody has dignity, now is the time. It's a good time for all of us to reflect on how we treat each other and to insist on respect and equality for every human being.\nWe have to end discrimination and violence against our brothers and sisters who are in the LGBT community, here at home and around the world, especially in countries where they are routinely prosecuted. We have to challenge the oppression of women, wherever it occurs, here or overseas. There's only \"us\"—Americans.\nHere in Orlando, in the men and women taken from us, those who loved them, we see some of the true character of this country: the best of humanity coming roaring back; the love and the compassion and the fierce resolve that will carry us through not just through this atrocity, but through whatever difficult times may confront us.\nIt's our pluralism and our respect for each other, including a young man who said to a friend, he was \"super proud\" to be Latino. It's our love of country: the patriotism of an Army reservist who was known as \"an amazing officer.\" And it's our unity: the outpouring of love that so many across our country have shown to our fellow Americans who are LGBT, a display of solidarity that might have been unimaginable even a few years ago.\nOut of this darkest of moments, that gives us hope, seeing people reflect, seeing people's best instincts come out, maybe in some cases, minds and hearts changed. It is our strength and our resilience: the same determination of a man who died here who traveled the world, mindful of the risks as a gay man, but who spoke for us all when he said, \"We cannot be afraid . . . . We are not going to be afraid.\"\nMay we all find that same strength in our own lives. May we all find that same wisdom in how we treat one another. May God bless all who we lost here in Orlando. May He comfort their families. May He heal the wounded. May He bring some solace to those whose hearts have been broken. May He give us resolve to do what's necessary to reduce the hatred of this world, to curb the violence. And may He watch over this country that we call home.\nThank you very much, everybody.", "timestamp": "2016-06-16", "title": "Remarks in Orlando, Florida"}

Since our earliest days, makers, artists, and inventors have driven our economy and transformed how we live by taking risks, collaborating, and drawing on their talents and imaginations to make our Nation more dynamic and interconnected. During National Week of Making, we recommit to sparking the creative confidence of all Americans and to giving them the skills, mentors, and resources they need to harness their passion and tackle some of our planet's greatest challenges.\nToday, Americans of all ages have the ability to connect and showcase their creativity through a growing maker movement. Technologies like 3D printing and desktop machine tools are rapidly lowering the costs of production; additional sources of capital such as crowdfunding are reducing barriers to getting started; and the democratization of technology is empowering more makers, helping to boost entrepreneurship and stimulate American manufacturing. Over the last 6 years, we have added over 800,000 manufacturing jobs and introduced next-generation manufacturing hubs. Just as the personal computer and the Internet transformed our Nation over the last several decades, these new opportunities can inspire the next generation of students, innovators, and entrepreneurs to carry forward our legacy of ingenuity.\nIn 2014, I launched the Nation of Makers initiative to ensure more Americans of all ages and backgrounds have greater opportunities to design, build, and manufacture. My Administration is taking steps to foster \"maker mindsets\" by promoting skills like creative problem-solving, and to support the development of collaborative maker spaces so aspiring makers and manufacturers can turn their bold ideas into realities. I am proud that so many people across our country have already joined in this effort. Mayors have hosted maker roundtables and town halls; Federal agencies have worked with schools, libraries, recreation centers, and museums to create maker spaces, curricula, and tools to help students learn the design process; and private businesses and other local collaborators have empowered individuals with the entrepreneurial resources and skills they need to launch companies and sell their products.\nTogether we must continue to expand opportunity for generations to come by working to eliminate the digital divide and reduce existing skill and confidence gaps. We must prepare young people for the jobs of the future by equipping them with the analytical skills needed to solve problems and the computer science and hardware development skills required to power our innovation economy. It is critical that we support the types of hands-on science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) learning experiences—in both formal and informal environments—that students encounter through making, which can help unlock their full potential and ignite their enthusiasm for the careers of tomorrow. That is why we are prioritizing investment in STEM teaching and active learning, expanding access to rigorous STEM courses like computer science, encouraging more opportunities in communities of greatest need, and working to get underrepresented students, including women and minorities, involved to increase diversity in STEM fields.\nAcross our country, Americans are attending all types of maker events and workshops—from studios in small towns to the streets of our Nation's capital—to share their incredible inventions and ideas with others and to inspire all of us to join in the creative process. As we celebrate the power of American ingenuity, I invite communities to build on this progress by encouraging citizens to be creators and by working together to ensure that spaces for making are available anywhere Americans live, work, play, and learn. This week, let us turn today's sketches and dreams into tomorrow's \"Made in America\" labels, and let us embrace the audacious spirit of human curiosity that is embedded in our DNA.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 17 through June 23, 2016, as National Week of Making. I call upon all Americans to observe this week with programs, ceremonies, celebrations, and activities that encourage a new generation of makers and manufacturers to share their talents, solutions, and skills.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-06-16", "title": "Proclamation 9463—National Week of Making, 2016"}

EDT\nMS. FRIEDMAN: Hey, everyone, and welcome on board en route to New Mexico. As you know -- we'll do a little topper here on what you guys can expect for this weekend and then happy to take your questions.\nSo, as you know, the President and First Family are headed to Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico, and Yosemite National Park, where they'll be visiting two of the many national parks across our country that add great value for families and communities both recreationally and, of course, as critical economic drivers. And they're making this trip as part of our national celebration of the 100th anniversary of our National Park System.\nSo the President understands that no challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change, and our conservation efforts need to meet this challenge. And that's why, since taking office, the President has protected more than 265 million acres of public lands and waters across the country\n-- which is more than any other President in history -- and he's taken unprecedented steps to protect our planet for future generations.\nIn addition, the President has helped ensure that all Americans have greater opportunities to experience our nation's unparalleled national parks and monuments, including by launching the Every Kid in a Park initiative, which gives every fourth-grader and their families across the U.S. free access to visit the country's public lands and waters. And according to a report that was recently released by the National Park Service, more than 305 million people have visited America's national parks in 2015, which is an all-time record, with visitors spending $16.9 billion in nearby local communities. So, obviously, this is an economic driver as well.\nSpecifically, in New Mexico, where we're headed now, where we have 15 national parks, 1.7 million visitors spent $97 million in local economies, and that's supported over 1,500 jobs. And in California, where we have 27 national parks, 38.4 million visitors spent $1.8 billion in local economies, and that supported 25,000 jobs.\nSo, obviously, in addition to the steps the President has taken to make it easier for Americans to get outside and enjoy the public lands, there's some economic value to the communities that these national parks serve as well. And so the President and First Family are looking forward to spending some time in the beautiful parks this weekend.\nSo with that, happy to take your questions.\nQ: Is there any reaction from the White House to the internal State Department memo that's very critical of the President's Syria policy?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: Thanks, Darlene. So I haven't read the memo, so without getting into any specifics of it, I'll say sort of generally that the administration obviously welcomes a strong deliberation on foreign policy challenges that face our nation. And Secretary Kerry noted today that he looks forward to reading this memo. And, as the President has said and others have said, we're always open to new or different ideas when it comes to the challenges in Syria. And the President certainly expects a robust discussion to be brought forward.\nAnd so, without getting into details of any national security meetings or discussions, I think it's fair to say we've taken a very close look at this over the course of the last few years and are certainly receptive to ways to facilitate our objectives.\nBut let me just be clear about what the President's approach has been. First, the President has always been clear that he doesn't see a military solution to the crisis in Syria. And that remains the case. And so we're focused on the threat posed by ISIL and terrorist groups in Syria. We've been relentless in pursuing ISIL and the external operations of leaders of al Qaeda in Syria, and working with a variety of local partners on the ground.\nAs you heard Brett McGurk say in briefing you all exactly a week ago, ISIL has lost 20 percent of their footprint in Syria. And, as we all know, Assad has brutalized his own people, and even his allies in Russia and Iran have acknowledged the imperative of a political transition. And so we're working with the international community on a Syrian-led transition process facilitated by the U.N. And, as you also know, Secretary Kerry has been working intensively to reduce the violence in Syria through a Cessation of Hostilities, both to ensure regular and routine humanitarian access, and then to set the conditions for a political transition. And since the cessation of hostilities went into effect, 820,000 Syrians have received aid.\nSo, needless to say, this is obviously tough work that our diplomats are pursuing every day. And I think it's not surprising that there would be a diversity of opinion on how best to achieve these goals in Syria.\nQ: Jen, has the President seen the memo or read it? Or will he have a chance to read it, or any interest in reading it?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: I don't know that the President has seen the memo. I am not aware that he's read it. As you know, this is an internal memo to the State Department. Secretary Kerry noted he was looking forward to reading the memo.\nQ: Jen, you said that the White House has been open to all ideas on this, but you've also said that the White House -- the President believes there's no military solution. So I'm wondering if you can say whether or not the President is open to this idea of targeted strikes -- and if not, why not -- against the Syrian government.\nMS. FRIEDMAN: I'll just reiterate that the President has been clear and continues to be clear that he doesn't see a military solution to the crisis in Syria. And so that doesn't mean that there shouldn't be discussions or a variety of conversations and a variety of opinions, but that fundamental principle still remains.\nQ: There are reports that the U.S. is putting a hold on the transfer of cluster bombs to Saudi Arabia because of civilian death over there. Can you confirm that is the case?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: I don't have anything to confirm at this point, so I'll take that and let you know if we have anything on that for you.\nQ: Just one more on Syria. You said there's no military solution, but it seems that this memo is saying that -- not trying to provide a military solution, but using the military to strengthen the diplomatic process, sort of forcing Assad's hand\n-- forcing him to be more honest in the diplomatic process. Is that something that the White House agrees with?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: As I mentioned, I haven't read the memo so I'm not in a position to get into any of the specifics. We certainly welcome strong deliberation on these challenges generally, but the sort of principles that I outlined still remain the same.\nQ: Fifty-one people signed the memo. Does the White House find that embarrassing?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: Look, I think, as Secretary Kerry said this morning, he looks forward to receiving and reviewing the memo. And I'd sort of refer you to the State Department to give some more details about the process of these dissent memos.\nBut as I understand it, this is an existing official vehicle that's in place to allow State Department employees to convey alternative views and perspectives on policy issues. And so they might have more to say on that.\nQ: And is Secretary Kerry -- you said he's open to meeting with these people. Would it be something that the President would be open to as well, to meeting with this group of State Department people?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: I don't have any sort of meetings or possible meetings to outline at this point. But for now, again, I'd refer you to what Secretary Kerry said on this this morning.\nQ: I'm wondering if the White House or the President has been made aware of the killing of the Parliament member in Britain, which earlier reports suggest could be a -- may have been carried out by someone who was sort of -- had anti-Muslim sentiments in Britain. And I'm wondering if the White House had a reaction at all to that, what was happening there.\nMS. FRIEDMAN: Thanks, David. So we offer our most sincere and heartfelt condolences to the family and loved ones of UK member of Parliament Jo Cox, who was brutally murdered yesterday in the course of doing her public duty. And obviously, this is a tragedy and our hearts go out to the family. And in terms of the investigation or any of the specifics you're asking about regarding this terrible crime, we'd refer you to the UK authorities who we understand are already investigating this heartbreaking incident.\nQ: And as for the Deputy Crown Prince meeting, do you have a readout of that meeting with the President?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: In fact, I do, which -- as you know, this meeting wrapped up a little bit before we took off today.\nSo President Obama met this morning in the Oval Office with His Royal Highness Mohammad Bin Salman of Saudi Arabia to continue discussions that they'd begun in April at the U.S. Gulf Cooperation Council Summit in Riyadh. The President expressed appreciation for Saudi Arabia's contributions to the campaign against ISIL. Reviewing recent Iraqi gains against ISIL, the President and Deputy Crown Prince discussed steps to support the Iraqi people, including increased Gulf support to fund urgent humanitarian and stabilization needs.\nOn Syria, they reaffirmed the importance of supporting the cessation of hostilities and a political transition away from Assad. The President and Deputy Crown Prince also agreed to build support for Libya's Government of National Accord. And with regard to Yemen, the President welcomed Saudi Arabia's commitment to concluding a political settlement of the conflict and of GCC support to address urgent humanitarian needs and rebuild the country. And, more broadly, the President and Deputy Crown Prince discussed Iran's destabilizing activities and agreed to explore avenues that could lead to de-escalation of tensions. They also discussed the important role Saudi Arabia can play in addressing extremist ideology.\nFinally, the President commended the Deputy Crown Prince's commitment to reform of the Kingdom's economy, and underscored strong U.S. support for achieving the recently announced Vision 2030 goals. The Deputy Crown Prince underscored Saudi Arabia's strong support for the Paris agreement and welcomed cooperation with the United States on clean energy issues. And the President and Deputy Crown Prince reaffirmed the strategic partnership between the United States and Saudi Arabia.\nQ: Does the President think that the Deputy Crown Prince's economic plan to wean the Kingdom off oil is feasible?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: So, Roberta, as you know, the President's economic team, the National Economic Council, along with a number of Secretaries -- Treasury Secretary Lew, Commerce Secretary Pritzker, Energy Secretary Moniz -- also met with the Deputy Crown Prince yesterday, and both sides agreed on the importance of both economic diversification, expanding private sector employment opportunities and renewable and natural gas development, and sort of the beneficial role that U.S. companies could play in implementing Saudi reform objectives. And so all those things were discussed yesterday.\nQ: Yesterday, the President was talking about sort of national solidarity in a time of crisis. He had a Republican senator on board Air Force One. But back in Washington, his opponent in the 2008 election essentially, initially seemed to blame the President personally for what happened in Orlando. And I wondered if the President was aware of what Senator McCain said, if he understood his sort of longer explanation afterward or whether he believes that that kind of rhetoric is out of bounds in any way.\nMS. FRIEDMAN: So, David, last week, you'll recall a certain Republican presidential candidate made a similar comment, and at that time, when you all asked Josh for his reaction, he said we're not going to be distracted by small things. And so that applies to this situation as well.\nQ: You think it's small? You think it's small what one of the leading Republicans in saying in terms of what the -- about the President's policies?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: I'm saying what the President is focused on is exactly what he was talking about yesterday when he was in Orlando visiting with the victims and -- the families of victims and some of the survivors of the horrible attack last weekend. And at that moment, he was explaining to everyone that we're going to have to all work together at all levels of government, across political lines, and do more to stop these killers who want to terrorize us. And he was sending a powerful message.\nQ: Let me ask about another Republican -- the Governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, has now said publicly he will not support Donald Trump and not vote for Donald Trump. I'm wondering if the President, who has spoken out very forcefully about how he sees Donald Trump and the dangers associated with electing someone like that to the highest office in the land, would the President in any way try to reach out to governors like Larry Hogan or others, Republicans who are willing to speak out against their standard bearer in any way, sort of offer his support to them or sort of in any way show a partnership with those kind of governors, or even other Republicans.\nMS. FRIEDMAN: As you know, the President obviously has had a number of things to say on this topic generally, and I think you can expect that he will continue to make the case for the policies that Democrats are putting forward and their vision for the country, and the importance of what's at stake in this election. And I think you can expect to see that in the weeks and months ahead. I don't have any specific previews of potential support of candidates that he'll be supporting.\nQ: In the readout you mentioned the President talking about combating extremist ideology within Saudi Arabia. That's something that Secretary Clinton said in a recent speech, that the Saudis need to do more to combat terrorist ideology and financing. Is that something the President brought up explicitly during this meeting?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: I don't have any more details beyond these topics that they discussed that I referenced here in this readout. So I'll let you know if we have any additional details.\nQ: Yesterday the President made a powerful statement in his remarks in Orlando about combating discrimination against women and discrimination against the LGBT community even when it occurs overseas. And I'm wondering if he brought up those issues with the Deputy Crown Prince today.\nMS. FRIEDMAN: I don't know if that came up in his conversation today, specifically. Obviously you heard the President reference this just yesterday and a number of other times, and that's something that is a priority for him in general. But I don't know if that came up in this specific conversation.\nQ: It's been a year since churchgoers were killed in Emanuel Church in South Carolina. And we all remember the President when he went there and delivered the eulogy and saying -- are there any plans for the President to acknowledge that anniversary in any way today?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: So, Darlene, I don't have any schedule updates or anything like that for you on this today. Obviously the President spoke at great length yesterday and then earlier in the week as well -- yesterday, in particular, to the families of many of the victims of Orlando and to a number of the survivors, and had spent what was I think a very emotional and moving couple of hours just talking with them and expressing his support and condolences. And so I think that certainly applies to many of the families of the victims and other survivors from a number of these tragedies.\nThere's obviously, quite sadly, and the President noted, more than just the tragedy in Orlando. This is just the latest example. And so I think his words yesterday would be applicable to a broad range of these tragedies.\nQ: The BREXIT vote is about a week away. There are several polls showing that Britons are sort of leaning towards voting to leave the EU. Is the President worried about that, and can we expect him to do anything more in the next week to express his opinion?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: I know you've heard the President talk about this generally when he was visiting the UK in April, where he expressed his views pretty clearly. I would note that in light of the tragedy in the UK *today [yesterday] with a member of Parliament who was brutally murdered, the campaign there has been suspended -- the BREXIT campaign there has been suspended for the day. So I wouldn't expect we would have anything in particular to say today, and certainly nothing beyond what the President expressed pretty clearly in April when he was there.\nQ: The AP is out with new numbers that 234 women, pregnant women in the U.S. have reported cases of Zika, and a number of incidents of microcephaly have been reported as a result of that. Understanding that legislation is still held up in Congress, with the summer months approaching and these mosquitoes with the Zika virus coming to the U.S. and landing here, affecting U.S. citizens, is there anything more that the President can do to speed up this funding, or anything he can do aside from what's being held up in Congress?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: Well, that's a really good question and it's a really important question for Congress to answer -- which is, why it's taken more than four months to approve the request that we submitted for $1.9 billion in funding to make sure that we have what we need to combat the Zika virus. And as you note, as mosquito season is upon us and certainly in certain regions of the country more so than others, it's becomes absolutely all that more critical that Congress act quickly to give states and local communities the funding they need to address this significant public health issue.\nAnd so I think you've heard the President make this case and lay out why that's necessary. But it's not just the President. You've heard his public health experts outline in great detail what it is they need the money for, again, particularly in many of our local states and -- our local communities and states across the country.\nAnd so it's absolutely time for Congress to act. And I think the question should be, why haven't they done so yet.\nQ: Can I ask a couple more about this trip that we're on right now? I'm just trying to understand -- I understand the tie-in to the national parks' 100th anniversary. But is this trip also something like that the First Family wanted to do and the First Lady or the daughters expressed an interest in, and the timing is such that it coincides with the 100th anniversary? Or is this a trip because it's the 100th anniversary, the First Family is making this trip to make a point specifically?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: So I think both things can be true, that they wanted to visit our nation's national parks, which, as you know, the First Family has done in the past. And this is, again, something that is critically important during the national celebration of the 100th anniversary of the National Parks System.\nQ: But is this a trip based on Malia's graduation, or summer break -- you know, it's summer break time, we're going on a family trip, and that's what sort of the genesis of it is? I mean, how long ago was this being talked about as something that the Obamas wanted to do and being looked into, I guess?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: I don't think it should be any surprise that this is the kind of trip and activity that the President and First Family would be interested in doing, as they have done so before. I think what is important is the President's record when it comes to conservation and the importance of climate change. These are issues that I think you'll hear the President talk about a little bit --\nQ: I guess a better way to ask it, is this trip -- if I'm not mistaken, when they go to Hawaii or things like that, or maybe Martha's Vineyard, the rental compound where the First Family stays is paid for I think by the family to some degree. And I just wonder, is this a personal trip, or is this a policy trip? And how is it being funded. For example, there are accommodations in parks, for example, overnight. Is that more of a family thing and are they paying for it? Or is this more of a policy-oriented trip?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: I don't have those details in terms of who's paying. I can see if there is anything additional we can get you on that. But I can tell you that the President, as he has done many times in the past, is going to be highlighting not just the record of progress we've seen in terms of conservation efforts and climate change, but what more we need to do. And I think particularly for the Every Kid in a Park initiative, which I something you've heard him talk about before, which is an initiative that he's been working on for many years, is all the more important this year -- recognizing the 100th anniversary of\nour national parks.\nQ: The last one on that is, I know this trip has been planned well before the past week or so. In light of the tragedy, I'm wondering if the White House thought or considered in any way postponing or cancelling the trip. Was that discussed? If yes, what was the conclusion on that? If no, is there any particular reason why not?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: So, look, David, I think the President's response and the entire administration's response to the tragedy of last weekend has been pretty evident throughout the week. If you recall, last Sunday, as soon as we heard about the *remarks [attack], the President went out and talked about exactly what he knew, updated the American people on the tragic events. On Monday, as you recall, he was briefed by his FBI Director and a number of national security officials, and made sure to give the American people an update about we're doing regarding this tragedy. On Tuesday, he met with his broader national security team at the Treasury Department, talked about our ongoing efforts to counter ISIL around the world. And then on Thursday, the President went to Orlando, and as we just discussed, spent a good deal of time with the families and survivors there.\nSo I think the President's reaction to the tragedy last week is pretty clear.\nQ: Is he going to be doing any interviews while he's visiting any of these national parks?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: We'll let you know if we have anything like that planned for the weekend.\nQ: -- on how the President will spend his time in the park, at Yosemite, in particular, after tomorrow? I mean, there's a lot to do and see there.\nMS. FRIEDMAN: As I think I mentioned, and you all know, you should expect you'll hear from the President at some point tomorrow in Yosemite, and you'll have a chance for him to talk a little bit about his efforts in this area and what he's doing. And then I think you can expect there will be a little bit of private family time to experience all the park has to offer themselves.\nAll right, week ahead. So on Monday, the President will deliver remarks at the SelectUSA Investment Summit at the Washington Hilton in Washington, D.C.\nOn Tuesday, the President will travel to the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, where he'll visit with wounded servicemembers.\nOn Wednesday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.\nOn Thursday, the President will travel to San Jose, California, to participate in the Global Entrepreneurship Summit, which is the seventh installment of the summit and final of his presidency. And this will showcase America's diverse entrepreneurial spirit and feature entrepreneurs from across the globe. The President will remain overnight in San Jose.\nAnd then on Friday, the President will participate in the Global Entrepreneurship Summit before traveling to Seattle, Washington, where he'll attend an event for Governor Jay Inslee in a DCCC event. And then the President will remain overnight in Seattle. And then on Saturday, he'll return to Washington.\nQ: A White House-organized summit?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: It is the White House in conjunction with partners. We can get you some additional information about who is actually organizing that.\nQ: Do you know, is he leaving on Saturday morning then to Washington? I'm sorry, Jen -- do you know the timing when he comes back?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: Next week?\nQ: Next week, yes.\nMS. FRIEDMAN: I don't have the exact timing, so we'll make sure to get you more details as soon as that's nailed down.\nOkay. Thank you, everyone.\nEND 1:30 P.M.

In recent years, the rise of the maker movement and growing community of self-identified makers have come to represent a huge opportunity for the United States. In the same way that the Internet and cloud computing have lowered the barriers to entry for digital startups, the democratization of the tools needed to design and prototype physical products can support entrepreneurship and a renaissance of American manufacturing.\nTools such as 3D printers, desktop machine tools, and tools for digital design are becoming more powerful, less expensive, easier to use, and more widely available through shared spaces. These trends, when combined with crowdfunding and online communities of practice, are empowering tinkerers, entrepreneurs, and companies to transform an idea from a drawing on the back of a napkin to a working prototype faster than ever before.\nPublic and private investments focused on increasing access to modern tools, shared facilities, and manufacturing-specific curricula will contribute to the right conditions for even more entrepreneurs to join a renaissance of American manufacturing and hardware innovation. At its core, making involves higher-order reasoning and problem-solving skills as well as individual and collaborative project-based learning, all of which instill the employability and technical skills that are needed in tomorrow's workplace. Additionally, the \"maker mindset\" actively fosters dispositions and skills which have inherent value, such as curiosity, collaborative problem-solving, and self-efficacy. By helping students experience hands-on science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) learning and real-world problem solving, making can spark deep interest and develop the necessary passion for students to excel in the 21st century.\nDetails on National Week of Making\nYesterday, President Obama proclaimed June 17-23 the National Week of Making. During the week, which marks the anniversary of the first-ever White House Maker Faire and the  2015 National Week of Making, hundreds of related events celebrating home-grown ingenuity will be taking place around the country in recreation centers, libraries, museums, schools, universities, and community spaces.\nThe week will coincide with a National Maker Faire in Washington, D.C. June 18 - 19, organized by a broad range of national and local organizations on the University of the District of Columbia campus. The National Maker Faire will include participation from Department of Agriculture, Department of Energy, Department of the Navy (Navy), Institute of Museum and Library Services, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), National Endowment for the Arts, and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).\nIn addition, a growing community of organizations are participating in and supporting National Week of Making, including:\n• America Makes, together with the City of Dayton, OH and Sinclair Community College, is planning a Maker Mayors and Innovation Cities Convening with key leaders from over 15 cities to develop local and regional roadmaps for advancing 3D printing in the participating cities.\n• Backyard Brains will host a \"TechTrek\" event in downtown Ann Arbor, MI, with 10 live hands-on neuroscience experiments for local students to develop low-fi versions of graduate-level research tools relating to the brain and neuroscience.\n• Elizabeth Forward High School, in partnership with the Grable Foundation, will host 140 K-12 educators for the free 2016 Pittsburgh FAB Institute.\n• The Exploratorium's Tinkering Studio will launch \"Tinkering Fundamentals: A Constructionist Approach to STEM Learning,\" a massive open online course (MOOC) free for anyone interested in making and tinkering.\n• GE Appliances and FirstBuild will provide 20,000 career and technical education (CTE) students, advisors, and business participants access to an interactive makerspace experience that will demonstrate how different skills can come together in the workforce.\n• NASA will print a Multipurpose Precision Maintenance Tool, the winning design from the first \"Future Engineers\" 3D printing challenge, on the International Space Station and host a live Q&A between the designer and the astronauts on the space station.\n• LittleBits will host a free online summer camp during the National Week of Making with daily challenges, in-person events, and prizes for young inventors.\n• Yale University will launch \"Making at Yale!\"—a new workshop series serving the youth and community of New Haven, CT.\nNew Steps Announced by the Administration Today\nFederal agencies are announcing an array of new steps to deepen their connections with the maker movement, help more makers take their ideas and prototypes to scale, and help more communities get involved. These include:\n• The Department of Education (ED) and Alliance for Excellent Education are announcing the launch of Future Ready Librarians, an expansion of the Future Ready initiative aimed at raising awareness among district and school leaders about the valuable role librarians can play in supporting the Future Ready goals of their school and district. Among other critical roles, Future Ready Librarians design collaborative library spaces that enable open-ended exploration, tinkering, and making that empower students as creators, and will serve as digital learning coaches who work side by side with teachers. In addition, a network of nationally recognized librarians, with support from Follett, will provide input on the development of strategies aligned with the Future Ready Framework, and five Future Ready Summits will be held in regional locations throughout the country and will include librarian-designed and facilitated sessions for district leadership teams on designing collaborative learning spaces.\n• The Navy-led Joint Advanced Manufacturing Region IPT (JAMR IPT) is launching a Maker Mentor Initiative. The effort, in conjunction with the Open Source Maker Labs and other JAMR IPT members, will create a national public registry where experienced manufacturers may volunteer to serve as technical subject matter experts and mentors for makers interested in manufacturing their prototypes.\n• The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Center for Innovation is collaborating with 3D Veterans to train Veterans in using 3D printing techniques. The effort will launch with a pilot program in San Antonio, training 15 Veterans over 3 months with the tools and skills associated with additive manufacturing. These Veterans will also collaborate with clinicians at San Antonio VA Medical Center to co-design prototypes of 3D printed assistive technology devices for Veterans with disabilities. At the end of the curriculum, seed funding will be available to Veterans for additional prototyping and commercialization of these devices.\n• The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will help more makers navigate its regulatory process by the end of 2016. Starting with medical devices, FDA will release streamlined web resources with early-assistance content to enable makers and other potential first-time entrepreneurs to navigate the regulatory landscape and facilitate early and ongoing interaction between the FDA and industry, small businesses, and entrepreneurs. Early and frequent interaction facilitates innovations that provide safe and effective care for patients and smoothing the pathway for these innovations to reach the medical market.\n• NASA will expand the CubeSat Launch Initiative to reach all 50 states. NASA commits to expanding opportunities for schools to build and launch small satellites through the CubeSat Launch Initiative—an opportunity for makers to build small satellites to demonstrate new innovative technologies and conduct scientific research in a space environment—until schools from all 50 states are successfully engaged. This builds on NASA's work with 32 states already engaged to launch small satellites, including new states New Jersey and Idaho selected in 2016. It also includes launches in 2015 of the first CubeSat from the state of Alaska, the first CubeSat built by a tribal college, Salish Kootenai College in Pablo, Montana, and the first CubeSat built by an elementary school, St. Thomas More Cathedral School of Arlington, Virginia.\n• The National Science Foundation (NSF) will introduce a new \"Maker to Manufacturer\" category in their third annual Community College Innovation Challenge. Launching this fall, this category will focus on developing the hardware, software, collaborative systems, and educational tools necessary to \"democratize\" small-scale manufacturing for the maker community, building on advances that have already occurred in the cost and ease-of-use of tools to digital design and prototyping.\n• NSF's Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer program will introduce a new \"Maker to Manufacturer\" subtopic to its existing solicitation. NSF will seek proposals focused on innovative, high-risk technologies that hold the potential to enable small-, medium-, and large-volume manufacturing of cutting-edge, high-value added products leveraging the maker movement.\n• NIST will help more makers to scale production. NIST is committing up to $2 million of existing funds for Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) Program Centers to develop consulting and hands-on technical services in direct support of makers interested in scaling prototypes through U.S. manufacturing services, including assistance in selection of manufacturing process, materials, and suppliers.\n• The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) will take steps to support makers and maker educators. USPTO is committing to working regionally along with its Patent and Trademark Resource Centers (PTRCs) across the nation to provide workshops and support for Makers, work with the YMCA to create mobile maker spaces and provide Maker Ambassadors to support students in those spaces, and help educators more easily integrate making into classrooms through the USPTO National Teacher Institute.\nIn addition to these commitments, Federal agencies are taking other actions. For example, agencies will form a new interagency working group on making under the National Science and Technology Council to catalog existing collaborations between Federal agencies and the maker community, as well as to identify promising practices or methods to build support for collaborative maker projects inside the Federal Government.\nAdditional Commitments in Response to the President's Call to Action\nToday, more than 1,500 different organizations are announcing new commitments, demonstrating the strong response to the President's call to give every student, every entrepreneur, and every American the opportunity to tinker, design, and bring their ideas to life.\n• More than 1,400 schools, representing almost 1 million students from all 50 states are signing the Maker Promise. Developed in collaboration with Digital Promise and Maker Ed, Maker Promise is a pledge by a K-12 school leader to support the students in his or her school or district by taking three concrete steps: (1) dedicating a space for making; (2) designating a champion for making; and (3) hosting a public showcase of what the students made. With support from  Chevron and Google, Digital Promise and Maker Ed are also launching a national network of Maker Promise schools with professional development guides, safety kits, storytelling tools, and other resources. As part of Maker Promise, Digital Promise and Maker Ed are also collaborating with the Department of Education's Career and Technical Education (CTE) MakeOver Challenge, which launched earlier this year and has already received entries from more than 600 schools.\n• Seventy-seven colleges and universities in 32 states representing more than 1.1 million students are committing to take new actions in support of the maker movement on their campuses and in their communities. Continuing to build on commitments made over the last 2 years, university partners convened through the Make Schools Alliance network, led by Carnegie-Mellon University with support from Bucknell University, Case Western Reserve University, and Cornell University, are making new commitments in the following collective action areas: (1) allowing students to submit maker portfolios during admissions; (2) new investments in makerspaces serving students across campus, or serving as anchor tenants for externally-operated makerspaces; (3) supporting maker education, outreach and service-learning; (4) supporting research that advances maker-focused technologies and approaches as well as access for makers to existing university facilities and scientific instrumentation; (5) encouraging interdisciplinary design projects to explore making and maker-entrepreneurship; (6) participating in regional efforts with companies, state and local governments, and community-based organizations to create stronger maker ecosystems; and (7) providing scholarships to students based upon excellence in making.\n• Communities are repurposing and enhancing underutilized municipal assets to transform recreation/community centers and library spaces into youth-centered, technology-enabled, maker learning spaces. These \"Rec to Tech\" efforts increase equity and access by creating more inclusive tech communities and by developing digital literacy skills connected to future employment for a population that has historically been disconnected from tech opportunities. Actions announced include:\no 4.0 Schools will equip up to 100 aspiring founders to launch pop-up versions of learning spaces, from makerspaces to recreation centers to coding labs. Up to 30 of these founders will be equipped with coaching, $10,000 in capital, and community support to grow these pop-ups into ten-student pilot programs in the next year.\no The 1881 Institute of Technology will partner with the New Orleans Recreation & Development Commission to launch a 6-week summer camp, with 75 teenagers, focused on electronics, robotics, and computer-aided design.\no City of Pittsburgh, the Sprout Fund, and organizations from the Remake Learning Network will work together to reimagine Pittsburgh's recreation centers as accessible neighborhood-based places for technology-enhanced learning. By May 2017, this partnership will yield a community plan, site-specific curriculum, renderings and space designs, and a demonstration effort.\no Google is partnering with MakerEd and the Children's Museum of Pittsburgh to award $1 million over the next two years to schools, libraries, non-profits, and recreation and community centers to build more than 100 new makerspaces as part of a new Making Spaces program.\no Ithaca Generator will host a workshop with representatives from several recreation programs to explore and plan how to increase technology offerings in Ithaca, New York. By the end of 2016, a publication will be issued that will identify and share each organization's strengths, needs, short-term actions, and long-term goals towards increased inclusion and access for all youth and adults.\no National Recreation and Park Association, representing over 50,000 local parks and recreation professionals, will launch a \"Rec-to-Tech\" campaign to help more of its members know how to convert underutilized recreation centers into technology-center makerspaces. For 2016-2017, this will include developing and sharing a curriculum and best practices guide on making Rec-to-Tech a core function of all neighborhood-based recreation centers, highlighting examples though its publications, and providing training to its 50,000 members at the NRPA conference.\n• Adam Savage, former co-host of Mythbusters, will launch a national tour in collaboration with Tested.com to both discover and share promising practices and innovations in the maker movement. The tour will build off of a recent tour of Cleveland where Adam Savage visited a local makerspace, hosted a community conversation, and interviewed a series of local makers to share their stories.\n• Foldscope Instruments and Prakash Lab, with support from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and other partners, will provide 1 million Foldscope Origami microscopes to children around the world in 2017, engaging them in hands-on, curiosity-driven science learning focused on biodiversity, public health, and environmental conservation.\n• Maker City Project, a collaboration between the Kauffman Foundation, the Gray Area for the Arts, and Maker Media, will release the Maker City Playbook with comprehensive case studies and how-to information useful for city leaders, civic innovators, nonprofits, and others engaged in urban economic development. The Maker City Playbook is committed to going beyond stories to find patterns and discern promising practices to help city leaders make even more informed decisions.\n• Maker Media, with support from Microsoft, Barnes & Noble, Intel, AT&T, and Google, is committing to engage more than 1 million kids nationally over the next 12 months in hands-on, project-based learning through its Maker Faires, School Maker Faires, and online Maker Camps.\n• Project Paradigm commits to expanding its national youth STEM innovation challenge, the Paradigm Challenge, to reach more than 150,000 young makers in 2016-17 and will award cash prizes and grants totaling more than $250,000 to the top 100 student teams and instructors.\nFull details on all of today's announcements can be found  HERE.", "timestamp": "2016-06-17", "title": "Fact Sheet: New Commitments in Support of the President's Nation of Makers Initiative to Kick Off 2016 National Week of Making"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118135", "text": "Today nearly one-quarter of all U.S. workers need a government license to do their jobs. The prevalence of occupational licensing has risen from less than 5 percent in the early 1950s with the majority of the growth coming from an increase in the number of professions that require a license rather than composition in the workforce. While licensing can offer can offer important health and safety protections to consumers, as well as benefits to workers, the current system often requires unnecessary training, lengthy delays, or high fees. This can in turn artificially create higher costs for consumers and prohibit skilled American workers like florists or hairdressers from entering jobs in which they could otherwise excel.\nResearch shows that licensing can not only reduce total employment in licensed professions, but also that unlicensed workers earn roughly 7 percent lower wages than licensed workers with similar levels of education, training, and experience. In addition, the patchwork of state-by-state licensing rules leads to dramatically different requirements for the same occupations depending on the state in which one lives, burdening workers who aim to move across state lines—including, for example, military spouses who move frequently.\nIn July 2015, the White House put out a set of best practices for state policymakers to enact reforms to reduce the prevalence of unnecessary and overly broad occupational licenses that are hurting workers and consumers. Today the Administration is taking additional steps towards occupational licensing reform.\n• First Ever Federal Funding Available for Occupational Licensing Reform. Licensing requirements often vary dramatically across State lines, meaning that licensed individuals seeking to move to another State often face procedural hurdles, paperwork, and fees, including sometimes the need to complete additional training. To address these challenges, today the Department of Labor is announcing $7.5 million for organizations to work with groups of states to design and implement approaches that enhance the portability of licenses across states and reduce overly burdensome licensing restrictions in general.\n• State Progress on Occupational Licensing Reform following White House call to action. In July 2015, the White House put out a call to action and set of best practices for state policymakers to enact reforms to reduce the prevalence of unnecessary and overly broad occupational licenses that are hurting workers and consumers. Since the release of the White House report and recommendations last year, legislators in at least 11 states have proposed 15 reforms in line with these recommendations, and four state bills have passed so far.\n• Federal Action to Reduce Licensing Barriers for People with Criminal Records. In April 2016, the President also directed federal departments and agencies to ensure that federally-issued occupational licenses are not presumptively denied on the basis of a criminal record.\nMore Details on Today's Announcements\nFirst Ever Federal Funding Available for Occupational Licensing Reform\nSince most occupations are licensed at the State level, licensed practitioners typically have to acquire a new license when they move across State lines. Analysis shows that licensed workers who relocate are 24 percent less likely than unlicensed workers to move across state lines\nThis may be because getting a license in a new state can entail various procedural hurdles, such as paying fees, filling out administrative paperwork, and submitting an application and waiting for it to be processed. Moreover, since each State sets its own licensing requirements, these often vary across State lines, and licensed individuals seeking to move to another State often discover that they must meet new qualifications. For example, Michigan requires three years of education and training to become a licensed security guard, while most other States require only 11 days or less. South Dakota, Iowa, and Nebraska require 16 months of education to become a licensed cosmetologist, while New York and Massachusetts require less than 8 months. The resulting costs in both time and money can discourage people from moving, or for those who must relocate, may compel them to leave the career.\nTo address these challenges, today the Department of Labor is announcing $7.5 million for organizations to work with groups of states to design and implement approaches that enhance the portability of licenses across states and reduce overly burdensome licensing restrictions in general. This funding represents the first ever Congressional appropriation, provided through the 2016 Omnibus, to address occupational licensing reforms. Recently the Senate included $8.5 million to support the continuation of this effort next year in their markup of the 2017 budget.\nGrants will be awarded to one or more non- profits working with three or more states to achieve two main objectives:\n• Identify unnecessary licensing criteria to ensure that existing and new licensing requirements are not overly broad or burdensome and that they do not create unnecessary barriers to labor market entry; and\n• Improve portability and reciprocity provisions for selected occupational licenses across State lines. These provisions mean that states harmonize what is required to get a license and accept licenses from other states rather than making workers meet additional requirements such as new training, assessments, or fees.\nState Progress on Occupational Licensing Reform following White House call to action\nIn July 2015, the White House engaged state legislators with a set of best practices for state policymakers to enact reforms to reduce the prevalence of unnecessary and overly broad occupational licenses that are hurting workers and consumers. Since then, we have actively engaged state policymakers from across the country around implementation of these reforms.\nWhite House Best Practices for State Occupational Licensing Reform\n• Ensure that licensing restrictions are closely targeted to protecting public health and safety, and are not overly broad or burdensome (for example, removing blanket exclusions for the formerly incarcerated in cases where such exclusions are not necessary);\n• Establish or strengthen sunrise review processes so that when a new licensing proposal comes up, there is a mechanism in place to weigh the costs and benefits of that proposal, and ensure that its benefits outweigh its costs before it is put into law; and\n• Expand reciprocity agreements and harmonize licensing requirements to increase workers' mobility across State lines.\n• Streamline licensing for military service members and veterans.\n• Limit licensing exclusions for individuals with criminal records to offenses that are relevant and recent.\nSince the release of the White House report and recommendations last year, legislators in 11 states have proposed 15 reforms in line with these recommendations, and four bills have passed so far. Proposed and passed bills include:\n• Georgia. Georgia recently passed a criminal justice reform law that—among other things—prevents professional licensing boards from using a felony record as a basis for denying a license unless the record is relevant to the license sought.\n• Michigan. Michigan passed a law making it easier for out-of-state firefighters to become licensed when they move into the state. Michigan has also created professional licensing guides for skilled immigrants seeking to use their education and skills acquired abroad in their new home.\n• Illinois. Illinois passed a law that prevents licensing boards from using criminal records as the sole basis for denying a license in several professions, unless the record directly relates to license being sought.\n• Alabama. Alabama introduced a bill prohibiting licensing boards from inquiring into the conviction history of an applicant for a license until after the applicant is found to be otherwise qualified for a license, except when a conviction is directly related to the license being sought.\n• Vermont. Vermont introduced a bill strengthening its cost-benefit review process to weigh the benefits of specific licensing restrictions in terms of protecting public health and safety against its costs for workers including an assessment of whether the education and training required is commensurate with protecting public interests.\n• Kansas. Kansas introduced a bill that prevents licensing boards from using a felony record as a basis for denying a license unless the record is relevant to the license sought\n• Delaware. Governor Jack Markell issued an executive order establishing a state Professional Licensing Review Committee. Among other things the committee is charged with conducting a comprehensive analysis of existing professional licenses to ensure that they are not overly burdensome; to consider how Delaware's licensing requirements compare to those in neighboring states; and to propose best practices for future licensing reform\n• Minnesota: After establishing a Foreign-Trained Physician Task Force, Minnesota passed a bill that to address barriers to practice and support pathways to licensure for immigrant and refugee physicians. It has also funded a collaborative urban educator grant program that is recruiting, retaining, and licensing immigrant and refugee teachers.\nThe President is continuing to call on states to pass reforms in line with the Administration's recommendations to reduce the prevalence of unnecessary and overly broad occupational licenses.\nFederal Action to Reduce Licensing Barriers for People with Criminal Records\nPeople with a criminal record are more likely to succeed and not recidivate if they have a good job. To give these individuals an opportunity to prove themselves, in April 2016, the President directed federal departments and agencies to ensure that federally-issued occupational licenses are not presumptively denied on the basis of a criminal record. The Department of Justice also recently announced that it will support technical assistance for states pursuing similar initiatives as part of $5 million grant solicitation focused on improving reentry.\nA criminal record is often a major barrier to obtaining employment in a licensed field. Data from the American Bar Association show occupational licensing restrictions are also particularly problematic for people with criminal records with more than 27,000 state occupational licensing restrictions for this population. In these States, in many cases, a licensing board may deny a license to an applicant who has a criminal conviction, regardless of whether the conviction is relevant to the license sought, how recent it was, or whether there were any extenuating circumstances.\nBuilding on Progress\n• Developing Strategies for Addressing Licensing Barriers for Skilled Immigrants. Many immigrants and refugees arrive in the United States having already completed extensive education and job training, or with significant work experience abroad. However, all too often they face challenges to fully utilizing these skills, including barriers to licensing. In March 2016, the White House Task Force on New Americans issued a call for letters of interests from state and local communities to participate in the Task Force's National Skills and Credential Institute. This peer-learning forum aims to help state and local leaders develop strategies to facilitate licensing and credentialing for skilled immigrants. The Institute will welcome 18 communities from 17 states to the White House later this month.", "timestamp": "2016-06-17", "title": "Fact Sheet: New Steps to Reduce Unnecessary Occupation Licenses that are Limiting Worker Mobility and Reducing Wages"}

Doing right by our families is the most important job any of us will ever have. On Father's Day, we thank the wonderful fathers—and stepfathers, grandfathers, uncles, brothers, and mentors—in our lives, and we recognize the sacrifices they make to be there for us, through good times and bad.\nFathers provide the discipline, guidance, and love it takes to flourish. With persistence and patience, generosity and integrity, they build our cores and help us understand right from wrong. They are some of our earliest and strongest sources of support and encouragement, and they serve as role models and sounding boards in our youth and as we grow. From single fathers who struggle to make ends meet to surrogates who step up to be there for America's daughters and sons, these men help shoulder the greatest obligation that exists—raising the next generation. Regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status; whether biological, foster, or adoptive; fathers teach their children the values that matter most and steer their moral compasses.\nMy Administration is dedicated to enacting policies that make it easier for working fathers to support their families, including paid family leave. We must promote responsible fatherhood by lifting up the fathers who do their part to be the parents and providers their children need and by rejecting any excuse for failing to meet this obligation. Too many Americans grow up without a father figure in their lives, and it is imperative that America's responsible men step up to be mentors for our young people in need of guidance. To learn more, visit www.Fatherhood.gov or www.Mentor.gov.\nBeing a father is about more than just having children—it is about summoning the courage to love and support them over anything else. We must always strive to be the best parents and role models we can be and commit to being present in the lives of our kids. Nothing is more precious than the moments we get to spend with our families—in conversations at the dinner table, coaching tips shouted from the sidelines, or profound experiences of learning and growing and teaching. Today, let us express our gratitude for the men who have enriched our lives and shaped our characters, and let us never stop working to show them how much they are valued and loved.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, in accordance with a joint resolution of the Congress approved April 24, 1972, as amended (36 U.S.C. 109), do hereby proclaim June 19, 2016, as Father's Day. I direct the appropriate officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on this day, and I call upon all citizens to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-06-17", "title": "Proclamation 9464—Father's Day, 2016"}

The Office of the Press Secretary also released a Spanish language transcript of this address.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117852", "text": "It's been less than a week since the deadliest mass shooting in American history. And foremost in all of our minds has been the loss and the grief felt by the people of Orlando, especially our friends who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. I visited with the families of many of the victims on Thursday. And one thing I told them is that they're not alone. The American people and people all over the world are standing with them, and we always will.\nThe investigation is ongoing, but we know that the killer was an angry and disturbed individual who took in extremist information and propaganda over the Internet and became radicalized. During his killing spree, he pledged allegiance to ISIL, a group that's called on people around the world to attack innocent civilians.\nWe are and we will keep doing everything in our power to stop these kinds of attacks and to ultimately destroy ISIL. The extraordinary people in our intelligence, military, homeland security, and law enforcement communities have already prevented many attacks, saved many lives, and we won't let up.\nAlongside the stories of bravery and healing and coming together over the past week, we've also seen a renewed focus on reducing gun violence. As I said a few days ago, being tough on terrorism requires more than talk. Being tough on terrorism, particularly the sorts of homegrown terrorism that we've seen now in Orlando and San Bernardino, means making it harder for people who want to kill Americans to get their hands on assault weapons that are capable of killing dozens of innocents as quickly as possible. That's something I'll continue to talk about in the weeks ahead.\nIt's also part of something that I've been thinking a lot about this week, and that's the responsibilities we have to each other. That's certainly true with Father's Day upon us.\nI grew up without my father around. While I wonder what my life would have been like if he had been a greater presence, I've also tried extra hard to be a good dad for my own daughters. Like all dads, I worry about my girls' safety all the time, especially when we see preventable violence in places our sons and daughters go every day: their schools and houses of worship; movie theaters; nightclubs, as they get older. It's unconscionable that we allow easy access to weapons of war in these places, and then, even after we see parents grieve for their children, the fact that we as a country do nothing to prevent the next heartbreak makes no sense.\nSo this past week, I've also thought a lot about dads and moms around the country who've had to explain to their children what happened in Orlando. Time and again, we've observed moments of silence for victims of terror and gun violence. Too often, those moments have been followed by months of silence, by inaction that is simply inexcusable. If we're going to raise our kids in a safer, more loving world, we need to speak up for it. We need our kids to hear us speak up about the risks guns pose to our communities and against a status quo that doesn't make sense. They need to hear us say these things even when those who disagree are loud and are powerful. We need our kids to hear from us why tolerance and equality matter, about the times their absence has scarred our history and how greater understanding will better the future they will inherit. We need our kids to hear our words and also see us live our own lives with love.\nAnd we can't forget our responsibility to remind our kids of the role models whose light shines through in times of darkness: the police and first responders, the lifesaving bystanders and blood donors, those who comfort mourners and visit the wounded, the victims whose last acts on this Earth helped others to safety. They're not just role models for our kids, their actions are examples for all of us.\nTo be a parent is to come to realize not everything is in our control. But as parents, we should remember there's one responsibility that's always in our power to fulfill: our obligation to give our children unconditional love and support; to show them the difference between right and wrong; to teach them to love, not to hate; and to appreciate our differences not as something to fear, but as a great gift to cherish.\nTo me, fatherhood means being there. So, in the days ahead, let's be there for each other. Let's be there for our families and for those that are hurting. Let's come together in our communities and as a country. And let's never forget how much good we can achieve simply by loving one another.\nHappy Father's Day to all the dads out there, and have a great weekend.", "timestamp": "2016-06-18", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "The President spoke at 11:21 a.m. at Sentinel Bridge. In his remarks, he referred to Jill T. Biden, wife of Vice President Joe Biden.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117872", "text": "The President. Hello, everybody! Well, everybody, have a seat, have a seat. How gorgeous is this day?\nAudience members. Yes, we can! Yes, we can! Yes, we can!\nThe President. Yes, we can enjoy this. [Laughter] I—this has to be the perfect way to spend Father's Day and Father's Day weekend. And yesterday our family checked out Carlsbad Caverns down in New Mexico.\nToday I want to thank Superintendent Neubacher and all the incredible rangers and staff for hosting us here at Yosemite. They do a great job. We're so proud of them. Give them a big round of applause. We also have here the Congressman for this area, Tom McClintock, who represents the park. We appreciate Congress continuing to work hard to support our national treasures. Give them—give Tom a big round of applause.\nSo in the West Wing Lobby, I've got a painting of Vernal Fall and Half Dome, but it looks slightly better in person. [Laughter] Just look at this scene. You can't capture this on an iPad or a flatscreen or even an oil painting. You've got to come here and breathe it in yourself.\nThis park is home to El Capitan and Yosemite Falls, one of the tallest in North America; to deer and to falcons and to bobcats and 2,000-year-old sequoias. It's a park that captures the wonder of the world, that changes you by being here. There's something sacred about this place. And I suppose that's why the walls of this valley were referred to as cathedral walls, because here at Yosemite, we connect not just with our own spirit, but with something greater. It's almost like the spirit of America itself is right here.\nSo it's no wonder, then, that 150 years ago, President Lincoln first protected the ground on which we stand. And then, Teddy Roosevelt, who called the great trees here a \"temple grander than any human architect could possibly build,\" spent a whole bunch of time camping around here with John Muir, a man who gave life to what's been called America's best idea: our national parks. As he said after his visit: \"We are not building this country of ours for a day. It is to last through the ages.\"\nIn August, we celebrate the hundredth anniversary of the National Park Service. It's a system that includes more than 400 sites, from Yellowstone to Denali to Gettysburg to Seneca Falls. And since I've took office, I have been proud to build on the work of all those giants who came before me to support our natural resources and to help all Americans get out into the great outdoors.\nWe've protected more than 265 million acres of public lands and waters. That's more than any administration in history. Now, it does include this really big body of water out in the Pacific Ocean, but we've also already done the second most public lands of any administration of history. We've seen more victories under the Endangered Species Act than any previous administration, from black bears in Louisiana to sea turtles and manatees in Florida. We're restoring vulnerable ecosystems like the Mariposa Grove of giant sequoias right here. We've designated new monuments and historic sites that better reflect the story of all our people. So along with those famous sites like Gettysburg, we can also see monuments to Cesar Chavez or Pullman porters in Chicago.\nAnd we've got more work to do to preserve our lands and our culture and our history. We're not done yet. In all, last year, more than 305 [million; White House correction.] people visited America's national parks. And for this centennial, we're asking all Americans to \"Find Your Park\" so that everyone, including those from underserved communities, can experience these wonders.\nFor the past few years, we've been offering free entrances to our troops and our military families through Michelle and Jill Biden's Joining Forces initiative. And then last year, we launched what we're calling Every Kid in a Park effort, which gives passes to every fourth grader in the country to explore our parks and forests and public lands with their families for free. Just visit everykidinapark.org.\nAnd by the way, our national parks aren't just fun to explore, they're good for our local and national economies. Sometimes, people try to pose conservation against economic development. But it turns out that studies show that every dollar we invest in our national parks generates $10 for local economies. And these parks help to drive our national outdoor industries—boots and tents and mountain bikes and snowmobiles—and that industry supports 6 million American jobs and almost $650 billion in spending every year. And that's a lot of fleeces and headlamps. [Laughter]\nSo as we look back over the last hundred years, there's plenty to celebrate about a national parks system that is the envy of the world. But when we look to the next century, the next hundred years, the task of protecting our sacred spaces is even more important. And the biggest challenge we're going to face in protecting this place and places like it is climate change.\nMake no mistake, climate change is no longer just a threat, it's already reality. I was talking to some of the rangers here. Here in Yosemite, meadows are drying out. Bird ranges are shifting farther northward. Alpine mammals like pikas are being forced further upslope to escape higher temperatures. Yosemite's largest glacier, once a mile wide, is now almost gone. We're also seeing longer, more expensive, more dangerous wildfire seasons, and fires are raging across the West right now. I was just in New Mexico yesterday, which is dealing with a big wildfire, just like folks here in California and four other States, all while it's still really early in the season.\nAs we look ahead, in the coming years and decades, rising temperatures could mean no more glaciers at Glacier National Park, no more Joshua trees at Joshua Tree National Park. Rising seas could destroy vital ecosystems in the Everglades, and at some point could even threaten icons like the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island.\nAnd that's not the America I want to pass on to the next generation. That's not the legacy, I think, any of us want to leave behind. The idea that these places that sear themselves into your memory could be marred or lost to history, that's to be taken seriously. We can't treat these things as something that we deal with later, that it's somebody else's problem. It shouldn't lead to careless suggestions that somehow we don't get serious about the carbon emissions that are released in the atmosphere or that we scrap an international treaty that we spent years just trying to put together to deal with this. Because the parks belong to all of us. This planet belongs to all of us. It's the only one we've got. And we can't give lip service to that notion, but then oppose the things that are required to protect it. We have to have the foresight and the faith in the future to do what it takes to protect our parks and to protect this planet for generations to come. And that's especially true for our leaders in Washington. It's what Lincoln did when he set aside this ground for all posterity. That's what Muir and Roosevelt did when they inspired the national parks system. That's what our generation has to do. We've got to summon that same vision for the future.\nWe've made good strides. We've jumpstarted a clean energy revolution. We're reducing carbon pollution. We're preserving landscapes. We're rallying the world to tackle climate change together. But we've got to do a lot more. And on this issue, unlike a lot of issues, there is such a thing as being too late.\nThe good news is, I know we can rise to the challenge. Over the last 7 years, we've proved it. And if we keep at it, we're not just going to safeguard this place, we're going to protect our communities from rising seas and stronger storms and brutal droughts. But we're also going to protect our children's lungs from breathing dirty air. We'll protect vulnerable peoples from displacement. We'll protect our national security, because we won't be seeing refugees displaced because of conflict and scarcity. And we'll build on that legacy of all those who came before us, who stood in these parks more a century ago and talked about an America that lasts through the ages.\nYou know, I was telling the head of the system here about my first visit to a big national park, up in Yellowstone. I was 11 years old. And I was living in Hawaii, and so this was the first time I had traveled to the mainland. And I came through California, and we went to Chicago and Arizona and then ended in Yellowstone National Park. And I remember, being an 11-year-old kid, the first time I saw a moose—[laughter]—in a lake, the first time we drove over a hill and suddenly there was a field full of deer, the first time I saw a bear and her cub.\nThat changes you. You're not the same after that. And I want to make sure every kid feels that. Studies have shown now that just 5 minutes of time in a green, open space brings your stress levels down. It makes your heartbeat go down. It makes your whole body feel better. It makes your spirit stronger and cleaner.\nAnd we've got kids all across this country who never see a park. There are kids who live miles from here who have never seen this. We've got to change that, because the beauty of the national park system is it belongs to everybody. It is a true expression of our democracy, the notion that we all look after ourselves and our families and we work hard and we make money and we have our own homes and apartments and cars and televisions, but then there's this part of us that is part of everybody, something we have in common, something we share, a place where we connect with each other and to connect to something bigger than ourselves. What an incredible idea. What a worthy investment. What a precious thing we have to pass on to the next generation. Let's make that happen.\nThanks, everybody. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. And to all the dads out there, Happy Father's Day, guys. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2016-06-18", "title": "Remarks at Yosemite National Park, California"}

But the slaves of Galveston, Texas, had to wait more than 2 years after Lincoln's decree and 2 months after Appomattox to receive word that they were free at last.\nToday we commemorate the anniversary of that delayed, but welcome news. Decades of collective action would follow as equality and justice for African Americans advanced slowly, frustratingly, gradually, on our Nation's journey toward a more perfect Union.

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117648", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:46 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Happy Monday. As you might suspect from the screens behind me, I have a couple of comments at the top before I get to your questions. I'm going with the subtle approach today. (Laughter.)\nAs many of you may be aware, today marks the first day of summer, the summer solstice, which is an important reminder that families should be taking steps to prepare for local transmission of mosquito-borne diseases like Zika. The graphic behind me outlines these measures, including how to prevent mosquito bites, and the importance of removing standing water inside and outside your house -- for example, pet water bowls, vases and open trash containers.\nWhile Zika poses the biggest risk to pregnant women, now that summer is here, travelers visiting Zika-affected areas should also be mindful of the risk of personal infection, and of the risk of spreading Zika within the continental United States upon their return.\nWe know that last year, U.S. citizens made more than 80 million visits to one of the 46 CDC-listed Zika-affected countries. Individuals who traveled to these regions should be taking steps to prevent mosquito bites. They also need to wear mosquito repellant for three weeks after returning to the United States to prevent Zika spread to family and friends, and men with pregnant partners who traveled to Zika-affected areas need to take special precautions to protect their partners.\nToday is also another reminder that it has been nearly four months since the President submitted a request to Congress for $1.9 billion in funding that our public health experts and scientists say that we need to prepare for Zika. In those four months, despite inaction from Congress, the federal government has been hard at work redirecting nearly $600 million in existing funds as a stopgap measure.\nThe administration has also been coordinating closely with state and local officials, both to limit the potential for transmission in the continental United States, but also to ensure that everyone is ready to respond once local transmission of Zika is detected. In addition, state and local officials are taking action on their own. And here's a flavor of what they're doing: We've seen public health departments from New York City to Tallahassee, Florida, to Sacramento, California, to Houston, Texas -- they've begun campaigns to educate residents about mosquito control and Zika. County and state health departments are bulking up their mosquito control and tracking, including places as far-flung as Hillsborough County, Florida, to Douglas County, Nebraska. And some health departments, including here in the D.C. area, have created Zika-prevention kits to educate and protect residents.\nSo while federal, state and local leaders have been hard at work, congressional Republicans continue to drag their feet. This is a public health emergency, and Congress needs to stop playing politics with the health and safety of the American people. Congress must pass emergency funding today to ensure we're doing everything in our power to protect pregnant women and children. The House Zika bill provided no new money and did nothing but essentially cannibalize existing funds. And that's clearly not the answer.\nDuring the conference process this week, we ask that members of Congress take their job to protect the American people seriously, and we ask them to provide the full funding that our administration -- that our public health and safety professionals say that we need, and they should take that action before they leave on their Fourth of July recess.\nSo with that, I'm happy to take your questions on the Zika virus or anything else that may be on your mind today. Kathleen, do you want to start?\nQ: Sure. I'm not going to start with Zika, though.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay. (Laughter.)\nQ: I wanted to --\nQ: What? Come on.\nMR. EARNEST: Are you saying that all your questions have been answered?\nQ: All my questions. (Laughter.) No, I wanted to start with the transcripts of the 911 calls in Orlando, if I could. The administration is being criticized for the redactions of those transcripts, and I'm wondering if you could talk to us a little bit about why those transcripts were redacted and whether the FBI should release the full transcript.\nMR. EARNEST: This obviously is pursuant to an ongoing law enforcement investigation. The decision about the release of the transcripts is one that was made solely by Department of Justice and FBI officials. They're doing that consistent with their assessment about the best way to advance the investigation, and so for questions about the transcripts I'd refer you to them.\nQ: You're saying it's not a sensitivity issue; it's actually about advancing the investigation?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm saying that all decisions about releasing the transcripts were made by Department of Justice officials.\nQ: And the White House has no opinion on whether or not those decisions were appropriate?\nMR. EARNEST: The opinion of the White House is that we should not interfere with an ongoing law enforcement investigation, and rather that those decisions should be made consistent with the assessment that is made by law enforcement officials about the best way to advance their investigation.\nQ: Okay. And then just secondly, the Senate is going to hold votes today -- four votes on different gun measures and they're all expected to fail. I'm just wondering if, from the White House perspective, if there's any progress here at all, or if you consider this all sort of political theater of some sort, holding votes that no one expects to pass.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the view of the administration is that the American public should be engaged in the debate. And for too long, we have seen Republicans in Congress use the majority that they have in the Congress to block progress, in some cases even block consideration of common-sense measures that would reduce gun violence.\nSo the fact that this is something that is being actively debated and considered in the Senate does represent some incremental progress. The President has also been pretty blunt about the fact that we won't see the needed change in our gun laws until we start seeing needed changes in Congress. And that's why the President has just used his own executive authority to make as many changes as he can to make our communities safer from gun violence. The President has also vowed to use his political capital and to only support and actively campaign for members of Congress that share his commitment to prioritizing common-sense measures that would reduce gun violence.\nQ: You didn't mention that Senator Susan Collins is supposedly working on some sort of deal. Is that because you don't think that there's any help for any --\nMR. EARNEST: I think it's primarily related to the fact that I haven't seen the results of her work that is reportedly ongoing. So the President's appetite for common-sense gun safety legislation in Congress is well known. And the only way that we'll be able to make progress is by working in bipartisan fashion. Thus far, we've seen a partisan effort on the part of Republicans to shut down that debate and shut down any progress toward passing these common-sense laws. So we obviously would encourage members of Congress to get it done.\nRoberta.\nQ: I guess I'll bite on Zika. (Laughter.) So given all the --\nQ: Aedes aegypti.\nQ: Given all the travel statistics and other information you presented, how do you know that Zika is not being transmitted in the U.S. yet? What makes you confident that it's not happening -- that it's not already being transmitted local yet?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, this is something that local health departments are closely monitoring. So they're obviously aware, as best they can, based on getting reports from local physicians and other health care workers in local communities, about the Zika virus. And when individuals are suspected of having Zika, they are able to go through -- they're able to take some tests to diagnose that disease, and then once the diagnosis has been completed and if they test positive for the disease, and there is some work done to determine how exactly they may have contracted the virus, there have been some instances of sexual transmission of the Zika virus, and that's a source of some concern among public health professionals here as well.\nAnd that's why there is an effort to try to educate the public, particularly men who have partners who are pregnant or could become pregnant, about the risk that they could pose to their partners. So there are some steps that could be taken to significantly mitigate that risk, and we obviously want everyone to be educated so that they know exactly what steps they need to take to prevent the transmission of this disease.\nQ: I wanted to ask about this event on Friday with Mark Zuckerberg that Jeff Zients wrote about today. I guess I'm wondering, given what's happened in Orlando, whether the President is going to be talking at all while he's there in Silicon Valley about new ways to counter extremism on social media, and whether he plans to push Mark Zuckerberg at all on encryption, given that WhatsApp is now fully encrypted, and also whether the President is concerned about the role that Facebook's news algorithms play in campaign coverage.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the focus of the President's panel that includes Mr. Zuckerberg will be on innovation and the important role it plays in a strong U.S. economy. That will be the focus of their discussions. So it's possible that some of these other topics could come up.\nAs it relates to the effort to work with the tech community to counter the strategies of using social media to radicalize vulnerable individuals that's used by ISIL, we've made some important progress in that regard. There has been effective work that the U.S. government and technology companies have been able to cooperate on.\nOn Friday, this past Friday, the President's top homeland security advisor, Lisa Monaco, put out a statement lauding the efforts of an organization called the Counter Extremism Project's National Office for Reporting Extremism. They've been engaged in some work coordinating with counterterrorism professionals and law enforcement and technology to counter the online activities of terrorist organizations. And they have had some success in countering extremism online, and that cooperative effort is something that the President is strongly supportive of. And I think that's why you saw the statement from Lisa Monaco last week.\nAgain, that's not the topic of the panel. I certainly wouldn't rule out that it could come up, though. But we obviously are looking for ways that we can cooperate with organizations like Facebook in the same way that we have in countering things like child pornography, that law enforcement in the United States has been able to work effectively with the tech community to counter the proliferation of child pornography. And we believe that we can effectively pursue a similar strategy to counter radicalizing messages online, as well.\nLet me move around a little bit. Michelle.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. You've often spoken about -- as has the President -- not wanting to play into ISIS's propaganda, not wanting to further the propaganda. And that's what Attorney General Lynch said these redactions are about. So does the White House not want to weigh in on that, and why not?\nMR. EARNEST: Michelle, this is the subject of an ongoing investigation, and the decisions about the investigation are made by law enforcement professionals. And those law enforcement professionals have to balance a lot of different equities, including protecting against potentially playing into ISIL propaganda. They also have an obligation to be as transparent as possible. And I know that the Attorney General indicated that that was an important priority, as well. But how they strike that appropriate balance is a decision that should be left up to our law enforcement professionals, particularly when it comes to something that is so central to the ongoing investigation.\nQ: And she's the one shedding on why, she's making that explanation -- which, again, is something we've heard from the White House a lot as being a priority when you're dealing with things like this. And it's clear that the President cares a lot about sort of the backlash, the rhetoric that has grown up around the President not using the words \"radical Islamic terror.\" We've heard the President's own words, kind of his rebuttal to all of that, a few days ago. So now that Republicans, in particular the Speaker of the House, is saying that these redactions are preposterous, do you worry that that's going to just rev up that sentiment even more?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I haven't seen the statement from the Speaker of the House, but what our law enforcement professionals are doing is they are reviewing the material that's available to them; they're doing their best to follow all the leads to determine what events, what activities, and what conversations led up to this horrific terrorist attack. And the desire of law enforcement officials, as they've publicly stated, is to further the investigation and learn as much as possible, elicit information from the public that may be known to individuals of the public about this individual, and also be as transparent as possible.\nBut, look, it's up to our law enforcement professionals to be focused on the task at hand, not be distracted by politics, and make these decisions consistent with their judgement. And the administration believes that's what they should do.\nQ: And speaking generally, if the redaction of anything is going to be because we don't want something to play into ISIS's propaganda -- but that reason is already known. I mean, the gist of what a person has said is already known and out there. So do you worry that a redaction, even though it's supposed to be in the interest of transparency, is happening for that reason, do you worry that something like that is not preposterous?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, this is up to the FBI and Department of Justice officials to decide. And I'll let them explain their decisions, so I'll leave it to them.\nApril.\nQ: Josh, two subjects. One, I want to ask you a little bit about Donald Trump and this gun issue. The NRA is quipping at what you said about the Orlando shooter and what happened there. What are your thoughts as this gun debate continues? Donald Trump is now lending his voice. The NRA is not necessarily happy with him. And the President cannot get movement on this almost at the end of his term at all. What is all of this mosh right now? This is coming together --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, April, I think the President believes that common-sense gun safety measures is something that should be a priority in the Congress. And unfortunately it's not. And the reason it's not is that Republicans have a majority in the Congress, and they've been unwilling to support common-sense measures that would reduce gun violence without gutting the basic constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans. And that's unfortunate, but that's not just the situation that we find ourselves in here at the end of the Obama presidency. That's a situation that we found ourselves in several years ago, even in the aftermath of a horrific shooting in an elementary school in Connecticut.\nQ: So do you see a glimmer of hope, even as this President is leaving? It may not happen on his watch, but there could be a change in the mindset any time you have the NRA going up against the presumed -- presumptive Republican nominee on issues of violence.\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I think it's unclear exactly how opinions inside the United States Congress are changing, but we are seeing ample evidence that minds across the country are made up in support of common-sense measures that would reduce gun violence. As you've heard me say many times, there's plenty of polling to indicate that it's not just a majority of Democrats who support closing the background check loophole. There's ample evidence to indicate that a majority of Republicans and a majority of gun owners share the same view.\nSo that, you would think, would lead to overwhelming support for something like the amendment that's been put forward by Senator Murphy that will get considered by the Senate later today. This would ensure that everyone who tries to purchase a gun is subject to a background check. That's a common-sense proposition, but yet one that is overwhelmingly opposed by Republicans. That is unfortunate. But that's why the President has observed that we're only going to see the change we'd like to see in gun safety laws when we see a change in Congress.\nQ: And I'm trying to get you to kind of take the fight from what I'm -- Donald Trump, NRA -- got anything on that?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't.\nQ: Okay, great. Moving on to the next subject. Twitter was abuzz last night with a story about the Supreme Court -- Justice Clarence Thomas mulling over the possibilities of retiring. What say you as there is an opening right now and there's no hearing set for your nominee? This could be two openings before he leaves.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I don't have any insight into the future career plans of any Supreme Court justices at this point. But, look, the fact that we have gone this far without Republicans in the Senate being willing to give a hearing to the President's nominee to fill the current vacancy in the Supreme Court is extraordinary, it's unprecedented, and it's terrible for our system of democracy. And it is an escalation of partisan politics into a branch of government that we have gone to great lengths to try to insulate from partisan divisions. That's unfortunate.\nAnd it's particularly unfortunate when you consider that the President put forward a nominee that has more judicial experience than any other Supreme Court nominee in American history. The President put forward a nominee that even Republicans acknowledge is a consensus pick. You've got Republicans publicly admitting that the only reason that they're not considering this individual is because he was nominated by a Democratic President. All of that sets up a situation that is entirely inconsistent with what the Framers of our Constitution intended. It's ironic because that kind of situation has been precipitated by a bunch of people who describe themselves as strict interpreters of the Constitution.\nSo, unfortunately, however, rationality and facts and appeals for fairness have fallen on deaf ears in the Republican conference of the United States Senate. And that's unfortunate when you consider the profound impact it has on our system of government.\nQ: -- has President Obama met with Clarence Thomas at all during his time here?\nMR. EARNEST: Not that I can think of off the top of my head.\nRon.\nQ: On the terrorism attacks, the President and others noted that the last two were American citizens who are I guess -- a lone wolf. Is there anything new that the administration is doing to focus in on that particular problem, that particular threat that the country faces now that this is such a -- again, pushing back about the immigration debate, the radical Islam -- what's really being done about this phenomenon of home-grown terrorism?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Ron, there are a couple of things that come to mind. The first is that the FBI has more than 100 joint terrorism task forces that are at work all across the country. These task forces are essentially a way to integrate federal resources and state and local law enforcement resources to fight terrorism. And these task forces are focused on trying to prevent suspected terrorists from moving forward with a terrorist act. And it is not uncommon for the Department of Justice to issue news releases announcing the results of a joint terrorism task force investigation to announce the arrest of an individual who is planning to carry out a terrorist attack.\nSo that certainly is one way that we -- and when I say \"we\" I mean primarily the law enforcement community is keeping the American people safe. The other thing that we are very focused on is countering the use of social media by extremist organizations to radicalize people who could be vulnerable to that kind of inspiration. And that is relevant in the two cases that you cited because these are American citizens who the evidence indicates was potentially heavily influenced by this online propaganda.\nQ: Is there some effort to increase the size of those task forces? Is there some staffing increase, some change in their scope, or is that the essence of their response?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'd refer you to the FBI for consideration of the question about whether or not they feel like additional resources are needed to ensure the success of these ongoing investigations.\nQ: And just on the guns front, I think that people sort of asked this and I think you've said essentially the President has exhausted his range of -- what he sees as his range of options in terms of executive action and it's basically on the Congress. There's nothing more in the seven and a half months or so that he has left that he can do.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, you actually -- just because you asked the question that way, you did remind me of a third thing that we certainly could do that would make the country safer from the risks that you outlined, and that is we could close the loophole that currently allows individuals who are on the no-fly list but are still, right now, under existing law, able to walk into a gun store and buy a gun. The President thinks that that is a policy that only endangers the American people.\nThe truth is, if it is too dangerous for you to board an airplane it should be too dangerous for you to buy a gun. And that's why we strongly support the amendment that Senator Feinstein has put forward to try to close that loophole.\nQ: In terms of -- you've often talked about -- scrubbing the laws and so forth -- there's really nothing expected that he thinks he can do?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President and his team announced a set of executive actions early this year that would have an impact on individuals who are seeking to circumvent getting background checks. But there are a number of things that are tied up in those proposals that include increasing funding for the ATF to allow them to hire 200 more agents that would more effectively enforce the gun laws that are on the books.\nAgain, you hear Republicans in Congress saying that they believe that gun laws that are already on the books should be more effectively enforced. But yet they are blocking funding to hire additional resources and additional officers who would do exactly that. So it's a little hard to take their prescriptions particularly seriously.\nBut the President believes that the country would be safer if there were more ATF officers on the beat enforcing our gun laws and protecting the American people.\nQ: When can we expect that event that the President cancelled with Senator Clinton to happen again? Soon?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have date for you. Obviously coordinating the schedules of Secretary Clinton and President Obama is complicated, particularly this time of year. Both of them are quite busy. But there are active conversations that the President's senior aide David Simas, who handles these political matters, is having with the Clinton campaign to determine a mutually agreeable time for us to reschedule that event.\nQ: Perhaps this week?\nMR. EARNEST: I just don't have an update for you. But when we do, we'll let you know.\nQ: Just lastly, on conversations, are there any further conversations between the President and Senator Sanders, and what is his status? What does the President see as his status? He's still running for President, apparently.\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any additional conversations that the President has had with Senator Sanders since he was here a couple weeks ago now.\nQ: Senator Sanders is still running for President.\nMR. EARNEST: It does appear that way. But as you've heard me say for a couple of weeks now, Senator Sanders has earned the support of more than 10 million Democrats across the country and he certainly is entitled to make his own decisions about his own campaign on his own schedule.\nKevin. Welcome back.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. Appreciate that. Good to see you. Has the President been briefed on the violence -- the latest violence in Afghanistan that took place over the weekend?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know if the President has received a specific briefing on this. Obviously we have seen those reports, and obviously we condemn these actions that at least in one case targeted innocent civilians, and in another case targeted essentially peacekeepers. So that's -- this does underscore the difficult security situation that continues to exist in Afghanistan. And the United States and our NATO partners continue to stand with the Afghan government as they counter the threat from extremists and terrorists inside their own country.\nQ: I want to throw some numbers past you. In 2011, there were approximately 97,000 American service personnel in Afghanistan, and that number has been cut to roughly just under 10,000 now. Has there been any reconsideration or regret, if you will, in dropping that number down given the increase or uptick in violence in Afghanistan?\nMR. EARNEST: There has not, Kevin, and the decisions that the President has been making about appropriate troop levels and about an appropriate military posture in Afghanistan is consistent with the guidance and advice that he's receiving not just from his military advisors on the ground and at the Pentagon, but also the rest of his national security team. And the --\nQ: But the last time we talked you said the drawdown was under review -- because I remember specifically that I think it was 2014, you suggested that the President wanted to get it down maybe even to 1,000, maybe just sort of making sure that the embassy was safe there. But that plan has been under review. So I'm wondering if that review is ongoing, and if that has been reconsidered completely given the circumstances on the ground.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, you'll recall, Kevin, that a month or so ago -- maybe it was longer ago than that -- General Campbell transitioned out of the job as commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, General Nicholson transitioned in. And in the early stages of his tenure, General Nicholson has been conducting a review to determine the appropriate military posture for U.S. servicemembers on the ground in Afghanistan. And that includes a review of the number of troops that he believes he needs to succeed in the mission that the President has given him.\nThat review is still ongoing. The latest update that I heard at the end of last week is that the results of that review have not been relayed to the President at this point. But the President is working very closely with the members of his national security team and our military commanders on the most effective way for us to protect our interests in Afghanistan. And that means making sure that Afghanistan cannot be used as a safe haven for terrorist organizations that seek to do harm against the United States. It means fulfilling the commitments that we have made both militarily but also financially and diplomatically to the Afghan government.\nAt the end of 2014, the Afghan government did assume responsibility for the security situation in Afghanistan, and in that time, U.S. forces and NATO forces have been working to train up Afghan security forces and to support them as they take on this very difficult challenge.\nQ: Are you satisfied with the pace of that training?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'd refer you to DOD for an update on that assessment. I think overall in Afghanistan I don't think anybody can be satisfied with the ongoing violence that we see there. And the good news is that we have seen Afghan security forces be quite resilient, that they have demonstrated a clear willingness to fight for their country, that they do have the commitment and the drive to take significant risks and to put themselves in harm's way to try to defeat the extremists that are wreaking havoc in their country.\nAnd the American people and our NATO partners and our men and women in uniform stand with the Afghan government and the Afghan security forces as they undertake that difficult mission. But this is a mission that has consequences for U.S. national security.\nQ: A couple more. One on Garland and one on the Syrian refugees. Is there a reason -- and forgive me if you've covered this -- is there a reason to want to accelerate the number of Syrian refugees that might be brought here to this country?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, the goal that the President has set is for the end of this fiscal year -- so, basically, by the end of September -- for 10,000 Syrian refugees to be admitted to the United States. These individuals, however, have to undergo the most rigorous screening of any individual that attempts to enter the United States. These individuals have to undergo a background check. They have to submit biographical and biometric information that is then run through a variety of data bases that are maintained by law enforcement, intelligence community and military organizations.\nQ: Is that for all refugees, or just Syrian refugees?\nMR. EARNEST: That's for all refugees, but certainly includes Syrian refugees. The reason I mention it here is that the President has indicated a desire to try to increase the number of Syrian refugees in this fiscal year, but the President has made clear that we're not going to cut any security corners in meeting that goal.\nBut the Department of Homeland Security, our intelligence community, and the Department of State are actively working to meet that goal. There's been some reporting in recent weeks that the administration is behind pace to meet that goal, but we continue to be hopeful that as we continue to increase resources that are dedicated to that effort, we may still be able to reach that goal. Certainly the officials who are working closely on this are aware of that goal and understand that it's a priority.\nQ: Last, on Merrick Garland, is it time for the President to head back to the Hill? Or is it just time to give up? I mean, it's been a while, and Chief Judge Garland doesn't appear to be getting any traction. Is there anything planned for this week that you can let us know about?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have any updates in terms of the President's schedule. But this is still a priority, and this is still a level of obstruction that we haven't seen before. And we continue to see Republicans struggling to explain their position. Unfortunately, that discomfort has not translated into tangible legislative action.\nBut, look, I think the American people understand the stakes of filling a Supreme Court vacancy. And the American people understand that the President has done his job by appointing a highly experienced, very well-regarded nominee that even Republicans have described as a consensus nominee. Unfortunately, Republicans in the Senate refuse to do their job. And it's not that they won't support this individual, they won't even consider Chief Judge Garland. They won't even give him a hearing. They won't even give him a vote.\nAnd even some Republican senators have criticized that posture. Even Senator Kirk has said that the Senate should \"man up and vote\" on Chief Judge Garland's nomination. And in that regard, he's correct.\nJustin.\nQ: First, I was wondering if you had any comment on Donald Trump's decision to dismiss his campaign manager today.\nMR. EARNEST: I do not.\nQ: I wanted to ask about Brexit. The vote is obviously later this week, and we've talked about it a few times, but I'm wondering if you could maybe address specifically any steps the U.S. government, the Obama administration are taking to prepare for the possibility that Britain could leave the EU, and whether there are specific areas of concern, from treaties, from trade deals or anything like that where you guys are kind of looking at what the ramifications of an exit would be.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Justin, with regard to our position -- this is something that you've heard the President communicate directly, including when he was in London earlier this year -- the United States of America continues to believe and value a strong U.K. and a strong EU. So the British people will decide what they believe is in the best interest of their country, but the President has made clear what he believes is in the best interest of the United States. And given the special relationship between our two countries, we believe that that matters. How much that matters, though, will ultimately be up to the British people to decide.\nWith regard to contingency planning, there are various aspects of the federal government that are quite focused on a wide range of contingencies for which they need to plan. So I'm confident that somebody somewhere in the U.S. government is considering what sort of contingencies may need to be considered in the event that this vote goes down in the direction of the U.K. leaving the EU. But I don't have any details about that. I think the polling indicates that this continues to be an uncertain outcome at this point. But this is a decision that will be made by the British people, as it should be.\nQ: I was wondering if you could describe the President's plan for signing the chemical safety bill this week. And also, some critics of the legislation say it handcuffs the ability of states like California to press forward with tougher chemical safety regulations, and so why the legislation's positives, which you guys have extolled, sort of speaks to that or overwhelms that in your guys' mind.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we can do just a scheduling announcement here -- that on Wednesday, the President will sign H.R. 2576, which is better known as the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act. The signing ceremony will take place in the South Court Auditorium, and there will be members of Congress, advocates and organizations that played a critical role in passing this legislation.\nThis is a rare instance of strong bipartisan support for a piece of legislation. We haven't seen a lot of that over the last year and a half, but I think that is an indication of how this bill could ultimately make our communities safer. And I think any time you see Democrats and Republicans come together on a piece of legislation, it does reflect a measure of compromise, which means that there may be some people who will criticize it because it's not perfect. But the President believes strongly that by instituting more uniform standards, we can more effectively regulate substances that are used in consumer products in a way that ultimately will better protect the American people. And the President was pleased to see Democrats and Republicans come together in strong support of this bill.\nQ: Last one. I assume you guys were happy that the Supreme Court decided to review a lower court ruling that had sort of thrown into doubt the President's ability to temporarily fill top government jobs. But I'm wondering if you can talk about that, and also if there's concern that, because of the way the Supreme Court operates with vacancies, that if this comes down to a split decision you could see a good number of the President's sort of nominees or appointees have their actions sort of invalidated by the split-court decision.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, Justin, we continue to have a lot of confidence in the legal power of the arguments that we'll be making in this case. So I don't want to handicap the outcome at this point because it's something that the Supreme Court has now agreed to consider. So we'll have an opportunity to make an argument before the Supreme Court, and we feel confident that we have a strong argument to make.\nBut look, with regard to filling vacancies, I do think that this underscores another element of congressional dysfunction. There are critically important jobs that don't have confirmed officials leading them. And that's a significant problem when you're talking about our counterterrorism strategy.\nSo we've talked a lot in here about Adam Szubin. This is a career professional who has served in both administrations who is the point person for implementing our sanctions against terrorist organizations, and even state sponsors of terrorism around the globe. He's a financial expert, and he was nominated more than a year ago and has still not gotten the vote that he needs on the floor of the United States Senate.\nThe same could be true of Beth Cobert. Beth is somebody who was nominated almost a year ago to lead the Office of Personnel Management, and yet for reasons that Republicans are unable to articulate, she has not gotten a vote either, despite the fact that she is unquestionably qualified for the job.\nSo this underscores I think a little of the frustration that we have about this particular case, because the way that it's been interpreted by some courts essentially suggests that individuals can't do the job if they haven't been confirmed by Congress, but yet when you have as many examples as we have of a Congress refusing to confirm individuals that are unquestionably qualified, you start to see the process break down. And it means that critically important functions like implementing sanctions against terrorist organizations, or managing the human resources of the entire federal workforce are undermined by a dysfunctional Congress.\nSo we'll make our arguments before the Supreme Court. But we certainly would appreciate a more conscientious Congress fulfilling their basic responsibility to ensure that our government can work.\nBill.\nQ: Was the executive branch consulted in any way by the Justice Department about the release of the 911 transcript?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the Department of Justice is part of the executive branch, but the White House --\nQ: Make it the Executive Office of the President, if you wish.\nMR. EARNEST: This is a decision that was made entirely by the Department of Justice and by officials at the FBI.\nQ: No consultation with the Office of the President?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I can't speak to every single conversation, but I'm not aware of one.\nQ: So the censorship was not at all reviewed here?\nMR. EARNEST: It was not. This was a decision that was made solely by officials at the Department of Justice and the FBI consistent with their need to be as transparent as possible about the investigation, but also to make sure that they could advance the investigation by eliciting additional information about the suspect from the public.\nQ: Might they have received some guidance beforehand from here?\nMR. EARNEST: No, they did not.\nJerome.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Secretary of State John Kerry said today that he had read the dissent cable about the White House Syria strategy and he found it \"very good.\" I was wondering whether the President had read the cable and whether he shared that view.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I do not know whether or not the President has read the cable. I think, as you heard my colleague indicate at the end of last week, the President does believe that having a procedure in place for State Department employees to make their dissenting views known is valuable.\nAnd so the process that's in place is worthwhile. But I think we've been just as clear about the President's policy in Syria, how it has not led yet to the results that we would like to see in Syria, but it has prevented a repetition of mistakes that previous administrations have made. So, for example, the President has been quite clear that the United States, not anyone else, will be successful. Let me say that more clearly: The United States will not be successful, nor will anyone else, in imposing a military solution on the problems inside of Syria. That, I think, is a basic lesson that we learned after the 2003 invasion of Iraq that was ordered by the previous administration.\nThat is a simple lesson learned, and it's one that we should keep in mind as we confront the situation inside of Syria. What's also true is our efforts inside of Syria right now are focused on ISIL. And any careful consideration of directing military assets or intelligence assets against the Assad regime means that there are fewer assets and resources that are being directed at ISIL. And ISIL is the terrorist organization that poses a threat to the United States and our interests around the world.\nSo that's why we have maintained this intense focus on ISIL. But what's also true is that our diplomats at the State Department have been working tirelessly and tenaciously to build international consensus -- and they've succeeded in this -- about the need for a political transition inside of Syria. And we've gotten organizations -- I mean, we've gotten countries like Russia and even Iran, that we know are strong supporters of the Assad regime, that are making at least vaguely constructive contributions to the ongoing process to facilitate a political transition.\nThat international pressure is going to be critical to our success. And we have seen that that international pressure has succeeded in putting in place a cessation of hostilities that has not worked nearly as well as we would have liked. But there are places where that cessation of hostilities has allowed significant humanitarian relief to be provided to hundreds of thousands of Syrians who desperately need it.\nSo that's the explanation for the policy that we have pursued thus far. And when you're dealing with a situation as complicated and as difficult and as high stakes as the situation inside of Syria, trying to stifle dissent is the wrong option. The President welcomes ideas from anyone that has a good one. But the President has been just as clear about the kinds of principles that we need to abide by in order to protect our interests.\nAnd the truth is, the strategy that we have pursued thus far has yielded some important results. We just haven't gotten as far as we'd like.\nQ: Would the President be ready to meet these diplomats?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any meeting like that that's on the books, but if something like that were to happen we'll let you know.\nJohn.\nQ: I wanted to follow up on Kevin's question about Merrick Garland and to see if you could give me a better sense of what he's been up to the last weeks, up to this week. When we got started, you were giving us a lot of information about senators that he was meeting with and kind of giving us updates on the number of senators he's met with. Do you have any --\nMR. EARNEST: I can get you the specific numbers. I think that he's met with just about every single Democratic senator in the United States Senate, and we've yet to see a Democratic senator say he doesn't deserve a hearing and a vote. And he's met with a number of Republican senators, at least of couple of them who have indicated that he does deserve a hearing and a vote.\nSo this is the situation that we find ourselves in right now. And we're going to continue to make a public case that Republicans in the Senate should stop blocking the most experienced Supreme Court nominee in American history. And I say he's the most experienced Supreme Court nominee in our history because he's spent more time on the federal bench than any other Supreme Court nominee in history.\nSo this is the current situation. We've got Republicans in the Senate who are refusing to do their job. And in this case, it has unfortunate and significant consequences for the successful functioning of our democracy.\nQ: What's he up to this week? Does he have any meetings on the Hill? Are you guys continuing to look for those, schedule those?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there aren't -- I believe at this point he has now met with 16 Republican senators. That means there are more than 30 who have abided by the request of the Senate Majority Leader to not meet with him. That's unfortunate, and I'm not sure how those senators reconcile that position back home -- they say I'm not going to do my job because the Republican leader in the Senate told me not to. But that's a position that they've taken thus far.\nQ: And then just two quick questions about maybe some possible phone calls the President might make. Has he called anybody in the Clinton family to congratulate them on the newest addition to their family?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any calls like that, but obviously when the President heard the news about the birth of Chelsea Clinton's second child, he was obviously pleased to hear it.\nQ: And then secondly, with the Cleveland Cavaliers championship win last night, has the President called anybody at their organization? And does he intend to invite them to the White House before he leaves office?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm confident the President is looking forward to the chance that he'll have to congratulate the Cleveland Cavaliers on their world championship victory last night. The President obviously had a chance to watch the end of the game on Air Force One last night, and I would expect that in the next day or two he will be making a call either to the head coach or somebody in the front office in Cleveland to congratulate them on their victory and to invite them to the White House.\nI don't know whether or not we'll have a chance to schedule that visit before the President leaves office, but I'm sure the President is hoping we'll be able to do that.\nJC.\nQ: In a little over two weeks, right after the Fourth of July break, the President is heading to Warsaw for the NATO summit. Notwithstanding what happens this week in the vote with Great Britain to withdraw from the EU, London being the second-largest and most powerful financial capital after New York, and other issues that are going on in Europe at the moment, what role will the President be playing and what are the major concerns the President has as he participates in the last NATO Summit of his administration?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't want to speculate about the outcome of the U.K. election later this week. So setting that aside, the President has valued the kind of close coordination that the United States has enjoyed with our NATO allies since the President took office. And one of his goals upon taking office, and I think one of his achievements upon leaving it, is succeeding in strengthening and deepening that alliance in a way that has a tangible impact, a positive one, on U.S. national security.\nSo there certainly are a range of questions to be discussed at the NATO Summit. I would anticipate that there will be an ongoing discussion about the situation in Afghanistan. Obviously, NATO has made a significant contribution to our efforts there, and we've been pleased by the contribution -- by the impact that their contribution has made.\nI would anticipate that there will be continued discussion of the security situation in Europe, including the challenge presented by the flow of migrants into Europe. This obviously is not just a pretty desperate humanitarian situation, but this is a situation that has an impact on the security situation inside of Europe. And the President had the opportunity to discuss that situation with some of our European allies when he was last in Europe earlier this spring. I would anticipate that something like that would come up again.\nAnd there continues to be a unanimity of opinion in Europe about the importance of protecting the principle of sovereignty, and that's why you've seen so many European nations stand with Ukraine as they confront repeated violations of their sovereignty by the Russians.\nSo there's plenty on the agenda. We'll certainly have more of an opportunity to talk about it as that trip gets closer.\nLalit.\nQ: Thank you. Forty-eight members of the Nuclear Suppliers Group are meeting in Seoul tomorrow, and India has applied for its membership. The President has supported it. What are the expectations of the meeting tomorrow? And what is the message the U.S. is sending to these countries for the meeting?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Lalit, the President did have an opportunity to discuss this issue with Prime Minister Modi when he was here at the White House a couple of weeks ago. The United States, as you know, strongly supports India's application to join the Nuclear Suppliers Group. We believe -- and this has been U.S. policy for some time -- that India is ready for membership. And the United States calls on participating governments to support India's application at the plenary later this week.\nAt the same time, participating governments will need to reach a consensus decision in order to admit any applicant into the group. And the United States will certainly be advocating for India's membership.\nQ: Has the U.S. reached out to this country or some of the countries who are opposing the membership?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have any conversations to read out at this point. But we've made our views known both publicly and privately, and we'll continue to do so in advance of the meeting this week.\nYes.\nQ: Hi. Okay, so going back to the Orlando 911 calls, is the White House at all concerned that redacting such large portions of the calls may help feed conspiracy theories that may be circulating?\nMR. EARNEST: No. I think that there's been a pretty blunt discussion of this situation. And these are decisions that are made by the Department of Justice and investigators at the FBI, and so we'll leave it to them to handle it.\nGardiner, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Sure. I got a question from our foreign desk. There's an escalating crackdown on the political opposition -- the Sunni monarchy in Bahrain said Monday that it had revoked the citizenship of a top cleric who is regarded as a spiritual voice of the Shiite majority. This is obviously a crucial country for the United States. It's where we have a huge Navy that -- fleet is there. The United States has continued to encourage this monarchy to not be quite so tough on the Shia minority. Do you have a reaction to this, Josh?\nMR. EARNEST: Gardiner, I have to admit I'm not aware of this particular situation.\nQ: Okay.\nMR. EARNEST: So I can get you a more specific response to it. Obviously, the President has regularly advocated for better protection of basic universal human rights, and the President believes that that is important not just because these are values that we hold dear in this country, but the President believes that it's in the best interest of countries around the world to organize themselves and to govern their country consistent with the recognition of these universal human rights.\nBut let me see if I can get you a more specific response to that particular situation.\nQ: You passed on this question before, but let me just rephrase it differently. Does firing a campaign manager by a nominee suggest there's a problem in the campaign?\nMR. EARNEST: I'll let the wide array of outside analysts who are closely monitoring the campaign weigh in on that decision.\nQ: And one other thing. On the editing of the transcript of the calls, it was just sort of a strange thing there in that this is a state function. There is a very good state Sunshine Act in Florida. Presumably -- I'm wondering why you think that it's appropriate for the FBI, which clearly is taking the lead in the investigation, but for the FBI to step on what is a state function with this very good state open-records law in this immediate time. Because presumably that open-records law will allow these records to come out fairly quickly, no?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, this decision was made by the FBI, and I'm confident they did that consistent with their interpretation of the law. Obviously, their interpretation matters a lot because, as you pointed out, they're in charge of the investigation, they have the lead on the investigation. And this particular transcript obviously is central to that ongoing investigation. But for how they arrived at that conclusion I'd refer you to them.\nThanks, everybody. Enjoy the rest of your Monday.\nEND 2:40 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2016-06-20", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118060", "text": "The Smart Manufacturing Innovation Institute, headquartered in Los Angeles, CA, brings over $140 million in public-private investment from leading universities and manufacturers to develop smart sensors for use in advanced manufacturing.\nThroughout this week, the Obama Administration will be highlighting America's capacity for creativity and invention and how our innovative progress over the last seven and a half years has helped continue to make our economy the strongest and most durable in the world. As part of this effort, today, at the third-annual SelectUSA Summit in Washington, DC, before an audience of business leaders, economic development officials, and investors from around the world, President Obama will announce that the Smart Manufacturing Leadership Coalition (SMLC) will lead the new Smart Manufacturing Innovation Institute, in partnership with the Department of Energy. The winning coalition, headquartered in Los Angeles, California brings together a consortium of nearly 200 partners from across academia, industry, and non-profits—hailing from more than thirty states—to spur advances in smart sensors and digital process controls that can radically improve the efficiency of U.S. advanced manufacturing.\nThe Smart Manufacturing Innovation Institute is the ninth manufacturing hub awarded by the Obama Administration. Today, the President also announced the launch of five new manufacturing hub competitions, which will invest nearly $800 million in combined federal and non-federal resources to support transformative manufacturing technologies from collaborative robotics to biofabrication of cells and tissues, to revolutionizing the ways materials can be reused and recycled. With the new competitions underway, the Administration is on track to meet the President's goal of a National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI) of 15 institutes underway across the country before the end of his Administration.\nAfter a decade of decline from 2000 to 2010, the U.S. manufacturing sector has added over 800,000 jobs since February 2010 and remains more competitive for jobs and investment today compared to recent decades. And just last month, a new survey of CEOs from around the world declared the United States the most attractive country for investment for the fourth year in a row.\nAnnouncing New Manufacturing Innovation Institute Award and Competitions\nThe Smart Manufacturing Innovation Institute being announced today, the ninth institute government-wide awarded to-date, will focus on innovations like smart sensors that can dramatically reduce energy expenses in advanced manufacturing, making our manufacturing sector strong today and positioning the United States to lead the manufacturing of tomorrow, helping sustain the resurgence of U.S. manufacturing currently underway. The Smart Manufacturing Leadership Coalition will bring together nearly 200 partners to launch the Smart Manufacturing Innovation Institute, focused on accelerating the development and adoption of advanced sensors, data analytics, and controls in manufacturing, while reducing the cost of these technologies by half and radically improving the efficiency of U.S. advanced manufacturing.\nIn addition, the newly announced manufacturing innovation institute topics now under competition include:\n• Robotics in Manufacturing Environments Manufacturing Innovation Institute. In collaboration with the Department of Defense, the newest manufacturing institute will focus on building U.S. leadership in smart collaborative robotics, where advanced robots work alongside humans seamlessly, safely, and intuitively to do the heavy lifting on an assembly line or handle with precision, intricate or dangerous tasks. People collaborating with robots has the potential to change a broad swath of manufacturing sectors, from defense and space to automotive and health, enabling the reliable and efficient production of high-quality, customized products.\n• Advanced Tissue Biofabrication Manufacturing Innovation Institute. In collaboration with the Department of Defense, the Institutewill pioneer next-generation manufacturing techniques for repairing and replacing cells and tissues, which may one day lead to the ability to manufacture new skin for soldiers scarred from combat or to produce life-saving organs for the too many Americans stuck on transplant waiting lists today. The Institute will focus on solving the cross-cutting manufacturing challenges that stand in the way of producing new synthetic tissues and organs - such as improving the availability, reproducibility, accessibility, and standardization of manufacturing materials, technologies, and processes to create tissue and organ products. We expect collaborations across multiple disciplines; from 3D bio-printing, cell science, and process design, automated pharmaceutical screening methods to the supply chain expertise needed to rapidly produce and transport these live-saving materials.\n• Modular Chemical Process Intensification (MCPI) Institute. In collaboration with the Department of Energy, the Institute will fundamentally redesign the process used for manufacturing chemicals, refining fuels, and producing other high-value products by combining many complex processing stages into one simple and streamlined step. Process intensification breakthroughs can dramatically shrink the footprint of equipment needed on a crowded factory floor or eliminate waste by using the raw input materials more efficiently. For example, by simplifying and shrinking the process, this approach could enable natural gas refining directly at the wellhead, saving up to half of the energy lost in the ethanol cracking process today. In the chemical industry alone, these technologies could save more than $9 billion annually in process costs.\n• Reducing Embodied Energy and Decreasing Emissions (REMADE) in Materials Manufacturing Institute. In collaboration with the Department of Energy, the Institute will focus on reducing the total lifetime use of energy in manufactured materials by developing new cradle-to-cradle technologies for the reuse, recycling, and remanufacturing of manmade materials. U.S. manufacturing consumes nearly a third of the nation's total energy use annually, with much of that energy embodied in the physical products made in manufacturing. New technologies to better repurpose these materials could save U.S. manufacturers and the nation up to 1.6 quadrillion BTU of energy annually, equivalent to 280 million barrels of oil, or a month's worth of that nation's oil imports.\n• Industry-proposed Institutes Competition. Leveraging authorities from legislation passed with broad bipartisan support in Congress, the Department of Commerce has launched the first \"open topic\" institute competition. This competition is open to any topic proposed by industry not already addressed by a manufacturing innovation institute. At least one institute will be awarded using FY2016 funds, and one or more will be awarded subject to the availability of additional funds. The open topic competition design allows industry to propose technology areas seen as critical by leading manufacturers to the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing.\nHeadquartered in Los Angeles, CA, the Smart Manufacturing Innovation Institute will also launch five regional manufacturing centers across the United States each focused on local technology transfer and workforce development. UCLA will lead the California regional center, in partnership with the city of Los Angeles harnessing the ability to tap the largest manufacturing base in the United States. Texas A&M University will lead the Gulf Coast center—a region anchored in the chemical, oil and gas sectors—and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) will lead the Northeast center, where glass, ceramic and microelectronic manufacturing has a strong presence. Pacific Northwest National Laboratory will lead a hub in the Northwest and NC State will spearhead a regional hub for the Southeast.\nTo ensure that all American businesses, regardless of their size or potential resource limitations, have the opportunity to benefit from the institute's progress, the Smart Manufacturing Innovation Institute will use an open-source digital platform and technology marketplace to integrate advanced sensors, controls, platforms, and modeling technologies into commercial smart manufacturing systems. The institute will also provide the manufacturing communities with easy and affordable access to real-time analytic tools, infrastructure, and industrial applications.\nThrough the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation, the new Smart Manufacturing Innovation Institute will partner with three existing manufacturing innovation institutes to pioneer technologies at the intersection of their unique capabilities. For example, the Smart Manufacturing Innovation Institute will partner with IACMI to demonstrate the value of using advanced sensors in the production of carbon fiber and with PowerAmerica to showcase the energy savings of using advanced sensors in the production of new wide bandgap semiconductor circuit boards.\nIndustry Partners: Aerospace Corporation; Alcoa; Analog Devices; ANSYS; ArcellorMittal; Autodesk; BASF Corporation; Bonneville Power Administration; Corning; Emerson Process Management; ExxonMobil; General Mills; Global Foundries; Google; KUKA Systems North America; Microsoft; Northrop Grumman; OSIsoft; Pfizer; Praxair; Rockwell Automation; Saint-Gobain; Southern California Edison; United States Steel Corporation; United Technologies Research Center; Medium: A&E Engineering Inc.; LanzaTech; Materia; SEVA; TowerJazz; Small: Able Industrial Products Inc.; Accurate Dial & Nameplate; Advanced Polymer Monitoring Technologies; Apex; APS Technology; Baja Designs; Banks Integration; Bonanza Associates; Citrine Informatics; EnerG2; Eon Reality; GMS Industrial Supply; Goodyear Rubber; Greenway Energy; HannahMax Baking; Industrial Automation Consulting; Infologic, Inc.; Information Systems Associates; Loman CSI-Consortium/Resource; Makai Ocean engineering; Martin Control Systems; Nila; Nimbis Services; One Cycle Control; Process Systems Enterprise Inc.; RES Group; Satelles: Savigent Software; Space Micro; Summertree Interiors Newport Cottages; SyncFab; ThinkIQ; Viewpoint Systems; VIMANA System Insights; Vinatech Engineering Inc.; VRCO; and many more small and medium-sized manufacturers.\nLocal and State Organizations: California Chamber of Commerce; City of Los Angeles; Energy Trust of Oregon ; Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce; LAnSync, National Association of State Energy Officials; Oregon Department of Energy; PortTech LA; State Energy Conservation Office; State of California; State of Connecticut; State of Louisiana Board of Regents; State of Washington; Texas Workforce Commission Manufacturing Enterprise Program (MEP): California Manufacturing Technology Consulting (CMTC), North Carolina MEP , Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station; Investing in Manufacturing Community Partnerships (IMCP): Advanced Manufacturing Partnership for Southern California (AMP SoCal); Pacific Northwest Manufacturing Partnership ; Puget Sound Regional Council.\nAcademic Partners and Research Institutes: Community Colleges: (Brazosport, California Community Colleges (113), Chaffey; Irvine Valley; Lee, Long Beach City) California Institute for Telecommunications; Cal State U (Long Beach; Poly Pomona, Northridge); California Community Colleges Centers for Applied Competitive Technologies; Clemson U.; Georgia Institute of Technology; Idaho National Laboratory; Jet Propulsion National Laboratory; Lamar U.; Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory; Louisiana State U.; Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Michigan Tech Rail Transportation Program; Michigan Technological U.; Missouri U. of Science & Technology; Montana Gallatin College; Montana State U.; MontanaTech; National Energy Technology National Laboratory; National Renewable Energy Laboratoroy; North Carolina State U.; Oak Ridge National Laboratory; Oregon State U.; Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; Pennsylvania State U.; Purdue U.; Purdue U.

The Federal government's commitment of over $600 million to the nine awarded institutes has been matched by over $1.2 billion in non-Federal resources from across industry, academia, and state governments. Already these institutes are having an impact - from helping Rochester, NY attract over $1.4 billion and 800 manufacturing jobs through new photonics companies to pioneering the first FDA approved 3D-printed medical device.\nAlready, these investments are generating wins for U.S. manufacturing:\n• To help anchor production of new semiconductor technologies in the United States and accelerate the commercialization of advanced power electronics, in March, the Power America Manufacturing Innovation Institute successfully partnered with X-FAB in Lubbock, TX, to upgrade a $100 million dollar foundry to produce cost-competitive, next-generation semiconductors, enabling new business opportunities to sustain hundreds of jobs.\n• Using next-generation metals manufacturing techniques, Lightweight Innovations for Tomorrow (LIFT), the Detroit institute focused on lightweight metals, has successfully reduced the weight of core metal parts found in cars and trucks by 40 percent, improving fuel efficiency and saving consumers dollars at the pump. In addition, LIFT has introduced curriculum in 22 states to train workers on the use of lightweight metals. This summer, 38 companies will host students in paid manufacturing internship in partnership with LIFT.\n• America Makes has attracted hundreds of millions of dollars in new manufacturing investment to its region, including helping to attract GE's new $32 million global 3D printing hub and spurring Alcoa to invest $60 million in its New Kensington, PA facilities, both of which will benefit from proximity to America Makes and its expertise in 3D printing with metal powders.\n• In addition, America Makes, with Deloitte and other partners, has created a free online course on the fundamentals of 3D printing for businesses. Over the last year, over 14,000 business leaders have taken this course to learn what 3D printing can do for their businesses.\nTo learn more about the open competitions for these next manufacturing innovation institutes, please visit Manufacturing.gov.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "The President spoke at 12:30 p.m. in the International Ballroom at the Washington Hilton Hotel. In his remarks, he referred to Secretary of Commerce Penny S. Pritzker; and Vinai K. Thummalapally, Executive Director, SelectUSA initiative at the International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117870", "text": "Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Please have a seat, have a seat. Well, let me begin by thanking Penny, not only for her kind words and friendship, but for her outstanding leadership in promoting American business and making the case for commercial diplomacy. Congratulations not only to Penny, but also her entire team, especially my dear friend Vinai Thummalapally, on yet another sold-out summit. Give Vinai a big round of applause.\nThose of you who do not know Vinai, he's a former Ambassador and, more importantly, was one of my roommates in college. [Laughter] So he got his job on the merits—[laughter]—but it is true that he has some compromising information—[laughter]—that if it was ever fully disclosed, I'd be in trouble. [Laughter] But he has done an outstanding job.\nTo all of you who have crossed oceans to be here, welcome. And to all of my Cabinet Secretaries and Ambassadors here, thank you for the extraordinary job that you do.\nI've been talking with a lot of young people lately, including on college campuses around the country. And some of you who are visiting from other countries know that when I travel abroad, one of my favorite things to do is to have a town meeting with young people overseas as well.\nAnd one of the things that I remind young people, just to offer them a little bit of perspective, is that no matter how grim the news sometimes seems, no matter how extraordinary the challenges that humanity or America seems to be facing at any given moment, if you had to choose a moment in human history in which to be born, and you didn't know ahead of time who you were going to be—what your nationality was or your gender or race or class—if you had to pick one moment in history that gave you the best chance to succeed, you would choose right now. You would choose this moment, when the world is wealthier, better educated, more open, more tolerant, more connected than it has ever been at any time in human history; less violent, less riven by division. You'd choose today.\nAnd as I think about what you're doing here in this hall, I'd add a corollary to that observation. If you could choose any place and time to invest your business's precious resources, I believe you'd choose right here, right now. If you'd choose a place to expand your portfolio, to place your bets, to open up a plant, to start building the next great new business or service, you would select the U.S.A. Because nowhere in the world and never in history has there ever been a better place to grow your business.\nNow, here's why: Never before has the United States recorded 75 straight months of private sector job growth. Never before has our graduation—high school graduation rate been higher, preparing students for college and careers in your industries. Never before have we insured more than 90 percent of our citizens, and we've seen the slowest growth in the price of health care in 50 years. And that's important for a whole host of reasons, including the fact that healthier workers are more productive workers, not to mention better consumers, and more affordable health care makes it easier for your businesses to add jobs and pay a good wage. Never before have we had such high-standard free trade agreements that level the playing field. And when complete, when we've gotten it done, the Trans-Pacific Partnership will do even more to lower the costs of exporting, eliminating taxes and custom duties, and raising intellectual property standards that protect data and ideas and jobs.\nYou would choose right here, right now, because no other economy is so crucial for the global economy. No other country can add more innovation to your business or bring your innovative products to more markets. No country has as many top universities, and no country invests more in research and development than we do. In fact, America is responsible for one-quarter of the world's R&D investments. No country can match our competitiveness in cutting-edge manufacturing. No country is home to more entrepreneurs or more supercomputing. No country has done more to build a culture of making and tinkering and entrepreneurship and risk-taking and of innovation and invention.\nAnd no other country is home to more foreign direct investment than the United States of America. Over the last 4 years, no other country has been named by CEOs around the world more frequently as the best place to invest with confidence. And all of this is for a very good reason: In large part because of the decisions we've made since the financial crisis to build our economy on a new foundation for the future, there is no country on Earth that's better positioned for the long run than the United States.\nWe've doubled our production of clean energy, even as we continue to produce traditional energy sources at an extraordinary pace, which means energy costs are lower here than they are in many other places around the world. Our rule of law, our mature capital markets, all these things contribute to an extraordinary place to do business.\nNow, that's a pretty good sales pitch. [Laughter] I don't mind being America's pitchman. And in 7 months or so, I'll be on the job market. [Laughter] And I'm glad I'm going to be here. [Laughter] Because I'm going get on LinkedIn and see what comes up. [Laughter]\nBut the truth is, it's easy to make the case, and it's one each of the economic development organizations represented here can make just as well, because behind it are the most talented and most innovative workers in the world: American workers.\nThat's why, several years ago, we took the advice of the CEOs on my Jobs Council and started SelectUSA, a team that wakes up every morning with one mission, and that is to bring jobs to America from overseas. They connect foreign investors with local American markets, making it easier for you to build a factory or facility in the United States, making it easier for you to get American workers researching, developing, making, and marketing your products.\nIn today's world, where business doesn't stop at borders, and when trade is how we shape economic change to our advantage, when the term \"global economy\" is redundant because of global supply chains being tied into every element and every aspect of our lives, these partnerships are the keys to success for all of us no matter where we live, no matter if you're a small startup or a major multinational. As the local economic development experts here all know, communities that open their doors to foreign investment create more jobs and economic activity than those that don't.\nAnd since we held the first SelectUSA summit 3 years ago, participating companies have invested more than $10 billion in 35 U.S. States and territories. And a lot of them met at this event, in the exhibition hall, or through SelectUSA's online matchmaking program. At last year's summit, an Italian tissue company started a conversation with folks from central Ohio, and next month, they're breaking ground in the town of Circleville on a manufacturing facility that will create hundreds of jobs in a part of the American Midwest that needs them. It will be the largest private sector investment in Circleville in decades, and it started right here at SelectUSA.\nAt that same summit, an agricultural tech company from Surat, India, met economic development representatives from Missouri. And within a year, the company established its U.S. headquarters in St. Louis. And we want more success stories like these. We want more of you to invest in America. We're ready to welcome more of the jobs you help create, just as you're ready for American workers and customers to help you succeed globally. So I believe investing in the United States is the best business decision you can make.\nAnd we also know that investment is always about the future. So as proud as we are about the lead in innovation we've developed over the last 8 years, we're running up the score. We're not resting on our laurels. Since 2014, we've opened eight cutting-edge manufacturing hubs: public-private partnerships that specialize in game-changing technologies like 3-D printing, photonics, the next-generation textiles. And today I'm proud to announce a ninth hub based in Los Angeles that will design smart sensors to make all types of manufacturing more efficient. And we've got more hubs on the way.\nThese institutes are new, but the innovators who are doing incredible things, they're who we've always been as Americans. Now, that's why near my desk, in the Oval Office, I keep models of great American patents like the Morse telegraph and the propeller blade, and the gear-cutting machine. And that's why I'm so proud of SelectUSA, which has proven to be a pretty good innovation and investment itself and one that I hope will endure—and I'm confident will endure—after Penny and I leave office.\nNow, I also know that the longer I talk, the less time you have to make deals—[laughter]—with the folks that are sitting around you. So let me just remind you that this is not just about jobs and trade, it's not just about hard, cold cash. It's also about building relationships across borders.\nWhen your companies come together, you help bring countries and cultures together. You generate greater understanding among peoples from different parts of the world. It's one of the most important things that you produce, and you should never underestimate its value. At a time when there is strong pushback in a lot of corners of the world against this process of globalization; at a time when, as I've argued here in the United States and overseas, when people are rightly concerned that that process of technology and innovation and globalization may be leaving some people behind; at a time when we have to be more mindful and attentive to the concerns of those who are not benefiting and seeing their wages and incomes go up as quickly as others; and at a time when the advanced economies in particular have to guard against a winner-take-all economy in which inequality grows—despite all those legitimate concerns that have to be addressed to give workers greater voice and to make sure that living wages are paid and working conditions are strong, what is also true is that the ability for us to trade and do business and to integrate our companies and people learning from each other and innovation spreading and connecting the globe promises prosperity and reductions in poverty and, ultimately, less likelihood of war and violence and conflict.\nIt is something that can help us advance all of our countries at the same time. It's something that we have to nurture and to value. The world is smaller than it used to be because of innovation, because of technology, because of globalization, because of global markets. And that is something that can work for everyone if we do it right. And that's been part of the premise of SelectUSA. When you select U.S.A., when you succeed, you'll help ensure that years from now, when the next generation asks itself about the best time to be in business, the best time to be a citizen of this world, they'll be happy to answer, in their own day, \"right now.\"\nSo good luck. I'm rooting for you. Make a deal. And make that smart choice to invest in the United States of America. We are open for business.\nGod bless you. Thank you very much. God bless the United States of America. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2016-06-20", "title": "Remarks at the SelectUSA Investment Summit"}

High Commissioner for Refugees reports that more people are displaced by rising violence, insecurity, and persecution than at any time on record. More than 65 million people around the world—more than the population of France, or California and Texas combined—have been driven from their homes. More than half are children. The scale of this human suffering is almost unimaginable; the need for the world to respond is beyond question.\nEvery day, members of the international community, humanitarian organizations, civil society, and individual citizens work to assist these vulnerable populations. For our part, the United States provides more humanitarian assistance to refugees than any other nation and maintains the world's largest refugee resettlement program. We support programs that provide food, water, shelter, and medical care to refugees and fight for their rights to safety, dignity, and long-term livelihood opportunities.\nBut responding to today's unprecedented challenge requires all of us to do more. In September, when world leaders meet for the U.N. General Assembly, I will convene a Leaders' Summit on Refugees. In advance of that summit, the United States is urging other governments to contribute more funding for humanitarian aid operations, to grant more refugees the chance to work and attend school, and to provide more resettlement opportunities for refugees who cannot safely go home or remain where they are. We are urging our non-governmental partners, including the private sector, to do more as well.\nEven as our aid supports refugees thousands of miles from here, each day, countless Americans do their part to welcome and support refugees as they start life anew in the United States. The millions of refugees who have resettled here through the years have brought similar dreams of a better tomorrow. Each has enriched the diverse mosaic that is America. Their lives and their many accomplishments stand as a clear rebuke to the bigotry and brutality they fled and serve as a powerful example of the human will to endure, hope, and achieve.\nToday we commemorate the spirit and strength of refugees worldwide and the dedication of those who help them on and after their journeys. Protecting and assisting refugees is a part of our history as a nation, and we will continue to alleviate the suffering of refugees abroad, and to welcome them here at home, because doing so reflects our American values and our noblest traditions as a nation, enriches our society, and strengthens our collective security.", "timestamp": "2016-06-20", "title": "Statement on World Refugee Day"}

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117646", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:12 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Nice to see you. I just want to do a quick statement at the top before I get to your questions. It has now been 97 days since the President fulfilled his constitutional responsibility and presented the American people with an exceptional nominee to the United States Supreme Court -- a man named Chief Judge Merrick Garland. And today, the nonpartisan American Bar Association agreed with that assessment. The ABA released an evaluation of the Chief Judge in which they unanimously concluded that Chief Judge Garland merits their highest rating.\nThe ABA's extensive review found that \"lawyers and judges uniformly praise the nominee's integrity. Most remarkably, in interviews with hundreds of individuals in the legal profession in a community who knew Judge Garland whether for a few years or decades, not one person uttered a negative word about him.\" They found that his \"judicial temperament is unassailable.\" And they wrote, \"The unanimous consensus of everyone we interviewed was that Chief Judge Garland is superbly confident to serve on the United States Supreme Court.\nThis significant point warrants repeating: All of the experienced, dedicated and knowledgeable sitting judges, several former solicitors general from both political parties, legal scholars from top law schools across the country, and lawyers who have worked with or against the nominee in private practice -- government or within the judiciary -- describe the nominee as outstanding in all respects and cite specific evidence in support of that view. Many described Judge Garland's professional competence as brilliant, exceptional and phenomenal.\"\nThe ABA, of course, is just the latest in a long line of well-respected voices from across the political spectrum, agreeing that Chief Judge Garland has a record of judicial excellence. There is no question that the Senate has abdicated its responsibility under the United States Constitution. Since 1975, the average period of time, from nomination by the President to confirmation by the Senate for a Supreme Court nominee, has been 67 days. We're now approaching day 100. It's long past time for Senate Republicans to do their job and consider Chief Judge Garland's nomination.\nSo obviously the kind of memo that we received from the ABA today is glowing, and I think does accurately reflect the universal assessment about Chief Judge Garland's integrity and competence from such an important job. That's why it is such a shame that he's been treated so unfairly by the United States Senate. But ultimately, it's our democracy that has to deal with the long-term consequences of this unprecedented partisan action by Republicans in the United States Senate.\nSo with that, Kevin, let's go to questions.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. FBI Director James Comey said recently he won't mention the Orlando nightclub shooter's name publicly. And it doesn't appear that you or the President have either. Is refusing to publicly say the names of individuals who carry out these mass shootings part of this concerted strategy, a new strategy on the part of the administration?\nMR. EARNEST: It's not a new strategy that I'm aware of. I haven't mentioned this individual's name. But, frankly, it's because we believe that the focus should be on grieving with the victims and making sure that we are dealing head on with the potential threat that exists. I know that there are other journalists who have gotten attention for reaching a similar conclusion.\nI do recall that after the shooting in Aurora, Colorado, the President had the opportunity to visit with some of the victims in the hospital in Aurora just days after that mass shooting incident occurred. And I know that in the context of those conversations, the President had promised the families that he wouldn't repeat the name of that assailant. And the President does not make a habit of naming individuals who seek attention for themselves by resorting to violence like this.\nIt, frankly, is an effort to put the attention where it should be, which is on the victims and their families who are grieving, but also on the more significant problem that exists both as it relates in this situation to the availability of weapons of war and the risk that is posed by extremist organizations that seek to use social media to radicalize vulnerable members of the population and inspire them to carry out acts of violence. We want to make sure that we continue to implement a strategy to counter that.\nQ: Thank you. You spoke of yesterday's votes in the Senate as a shameful display of cowardice during your interview. Democrats voted down a pair of Republican-led amendments -- one that was designed to steer more money toward the federal background checks, and another that provides what they would describe as due process for those who want to appeal being placed on the no-fly list. I wanted to ask, did the White House support the GOP amendments? And wouldn't they have resulted in some progress in keeping guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I've expressed concerns about the Cornyn amendment before, when that was being discussed last week. It's apparent that that would do very little to keep individuals who are suspected of having ties to terrorism from being able to buy a gun. And as a practical matter in terms of the way that bill would be implemented, it would do very little to enhance the security of the country.\nAs it relates to the amendment put forward by Senator Grassley, the other Republican amendment that you're referring to, even he acknowledges that it would do nothing to close the gaping loophole in a background check system that currently exists. So the President believes that it's common sense that we would close loopholes that allow individuals to purchase guns without going through a background check. In some cases, this is Internet purchases and other places.\nSenator Murphy, the senator from Connecticut, did put forward a proposal to do exactly that, and we enthusiastically support it because it would close the background check loophole, make it harder for people who shouldn't have guns from being able to get their hands on them. It is a proposition that is strongly supported all across the country by Democrats, Republican and gun owners. A majority of all of those groups support this kind of rule because it's a common-sense rule. It is a rule that would make our community safer without undermining the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans. And after spending the last week listening to Republicans talk about \"radical Islamic terrorism,\" this is the very textbook definition of cowardice -- to talk tough in the hopes that nobody is going to actually do something. Republicans were asked to do something. They were asked to vote on a common-sense proposal that would make our community safer, and they abdicated that responsibility, too.\nQ: You do not concede that the Republican-led amendments would have led to some progress on keeping guns away from people who shouldn't have them?\nMR. EARNEST: What is clear is that Republicans did not put forward an amendment that would prevent terrorists from getting their hands on -- potential people with ties to terrorism getting their hands on guns. And they didn't put forward an idea for closing the significant loopholes that exist in our background check system. Democrats did. Democrats overwhelmingly supported proposals that did, but hardly any Republicans did. And that's why both of those common-sense proposals that have strong support all across the country from a majority of Democrats, a majority of Republicans and even a majority of the gun owners, but those proposals were defeated by Republicans, frankly, at the request of the NRA -- and that's unfortunate.\nAyesha, welcome back. Very nice to see you.\nQ: Thank you. So Reuters is reporting today that there's a bit of disagreement between the White House and the Attorney General over whether to allow prisoners of Guantanamo Bay to be able to plead guilty to terrorism charges via videoconference, and thereby they would avoid having to step foot on U.S. soil. I was wondering if you could talk a bit about whether the White House plans to pursue this strategy, even over some objections from the Justice Department, or plan to pursue a strategy where you would support legislation or things of that nature, even over objections from the Justice Department. And if not, are there any alternatives to videoconferencing that could kind of avoid the issue of bringing these prisoners to the U.S.?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me start by saying that there is strong unanimity of opinion across the administration that closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay is a national security priority. And I feel confident in telling you that every member of the President's national security team, including the Attorney General, supports that goal and believes that it would enhance the national security of our country to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\nWhat is also true is that the President believes that Article III courts have proved to be an effective way to bring terrorists to justice. Attorney General Lynch certainly believes that. She's got her own experience with that. Prior to becoming Attorney General, she was the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of New York where she was involved in some of those terrorism cases. So she certainly has a strong track-record on this, and she understands the importance of bringing terrorists to justice, protecting the country, and doing so in a way that's consistent with our values.\nSo beyond that, I'm not going to get into the views that are expressed in private conversations. You won't be surprised to hear that the administration certainly is considering a wide range of options to bring to justice those individuals that are currently in the prison at Guantanamo Bay so that we can close that prison. And that work is ongoing. The only reason that we haven't succeeded in getting that done is that obstacles have been erected by Congress to prevent that from happening. That's unfortunate, and that is something that the President and every member of his team strongly disagrees with.\nQ: Going back to gun control, Senator Collins is supposed to be releasing legislation today, and there's a thought that her legislating could maybe get support on both sides of the aisle. Has the White House at all reached out to Senator Collins or talked with her or her staff about a possible compromise on this issue?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me start by saying that we're quite disappointed that Republicans voted down a proposal from Senator Feinstein just yesterday that would prevent everyone who's suspected of having ties to terrorists from being able to purchase a gun. It appears that Senator Collins is considering a proposal that would prevent some people who are suspected of ties to terrorism from being able to purchase a gun.\nSo, frankly, I don't know why you would water down a proposal that would prevent everyone who's suspected of having ties to terrorism from being able to purchase a gun. But because Republicans have blocked that proposal, that's what some senators have had to resort to.\nSo what I can tell you is that the White House and attorneys at the Department of Justice are taking a look at the proposal that's been put forward, and if the assessment is that this would enhance the ability of our law enforcement professionals to keep us safe and to prevent suspected terrorists from purchasing a gun, then that's likely something that we'll be able to support. We're still reviewing the legislation to determine if that is actually the practical effect it would have. But this certainly does not make up for the rejection by Republicans of a common-sense proposal that would prevent people who are on the no-fly list or otherwise suspected of terrorism from being able to buy a gun.\nMichelle.\nQ: It was clear from the beginning, even before these votes were cast, the Democrats weren't going to get what they wanted on these bills. So would it not have been better to vote for the Republican bills? I mean, wouldn't that have been an incremental change, and then go from there? Maybe then this Collins bill next. Wouldn't that have been better than nothing?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess for the legislative strategy, I would encourage you to check with the senators who conceived of it. I think part of it -- so part of their thinking, I'm sure, is the fact that all of these proposals that went down provided an incentive for somebody like Senator Collins to try to step up and find common ground with Democrats at least on something. It's unlikely that would have happened if Democrats had gone along with a do-nothing Republican attempt, like the Grassley and Cornyn amendments.\nQ: What you're ending up with, though, is a very narrow amendment with this Collins thing. So --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we're still assessing exactly how narrow it is and determining what kind of impact it actually would have. So I think it's too early to say at this point whether or not the administration would support it, because it's too early to -- we have not yet assessed exactly what impact it would have. If we conclude that it would have a positive impact and at least prevent some suspected terrorists from being able to buy a gun, then that seems likely something that the administration would be able to support.\nBut we're going to take a look at the details of this. The details in this case are quite important and do have an impact on whether or not this would enhance our national security.\nQ: I guess what I'm saying -- and maybe it is too early, as well. I mean, that's fine if that's your answer again. But when you're looking at what each of those original Republican amendments would have done with the mental health piece, the background check piece, and the five years looking at possible terrorist ties, might you not have ended up with more with those two amendments than this compromise?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't think so. Again, the Cornyn amendment would do every little to prevent suspected terrorists from being able to buy a gun. Very little. And as it relates to the Grassley piece, look, he himself said that it would not expand background checks. That has been a top legislative priority of this administration for quite some time. And Senator Grassley was pretty blunt about it.\nAnd this is a little of a hobby horse of mine, but it is hard to take seriously claims from Republicans that they actually care about enhancing mental health care in this country. They have voted more than 50 times to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which has done more than any other single piece of legislation in American history to expand mental health care coverage in this country.\nSo it's hard to -- I don't believe Republicans when they say they care about expanding mental health care for the American people. I don't believe them when they say that. And I think their record makes it very hard to make a convincing case that I'm wrong.\nQ: Okay. And on the topic of tweets today, there was a tweet last night from Senator Warren saying that she agreed with Chris Murphy that Republicans have decided to sell weapons to ISIS. Do you think that goes too far?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I didn't see the tweet, but what I could say about this is simply the situation that is created by Republicans blocking the Feinstein amendment is simply that individuals who are suspected of having ties to terrorism are able to buy a gun with impunity, because Republicans are protecting that loophole at the simple request of the NRA. Those are the facts of the situation. And again, I'll leave it to Republicans to try to defend that position. I don't think it's a position that many Americans are going to have sympathy for.\nQ: Are you saying that you agree with that sentiment that it's essentially deciding to sell weapons to ISIS?\nMR. EARNEST: I think what is -- again, I'll let Senator Murphy and Senator Warren describe the situation as they see it. As we see it, it is without question possible for suspected terrorists to buy guns because Republicans are protecting their ability to do so.\nJordan.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Just before the briefing, Congressman Chaka Fattah was convicted of federal corruption charges, and I'm wondering if the White House has any reaction to that conviction.\nMR. EARNEST: Jordan, I saw that report shortly before I walked out here, so I don't have a reaction to it at this point. But we'll take a look and see if we can get you a reaction. Obviously -- I think this is pretty good evidence that the Department of Justice is faithful to their mandate to pursue justice irrespective of political affiliations. Congressman Fattah is somebody that was a supporter of President Obama's campaigns. That's just a fact. But as it relates to this specific investigation, I don't have a reaction at this point.\nQ: On another topic -- on the redaction, yesterday that we discussed. Now that the Department of Justice reversed course and decided to release the unedited transcript of the 911 call, are you willing to say that yesterday's decision to release a redacted transcript was a mistake?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not going to be in a position of doing any backseat driving as they pursue this investigation. They're obviously making decisions that they believe are in the best interest of the investigation and of the broader community, and I'll leave it to the investigators to make those decisions and comment on the wisdom of those.\nOlivier.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. In an interview with Charlie Rose, the Vice President said that he argued strongly against the intervention in Libya. And he said -- this is from the interview -- my question was, \"Okay, tell me what happens? He's gone. What's happens?\" I'm assuming that \"he\" is Qaddafi. \"He's gone. What happens? Doesn't the country disintegrate? What happens then? Doesn't it become a place -- a petri dish for the growth of extremism?\" Why did the President set aside that advice?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think, Olivier, I can't speak to the views that were represented by anybody in the private conversations that the President was having in the run-up to the decision about intervening in Libya. You'll recall that the decision that the President made was actually to work closely with our allies to carry out a military operation to try to protect tens of thousands of innocent Libyans that were at risk of slaughter.\nNow, the President has now on a number of occasions acknowledged that he made a mistake. He didn't carefully consider what would be the aftermath even of a successful military intervention. Military intervention was successful to the extent that it did prevent the slaughter of tens of thousands of innocent Libyans, but the aftermath of even that successful intervention has led to a very difficult security situation inside of Libya that does have consequences for our national security. So the President gave a speech at the United Nations where he acknowledged that he bore some responsibility for that failure to think through the situation.\nAnd again, I'll leave it to the Vice President to describe what his -- what advice he offered to the President in advance of that situation. But I think the President has spoken to this pretty bluntly.\nQ: All right. One more on Libya. The President's choice to lead AFRICOM has reportedly told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the United States needs to have some troops on the ground and to work to choose airstrike targets. Does the President share that assessment?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't seen that testimony, so let me take a look at it and we'll get back to you on that.\nRon.\nQ: On the Garland nomination, are there any meetings or anything planned? I think as of yesterday there was nothing on his calendar?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any additional meetings at this point. Obviously, the Chief Judge is available for meetings with Republicans who have changed their mind and decided that they are ready to do their job and actually have a conversation with him. He certainly merits that kind of consideration, but unfortunately too many Republicans have refused to offer it to him.\nQ: Is there any -- what changes this besides the outcome of the election in November?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think that the only thing that can change the situation is Republicans deciding that they're actually willing to do their job in the Senate.\nQ: But nothing -- there's no consequence, it would seem, short of the outcome of an election. Is that fair?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it certainly is -- I think it is reasonable to assume that there might be some voters out there who are interested in the position that their elected representative has taken. They might be interested in the fact that their elected representative is refusing to do their job, particularly when it comes to something as important as a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court. So there could be consequences in that regard. But that will be up to individual voters to determine.\nI think much of the public data that we've seen out there does indicate that there is the potential for downside for some Republicans, at least in terms of their standing with their constituents.\nQ: And the President is willing to still -- going to see this through to January 20, whatever the date is?\nMR. EARNEST: The President strongly believes that Chief Judge Garland is the best person to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court. That assessment has not changed. If anything, the President's view has been strengthened based on the independent conclusions of the nonpartisan American Bar Association.\nQ: And on Gitmo, did you confirm that, in fact, there was this proposal to have a videoconference session as a solution? Was that something that was, in fact, considered?\nMR. EARNEST: I did not confirm that. I'm just not going to get into the internal deliberations. I confirm that there are, in fact, internal deliberations to consider a wide range of ideas for advancing the process and making progress against the goal of closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay. But I haven't discussed what some of those ideas might be.\nQ: Why not? Is there anything -- well, the report that was sent up there, the proposal with the various sites, that was, what, a couple months ago? Has anything happened with that at all? Has there been any response?\nMR. EARNEST: No, other than Pat Roberts minutes after receiving that piece of paper, crumpling it up, and filming himself throwing it in the trash can, I think that is a pretty good indication of the lack of seriousness on the part of Senate Republicans. It seems unbelievable, but he's actually considered one of the serious ones. Maybe after that display he's not anymore.\nQ: How is that going to ever happen? How is Gitmo going to be close? Can you sketch out any scenario whereby you get past this number 30 who are not seen as prosecutable, if that's a word?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think a couple of things. The one thing that we can do is continue to do the important diplomatic work of considering how to transfer individuals who are currently in the prison at Guantanamo Bay to other countries. Now, this is difficult diplomatic work because we ask those other countries to impose significant security restrictions against these individuals. And --\nQ: So are there new countries? Were there discussions going on?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have much to say about -- obviously, those kinds of diplomatic conversations are rather sensitive. But whenever there is a decision to move forward with a transfer, that is always something that we do publicly announce. And we always disclose the destination of that individual. But I'm not going to get into the talks in advance of those agreements being secured.\nQ: And there's obviously Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and the Five. Do you really think -- does the President think that that's going to be resolved on his watch?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President certainly hopes so. And again, there are a variety of ways of dispensing with each of these cases in terms making sure that these individuals are brought to justice. And whether that is transferring them to another country or putting them through Article III courts, or having them go through military commission proceedings, there certainly is a way to deal with many of these cases.\nNow, the question really is some of these legal proceedings could take quite some time, and quite some time longer. The question is are they going to sit in a prison at Guantanamo Bay at a prohibitive cost to the taxpayers and serve as a recruiting tool for extremists, or are we going to do a common-sense thing like bring that individual to a secure facility where there are already terrorists, convicted terrorists being held in American facilities on American soil. That's not going to make the country less safe. In fact, it's going to make us more safe because it will remove this recruiting element. And it is a much more cost-effective way to deal with these dangerous individuals.\nQ: I ask because, on Gitmo, on Garland -- it seems that the President has absolutely no leverage remaining with Congress to get anything done.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, when you have Republicans in the United States Senate and in the United States House of Representatives that are unwilling to do their jobs, yes, that makes it hard to get things through Congress. That is an accurate observation. But the President certainly hasn't given up. And the President is on the right side of these issues. The American people in general agree with the President's approach to these issues. But thus far we've seen a lot of obstruction from Republicans. And it's not because Republicans are busy doing other things; they're out there doing nothing.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, can you say why the U.S. does not allow a U.N. monitor on torture by the name of Juan Mendez to visit the facility at Gitmo?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know what kind of access is granted by those who are in charge of running the facility at Guantanamo Bay. Certainly the Department of Defense can give you more information about the access that they provide.\nThere is extensive access that is provided to the International Committee for the Red Cross, for example, to reach their own independent assessment of the conditions there. So there certainly is an effort that is made by the Department of Defense to provide that kind of access. But as it relates to the individual that you're referring to, I'd refer you to the Department of Defense. I'm just not familiar with the request that he's made for access.\nQ: Have you got any information on the interception of a vehicle on the New Jersey side of the Holland Tunnel filled with weapons that might have been tied to some kind of a terrorist plot? Has the White House been informed about that?\nMR. EARNEST: I've seen some of these news reports, or I was briefed on some of these news reports. I understand that this was -- that these individuals were apprehended by local law enforcement. I would actually check with the FBI to determine what role they would play in this case and what role they could play in any potential investigation.\nQ: Did the White House play any role in the reversal at Justice to reverse on the redactions in that transcript?\nMR. EARNEST: The decision to release the un-redacted version of the transcript that was released yesterday was made independently and entirely by the Department of Justice.\nQ: Okay. That's it.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay.\nQ: Thanks.\nMR. EARNEST: Good. Angela.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. Following up on Olivier's line of questioning about the Vice President's comments in the Charlie Rose interview yesterday, one of the other things he said that was -- that it is \"unlikely that there will be a political resolution in Syria.\" That doesn't seem to represent a change in administration policy, but it's a little bit different line than what we've heard about -- a little more optimism about a political solution there. Can you extrapolate on that a little bit?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think the Vice President has a reputation for calling it like he sees it. And it is difficult to be optimistic about the situation inside of Syria. There's no denying that.\nThe United Nations has worked very hard to try to bring all of the relevant parties to the table. The United States has played a central role in that effort. We have made progress insofar as we've been able to bring the international community together in support of the concept of a political transition inside of Syria. Even people like Vladimir Putin have acknowledged that a political transition inside of Syria is required, is long overdue, and is what will be necessary to bring an end to the violence in that country.\nWe have succeeded on a number of occasions in helping the U.N. bring the parties together to participate in what they described as proximity talks. But this is a very difficult process to get moving. And we've been frustrated that far too often the Russians and the Assad regime have not lived up to the commitments that they made in the context of the Cessation of Hostilities. And that's been disappointing.\nAnd the fraying of the Cessation of Hostilities has had a negative impact on our ability to engage in those kinds of diplomatic political negotiations. So the Vice President is a pretty optimistic guy, but the situation in Syria is difficult.\nQ: On Brexit, obviously the administration position is very clear and it's been articulated. But there's two more days between now and when the U.K. votes. Will we hear anything more out of the President either directly in words or in social media, or in any other way? Is he likely to reiterate his position between now and Thursday on Brexit?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any plan to do that. But if that changes, we'll let you know. The President has obviously had an opportunity -- a rather high-profile opportunity -- when he was in London earlier this spring to make his views known. I think it was apparent at that time that his view that the United States benefits from having the U.K. as a strong member of the EU was something that was good for the United States was considered rather newsworthy. It got a lot of attention. And the President felt it was important to share his view given the special relationship between our two countries.\nBut the President said at the time, and you've heard me say on many occasions, that this is up to the British people to decide. And they should make this decision consistent with their own instincts and their own views about how their country is best served. But obviously the relationship between our two countries is such that the President felt like it was appropriate to share his view. But we'll see on Thursday what's going to happen.\nLet's move around. Karen.\nQ: Josh, the President had tweeted earlier today about the gun votes last night in the Senate. And he said that the Senate failed the American people. He didn't say Senate Republicans. Is he expressing frustration with Democrats on the Hill, too, casting blame on everybody?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what is clear is that the institution of the Senate has not functioned the way that it should. And the reason that that bill didn't succeed is because about 95 percent of Republicans flunked the test. And that's the reason that the bill didn't pass.\nSo I think the President's statement is a pretty blunt on about how we're not going to see the kind of changes to our gun laws that most Americans would like to see until we see some changes in Congress. And that's what has motivated the President to assume this posture of essentially being a single-issue voter and only being willing to support Democrats who share his commitment to common-sense gun safety legislation.\nQ: Was there something more he wanted to see from Democrats?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, again, about 90, 95 percent of Democrats voted the right way on this. So I think it's also pretty clear that the only way we're going to see the kinds of changes in our gun laws is when we elect people to Congress that are supportive of those common-sense measures.\nAnd right now an overwhelming majority of Democrats do support those kinds of changes and an overwhelming majority of Republicans oppose them. So I guess it's not just clear that we need changes in Congress. It's pretty apparent what kinds of changes we need in order to pass gun safety legislation.\nQ: And one question on Florida. Governor Rick Scott is not happy that the government is not giving $5 million in emergency funds that he's requested, which he said would be for the emergency response, the law enforcement response, medical care, counseling services, and other services. Why not approve that as an emergency funding request?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Karen, I'd principally refer you to FEMA. Requests for disaster assistance are considered at FEMA. These are not decisions that are made by the White House.\nGenerally speaking, I can tell you that the Stafford Act, under which this request was made, is intended to provide emergency federal assistance when it is beyond the capacity of state and local authorities to protect immediate life and safety. This particular incident took place within a defined period of time, unlike other major incidents that were ongoing and required additional emergency federal support.\nThat's why hurricanes are typically the kind of scenario where you would see federal disaster assistance readily provided. In this case, it's obviously somewhat different. What is true, however, is that there may be additional federal assistance that can be provided to the state of Florida as they are dealing with what is admittedly a very difficult situation.\nSo let me just give you a couple of examples. The first is, obviously, as has been well documented by all of you. The FBI has taken over the investigation. So this investigation is going to require and already has required substantial resources. These are obviously a very complicated, difficult crime scene in which significant forensic work will be done. And so the FBI is using their resources to conduct that aspect of the investigation.\nThe FBI has also indicated that they're going to commit significant resources to learn as much as they possibly can about the days -- about this individual and how he spent his time in the days and weeks leading up to this terrorist attack.\nThat obviously is going to require a lot of manpower, a lot of expertise, and a lot of resources. And those will be -- significant quantities of those resources will be expended by the federal government.\nIn addition to that, the Department of Health and Human Services has a unit that's dedicated to offering assistance to victims who have been affected by a tragic incident like this. So certainly the Department of Health and Human Services stands ready to provide that kind of assistance. That offer has been made to the state of Florida. So separate from a disaster declaration, there certainly is an important role that the federal government can play in providing assistance to a community like Orlando that is going through a very difficult time.\nPam.\nQ: Josh, has the White House done any assessment of the impact of the executive actions on guns that the President announced five months ago in terms of whether there have been more background checks? Because it covered a wider population of sellers.\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't seen those statistics, but why don't I look -- why don't we check with our team and see if there's some information like that that we can provide to you.\nQ: Okay. How about -- how is Judge Garland handling this long delay in his nomination? Is it frustrating to him?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, this is a guy who has spent the last 19 years going to work at the second-highest court in the land. He spent the last several years as the chief judge on the D.C. Circuit. So he's used to having a pretty busy workload. And I think he's ready to get to work on the Supreme Court. And he's ready for the Senate to treat him fairly and ready to get to work serving the American people.\nSo he's ready to go and eager to get to work. We just need members of the Senate to do their job.\nQ: Thanks.\nMR. EARNEST: Kevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. How concerned is the President about the economic impact of new drone legislation -- regulations, as it relates to commercial use? In particular, large providers like Amazon have expressed great concern about not just the proliferation potential of more drones, but obviously more regulations.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think what most people understand is that there needs to be a regulatory regime put in place to allow these kinds of devices to realize their potential. We need to make sure that we are protecting public safety, that these kinds of unmanned aerial systems don't interfere with commercial aircraft, for example. And I know that there has been some investigation into the, I think, rather obvious negative consequences of having drones operating in and around airports without some sort of regulation.\nI think there are obvious concerns that are raised about privacy. We need to make sure that these drones can't be used in such a way that they violate the privacy of Americans. So having a regime in place to protect that privacy is important.\nBut this is -- this does represent a potentially powerful innovation that could have a positive impact in our economy. So I think most people, even people in the private sector who recognize the economic potential of this kind of innovation, recognize the value of establishing parameters for regulation to ensure that we can put in place protections for public safety and privacy, while also creating space for economic interests to thrive.\nAnd that's the work that is just starting. This is just the beginning of this process. And obviously we're going to continue to work closely with private sector entities that recognize this potential, because the President has made clear that the future success of our economy will depend on our ability to continue to innovate. That is the competitive advantage that the United States has long had over the rest of the world, is our potential that's built in to innovate and to pursue new ideas and new ways of doing things. And this is certainly a good example of that.\nQ: I want to switch gears and talk about China and cyber. Obviously, you remember back in September the President made the announcement about the new U.S.-China cyber agreement, and yet since then, there have been more than a dozen Chinese-based hacking groups that have been able to compromise computer networks belonging to U.S. corporations -- this is according to a study released today by the cybersecurity firm FireEye. Two parts to the question. One, how would you assess the success of that agreement given the ongoing problems? And what, if anything, is this administration able to do to either punish, retaliate or whatever else there might be in terms of tools that you can utilize to stem this problem?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, as you alluded to, last fall, when President Xi visited the White House, he did commit, alongside President Obama, that neither government will conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled economic espionage for commercial gain. And both countries agreed to work together to advance international adoption of peacetime norms of responsible state behavior in cyberspace. That was an important commitment on the part of the Chinese, and we obviously have tried to capitalize on that common ground to advance our mutual interests.\nAnd so one element of that has been the establishment of what is described as essentially a cyber dialogue. This dialogue took place for the first time last December, and the agreement was to meet every six months with national security officials and cyber officials to discuss how the United States and China could cooperate on this.\nOur two countries met just last week for the second installment of that dialogue. And maintaining those open lines of communication I do think will enhance our ability to protect U.S. interests in cyberspace. But this still continues to be an irritant in our relationship, and this is something that is raised at all levels just about every single time U.S. and Chinese officials sit down at the same table.\nSo we're going to continue to try to advance our mutual interests in this regard, but also we want to take some common-sense steps to enhance the cybersecurity of the United States. And the President put forward a very specific proposal for how we could use additional resources to protect our cybersecurity. The President included those proposals in our budget, and, as you recall, Republicans in the House and Senate refused to even convene a hearing to discuss that budget. They refused to even discuss the specific proposals that the President put forward to dedicate a billion dollars to enhancing our cybersecurity.\nSo I said at the time and I say it now, the next time that there is a prominent cyber intrusion somewhere -- and I'm confident there will be one -- whether it's in the government or in the private sector, Republicans are going to have a hard time explaining yet again how when it comes to a critically important national security and economic priority of the United States, that it's not just that Republicans have the wrong priorities, they've refused to do their job. They refuse to even have a hearing to discuss the President's ideas for strengthening our cybersecurity. And that's an abdication of their responsibility.\nQ: Is there a sanctions element to what the U.S. can do to get the Chinese to rein in the problem? Or in the conversation, are they suggesting that it's a two-way problem, that U.S. companies are doing it to them, for example.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'll let the Chinese characterize their views. One step that the President did take -- and I believe this was about a year and a half ago -- the President did sign an executive order essentially giving authority to the Treasury Secretary to use financial sanctions and other instruments against either countries or entities that violate our cyberspace, that this is a newly available option to the President and to the administration to protect our interests.\nI don't have anything to telegraph in terms of how or whether those sanctions could be used against any Chinese entities. But this is an option that is on the table because the President put it there.\nQ: Last one. I was watching this morning -- you were on a competing network, CNN -- (laughter) -- and you said, \"Using the term 'radical Islamic extremism' is not a counterterrorism strategy.\" And I've heard you say that, and the President has actually said something similar. You said, \"It's a political talking point, plain and simple.\" And I'm just -- I want to be careful and give you an opportunity to sort of expand on that, because it's very real in the minds of a great many people around the globe that this isn't just politics. It goes beyond sort of Republicans and Democrats in the United States. This is a worldwide issue. So I wanted to give you a chance to sort of explain what you meant by that.\nMR. EARNEST: What I meant by that is I think pretty much what I said, which is that Republicans actually don't put forward their own strategy for protecting the American people, they just use the word \"radical Islamic extremism\" -- or the words \"radical Islamic extremism\" to try to make it seem like they're somehow tough on terrorism even though they don't have an actual strategy.\nIt's the President of the United States that's actually put forward a very specific strategy for protecting the country. It's the President of the United States that's built a coalition of 65 countries to go after ISIL. And it's because we've been able to work effectively with those countries that we have reduced the influence that ISIL has over about more than 40 percent of the territory inside of Iraq, and more than 20 percent of the territory inside of Syria.\nIt's because of the strategy that the President has implemented that we've actually been able to work closely with our partners in the Muslim world to combat ISIL and to take strikes against ISIL, and to get those countries to contribute to our fight, both in a tangible military sense, but also in a financial sense and in strategically -- and in a strategic sense.\nSo that is our strategy. And we haven't heard a strategy from Republicans; we've just seen Republicans try to use the words \"radical Islamic extremism\" to fool people into thinking that they're tough on terrorism when the truth is they don't even have the courage to vote against the NRA and prevent those same suspected terrorists from being able to buy a gun in the United States. It's shameful and it's cowardice.\nQ: But when other leaders around the globe use that expression, you're not suggesting that they're also being political, \"plain and simple\"? Which is what you said.\nMR. EARNEST: No, because those leaders actually have a strategy too. So many of the leaders -- and I think Michelle and I talked about this a week or two ago -- President Hollande in France has, on occasion, described a threat in this way. President Hollande of France has actually made a substantial contribution to our military strategy against ISIL, both in Iraq and in Syria. There are French soldiers that are serving alongside U.S. troops to counter ISIL. France has been very helpful in terms of sharing information in a way that has obviously important national security benefits for the people of France, but also for the United States as well.\nAnd obviously, France has taken the lead in combatting extremist elements in North Africa and in West Africa. That obviously is an important contribution that the French are able to make because of their long history in that region of the world. That represents a strategy. That represents a substantial commitment to actually countering the violent extremists that threaten the United States and the West.\nRepublicans can't make the same claim. Republicans don't have the same strategy. All they can rely on is a talking point. And I think it's doing less and less to fool people into thinking that they actually have a thoughtful approach to these kinds of issues that are so consequential to our national security.\nByron.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. In the criminal justice system, the standards for certain activities are reasonable suspicion for a detention, probable cause for an arrest, beyond a reasonable doubt for a conviction. These are clear and well-known legal standards. But very little is publicly known about how people end up on terror watch lists. And given that gun ownership is a constitutional right and is affirmed by the Supreme Court, shouldn't Americans have a little more insight into how and why they end up on a government list that would deny them their rights? In the spirit of transparency and to allay concerns about this proposal, would you be willing to consider sharing more details about standards for inclusion on this list?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Byron, I think that there are some challenges to that, and some of it is that these kinds of investigations often deal with classified information.\nBut here's what I would acknowledge is important about your question, which is that there are civil liberties that are worth protecting in here. And that is why, built into all these proposals, including the Feinstein proposal that was voted down by Republicans in the Senate yesterday, is a specific mechanism for individuals to seek redress. If individuals feel like they're wrongly included on that list, there should be a process that they can go through to have their name cleared. This is something that DHS already administers, a redress process for individual who are on the no-fly list and believe that they're wrongly included on that list.\nSo we certainly do believe that that's important, and we need to make sure that that process is working effectively. And I know that the Department of Homeland Security, particularly in the last nine months or so, has made improvements to that process to make it work more efficiently, to make sure that we are protecting the constitutional rights and civil liberties of innocent people.\nBut, Byron, here's the other thing that I would say: What about the thousands of people that are killed every year in acts of gun violence? Those people have rights too. It's worth standing up for them. And if, in order to protect their rights, we're actually going to say to people that if you're suspected of having ties to terrorism that you can't buy a gun, I think that's a pretty good way to protect the rights of the maximum number of Americans, particularly when there is a well-established, fair process for individual who believe that they're wrongly included on that list to be exonerated, or at least to get off the list. And that's the approach that we have taken.\nQ: The President spoke early in his political career and pretty extensively about the need to protect civil liberties in the face of threats like terrorism, but he is proposing using a rather opaque process, even though there are, as you point out, safeguards built in to deny people who have been convicted of (inaudible) their rights. Is there concerns from this President about the constitutionality of this? Has the Department of Justice or the White House Counsel's Office done a memo or an analysis on constitutionality?\nMR. EARNEST: I can't speak to any of the legal advice that the President may have received. But look, Byron, this is not a novel process. The no-fly list has existed for quite some time. And things like the freedom of assembly and the ability to pursue happiness, these are all values that are central to our country's founding. And I think you could make a strong case that people have a right to be treated fairly when it comes to buying an airline ticket. But we've been able to establish a process that protects the rights of people to fly on an airplane even at the same time that we protect the country's aviation system. And I think the same principle applies when it comes to firearms.\nQ: But domestic travel on an airplane is not a constitutional right in the same way -- protected by the Second Amendment, the ownership of a gun. Can you name other constitutional rights that are circumscribed --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Byron, there weren't airplanes when the Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution, so I think there are reasons for that. I think in large part this comes down to common sense. And if the government has concluded that it's too dangerous for you to board a plane, it should be too dangerous for you to buy a gun. I think there's a reason that about 90 percent of the American public agrees with them.\nAnd it's because of the President's concern for civil liberties that we've been focused on making sure that individuals who believe that they're wrongly included on that list have an opportunity to go through a process to get their name off that list. But I think this is a pretty common-sense strategy for protecting the American people.\nApril.\nQ: Josh, I want to ask you -- back on these questions about guns. Past, present and future, presidents -- plural -- have been dealing with this issue in many ways. I mean, just going back to Clinton, he was dealing with issues of the gun show loophole -- it didn't happen. Then you had President George W. Bush, he allowed the assault weapons ban to sunset. Now this President has overseen many shootings. We've seen many shootings, to include one where kids were killed in Newtown. And we're hearing that you guys put everything on the table with that and the President leaned in. And if nothing could happen there, the possibilities are bleak.\nAs you have seven and a half months, the reality looks like nothing -- you can really do anything from this point. But looking at the next President, and President after that, realistically -- I mean, this country has been dealing with this issue for decades, at the very least -- looking at the future, what do you see -- I mean, as it relates to issue of guns in this country and mass murders that continue to happen and get worse and worse?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, April, there's not a piece of legislation that we can put forward that's going to prevent every incident of gun violence. But what we can do are some common-sense things that would make it harder for people who shouldn't have guns from being able to get their hands on them. And that's all that we're asking. This is not some radical, pie-in-the-sky notion that we should somehow, for example, amend the Constitution. Nobody is raising that prospect. In fact, the President himself has reaffirmed, on a number of occasions, his believe in the Second Amendment. He believes that's something that's worth protecting for law-abiding Americans.\nSo we're just looking at common-sense proposals to do things like prevent people who are suspected of ties to terrorism from being able to buy a gun; to make sure that everybody who attempts to purchase a gun goes through a background check, that they aren't able to easily circumvent that background check by going to a gun show or trying to purchase their gun on the Internet.\nSo these are common-sense proposals. And I have confidence, I have some optimism that common sense will eventually prevail. I think the tragic question, though, that has to be answered is how many people have to die before it does. Because it's clear 49 people dying in a nightclub in Orlando wasn't enough. And that's tragic. But it didn't persuade Republicans to muster the courage to stand up to the NRA. That's a tragic turn of events. It says something quite sad about the state of the Republican Party, about the state of the Republican conference in the United States Senate. But those are the facts.\nAnd that's why the President has been pretty blunt about his conclusion that in order to see the change in gun laws we'd like to see, we're going to need to see some changes in Congress. And the President is working toward that.\nQ: And I understand all administrations try to have this outlook of hope and optimism, but you have people --\nMR. EARNEST: None more so than this one.\nQ: You have people who are people who deal with issues of guns in various sectors and believe in the right of guns but also believe that there should be somehow gun control. But they are still saying that it looks bleak, as you've had these kind of things happen. What say you to those people who feel that, yes, the reality is this happening and things are doing downhill, even though you have Republicans who are in support but they still cannot pass something?\nMR. EARNEST: Here's the cause for optimism. Just about every American citizen agrees with the President's position. When it comes to closing background checks, I think we're -- close to 90 percent of Americans agree that we should close the background check loophole.\nSo this is not a daunting task of trying to win hearts and minds. Most of those hearts and minds have already been won. The challenge now is just to make clear that people who agree with the President's views on gun safety are just as passionate as he is about them, that they'll exercise their right to vote, that they'll show up and use it, and that they'll make this the number one issue as they look at their ballot.\nThat's a commitment that the President has made when it comes to filling out his own ballot and using his own political capital. He's the head of the Democratic Party. He's the most popular politician in America. So he's got some political capital to use, and he's prepared to use it in pursuit of this goal. And that does give me some optimism that common sense will prevail. But unfortunately, there are going to be more lives lost. More innocent lives will be lost as a result.\nQ: Josh, thanks. On Thursday it will be two weeks since the President's endorsement of Hillary Clinton. We haven't heard from Mrs. Obama or from Elizabeth Warren, Nancy Pelosi, Dr. Jill Biden, Joe Biden. Is there an endorsement coming from her separate of the video that we can anticipate?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what I acknowledged on the day that the President released his video is that that could be and should be interpreted as a joint endorsement from the President and the First Lady. The President -- I mean, the First Lady shares the President's enthusiasm for Secretary Clinton's campaign. And I'm confident that at some point, Mrs. Obama will have an opportunity to describe that enthusiasm in her own words. I don't know exactly when that will take place, but we'll keep you posted. I'm sure there will be a lot of interest.\nQ: Not the United State of Women, or -- her new Snapchat maybe?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I certainly would encourage everybody to follow her on Snapchat.\nQ: But you anticipate one might be coming.\nMR. EARNEST: But at some point she'll have an opportunity to describe her enthusiasm in her own words. I'm sure you'll all be listening.\nJohn.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. Two questions about guns and about Chief Judge Garland. First, on the vote in the Senate, you talk about the Republicans. Now, Senator Portman of Ohio, a Republican who has a difficult reelection, changed his position and did vote for the amendment to bar guns from those who are on the watch list. Has the President called, congratulated him, or did he lobby him in any way on this vote?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I'm not aware of any White House lobbying that was directed at Senator Portman on this. And look, this is a common-sense proposal. So I'll let Senator Portman describe his position and why he may or may not have changed it. But this is a common-sense proposition. I don't think anybody -- anybody who is accomplished enough to have run for and won election to a six-year term in the United States Senate think supporting common-sense legislation is the bare minimum when it comes to doing their job.\nAnd I think that's why I can confidently and forcefully say that Republicans are failing to do their job when they oppose common-sense legislation like the amendments that were put forward by Senators Feinstein and Murphy last night.\nQ: Did the President say anything about Senator Portman's position, his vote or anything?\nMR. EARNEST: Not that I'm aware of, no.\nQ: On Judge Garland, you continually say this is unprecedented what the Senate is doing now.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, Senator Graham said the same thing.\nQ: Senator Lindsey Graham.\nMR. EARNEST: Senator Lindsey Graham said the same thing when he was discussing Chief Judge Garland's nomination in the Senate Judiciary Committee, he noted that what Republicans were prepared to do with regard to Chief Judge Garland's nomination was unprecedented. We can get you the full quote on that.\nQ: All right, please. Senator McConnell said that the last time someone was nominated for a Supreme Court seat that a vacancy occurred in a presidential year and someone was confirmed by the Senate was Justice Murphy in 1940. The last time it occurred when the White House and the Senate were in opposite parties was under President Cleveland in 1888. So he would differ with the view that this is unprecedented.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, unfortunately, with Senator McConnell the facts are just not on his side. There's actually a very direct historical reference that we can consider. You'll recall -- and, John, you may have covered this back in 1988, we were in exactly the same situation. You had a Republican President of the United States who was asking a United States Senate that was controlled by the other party to confirm in an election year, in that President's final year in office, his appointee to a lifetime term on the Supreme Court. And what Democrats who were in charge of the Senate in 1988 did was they confirmed Justice Anthony Kennedy to the Supreme Court. Justice Kennedy continues to serve on our Supreme Court.\nDemocrats who confirmed him unanimously -- the Judiciary Committee was led by Vice President Joe Biden. So all we're asking Republicans to do is exactly what Senate Democrats did in 1988. That's the thing on this -- is that so often people want to say, well, you know that Democrats would be doing the same thing if the shoe were on the other foot. The shoe was on the other foot and Democrats did not do the same thing. Democrats actually did their job. They stepped up to the plate. They fulfilled their constitutional duty. They considered carefully the record of Judge Kennedy. They gave him a hearing. Many of them met with him in private. And they gave him a timely vote, and they voted in favor of him because he demonstrated -- even though he was nominated by a Republican President -- that he was somebody who could serve with honor and distinction on the Supreme Court.\nAnd look, I think history proves that vote to be a prescient one. It doesn't mean that the President agrees with every decision that Justice Kennedy has made, but I think it would be hard for anybody to quibble with his service on the Supreme Court. And I think that's an indication that in 1988, when Democrats were in charge of the Senate, they did the right thing. Now we're asking Republicans who are in charge of the Senate in 2016 to do the same thing.\nQ: And that was for the vacancy of Justice Powell's retirement from the Court?\nMR. EARNEST: I believe that's correct.\nQ: In 1987?\nMR. EARNEST: I believe that's correct, yes. But it was in 1988 that the Republican President of the United States was asking the Democratic Senate to confirm his nominee to fill that vacancy. And the Democratic Senate voted in that last year, the President's last year in office, in an election year, to confirm Justice Kennedy to the Supreme Court. So they didn't take the year off just because it was an election year. They actually did their job.\nGoyal, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thank you, sir. A couple of questions. One, today is the International Day of Yoga.\nMR. EARNEST: No kidding. How is that not in my briefing book? (Laughter.) Where is the International Day of Yoga tab? Come on, guys. We can't just take the year off because it's an election year. We got to be focused on the priorities.\nI'm just teasing with you.\nQ: Declared by the United Nations under --\nMR. EARNEST: Asking this question is quite a stretch.\nQ: Yes, sir. (Laughter.)\nQ: Oooh --\nMR. EARNEST: I couldn't even let you get the question out before I pulled that one.\nQ: Well, Prime Minister Modi proposed to the United Nations, and was declared by the U.N. And also when he addressed the U.S. Congress, he said that over 30 million Americans they practice yoga today, which, of course, can eliminate most of their medical bills and stress and mental health if it's practiced properly.\nAnd any message from the President on this day? Because even the First Lady and the First Family, they have been working in the White House and practice this.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I was not aware before you brought it up that today was the International Day of Yoga. But obviously there are millions of Americans who benefit from the studious pursuit of yoga. And there are many mental and physical health benefits associated with those who pursue this practice regularly. So obviously it underscores the deep cultural ties between our two countries. It certainly is a way that the American people have benefitted from the rich and ancient culture of India.\nQ: And if I may, two more. One, when Prime Minister Modi entered the United States Congress and he said that this is a temple of democracy, and he said this is where the world is watching whatever you do. And this is similar what he did when he entered for the first time in the Indian parliament, that this is where the people look for justice and all that.\nWhat I'm asking you, he told the lawmakers in the U.S. Congress that as far as terrorism is concerned, there is no good or bad terrorism, or there is no distinction between the two because terrorists are always bad. There are not good terrorists. So what he was telling the lawmakers that there should be done something about this terrorism. And what do you think that what they have been talking about after his visit to the -- to the international lawmakers that the whole world depends on it? And also, at the same time, he was sending the message to the world that now we are one and fight against these terrorists. And finally, who the ISIS, and who are sponsoring them or financing them or arming them?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, Goyal, obviously I think this underscores the shared values of the United States and India, which is that there is a shared commitment to the idea that using violence to accomplish a political goal, or even a threat of violence to accomplish a political goal goes against everything that we believe in. It goes against everything that we stand for. And it is a testament to the world's two largest democracies that we are committed to resolving our differences -- our political differences -- through a political process that sometimes is messy, that sometimes is less than efficient, that sometimes takes longer than it should, but a commitment to resolving our differences peacefully and in the context of an established political process and the rule of law is something that binds the United States and India. The commitment to these principles is important.\nAnd that is why the United States and India have been able to work effectively to combat terrorism. And we obviously value the counterterrorism relationship between our two countries. And our cooperation on those issues has been enhanced under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi and as a result of the effective working relationship between Prime Minister Modi and President Obama.\nQ: And quickly as far as two leaders are concerned, they're very close. And Prime Minister and President Obama, where to go from here? Because he's leader to the U.S. and also President's visit to India. And Indians in India, over a billion, they are praising the two leaders today.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, obviously Prime Minister Modi was just at the White House a couple of weeks ago. And that gave both leaders an opportunity to spend time together and to not just deepen their personal relationship, but actually strengthen the relationship between our two countries.\nAnd in the seven months that the President has remaining in office, I'm confident that he'll continue to work closely with Prime Minister Modi to advance our shared goals. And hopefully the President's successor in the Oval Office will be somebody who recognizes how important it is to build on a strong U.S.-India relationship that's been established under the leadership of President Obama and Prime Minister Modi.\nThanks, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 2:26 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2016-06-21", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}

Trump announced that he has hired several staff members to expand his campaign operations and focus on the general election in November. Veteran political operative Jim Murphy, former HR executive Lucia Castellano, digital services expert Brad Parscale, and former Bush Administration staffer Kevin Kellems have all taken roles with Mr. Trump's campaign.\nMr. Trump stated, \"I continue to build a team of great people that will ensure we win in November. I have received more votes than any Republican in the history of the party and I am confident that, along with my team, we will take our movement to the White House and Make America Great Again.\"\nJim Murphy will serve as Mr. Trump's National Political Director focusing on the campaign's key battleground states. Jim will work closely with the RNC to build a comprehensive political ground game for the general election. Jim has over 30 years of political campaign experience having worked in over 60 national, congressional and statewide races including U.S. Senators Gordon Humphrey and Bob Dole.\nLucia Castellano will serve as Director of Human Resources for the campaign. Lucia has developed and delivered business aligned HR programs on a domestic and global scale. She will handle day-to-day HR activities as well as provide strategic advice and guidance.\nBrad Parscale will spearhead Mr. Trump's digital team as the campaign's digital director. Brad is the co-founder of Giles-Parscale, a digital media and branding company based in San Antonio, Texas. With over 20 years in the digital space, Brad has served the Trump Organization in building its digital platform globally.\nKevin Kellems will work to build out the campaign's surrogate operations as the Director of Surrogates. Kevin brings decades of political campaign experience to Mr. Trump's operation and has worked for U.S. Senators Richard Lugar and Dan Coats and served as a communications aide to Vice President Cheney in 2003.\nThe campaign has also added staff to the Communications Division to expand its research and rapid response capabilities. More hires in this department are expected to be announced as the campaign continues to grow prior to the convention in July.\nDonald Trump has energized millions of hard-working people across the country to support his positions on the economy, jobs, immigration, national security, education and healthcare. Winning almost 14 million votes in the Republican primary, more than any Republican candidate in history, Mr. Trump will continue working for the people and tackling the real problems facing our nation.", "timestamp": "2016-06-21", "title": "Press Release - Donald J.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117956", "text": "* The lead author of Moody's report, Mark Zandi, was a cheerleader for Obama's stimulus and has regularly appeared before congressional committees on behalf of Democrats. Mr. Zandi, a Democrat, is a maxed-out Hillary donor. http://newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/tom-blumer/2016/03/30/imagine-mark-zandi-economys-head-cheerleader-donated-max-hillary\n* Zandi believes the stimulus worked, but his forecast was way off the mark. In 2009, he claimed that in 2012 we would have 141.4 million payroll jobs if stimulus passed and only 135.8 million without it. In 2012, there were 134.2 million payroll jobs (annual average) or 134.9 million (4th quarter over 4th quarter). Zandi's stimulus projection was not achieved until the 2nd quarter of 2015.\n* Zandi's forecasts for GDP growth were also wildly off. He projected that with the stimulus the economy would grow by 9.1 percent from 2008 through 2012. Actual growth, however, was 3.5 percent over the four years.\n* Zandi's analysis of the Trump plan is based on the same model, which, as shown above, is notably horrible at forecasting and providing policy guidance. Such models assume little or no benefit from tax rate cuts and were used to oppose Reagan's 1986 tax cut and Bush's 2003 tax cut. Zandi believes Food Stamps and Unemployment insurance provide more stimulus than tax cuts or infrastructure spending (see attached chart).\n* The analysis assumes little or no productivity boost from better trade deals, from drawing more Americans into the labor force, and from freeing business from onerous regulations. There's almost no recognition of the importance of new business formation (which has ground down) to job growth and increases in median incomes, and it completely ignores the millions of jobs that will be created through energy policy changes\n* There's no acknowledgment in the report that current policies have caused business investment to disappear and that Trump's effort to battle the establishment and strengthen the rule of law will aggressively attract new business investment (from inside the U.S. and from all over the world).\n* Zandi's analysis warns about the tightening of the labor mark from immigration control, yet admits this will boost wages and incomes for American workers.\n* Zandi's analysis assumes large Fed rate hikes — to 4% in 2017 and 6.3% in 2018, up from 2% in 2017 and 3.6% in 2018 in the baseline scenario — as a result of large deficits. It is unclear that the Federal Reserve would need increase rates to these levels to prevent overheating in an economy that many fear could slide into recession in the next year. On this alone, the report should be put in the trash can.\n* Zandi admits the arbitrariness of the assumptions by providing three different scenarios. Under the scenario that assumes enacted legislation negotiated with the Congress, the federal budget deficit in 2026 is $1.4 trillion--only some $100 billion higher than Zandi's baseline scenario of $1.3 trillion. Considering that the campaign does not have a complete fiscal plan yet, it is remarkable that Moody's likely scenario leads to deficits that are relatively close to baseline. Given the imprecision of estimates for fiscal results 10 years into the future, that difference is not material.\n* One could equally conclude from the report that the Trump policies would do no harm rather than the great harm portrayed by Hillary Clinton in citing Zandi's analysis.\n* What has the Hillary/Obama economic policy given us – the weakest recovery on record!\n* Since the recession ended, real GDP has grown at an annual rate of just 2.1 percent. Other recoveries since 1960 averaged 3.8 percent over the comparable period. GDP would be $2.0 trillion (real)/$2.2 trillion (nominal) larger if the recovery had only been average. Cumulative lost economic output (real GDP) compared with average recovery is $8.0 trillion.\n* Private-sector payrolls have grown by 12.3 percent since the end of the recession. Average recovery post-1960 over a comparable time frame was 16.3 percent. Average growth would have yielded an additional 5.8 million private-sector jobs than has been achieved under Hillary/Obama.\n* Even from the cycle low in February 2010 (Obama's cherry-picking of date), this recovery comes up 2.9 million short.\nMoody's Estimates of the Multiplier Effect of Federal Policies: http://econbrowser.com/archives/2008/10/pocketfull_of_m", "timestamp": "2016-06-21", "title": "Press Release - Mark Zandi Is An Obama Adviser And Clinton Donor"}

Jenkins, R-KS, and 39 cosponsors)\nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 1270, which would create new and unnecessary tax breaks that disproportionately benefit high-income people, increase taxes for low- and middle-income people, and do nothing to improve the quality of or address the underlying cost of health care.\nThe Affordable Care Act is working and is fully integrated into an improved American health care system. Discrimination based on pre-existing conditions is a thing of the past. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, 20 million more Americans have health insurance. And under the Affordable Care Act, we have seen the slowest growth in health care prices in 50 years, benefiting all Americans.\nH.R. 1270 would repeal the Affordable Care Act's provisions that limit the use of flexible savings accounts for over-the-counter drugs—provisions that help fund the law's coverage improvements and expansions. The bill also would provide additional tax breaks that disproportionately benefit those with higher income by expanding tax-preferred health savings accounts. These changes would do little to reduce health care costs or improve quality. To fund these new high-income tax breaks, H.R. 1270 would increase taxes paid by low- and middle-income families by removing the law's limit on repayment of premium tax credits available through the Health Insurance Marketplaces.\nRather than refighting old political battles by once again voting to repeal parts of the Affordable Care Act, Members of Congress should be working together to grow the economy, strengthen middle-class families, and create new jobs.\nIf the President were presented with H.R. 1270, he would veto the bill.", "timestamp": "2016-06-21", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 1270 – The Restoring Access to Medication Act of 2015"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118005", "text": "STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY\n(House Rules)\n(Rep. Rogers, R-KY)\nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 5485, making appropriations for financial services and general government for the fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, 2017, and for other purposes.\nThe bill's reductions in funding for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) exacerbate the damaging reductions inflicted on the IRS since 2010, and irresponsibly cut funding for the agencies charged with implementing Wall Street reform. The bill also underfunds the Federal Trade Commission's efforts to promote economic competition.\nFurthermore, the legislation includes highly problematic ideological provisions, including provisions that restrict the IRS's ability to implement the Affordable Care Act (ACA), interfere with important new regulations designed to protect consumers from risky or abusive lending, and undermine the principle of home rule for the District of Columbia. These provisions also prevent the Federal Communications Commission from promoting a free and open internet and encouraging competition in the set-top box market, impacting millions of broadband and cable customers. Furthermore, these provisions would bar Federal agency efforts to reduce the risks and costs of flood disasters. Despite these shortcomings, the Administration welcomes the bill's investments in entrepreneurship and small business financing.\nIn October 2015, the President worked with congressional leaders from both parties to secure the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA), which partially reversed harmful sequestration cuts slated for FY 2017. By providing fully-paid-for equal dollar increases for defense and non-defense spending, the BBA allows for investments in FY 2017 that create jobs, support middle-class families, contribute to long-term growth, and safeguard national security. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to enact appropriations that are consistent with that agreement, and fully support economic growth, opportunity, and our national security priorities. However, the Administration strongly objects to the inclusion of problematic ideological provisions that are beyond the scope of funding legislation.\nIf the President were presented with H.R. 5485, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.\nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill.\nDepartment of the Treasury\nInternal Revenue Service (IRS). The Administration strongly objects to the $766 million reduction in funding for the IRS compared to the FY 2017 Budget request. This reduction would bring IRS funding to FY 1993 levels, in real terms, hindering the agency's efforts to provide robust service to taxpayers, improve enforcement operations, and implement new statutory responsibilities. Furthermore, these reductions would negatively impact efforts aimed at deficit reduction, with enforcement revenues in FY 2017 estimated to be more than $11 billion lower than if FY 2010 staffing levels had been maintained. In addition, the Administration strongly opposes sections of the bill that limit IRS funding and transfers to carry out implementation of the ACA, under which millions of individuals have signed up for coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplaces. The Administration also objects to provisions that unnecessarily encumber IRS operations with burdensome reporting requirements and that would constrain enforcement of tax laws.\nDepartmental Offices. The Administration appreciates the support for targeted investments in Department-wide cybersecurity enhancements. However, the Administration objects to the bill's defunding of the Department's Systems and Capital Investment Program and is disappointed that the bill fails to permit funding for oversight and administration of the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund to be paid from the Trust Fund. In total, the bill would require a $27.4 million reduction in funding from the comparable level in the FY 2017 Budget request for core Departmental Offices Salaries and Expenses.\nCommunity Development Financial Institution (CDFI) Fund. The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the CDFI Fund, which is funded above the FY 2017 Budget request. However, the Administration is disappointed that the bill provides neither the $22 million requested for the Healthy Food Financing Initiative, which offers financial and technical assistance to expand the availability of healthy food options in distressed communities, nor the $10 million requested for the Small Dollar Loan Program to expand access to small dollar loans in underserved communities and combat predatory lending. The Administration also appreciates the continuation of the CDFI Bond Guarantee Program, but is concerned about the $250 million limitation on new commitments, which is below the program's annual average commitment level. This lower level of commitment authority would unnecessarily constrain the provision of long-term capital in low-income and underserved communities.\nOffice of Financial Research (OFR) and Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC). The Administration strongly opposes section 130 of the bill, which would subject OFR and FSOC to the annual appropriations process beginning in FY 2018. This language would hinder the independence of these entities and limit their ability to develop critical market analysis and improve regulator coordination if future funding shortfalls prevent information technology (IT) investments or the hiring of highly-skilled staff. The Administration also opposes onerous new procedural requirements that could effectively prohibit FSOC from formally designating nonbank financial companies whose material financial distress could pose a threat to U.S. financial stability. In addition, the Administration strongly opposes section 129 of the bill, which would require OFR to publish notice 90 days prior to issuing any report, rule, or regulation; research reports are intended to provide independent analysis of the facts, unswayed by public or political sentiment.\nDigital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act). The Administration appreciates that the Committee fully funded the FY 2017 Budget request for the Bureau of the Fiscal Service for Government-wide implementation of the DATA Act, and urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request for the Department of the Treasury's own implementation of the DATA Act. This funding supports efforts to provide more transparent Federal spending data, such as updating information technology systems, changing business processes, and linking financial and Federal award data with the Award ID.\nExecutive Office of the President (EOP)\nEOP Funding and Operations. The Administration objects to section 621 of the bill, which would continue a prohibition on paying salaries and expenses for certain White House staff positions and impinge on the President's ability to organize EOP operations. The Administration appreciates funding for Presidential transition costs but strongly objects to the lack of funding for Unanticipated Needs, which would severely hamper the President's ability to meet unexpected requirements for the furtherance of the national interest, security, or defense. The Administration also objects to the funding level in the bill for the National Security Council, which is $2.1 million below the FY 2017 Budget request.\nOffice of Management and Budget (OMB). The Administration strongly opposes the funding level in the bill for OMB, which is $10 million below the FY 2017 Budget request. This reduction would significantly diminish OMB's ability to carry out its mission. The Administration also objects to continuation of bill language that would require burdensome OMB cost estimates to accompany the issuance of all Executive Orders, as well as language that requires OMB to submit a report to the Congress estimating the costs of implementing the Dodd-Frank Act, an onerous and duplicative report of limited value.\nInformation Technology Oversight and Reform (ITOR). The Administration strongly opposes the funding level in the bill for the ITOR account, which is $10 million below the FY 2017 Budget request. ITOR funds important efforts to improve the most critical public-facing Federal digital services through the application of best practices in product design and engineering by the U.S. Digital Service and its agency partners. The ITOR fund also supports efforts to protect Federal systems through implementation of leading solutions to address new and constantly evolving advanced, persistent cyber-threats, drive value in Federal IT investments, and implement the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act. The bill's reductions to these initiatives would undermine efforts to secure the Nation's highest value information targets and build on successful reforms to the Federal Government's management of IT resources, which have resulted in about $3.6 billion in cost savings and avoidance.\nGeneral Services Administration (GSA)\nOverall GSA Funding. Funding for GSA is an integral part of supporting agencies in their performance of critical missions. The bill's funding level would undermine GSA's ability to deliver services, impacting agencies Government-wide.\nFederal Buildings Fund (FBF). The Administration finds the bill's funding level for the FBF unacceptable at nearly $934 million below the FY 2017 Budget request and the anticipated level of rent collections from other Federal agencies in FY 2017. The bill also denies critical construction funding for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Headquarters project and the next phase of the Department of Homeland Security's headquarters consolidation at St. Elizabeths, Washington, D.C. Since FY 2011, the Committee has chosen to fund the FBF at levels billions below what GSA collects in rent from agencies. Underfunding construction and renovation is particularly damaging, as the Government must be a good steward of its own assets, able to take advantage of opportunities to save money over the long term and maintain its buildings adequately to avoid more costly failures in the future. Further, the practice of chronically underfunding the FBF is unfair to other Federal agencies, who are no longer receiving the space and services that they are paying for, as well as to the other appropriations subcommittees who are providing funds that are never used for their intended purpose.\nFBI Headquarters. The Administration strongly urges the Congress to provide the full request in the FY 2017 Budget for the new consolidated FBI headquarters facility. The bill provides only $200 million, $559 million below the FY 2017 Budget request for GSA for construction of the new FBI headquarters. In total, the FY 2017 Budget requests $1.4 billion for the FBI headquarters project— $646 million for FBI and $759 million for GSA's Federal Building Fund. Full funding of the FY 2017 Budget request is required for GSA to award a design and construction contract for the project this year. Absent a new, modern, and secure headquarters facility, the ability of the FBI to fully support its critical national security and law enforcement missions may be compromised.\nInformation Technology (IT) Modernization Fund. The Administration is concerned that the Committee does not provide the requested $100 million for the IT Modernization Fund (ITMF), part of a larger $3.1 billion request in the FY 2017 Budget that creates a revolving fund to retire and replace legacy IT systems across Government. Absent funding for the ITMF, the cost to operate and maintain legacy systems, as well as security vulnerabilities and other risks, would continue to grow.\nUnified Shared Services Management (USSM). The Administration urges the Congress to support the $5 million requested in the FY 2017 Budget for the establishment of the USSM, a new organization housed in GSA that would serve as an integration body for the shared services environment. The funding is needed to give the USSM a stable funding source.\nSmall Business Administration (SBA)\nSBA Support for Businesses. The Administration appreciates the strong support for small businesses through the bill's robust funding for the SBA's business loan and entrepreneurial development programs. The SBA's business loan programs would support over $46 billion in lending to small businesses in FY 2017, and the increased funding for technical assistance and development programs would ensure business owners can effectively deploy capital to grow their businesses and create good jobs. However, the Administration opposes the elimination of funding for Regional Innovation Cluster grants and Growth Accelerators, as these innovative programs help regions leverage their unique assets to create jobs by turning entrepreneurial ideas into sustainable high-growth small businesses.\nDisaster Loans Program. The Administration urges the Congress to utilize the disaster relief cap adjustment authorized in the Budget Control Act of 2011 to fund the $159 million FY 2017 Budget request for SBA's administrative costs associated with major disasters. By not utilizing the cap adjustment, the bill makes unnecessary reductions to other programs to accommodate this line of support to small businesses after a disaster has struck.\nOther Independent Agencies\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Administration strongly objects to the funding level of $1.55 billion for SEC, which is $226 million below the FY 2017 Budget request. The bill would hinder SEC's enforcement, examination, and market oversight functions and undercut investor protections strengthened by Wall Street Reform that benefit both consumers and Main Street. The bill would also shortchange SEC's core programs by mandating that funding for IT initiatives increase by $50 million over the FY 2016 enacted level and prohibiting authorized IT spending from the agency's mandatory Reserve Fund. Taken together, these provisions would inhibit SEC's ability to improve oversight and examination functions in a way that investors expect and deserve. The SEC is fee-funded and its funding level has no impact on the deficit, nor does it impact the amount of funding available for other agencies.\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The Administration strongly opposes sections 502 and 503 of the bill that subject CFPB to annual appropriations and politicizes its leadership, which would severely weaken its independence and undermine its ability to serve the most vulnerable consumer populations. In addition, the Administration strongly opposes sections 506, 637, 638, and 639 of the bill that undermine key consumer protections by preventing the CFPB from finalizing or implementing payday lending and arbitration regulations and would amend the Truth in Lending Act to deny borrowers protections from certain high-cost loans. These are problematic, ideological provisions that are beyond the scope of this bill.\nConsumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). The Administration objects to the total funding level of $120 million for CPSC, an $11 million reduction below the FY 2017 Budget request. This funding level would significantly impede CPSC's public safety mission intended to safeguard consumers, particularly children, from hidden hazards that continue to cause death and severe injuries, including its ability to expand the import surveillance program through which CPSC identifies hazardous products that can cause injury or death before these goods can enter the U.S. market. In addition, the Administration objects to section 510 of the bill that would continue to prohibit CPSC from using funds to finalize or implement mandatory standards for recreational off-highway vehicles (ROVs) until CPSC commissions and completes a study with the National Academy of Sciences. This provision could indefinitely delay CPSC's ability to complete rulemaking on ROVs, potentially compromising public safety. The language also would undermine the Commission's statutory independence and authority to write public safety regulations, interfering with its regulatory independence and public safety mission.\nElection Assistance Commission (EAC). The Administration urges the Congress to provide the full $9.8 million requested for EAC in the FY 2017 Budget, including $1.5 million for the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The $4.9 million provided in the bill is half of the funding requested in the FY 2017 Budget. Such a significant reduction would severely limit EAC's ability to assist State and local entities administer Federal elections, test and certify voting equipment, and provide information about voting system standards.\nFederal Communications Commission (FCC). The Administration strongly opposes the deep reductions to the funding level for FCC, which is $53 million, or 14 percent, below the FY 2017 Budget request. These reductions unnecessarily force FCC to scale back important work on public safety and wireless spectrum, delay efforts to modernize IT systems, and undermine efforts to save the taxpayers money by consolidating office space and improving oversight of the Universal Service Fund. The Administration objects to the $106 million cap on auction program funding, which is $18 million, or 15 percent, below the FY 2017 Budget request. This would severely harm the FCC's efforts to modernize its auction infrastructure to support the increasingly complex auctions of the future, which have the potential to return tens of billions of dollars to the U.S. Treasury.\nFCC, Open Internet Order. The Administration strongly objects to sections 630, 631, and 632 that aim at delaying or preventing implementation of FCC's net neutrality order. The order, which was issued after a lengthy rulemaking process that garnered input from four million Americans, ensures a level playing field that is increasingly vital to the future of the Nation's digital economy and online competition. For almost a century, U.S. law has recognized that companies who connect Americans to the world have special obligations not to exploit the monopoly they enjoy over access in and out of Americans' homes or businesses. It is common sense that the same philosophy should guide any service that is based on the transmission of information—whether a phone call, or a packet of data. The FCC's rules recognize that broadband service is of the same importance, and must carry the same obligations as so many of the other vital services do. These carefully-designed rules have already been implemented in large part with little to no impact on the telecommunications companies making important investments in the U.S. economy, and would ensure that neither the cable company nor the phone company would be able to act as a gatekeeper, restricting what Americans can do or see online. The appropriations process should not be used to overturn the will of both an independent regulator and millions of Americans on this vital issue.\nFCC, Set-top Rule. The Administration opposes section 636 that aims at delaying the FCC from adopting or enforcing new rules to open the video set-top box market to additional competition. Currently, 99 percent of cable and satellite TV consumers rent set-top boxes directly from the cable providers, costing households an average of $230 per year. The FCC is already committed to a lengthy, thorough rulemaking process that would establish a robust record of comment and analysis from companies, non-profit organizations, and academics. The current provision unnecessarily interferes with these long-established processes by requiring a delay of at least 270 days, and probably much longer, and a redundant, potentially costly study.\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC). The Administration is concerned that the Committee is underfunding the efforts by the FTC and the Department of Justice's (DOJ) Antitrust Division to protect American consumers from criminal cartel practices—such as price fixing, fraud, and currency manipulation—and anticompetitive mergers. Since 2010, the number of proposed $1 billion \"mega mergers\" reviewed annually by the FTC and DOJ's Antitrust Division has more than doubled. Anticompetitive mergers can harm American consumers significantly by raising prices, reducing quality, limiting output, restricting consumer choice, and stifling innovation in markets such as healthcare and pharmaceuticals, defense contracting, energy and petroleum, cable television and internet, cell phones and service, airline travel, appliances, and common food items. The bill provides $317 million for the FTC, $25 million below the FY 2017 Budget request.\nUnited States Postal Service. The Administration strongly opposes new language in the bill that would roll back cost saving measures implemented by the Postal Service over the last four years. The Administration is also disappointed that language under the Payment to the Postal Service Fund account would prohibit the Postal Service from modifying its delivery schedule to better adapt to its current business environment. Each year, the President's Budget has proposed balanced reforms to provide the Postal Service with the operational flexibility to continue to meet its universal service obligation and implement structural changes that would help put it on a sustainable trajectory. While the Congress has failed to act, the Postal Service has undertaken significant administrative reforms under existing authority to reduce expenses. Despite these efforts, since FY 2012 the Postal Service has been forced to default each year on scheduled payments to reduce its unfunded liability for retiree health benefits and is expected to default on an additional $5.8 billion due during FY 2016. The Postal Service estimates that reversing four years of service changes would increase its operating deficit by roughly $1.5 billion annually and impose an additional $500 million in one-time costs.\nPrivacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB). The Administration objects to the funding level of $8.3 million in the bill for the PCLOB, which is $1.8 million, or more than 17 percent, below the FY 2017 Budget request. The funding level provided would impair PCLOB's ability to maintain sufficient staff to independently and robustly assess the multi-billion dollar counterterrorism enterprise's efforts to balance privacy and civil liberties. The Congress and the Executive Branch have asked the Board to analyze a number of complex issues that are subject to ongoing public debate, including electronic surveillance. The impact of the funding reduction on the Board's staffing would hinder its ability to satisfy these requests.\nUdall Foundation. The Administration opposes the elimination of funding requested in the FY 2017 Budget for the Udall Foundation, which provides education and research resources to American Indians and Alaska Natives. In addition, through the U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution, the Foundation provides mediation services for conflicts involving Federal agencies or interests. The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the Udall Foundation at the $5 million level included in the FY 2017 Budget request.\nDistrict of Columbia (D.C.)\nD.C. Local Budget Autonomy. The Administration does not object to the one-year shutdown exemption in section 816 of the bill, which would allow D.C. to spend local funds in the event of a lapse in appropriations in FY 2018. However, the Administration strongly objects to section 817 of the bill, which repeals the D.C. Local Budget Autonomy Act of 2012. The residents of the District and their elected leaders deserve to have the same ability as other U.S. residents and elected leaders to determine how to use their local revenues. Such authority is fundamental to a well-functioning democracy and the denial of such authority is an affront to the residents and leaders of the District. The Administration urges the Congress to adopt provisions included in the FY 2017 Budget request that would permanently allow the District to use local funds without congressional action.\nRestrictions on the District's Use of Local Funds. The Administration strongly opposes language in the bill that bars the elected leaders of the District of Columbia from determining how to use local revenues. Specifically, the Administration strongly opposes section 810 of the bill, which prohibits the District from using both Federal and local funds for abortion services for low-income women. Longstanding policy prohibits Federal funds from being used for abortions, except in cases of rape or incest, or when the life of the woman would be endangered, but restrictions on the District's use of local funds for abortion services is contrary to the principle of home rule. In addition, the Administration strongly opposes the restriction in section 809(b) of the bill on the use of both Federal and local funds for regulatory or legislative activity pertaining to recreational use of marijuana, which was approved by D.C. voters. The Administration urges the Congress to adopt the provisions in the FY 2017 Budget request that limit the abortion and recreational marijuana restrictions to Federal funds.\nD.C. Syringe Services Program. The Administration strongly opposes the restriction in the bill on the use of Federal funds for the District's syringe services program. This is contrary to current law, which prohibits the use of Federal funds for syringe services programs only in locations where local authorities determine such programs to be inappropriate.\nD.C. Education Funding. The Administration strongly opposes the $20 million funding level in the bill for the Tuition Assistance Grant Program (TAG), which is $20 million below the FY 2017 Budget request level. TAG provides grants of up to $10,000 per year to District residents to cover the difference between in-State and out-of-State tuition at public colleges and universities and helps to make college affordable for many low-income District residents. In addition, the Administration opposes the $30 million funding level in the bill for D.C. public schools, which is $10 million below the FY 2017 Budget request, and the Administration strongly opposes the additional $12 million the bill provides for the Opportunity Scholarship Program (OSP), a private school voucher program. The Administration appreciates the bill's support for evaluation and administration of OSP and will continue to use available OSP funds to support students returning to the program until they complete school, but strongly opposes additional funding for more vouchers. The Administration remains focused on improving the quality of public schools for all children rather than supporting a handful of students in private schools.\nD.C. Water and Sewer Authority. The Administration opposes the bill's lack of funding for D.C. Water and urges the Congress to provide the $14 million included in the FY 2017 Budget request for ongoing work on the combined sewer overflow project.\nOther Issues\nFinancial Institution Bankruptcy Act of 2016. The Administration is concerned by the inclusion of Title XI in an appropriations act. Revisions to the bankruptcy code have no place in an appropriations bill and the Financial Institutional Bankruptcy Act of 2016 (HR 2947) has been referred to the Senate where it should be considered in due course.\nAbortion Coverage Under Multi-State plans Administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The bill would expand current prohibitions on funding for abortion services and related administrative expenses in connection with Multi-state Plans (MSPs) administered by OPM. Section 641 appears to preclude OPM from spending any funds appropriated by this Act to administer MSPs that cover abortion services with non-Federal funds under segregated funding requirements. This expansion is not necessary to protect Federal funds and would restrict private insurance choices as well as women's access to healthcare.\nCoal-Fired Power Plant Protections. The Administration opposes section 131 of the bill, which would prohibit the use of FY 2017 appropriated funds for the enforcement of rules, regulations, policies, or guidelines implemented pursuant to certain Administration policies intended to limit public financing for coal-fired or other high-carbon-intensity power projects overseas—policies that have catalyzed similar commitments from other major exporting countries and multilateral financial institutions. These prohibitions impede U.S. leadership in reducing carbon pollution, promoting climate solutions and preparedness, and meeting our responsibility to future generations.\nCuba. The Administration strongly objects to sections 132, 133, 134, and 135, which would severely undermine the President's policy on Cuba that aims to improve the lives of the Cuban people and advance U.S. interests through expanded travel, commerce, and the free flow of information. The Administration strongly opposes section 132 on non-academic educational exchanges, as it would result in a reduction of people-to-people interactions and as such is counter to the Administration's policy to increase overall travel and the flow of information and resources to private Cubans. This provision is an unwarranted restriction on purposeful travel to Cuba by U.S. citizens, who are the best ambassadors to the Cuban people of our values and ideals. The Administration also strongly opposes section 133 regarding property confiscated by the Cuban Government, which could severely chill authorized U.S.-Cuba commerce designed to support the Cuban people. In addition, the Administration strongly opposes section 134, which is overly broad and, as written, could significantly undermine the ability for U.S. persons to engage in otherwise authorized business in order to more effectively support the Cuban people.\nFederal Flood Risk Management Standard, Executive Order (E.O.) 13690. The Administration objects to section 745 of the bill, which prohibits any funds from being used to implement, administer, carry out, modify, revise, or enforce E.O. 13690 entitled \"Establishing a Federal Flood Risk Management Standard and a Process for Further Soliciting and Considering Stakeholder Input,\" until certain conditions are met. If enacted, this provision would undermine Federal agencies' ability to protect Federal investments and could make communities more vulnerable to flood risks.\nPublic-Private Competition. The Administration opposes elimination of the moratorium on public-private competition between Government employees and private sector contractors to perform commercial activities that support agency missions. OMB continues to work with agencies on efforts to ensure the most effective mix of Federal employees and contractors and believes more time is needed for efforts to ensure core in-house capabilities for critical functions take effect before the moratorium is lifted. The Administration urges the Congress to continue the moratorium in FY 2017, as proposed in the FY 2017 Budget request.\nDelayed Implementation of E.O. 13673. The Administration objects to section 640, which would delay implementation of E.O. 13673 entitled \"Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces,\" until the Government Accountability Office conducts a comprehensive study on the effects of the E.O. and the Secretary of Labor certifies that the benefits of the order outweigh any costs. Such a delay is unnecessary and would forestall implementation of important safeguards established by the President to ensure that taxpayer dollars do not reward corporations that break labor laws and thereby jeopardize the performance and cost of Federal contracting. Over the nearly two years since the E.O. was issued, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council and the Department of Labor have conducted a measured and highly deliberative process to implement the E.O., which included publication of a proposed rule and guidance in May 2015 that generated nearly 20,000 public comments. Any final rule would need to be accompanied by a comprehensive regulatory impact analysis that responds to public comments and explains, among other things, how the rule improves economy and efficiency and the alternatives that were considered to minimize burden on small businesses.\nU.S. Digital Service Team.The Administration appreciates that the Committee fully funded the FY 2017 Budget request for OPM and the National Archives and Records Administration to develop U.S. Digital Service teams. However, the Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request for the Department of the Treasury, GSA, and SBA to develop their U.S. Digital Service teams. This funding supports efforts to improve digital services that have the greatest impact on citizens and businesses.\nConstitutional Concerns\nSeveral provisions in the bill raise constitutional concerns, including sections 204 and 205, relating to the President's authority to execute and interpret Federal laws, including the Constitution; section 621, relating to the President's authority to supervise and oversee the Executive Branch; and section 713, relating to the disclosure of certain classified and other privileged information.\nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2017 appropriations process moves forward.", "timestamp": "2016-06-21", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 5485 - Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2017"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118059", "text": "This week, the Obama Administration will be highlighting America's capacity for creativity and invention and how our innovative progress over the last seven and a half years has helped continue to make our economy the strongest and most durable in the world. To further grow our economy and encourage innovation, today, the Obama Administration is announcing ground rules to govern commercial, scientific, public safety and other non-recreational uses of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) —commonly known as \"drones—in the National Airspace System. These ground rules will enable the safe expansion of a new generation of aviation technologies that will create jobs, enhance public safety, and advance scientific inquiry.\nSince President Obama took office in 2009, aviation technologies have emerged that are powering a revolution in unmanned flight. The development of these technologies has made drones commercially available at scale for the first time. Commercial operators are using unmanned aircraft for a wide variety of applications, and consumers can choose from scores of vehicles of different sizes and capacities, many of which can be taken out of a box, launched directly into flight, and operated from a smart phone or a tablet.\nToday, the Department of Transportation is publishing the final \"Small UAS\" rule. This rule provides the first national, uniform guidelines for non-recreational operation of unmanned aircraft systems under 55 pounds. Under the new rule, drone flight will be permitted for commercial, scientific, public, and educational purposes, pursuant to a set of operational and safety requirements.\nWe are in the early days of an aviation revolution that will transform how we gather information about our world, enable more accurate science, move products around the country, and protect public health and the environment. In the short term, unmanned aircraft will provide significant benefits in areas like:\nØ Agriculture: Unmanned aircraft can monitor crop health in real-time for farmers who are trying to manage farms that are hundreds or even thousands of acres. By reducing the need for manned aircraft in agricultural operations, drones can help reduce fatal agricultural aviation accidents and can increase crop yields by providing higher-quality data about the ground below.\nØ Safer infrastructure inspection: Unmanned aircraft systems can also save lives by helping workers inspect cell phone towers, bridges, pipelines, electric lines, and oil rigs. For example, all 300,000 communications towers in the United States must be routinely inspected, and workers can be injured and even killed during these inspections. Using unmanned aircraft systems, workers can inspect towers—and other kinds of infrastructure, like utility lines, bridges, or railways—more safely.\nØ Scientific research: Scientists and engineers can use unmanned aircraft for more effective environmental monitoring of our Nation's natural resources, wildlands, and waterways.\nIndustry estimates suggest that, over the next 10 years, commercial unmanned aircraft systems could generate more than $82 billion for the U.S. economy and by 2025, the industry could be supporting as many as 100,000 new jobs.\nThe Administration believes that expanded use of drones must be done responsibly, with clear rules of the road that ensure strong safety and privacy protections. Our aviation system has historically been designed around manned aircraft, and unmanned aircraft systems will need to be carefully integrated into the National Airspace System to protect airplanes, helicopters, and the people and property over which they will fly. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will work closely with local and state governments, airports, pilots, and companies around the country in the months ahead to make sure the rule is safely implemented.\nTo advance strong privacy protections, last year the President issued a Presidential Memorandum,  Promoting Economic Competitiveness While Safeguarding Privacy, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties in Domestic Use of Unmanned Aircraft Systems. In line with the Presidential Memorandum, Federal agencies, including the Department of Defense, Department of Justice and Department of Transportation, have instituted strong unmanned aircraft systems privacy policies to protect the public. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration has also worked with industry and advocacy groups to develop national best practices, to which major companies like Amazon and Google have committed. Building on these efforts, the Administration is launching a new privacy campaign to educate pilots and companies. Among other steps, the FAA will direct potential commercial drone pilots—also called \"remote pilots\"—to review information on privacy protections as part of their certification process, and will promote strong privacy standards during the unmanned aircraft systems registration process.\nTo demonstrate the potential benefits of unmanned aircraft for the public, the Obama Administration is also announcing new Federal initiatives, including a partnership between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the FAA related to unmanned aircraft systems traffic management, and other Federal programs to deploy unmanned aircraft to respond to disasters and manage and monitor the environment.\nFurther details on the rule, privacy actions and new initiatives are outlined below.\nSafely Integrating Unmanned Aircraft\nAs a new technology, unmanned aircraft operations have to date been limited to hobbyists or have required a special exemption from the FAA. The new rule requires that unmanned aircraft to be flown according to a simple set of rules that will protect people on the ground and manned aircraft. Rules include:\n• A requirement to avoid operating unmanned aircraft over people;\n• A requirement for non-recreational remote pilots to pass a written knowledge test and to go through the same security vetting process as traditional manned-aircraft pilots;\n• A requirement for unmanned aircraft to stay at least 5 miles from airports and, among other reasonable restrictions, generally fly at an altitude below 400 feet, creating a safe buffer between unmanned and manned aircraft, which can generally fly no lower than 500 feet; and\n• A requirement for remote pilots to keep unmanned aircraft within visual sight.\nMore details will be available from the FAA.\nLooking forward, in consultation with industry and research partners, the FAA is considering additional rules that will further enable safe unmanned aircraft operations—including, for example, to govern the flight of unmanned aircraft over people. This rule is the first step towards a long-term vision of the airspace of the future that will be fully integrated, allowing for the routine safe operation of unmanned aircraft alongside manned aircraft.\nProtecting Privacy\nWhile this rule prohibits unmanned aircraft flight over people for safety reasons, as commercial unmanned aircraft use expands, companies will be able to gather new kinds of data. While this possibility creates significant economic opportunities, it also raises important privacy considerations. Entities that plan to use unmanned aircraft systems to gather personal information should have plans in place for how they collect, use and protect personal information. Like basic safety precautions, privacy should be a building block of every flight plan and every unmanned aircraft system operation.\nTo advance these goals, and pursuant to the Presidential Memorandum,  Promoting Economic Competitiveness While Safeguarding Privacy, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties in Domestic Use of Unmanned Aircraft Systems, the Administration has taken important steps forward:\nØ Instituted strong Federal standards: The Departments of Defense, the Interior, Justice, and Transportation, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) have instituted unmanned aircraft systems privacy policies. These policies help guide Federal agencies in their use of unmanned aircraft to carry out agency missions while respecting the privacy of the American people. These policies also generally require Federal contractors to adhere to the same privacy standards as the agencies themselves, helping promote strong standards in the marketplace.\nØ Developed industry-consensus best practices for protecting privacy: To promote similarly strong standards in the private sector, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) has worked with privacy advocates and industry to develop recommended best practices for unmanned aircraft privacy, transparency, and accountability,  which NTIA published last month. These best practices are supported by some of the largest companies in the unmanned aircraft industry, including Amazon and Google X, industry associations including Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International and the Commercial Drone Alliance, and civil advocates like the Center for Democracy and Technology and the Future of Privacy Forum. The Obama Administration encourages all drone operators and companies to review the best practices and to determine whether and how to apply the practices to their own unmanned aircraft operations.\nToday, in connection with the release of the new rule, the Administration is taking additional steps to enhance privacy protections:\nØ Launching a public education campaign on privacy: The Federal Aviation Administration is launching a campaign to educate pilots and citizens on drone privacy, including providing all unmanned aircraft users with recommended privacy guidelines as part of the unmanned aircraft systems registration process and through the FAA's B4UFly mobile app; educating all commercial drone pilots on privacy during their pilot certification process; and issuing new guidance to local and state governments on drone privacy issues.\nØ Issuing a call for commitments to protect privacy: New technologies and business practices can also help protect privacy. Today, the Administration is  putting out a call for private sector and nonprofit organizations to share commitments for new technologies or business practices that will protect privacy during drone operations. This call builds on actions already taken by industry. For example, one drone manufacturer is releasing a new tool that allows remote operators to create a map of where they want to fly and only captures images in that area, allowing operators to prevent the accidental collection of sensitive data. To take a second example, an unmanned aircraft software provider is integrating privacy considerations into software design by creating a pre-flight privacy checklist.\nDeploying Unmanned Aircraft for Public Safety, Research, and the Environment\nUnmanned aircraft systems are transforming the ability of local, state, and Federal agencies to carry out their missions, including in emergency assistance and disaster response, where they have been deployed by international emergency response teams in mudslides, wildfires, hurricanes, structural collapses, nuclear accidents, tsunamis, and more. They also improve our capability to conduct research, monitor wildlife, protect sensitive ecosystems, and manage and monitor the environment.\nThese tools are already being put to work by the Federal Government across a broad spectrum of application areas. Today, Federal agencies are announcing new steps to integrate unmanned aircraft systems into the National Airspace System, and to deploy these systems to protect public safety and advance scientific research:\nØ Fighting wildfires and protecting the environment through the Department of the Interior (DOI): DOI, which manages one-fifth of all land in the United States, has used unmanned aircraft systems since 2009, employing unmanned aircraft systems to conduct wildlife and vegetation surveys to protect endangered populations, archeological studies, emergency response, and wildfire management, where drones have expanded DOI's capability to suppress fires to 24 hours a day. DOI is committing to:\no Make high-definition remote sensing capability via unmanned aircraft systems available to all nine of its bureaus by 2018 to support department missions: This technology, which can provide a 500-fold increase in resolution over traditional aerial imagery, will provide affordable high resolution data and assist with many critical missions, including invasive plant and animal detection, search and rescue, wildland firefighting, flood management, earthquake forecasting, volcano research, and oil spill response.\no Finalize protocols to deploy drones to detect, assess, and attack wildfires; position crews; and enhance firefighter safety by Spring 2018. No later than 2020, the Department also will equip all DOI firefighting teams with unmanned aircraft systems necessary to successfully perform these missions as part of their toolkit for fighting fires.\no Have in place procedures for the rapid deployment of unmanned aircraft for emergency response anywhere in the country by 2020.\nØ Understanding and predicting changes in climate, weather, oceans, and coastal areas through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA): NOAA has made significant strides since 2008 in deploying unmanned aircraft systems to improve or enhance weather, climate, and coastal and oceanic observations. Today, NOAA is announcing that it:\no Commits to finalize operations, training, safety, and data management plans by 2019 for small unmanned aircraft systems to be used in the agency's routine operations, increasing NOAA's capacity to work with other government agencies and stakeholders to develop rapid response imagery of storm damage, river flood conditions, marine wildlife and ecosystem environments, and sudden changes to polar sea ice fields, as well as oil and chemical spills impacting coasts, marshlands, and marine sanctuaries.\no Is partnering with NASA, the U.S. Navy, the National Science Foundation, and other entities conducting a comprehensive assessment of unmanned aircraft observations for the improvement of weather forecasts of high-impact storms, such as hurricanes. This work could improve our ability to forecast weather, and predict and minimize the damage done by hurricanes, tornadoes, and other extreme weather events, saving lives, property, and taxpayer dollars.\nØ Developing air traffic management for low-altitude unmanned aircraft: NASA and FAA are announcing the formation of a new research collaboration, called a Research Transition Team, to identify requirements to implement large-scale unmanned aircraft system operations in low-altitude airspace. This work will focus on research to support the development of Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management by providing remote pilots with information needed to maintain separation from other aircraft and to make unmanned aircraft traffic safe and efficient through proper integration with the FAA's Air Traffic Management system. In 2016, NASA will conduct tests involving multiple unmanned aircraft systems operations beyond visual line of sight to define and refine these requirements, which will help inform future regulatory actions and, eventually, help achieve full airspace integration of unmanned aircraft systems.\nØ Engaging the government and the public on the future of unmanned aircraft: The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy today announces that it will host an event with government, academic, and industry stakeholders at the White House later this year, focused on the potential of drones to enable high-impact research, create new jobs and industries, save lives, and improve the way government agencies and companies do business; and on potential actions to further address safety, security, and privacy in this emerging field.

Charles Kettles, U.S. Army, the Medal of Honor for conspicuous gallantry.\nLieutenant Colonel (Ret.) Kettles will receive the Medal of Honor for his actions while serving as a Flight Commander assigned to 176th Aviation Company (Airmobile) (Light), 14th Combat Aviation Battalion, Americal Division. Then-Major Kettles distinguished himself in combat operations near Duc Pho, Republic of Vietnam, on May 15, 1967. He led a platoon of UH-1Ds to provide support to the 1st Brigade, 101st Airborne Division, during an ambush by a battalion-sized enemy force. After leading several trips to the hot landing zone and evacuating the wounded, he returned, without additional aerial support, to rescue a squad-sized element of stranded soldiers pinned down by enemy fire. He is credited with saving the lives of 40 soldiers and four of his own crew members.\nPERSONAL BACKGROUND:\nU.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel (Ret.) Charles S. Kettles was born in Ypsilanti, Michigan, Jan. 9, 1930. Lieutenant Colonel (Ret.) Kettles was drafted to the Army at age 21 while enrolled in Michigan State Normal College (now Eastern Michigan University) where he studied engineering. Upon completion of basic training at Camp Breckinridge, Kentucky, Kettles attended Officer Candidate School at Fort Knox, Kentucky, and earned his commission as an armor officer in the U.S. Army Reserve, Feb. 28, 1953. Kettles graduated from the Army Aviation School in 1954, before serving active duty tours in Korea, Japan and Thailand.\nAfter leaving active duty, Lieutenant Colonel (Ret.) Kettles established a Ford Dealership in Dewitt, Michigan, and continued his service with the Army Reserve as a member of the 4th Battalion, 20th Field Artillery. Lieutenant Colonel (Ret.) Kettles volunteered for active duty in 1963. He attended Helicopter Transition Training at Fort Wolters, Texas in 1964. During a tour in France the following year, Lieutenant Colonel (Ret.) Kettles was cross-trained to fly the famed UH-1D \"Huey.\" In 1966 he was assigned as a flight commander with the 176th Assault Helicopter Company, 14th Combat Aviation Battalion, and deployed to Vietnam from February through November 1967. His second tour of duty in Vietnam lasted from October 1969, through October 1970. In 1970, Lieutenant Colonel (Ret.) Kettles went to Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas, where he served as an aviation team chief and readiness coordinator supporting the Army Reserve. He remained in San Antonio until his retirement from the Army in 1978.\nLieutenant Colonel (Ret.) Kettles completed his bachelor's degree at Our Lady of the Lake University, San Antonio, Texas, and earned his master's degree at Eastern Michigan University, College of Technology, in commercial construction. He went on to develop the Aviation Management Program at the College of Technology and taught both disciplines. He later worked for Chrysler Pentastar Aviation until his retirement in 1993. Kettles currently resides in Ypsilanti, Michigan, with his wife Ann.\nKettles' awards and decorations include the Distinguished Service Cross, the Legion of Merit, the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Bronze Star Medal with one bronze oak leaf cluster, Air Medal with Numeral \"27,\" the Army Commendation Medal with one bronze oak leaf cluster, the National Defense Service Medal with one bronze service star, the Korean Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal with one silver service star and one bronze service star, the Korea Defense Service Medal, the Armed Forces Reserve Medal with bronze hourglass device, the Master Aviator Badge, Marksman Badge with carbine bar, the Valorous Unit Citation, the Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross with bronze star, the United Nations Service Medal, the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal with \"60\" Device, and the Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross Unit Citation with palm device.\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nTHE MEDAL OF HONOR:\nThe Medal of Honor is awarded to members of the Armed Forces who distinguish themselves conspicuously by gallantry above and beyond the call of duty while:\n•     engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States;\n•     engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force; or\n•     serving with friendly foreign forces engaged in an armed conflict against an opposing armed force in which the United States is not a belligerent party.\nThe meritorious conduct must involve great personal bravery or self-sacrifice so conspicuous as to clearly distinguish the individual above his or her comrades and must have involved risk of life.

Coming into office, the President was committed to reinvigorating the American scientific enterprise through a strong commitment to basic and applied research, innovation, and education; to restoring integrity to science policy; and most importantly, to making decisions on the basis of evidence, rather than ideology.\nIn a speech at the National Academy of Sciences in April 2009, the President called for expanded investments in research and development and a focus on science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education. He noted that science, technology, and innovation are essential to sustaining economic growth, enabling Americans to lead longer and healthier lives, limiting the harm from climate change, and providing U.S. armed forces and homeland defenders with the tools they need to succeed in every contingency.\nToday, the Administration is releasing a list of 100 examples of the profound impact that the President's leadership has had in building U.S. capacity in science, technology, and innovation and bringing that capacity to bear on national goals. The release of this list marks the milestone of Dr. John Holdren becoming, on June 18, 2016, the longest-serving President's Science Advisor since Vannevar Bush pioneered a similar role while serving Presidents Roosevelt and Truman during and after World War II.\nEXPANDING SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND INNOVATION CAPACITY AND IMPACT ACROSS GOVERNMENT\n1. Elevated the quality and rigor of the science, technology, and innovation advice in the White House. President Obama reinvigorated the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) by restoring the rank of Assistant to the President to the OSTP Director and rebuilding the two OSTP directorates—environment and national security—that had been slimmed down and subsumed into the science and technology directorates in the previous Administration. In addition, he created three new high-level science, technology, and innovation positions in the White House—a U.S. Chief Technology Officer, a U.S. Chief Information Officer, and a Chief Data Scientist. He also reinvigorated the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST), which augments the science, technology, and innovation advice available from full-time government employees with part-time advisors who are leaders in science and technology in the private and academic sectors. This Administration's PCAST is arguably the most distinguished and diverse in the history of presidential science and technology advisory bodies, which in their current form date back to the Eisenhower Administration. PCAST has produced more than 30 reports for the President on such topics as influenza preparedness, energy innovation, advanced manufacturing, and cybersecurity, and many of PCAST's recommendations have been embodied in Presidential initiatives. Read more, more, and more.\n2. Boosted science, technology, and innovation talent across the Administration. The President raised the bar for science, technology, and innovation talent serving in his Administration with five Nobel Laureates in science and 28 other members of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in his initial tranche of appointments. Through the U.S. Digital Service, 18F at the General Services Administration (GSA), and the Presidential Innovation Fellows program—each created by this Administration—more than 450 engineers, designers, data scientists, and product managers have signed on for a tour of duty to serve in over 25 agencies alongside dedicated civil servants to improve how government delivers modern digital services to the American people. Because of the efforts of these digital teams, for example, it now takes a fraction of the time it used to take for residents to renew their green cards and for prospective college students to identify which schools provide the best value for them, and all Americans can enroll in health insurance plans online. The President also created the Presidential Management Fellows (PMF) STEM track, with the first Class of PMF-STEMs started in 2014. Read more, more, more, more, and more.\n3. Connected science, technology, and innovation experts and resources across the Administration to address national challenges and opportunities. The National Science and Technology Council (NSTC)—through its approximately 100 interagency working groups, task forces, and subcommittees—published over 90 policy papers over the course of the Obama Administration in the areas of environment, natural resources, and sustainability; homeland and national security; fundamental science; technology; and STEM education. The NSTC set strategies and coordinated resources for many of the Administration's interagency science, technology, and innovation initiatives, including the U.S. Global Change Research Program, the National Nanotechnology Initiative, the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Program, the Materials Genome Initiative, the Federal Cybersecurity Research and Development Program, and the Ocean Acidification Research and Monitoring Program.

On the first day of his Administration, the President issued a Presidential Memorandum calling on all the agencies in the Federal Government to work together to create \"an unprecedented level of openness\" in government and to \"establish a system of transparency, public participation, and collaboration.\" An Open Government Directive and a plan for implementing those goals were issued in December 2009. In March 2009, the Transparency and Open Government Presidential Memorandum was followed by a Presidential Memorandum on Scientific Integrity, stating in part that:\nThe public must be able to trust the science and scientific process informing public-policy decisions. Political officials should not suppress or alter scientific or technological findings and conclusions. If scientific and technological information is developed and used by the Federal Government, it should ordinarily be made available to the public.\nThis Presidential Memorandum called for all agencies to embed these principles in appropriate policies and procedures and charged the OSTP Director with overseeing the development and ensuring the adequacy of the agency plans. Detailed guidance concerning the content of the plans was developed by OSTP in consultation with the agencies over the next 20 months, and 22 agencies subsequently produced and published their scientific integrity plans.

In June 2013, President Obama released his Climate Action Plan (CAP), with three components: reducing U.S. emissions of heat-trapping pollutants; building the Nation's preparedness for and resilience against the impacts of climate change; and working with other countries to encourage and help them do the same. A key pillar of domestic emissions reductions, the Clean Power Plan (CPP), was released by President Obama and Environmental Protective Agency (EPA) Administrator Gina McCarthy in August 2015. The CPP sets strong but achievable standards for carbon emissions from power plants and allows for flexibility in state emission-reduction plans to meet the tailored state goals. To help build preparedness and resilience, the Administration: created a State, Local, and Tribal Leaders Task Force, as well as an interagency Council to understand needs and coordinate efforts; implemented a 10-year research plan from the U.S. Global Change Research Program; completed the National Climate Assessment, the most comprehensive assessment ever of expected climate-change impacts in the United States, disaggregated by region and economic sector; and launched the Climate Data Initiative and Climate Resilience Toolkit to provide the data and tools needed by officials, businesses, and individuals to take appropriate action to increase their preparedness for climate change. To support international efforts to address climate change, the Administration leveraged bilateral and multilateral cooperation to reach a historic agreement on climate change at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris in December 2015. Read more, more, more, more, more, more, and more.\n55. Assisted developing countries with resilient development.

Contributed to the rapidly declining cost of renewable-energy technologies. The Administration launched the SunShot Initiative through DOE as a collaborative national effort to develop solar-energy technologies to make solar energy cost-competitive without incentives by 2020. The Administration's energy-research priorities, combined with industry innovation encouraged in part by vital Federal tax credits, have contributed to dramatic reductions in the cost of wind and solar photovoltaic electricity generation, which in turn have led to rapidly increasing uptake of these renewable-energy technologies. The United States now generates more than three times as much electricity from wind and 30 times as much from solar as it did in 2008; and the cost for wind electricity in good-to-excellent sites has fallen roughly 40 percent, and the cost for solar electricity has fallen by 50-60 percent. President Obama has also worked with Congress to secure multi-year extensions of the Investment Tax Credit and Production Tax Credit for renewable energy, which will ensure that these vital incentives will continue to support the growth of clean energy technologies.

From 2009 to 2015, the Administration finalized 40 new or updated efficiency standards, which are estimated to save more than $540 billion in consumer energy costs through 2030. Supported by the Administration's leadership, which has included more than $300 million in research and development for improving LED, the L-prize competition, and the Global Lighting Challenge, LED bulbs available now consume 85 percent less energy and last 25 times longer than incandescent bulbs, and costs of LED bulbs have dropped by more than 90 percent since 2008. Read more, more, more, and more.\n59. Issued first-ever greenhouse gas and new fuel-economy standards and improved electric vehicle technology. The Administration released greenhouse gas and fuel-economy standards for light duty and heavy duty vehicles. The fuel-economy standards for passenger vehicles are the toughest in U.S. history and once fully implemented, will save drivers as much as $8,000 per vehicle in fuel costs over the life of their new vehicle while cumulatively avoiding 6 billion tons of greenhouse gas pollution and reducing American dependence on foreign oil by 2 million barrels per day in 2025. The standards for heavy-duty vehicles for model years 2014-2018 will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 270 million metric tons and save 530 million barrels of oil over the life of these vehicles. In addition, supported by Federal research investments, the costs of lithium-ion batteries have dropped by more than 70 percent since 2008, making electric vehicles more affordable. More than 400,000 plug-in electric vehicles are now on the roads. Read more and more.\n60. Created new models for supporting innovation in the energy sector. The Administration's five Energy Innovation Hubs are bringing together investigators from the government, academic, and business sectors, from multiple disciplines, to focus their collective talents on key national energy-innovation needs. In addition, the Energy Frontier Research Centers created by the Administration in 2009 are advancing fundamental science and long-term research relevant to real-world energy systems and overcoming roadblocks to revolutionary energy technologies in particular domains. And ARPA-E is supporting research with potentially high commercial impact that is deemed too risky for industrial investment. Read more, more, and more.\n61. Set a goal to double global government funding for clean energy research and development through Mission Innovation. As part of COP21 of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris in December 2015, the United States launched an initiative in which the 20 countries that account for most government-funded energy research and development globally pledged to double their clean-energy research and development investments over 5 years. At the inaugural Mission Innovation Ministerial, which took place alongside the seventh Clean Energy Ministerial in June 2016, those 20 nations, plus the European Union as the newest partner, announced their specific plans to meet that target to invest nearly $30 billion per year in public clean energy research and development by 2021. Read more and more.\n62. Encouraged private-sector investment in clean-energy innovation. Through the Clean Energy Investment Initiative, foundations, institutional investors, and other long-term investors have pledged more than $4 billion in independent commitments to scale up clean-energy innovation and climate-change solutions. Additionally, in June 2015, the Administration launched a new Clean Energy Investment Center at DOE to make information about Federal energy and climate programs more understandable to the public, including to mission-driven investors. The Administration has also created and promoted new opportunities for clean-tech entrepreneurship, including support for student startups through business plan competitions, vouchers for services available to small businesses at National Laboratories, and embedded entrepreneurial training within the National Laboratories. These opportunities have already supported hundreds of startups that have attracted well over $250 million in follow-on funding, doubled the number of partnership agreements between small businesses and National Laboratories, and generated hundreds of jobs. Read more.\n63. Created the most comprehensive process ever for assessing energy-technology and energy-policy options. Following recommendations of PCAST studies in November 2010 and March 2013, the Administration launched two of the most comprehensive Federal assessments of energy technology and energy policy ever undertaken by the Federal Government. To assess energy-technology options, DOE completed two cycles—in late 2011 and mid 2015—of the Quadrennial Technology Review, a rigorous review of the status of and prospects for all known energy-supply and energy-efficiency technology options. To assess energy policy options, DOE issued the first installment of the Quadrennial Energy Review in 2015, focused on infrastructure for energy, transport, distribution, and storage. This 4-year, moving-spotlight assessment of the Nation's energy-policy options is now entering its second phase, scheduled for completion in late 2016, which will focus on the electricity sector from generation to end-use.

Under the Recovery Act, the Administration added or improved more than 114,000 miles of broadband infrastructure, making high-speed connections available to more than 25,000 community institutions. The Administration issued a \"Dig Once\" Executive Order to streamline broadband permitting and accelerated the deployment of broadband infrastructure on Federal lands. Overall, the average home Internet speed in the United States has tripled in the past 4 years. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has taken action to preempt state laws that restrict local communities from investing in their own broadband networks, opening the way for increased broadband competition and deployment. The Administration took steps to aggressively repurpose spectrum for mobile broadband and other innovative uses. Through aggressive spectrum policy and private investment, more than 98 percent of Americans have access to fast 4G/LTE mobile broadband, and the vast majority of Americans are covered by four or more LTE providers. The FCC held the most successful spectrum auction in U.S. history—raising more than $40 billion—and launched an innovative two-sided auction to repurpose television spectrum for broadband use. The United States made 100 megahertz in the 3.5 GHz band available for shared use through a three-tier access system like the one envisioned by PCAST. The U.S. Ignite partnership has created an ecosystem of 40 local gigabit and next-generation broadband testbeds and more than 75 applications that use these networks. Through these efforts and the FCC's aggressive steps to unlock high-band spectrum, the United States is poised to maintain its lead as the world shifts to 5G. Read more, more, more, more, and more.\n74. Accelerated efforts to meet the digital needs of low-income Americans. In July 2015, President Obama announced the ConnectHome initiative—led by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)—to provide home-based Internet access, digital literacy training, and devices to families with school-age children living in HUD-assisted housing in 28 pilot communities to initially reach over 275,000 low-income households—and nearly 200,000 children. In its first year, the pilot has already secured commitments from Internet service providers to auto-enroll public housing residents. Under the ConnectALL initiative, the President issued a national call-to-action in March 2016 to connect an additional 20 million Americans to broadband by 2020. This initiative will bring together Federal agencies, the private sector, and non-profit organizations to help close the digital divide. In parallel, and with the support of the Administration, the FCC has created a national $2.25 billion broadband subsidy for low-income families by reforming its Lifeline program.

The President also found that it was necessary to maintain certain restrictions with respect to North Korea that would otherwise have been lifted pursuant to Proclamation 8271 of June 26, 2008, which terminated the exercise of authorities under the Trading With the Enemy Act (50 U.S.C. App. 1-44) with respect to North Korea.\nOn August 30, 2010, I signed Executive Order 13551, which expanded the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13466 to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States posed by the continued actions and policies of the Government of North Korea, manifested by its unprovoked attack that resulted in the sinking of the Republic of Korea Navy ship Cheonan and the deaths of 46 sailors in March 2010; its announced test of a nuclear device and its missile launches in 2009; its actions in violation of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1718 and 1874, including the procurement of luxury goods; and its illicit and deceptive activities in international markets through which it obtains financial and other support, including money laundering, the counterfeiting of goods and currency, bulk cash smuggling, and narcotics trafficking, which destabilize the Korean Peninsula and imperil U.S. Armed Forces, allies, and trading partners in the region.\nOn April 18, 2011, I signed Executive Order 13570 to take additional steps to address the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13466 and expanded in Executive Order 13551 that will ensure the implementation of the import restrictions contained in United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1718 and 1874 and complement the import restrictions provided for in the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.).\nOn January 2, 2015, I signed Executive Order 13687 to take further steps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13466, as expanded in Executive Order 13551, and addressed further in Executive Order 13570, to address the threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the provocative, destabilizing, and repressive actions and policies of the Government of North Korea, including its destructive, coercive cyber-related actions during November and December 2014, actions in violation of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1718, 1874, 2087, and 2094, and commission of serious human rights abuses.\nOn March 15, 2016, I signed Executive Order 13722 to take additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13466, as modified in scope and relied upon for additional steps in subsequent Executive Orders, to address the Government of North Korea's continuing pursuit of its nuclear and missile programs, as evidenced by its February 7, 2016, launch using ballistic missile technology and its January 6, 2016, nuclear test in violation of its obligations pursuant to numerous United Nations Security Council Resolutions and in contravention of its commitments under the September 19, 2005, Joint Statement of the Six-Party Talks, that increasingly imperils the United States and its allies. Executive Order 13722 also implements certain multilateral sanctions imposed under United Nations Security Council Resolution 2270.\nThe existence and risk of proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula and the actions and policies of the Government of North Korea continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13466, expanded in scope in Executive Order 13551, addressed further in Executive Order 13570, further expanded in scope in Executive Order 13687, and under which additional steps were taken in Executive Order 13722 of March 15, 2016, and the measures taken to deal with that national emergency, must continue in effect beyond June 26, 2016. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to North Korea declared in Executive Order 13466.\nThis notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.\nBARACK OBAMA\nThe White House,\nJune 21, 2016.", "timestamp": "2016-06-21", "title": "Notice - Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to North Korea"}

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117649", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n12:31 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. I do not have any announcements at the top, so we can go straight to your questions.\nDarlene, would you like to start?\nQ: Thanks. So a federal judge has struck down administration regulations on hydraulic fracking, and says the State Department doesn't have the authority to regulate fracking. Is there any reaction to that from the White House? And do you know at this point if you will -- if the administration will appeal that decision?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, my understanding is that this is something that will be considered by the 10th Circuit, so I'd refer you to the Department of Justice for the legal procedures at play here. We obviously believe that we've got a strong argument to make about the important role that the federal government can play in ensuring that hydraulic fracturing that's done on public lands doesn't threaten the drinking water of people who live in the area. That's a pretty simple proposition.\nAnd it's indicative of the kind of common-sense approach that the Obama administration has pursued.\nThis is an approach that seeks to protect public health and public safety while also creating space for innovators to strengthen the economy. And based on the results that we've seen in our economy from the dramatic increase in oil and gas that's produced in the United States, much of which is attributable to developments like fracturing, I think it's an indication that we've pursued this in the right way.\nAnd that's certainly been our policy approach. But when it comes to the legal authority at stake, we'll continue to make our case in the courts.\nQ: On another topic, Senator Marco Rubio -- any surprise here that he has done an about-face and decided to run again for reelection?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think everybody is surprised about his announcement. But I'll leave it to him to explain. Mark apparently wasn't surprised. (Laughter.) Mark was unpersuaded by the 10,000 times he said publicly -- (laughter) -- that he was not going to be -- that he was going to be a private citizen in January. So the rest of us I think took Senator Rubio's word, but Mark, ever the skeptic -- (laughter) -- sniffed this one out.\nQ: How much does his decision complicate efforts by Democrats to take that seat in November? Because you're now going from what would have been an open seat to an incumbent defending --\nMR. EARNEST: The President has had the opportunity to express his vocal support for Congressman Murphy. The President's endorsement outlines why the President believes that Congressman Murphy would be an excellent United States senator and why he would do an excellent job representing Florida in the United States Senate. And there will be an opportunity for an aggressive campaign and aggressive debate. I know that Florida has their party primaries rather later in the season, so that's something that both Congressman Murphy and Senator Rubio will have to contend with. Both of them will have tough primaries and then there will be a general election. But the President has made I think a persuasive case about the credentials of experience and values that Congressman Murphy brings to the job.\nQ: Thanks.\nMR. EARNEST: Ayesha.\nQ: So North Korea successfully conducted a missile test today. And it seems like their technology is getting better. They don't seem to be slowing down in their pursuit of these weapons despite sanctions. I know that you've said before that their actions are going to leave them isolated, but it doesn't seem that isolation and sanctions are leading to any change in what they're doing or in their behavior. I mean, is there anything that the U.S. can do right now to influence North Korea? I guess what -- is there more that China needs to do? What can be done, since it seems like what's going on right now hasn't really affected their leaders?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me start by saying that the United States strongly condemns the provocative actions by the North Korean government that is a flagrant violation of their international obligations. The U.S. Strategic Command did, in fact, detect and track what we assess were two North Korean missile launches yesterday. The missiles were tracked over the Sea of Japan, where initial indications are that they fell. NORAD was also monitoring the launches and determined that they did not pose a threat to North America. But I do think that the impact of these provocations will be to only strengthen the resolve of the international community that has such serious concerns with North Korea's behavior.\nSo the United States will do what we have done in the past, which is work with the international community, particularly our allies in South Korea and Japan. We'll also continue our ongoing dialogue with the Chinese and the Russians about what additional pressure can be applied to the North Koreans. And the key here will be to continue to work with our allies and partners to address this destabilizing threat in Northeast Asia.\nQ: On another topic, President Putin said today that Russia must boost its combat readiness in response to NATO's aggressive actions. And this comes after the German foreign minister had warned NATO against war-mongering. What is your response to these latest comments from Putin, and concerns that some NATO actions may actually be heightening tensions?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, we've been clear as often as possible about the fact that NATO is a defensive alliance, that that alliance is critical to the national security of the United States. It's the cornerstone of our national security policy. And these are allies and partners who cooperate with us not just to enhance the national security of the United States and Europe, but to actually respond to other situations around the globe, including the situation in Afghanistan. We've talked in here before about how we value the contributions that our NATO partners have made to that effort.\nSo I'm confident that the President will have an opportunity to meet with our allies at the NATO summit in Warsaw next month, and there will be extensive discussions about what additional steps we can take to further strengthen that alliance that's so critical to the national security of the United States.\nMichelle.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Are you aware of Donald Trump's speech on Clinton today? Did you see any of it?\nMR. EARNEST: I saw just a little bit of the coverage. I don't know that I'll have a whole lot to say about it.\nQ: Well, saying things like Hillary Clinton has the blood of many on her hands, and he was repeating a quote that she should be in prison. He also said a number of things that seemed on their face to not be true. And of course, the whole thing will be fact-checked to death soon.\nMR. EARNEST: I hope so.\nQ: What do you think of that kind of rhetoric? Because a lot of these statements, even if some are proven to be false on their face, the message still got out today.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think the questions about how to most effectively cover and fact-check and hold public officials accountable for their statements is something that all of you and the executives at your media organizations have to carefully consider. And those are decisions that all of you should make based on your own professional experience and expertise.\nI think it's the responsibility of those who are in the spotlight -- and the President has certainly embraced this responsibility -- which is to engage in debates that are rooted in fact and evidence and rationality. And our democracy is best served when public officials and those who are seeking power in our democracy willingly engage in that kind of fact-based debate. And those who don't should be held accountable for that. But that accountability is provided by professional, independent news organizations and ultimately by the American people.\nQ: I think it surprised a lot of people to hear him say those words, though. I mean, even in some sense, it was a shade of something he had said before, but to say that she has blood on her hands of many and that she should be in prison -- does that strike you as more off the mark than other things that have --\nMR. EARNEST: When it comes to directly responding to those kinds of charges, I'll defer to my colleagues at the Clinton campaign and surely many others who I think would have their own view to register about comments like that.\nQ: And can you respond to the Democratic sit-in that's going on right now on the Hill over guns, and also your reaction to the fact that Senator Collins's amendment doesn't really seem to be going anywhere?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me take the last one first, which is that the Department of Justice and officials at the FBI continue to review the proposal that's been put forward -- or at least that's been floated by Senator Collins. And the position of the administration remains the same, which is that we believe that everyone who is suspected of having ties to terrorism should be prevented from buying a gun.\nUnfortunately, Republicans blocked legislation that would do that. That's unfortunate. But, look, if there is a step that would prevent some people who are suspected of having ties to terrorism from being able to buy a gun, then we'd support that, too. I don't really understand why we wouldn't go for -- why we would prioritize the watered-down version over the extra-strength version. But that's apparently the way the legislative process works.\nWhat we're working to determine right now is whether or not the current proposal can be shaped to effectively accomplish the goal that it states to set out -- or that it sets out to achieve. And that's something that's under review at the Department of Justice and the FBI. We'll continue to remain in touch with members of Congress as they continue to consider it.\nAs it relates to House Democrats, I think they're showing the kind of frustration and even anger that people around the country have about the inability of the Republican-led Congress to take common-sense steps that would protect the American people. And I think they're resorting to what I think even they would acknowledge is an extraordinary step to change the status quo in the House of Representatives that prevents even consideration of common-sense gun safety legislation.\nThe thing to keep in mind is what Democrats are asking for is neither radical, nor controversial. They're asking for votes and bipartisan support for policies that are supported by a majority of Democrats, a majority of Republicans, and a majority of gun owners all across the country. These are common-sense proposals that do not undermine the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans. But they are common-sense proposals that would, in fact, succeed in at least making it harder for individuals who shouldn't have guns from being able to get their hands on them.\nIt's a common-sense proposition. It's not controversial. And Democrats I think are rightly frustrated that those kinds of proposals haven't even been called up for a vote by the Republicans who are in charge of the Congress. And they are taking some extraordinary steps to try to change that.\nQ: Has the President spoken to Senator Collins or any of the others that were trying to hammer out a compromise?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know that the President has been involved in any of those conversations in the last 24 hours, but --\nQ: Why wouldn't he, though?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, because this is something that, frankly, is being negotiated in the Senate. There is no ambiguity about the administration position on this. There are some important technical questions that do have to be considered, and that's exactly what officials at the Department of Justice and the FBI are reviewing. And, frankly, those are questions related to the technical way in which these new rules and procedures and laws would be implemented.\nSo if we determine that it's necessary and would be helpful for the President to intervene, I'm sure he would not hesitate to do so. But to this point, that has not been necessary.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, I think I know the answer to this question, but I'll ask it anyhow. What do you think of Paul Ryan's health care plan?\nMR. EARNEST: well, I think a couple of things. How long do you have? Well, I'll try to keep it brief. I think what I would simply say is that for six years now, Republicans have vowed to put an Obamacare alternative on the floor of the Congress, and for six years now, they've broken that promise. The proposal they put forward today does include some more details, but the details they put forward are wildly unpopular, which is why I suspect they will not be put to a vote in the Republican-led Congress.\nThese are proposals like privatizing Medicare, and specific proposals that even those Republicans acknowledge would raise costs for working families and for older Americans. There are a whole host of other details that are not included in there. I suspect the reason that those details are not included is that they're even worse than the details that are provided. And these are details that relate to how much the program would cost -- because the Republican proposal is to repeal a bunch of the Obamacare measures that actually do have the effect of reducing the deficit, but yet Republicans believe that those should be taken away. They also don't want to get into too much detail about how many millions of Americans would lose health care coverage as a result of their proposal.\nSo, again, because they're making decisions based on politics, not based on actually trying to get something done, it's not surprising to me that the most unpopular, controversial, unworkable elements of their plan are not detailed in their proposal that was rolled out today.\nQ: Do you think Speaker Ryan should get some credit for getting consensus on something, though?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what consensus does he have? If he actually has consensus, then why wouldn't they put it to a vote?\nAgain, Speaker Ryan is not the chair of some think-tank here in Washington, D.C.; he's the Speaker of the House of Representatives who presides over the agenda of the House of Representatives and wields the authority of a historically large Republican majority in the House of Representatives. So, no, he doesn't get any credit for writing a white paper that doesn't include many details. If he were actually serious about his job and actually serious about trying to improve the health care system in this country, then he'd put forward a legislative proposal that would pass the House of Representatives. But he hasn't done either one.\nQ: I knew you'd answer --\nMR. EARNEST: I'm glad we could have this entertaining exchange anyway.\nRon.\nQ: Any word on the reschedule of the President's and Secretary's Wisconsin campaign trip?\nMR. EARNEST: Not at this point. But as soon as we have more details we'll let you know. It's just a matter of trying to make their two schedules work.\nQ: Do you think it will happen next week sometime? Sooner rather than later? Or is --\nMR. EARNEST: We're obviously interested in trying to get this on the books as soon as we can. I don't yet know at this point whether or not we'll be able to get it done next week. But once we figure that out, we'll definitely let you know.\nQ: The meeting this afternoon between the President and Secretary Kerry, is that about the dissent memo on Syria?\nMR. EARNEST: It's not. This is a meeting that the President has with Secretary Kerry on a weekly basis whenever the two of them are in town. Now, the two of them are not in town the same time every week, but when they are, they have a meeting. And so I think they will cover a range of issues. I wouldn't rule out that this topic could come up, but this meeting is not focused on the so-called dissent cable.\nQ: What is the President's view of that? We heard the Vice President basically dismiss it. The President I guess will say that he's -- well, you tell me.\nMR. EARNEST: Look, the President approves of this --\nQ: -- of the process.\nMR. EARNEST: -- well-established process at the State Department. There should be an opportunity for people who do have a dissent to register to do so. And that's a healthy part of the process. And, look, the President has long acknowledged how difficult the situation in Syria is, and so the President would certainly welcome new ideas that are put forward for confronting it.\nQ: But there's no new ideas in that cable, that memo --\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't read the cable, but based on the way that it's been reported, those are things that had been previously considered. And, look, the President is determined to make sure that the United States does not make the unwise assessment that somehow we can succeed in imposing a military solution on Syria. The United States tried that when President Bush ordered the invasion of Iraq in 2003, and that did not lead to results that were in our country's best interest. So the President wants to avoid that.\nAnd the President believes that we need to be focused on ISIL and that if we take resources that are currently dedicated toward ISIL and redirect them toward the Assad regime, that's going to not advance our broader goal.\nQ: -- it wasn't so much to impose a military solution. It was to use the military for more leverage. Is there anything about this -- or the whole Cessation of Hostilities process, or is that essentially ended?\nMR. EARNEST: No, the Cessation of Hostilities is something that we're working hard to try to keep from completely falling apart. There are places where the Cessation of Hostilities has frayed in a way that has had a very negative impact on the security situation inside of Syria. In those places where the Cessation of Hostilities has had some positive impact, the benefit has been that humanitarian aid has been able to flow into some of those areas. And some of those are areas that badly needed it.\nSo I think the latest estimate that I've seen is more than 800,000 Syrians have been able to get some form of humanitarian relief in the last few months since the Cessation of Hostilities was put into place. That obviously is a positive consequence of that. But, look, there are far too many places where we have seen the Cessation of Hostilities intermittently observed, and that's been frustrating.\nBut I do want to go back to one element of your question -- and this is sort of the way that -- the way that this is often considered is that somehow the use of the United States military could be used to enhance the leverage of the United States. I'm not really sure what that means. I think what it means is it means that we should direct the force of the United States military against the Assad regime. And I think there are a lot of questions that are raised about that.\nFirst of all, how do you do that without harming innocent civilians? Second of all, I'm not sure exactly what legal authority the President would rely on to do something like that. And, three, it seems like a slippery slope. Does that just mean that there's one round of missile strikes and then we spend a month trying to negotiate again, and if nothing happens, do we launch more missile strikes? Or then do we have to steadily ramp up the military engagement? And at what point does that stop?\nIt's hard to imagine where that stops -- that that somehow stops short of a war against a sovereign nation that is being backed by Russia and Iran in a way that's unclear to me how exactly that is going to apply additional pressure against ISIL, which is the extremist organization that we obviously are quite concerned about.\nQ: -- about the military, and there are proposals obviously like the safe zone and so forth.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess this is the point. So I'm glad you say that, because this, I think, is the point. The President is relying on his military advisors. They have not put forward a specific plan that would address the concerns that I've just raised. They acknowledge that. The President is relying on them for the good military advice that he's getting thus far that is having the tangible impact of applying additional pressure on ISIL. We have made progress, just looking inside of Syria, in terms of regaining more than 20 percent of the territory that ISIL previously controlled. And we've done that just by training forces inside of Syria. So we are making progress in encircling Raqqa. We are applying significant pressure against ISIL in Syria. We are making progress in terms of shutting off the border they benefit from.\nSo the point is the President is relying on the best military advice. He is following that military advice, and it's showing results. Not as fast as we would like; it certainly hasn't turned Syria into a Jeffersonian democracy that reflects the pluralism and diversity of that country. But we are making progress. And it's because the President is relying on the best advice that's out there.\nSo it's important to remember that for all of the criticism about how the President's policy has not led to the kind of results that we'd all like to see inside of Syria, it's not because the President has failed to consider or implement an alternative proposal. There is nobody else that has put forward a specific idea -- with the possible exception of the safe zone that you referred to. I think the President has laid out in pretty clear terms why he doesn't think that's a good idea. And the truth is you don't hear a whole lot of people talking about that anymore, and I don't even know if that was mentioned in the speech today from, frankly, the President's most high-profile critic.\nQ: Donald Trump.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes.\nQ: I don't either. I didn't hear that. Just one on this humanitarian -- the concern about the humanitarian situation that's continuing to be a disaster. Just one -- in Fallujah, another situation where there are now tens of thousands of people who are fleeing the city, which is good in that they feel safe enough to do that. How concerned is the administration about what appears to be a developing humanitarian situation there, particularly in the Sunni area? Because you'd said on a number of occasions about the need for coalition partners and others to essentially support those communities once ISIS is removed. How concerned are you about the evolving situation -- or devolving situation in --\nMR. EARNEST: I actually was asking about this -- I posed a question similar to this to some of our national security staff earlier this week. And it's important to understand that there are sort of two different situations here that we are concerned about. The first is -- and the President has talked about this publicly, including when he met with the GCC countries in Riyadh earlier this spring -- and that is ensuring that the Iraqi government has the necessary resources to try to stabilize those communities that are liberated from ISIL.\nRamadi is the best example of this. When ISIL controlled Ramadi they essentially destroyed the infrastructure of that city. They destroyed a number of buildings. And the Iraqi central government has been working hard to rebuild that city so that people can return to their homes. That is a way to certainly inspire a lot of confidence in the central government in Iraq. The people of Ramadi know that the central government is looking out for them if the central government is working hard to rebuild their city.\nThe problem is that the central government of Iraq is rather cash-strapped right now. And so international financial assistance has been critical to ensuring they have the resources to accomplish that goal. And they've been working on that. And they will obviously need to use those kinds of resources to rebuild Fallujah once the work has been done to drive ISIL out of that city.\nThat has primarily been an effort led by the international community to provide resources to the central government of Iraq to accomplish that task.\nYou're asking I think about a similarly important situation that's being handled somewhat differently. You're asking about a situation as it relates to internally displaced persons. These are essentially individuals who, like you described, have been able now to flee Fallujah because of the fighting there. While that doesn't necessarily sound like a good thing, it probably is a sign of progress because previously those individuals had been holed up in their homes and ISIL hadn't let them out. But the question is, once they fled their homes and fled their city, where do they go? And it means that there are now tens of thousands of internally displaced Iraqis, residents of the city of Fallujah, who are fleeing violence.\nAnd what the United Nations has done is try to step and collect funding from countries around the world to try to provide for the immediate humanitarian needs of individuals who are in that situation. There are already some refugee camps -- or they're not technically refugees because they're still inside the country, but camps for individuals who are internally displaced. But the capacity of those camps needs to expand to incorporate the tens of thousands of people who are fleeing the violence in Fallujah.\nSo the State Department announced yesterday that the United States had made a $20 million commitment to funding those efforts. We're obviously going to need to see a lot more funding for the U.N.-led efforts from around the world. So the State Department will be hosting a donor conference to consider actually both of these questions -- both stabilization funding that can be provided to the central government of Iraq, but also funding that can be provided to the United Nations as they organize efforts to try to meet the basic humanitarian needs of internally displaced people inside of Iraq.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Is there a circumstance that you can envision or that the White House can envision whereby the North Koreans stop testing missiles?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it certainly would be in their interest to do so. Right now this is probably the most isolated country in the world. Their economy is suffering under withering economic sanctions that are not just imposed by the United States and our allies, Japan and South Korea, but also have an impact -- a significant impact on their economic relationship with countries like Russia and China. So there's a clear incentive for the North Korean government to start abiding by their international obligations and living up to the U.N. Security Council resolutions that apply in a situation like this.\nBut the choice is theirs, and it will be a choice that they will have to make. Until that time, they're going to continue to be isolated. Their economy is going to suffer. And as a result of the decisions made by the North Korean government, unfortunately the people of North Korea will suffer.\nQ: Does the White House believe that Iran is at least in part helping to fund the missile program in Pyongyang?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have an assessment about that situation to share, but we'll see if we can get you one.\nQ: Is it your understanding that there is a strong and lasting relationship between Tehran and Pyongyang as it relates to funding some of the missile programs that have been taking place in that country?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me just say in general that we have previously expressed significant concerns about the degree to which both North Korea and Iran are contributing to the proliferation of weapons technology that's dangerous. That's something that we've said in the past. I don't have an updated assessment on that. I don't have an updated assessment of sort of how those countries have benefitted from the actions of the other. We can see if we can provide you some more information about it, though.\nQ: The reason I ask is because, if that's the case -- and certainly in the past that certainly appeared to be the case -- how is it a good idea that an American company might want to sell the Iranians aircraft technology, for example, while they continue to fund a missile program that threatens not only our allies in the region, but indeed could threaten the United States mainland?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, so I think you're asking about the Boeing deal. And the direct question there is, essentially this is a result -- this was written into the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action that was agreed to last year and prevents Iran from being able to obtain a nuclear weapon. And the concern that the Iranian government had is that their fleet of commercial aircraft, passenger aircraft, was aging dramatically and it was contributing to a rather unsafe situation inside of Iran. And I think this is a good example of how their desire to reengage with the international community did give the United States and the international community leverage to get Iran to make a bunch of serious commitments as it relates to their nuclear program.\nSo this is a benefit that Iran got, only after we were able to definitively confirm independently that they had abided by the terms of the deal and that they had essentially rendered harmless their plutonium reactor, that they had disconnected thousands of centrifuges, that they had reduced their highly enriched uranium stockpile by 98 percent. Only after we had confirmed that they'd taken all those steps, and only after we have seen them continue to cooperate with independent verification systems did we allow this kind of thing to move forward.\nWhat it doesn't change, however, are the sanctions that remain in place against Iran because of Iran's ballistic missile program. And those sanctions are in place. They are occasionally toughened based on the discretion of the Treasury Department, and they are rigorously enforced. And they will continue to be as long as Iran continues to flout their international obligations when it comes to their ballistic missile program.\nQ: And last, on the Donald Trump comments today, he cited the video that then-Secretary Clinton suggested may have been behind the attack in Benghazi. He cited her comments about landing under sniper fire overseas and previous explanations for why she set up her private server as examples of her being a liar. He called her a \"world-class liar.\" Your reaction to his description based on those examples?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I think for a direct response to his speech, I'd refer you to Secretary Clinton's team.\nChris.\nQ: Josh, Sunday, June 26th, is going to be the one-year anniversary of the Supreme Court decision on marriage equality nationwide. It's also going to be the three-year anniversary of the Supreme Court decision against the Defense of Marriage Act and California's Proposition 8. It's also the 13th anniversary of the Lawrence v. Texas decision against state laws criminalizing same-sex relations. Is there any consideration on the part of the administration to designate June 26 as a federal holiday as a result of that coincidence?\nMR. EARNEST: I was not aware of that coincidence at this point, and so I'm not aware of any consideration of making that day a federal holiday. But obviously after the Supreme Court decision was announced last year, the President went out of his way to acknowledge the historic nature of that decision and the significant impact, positive impact, it would have all across the country. So it obviously is a day that, whether it's federal holiday or not, is one that the President will long remember.\nQ: But do you know how the President will observe the anniversary --\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know if there will any formal observance on the part of the President this year.\nCheryl.\nQ: Thanks. If I can go back to health care. Donald Trump has said he wants to repeal and replace Obamacare. He's called it a mess. Speaker Ryan actually rolled out his plan today. Are they any changes to the Affordable Care Act that you would still like to see made?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Cheryl, what we have indicated is that the way that the Affordable Care Act has been implemented thus far has yielded enormous benefits for the American people. Twenty million more Americans have health insurance since the Affordable Care Act went into effect. We've seen that the inflation rate of health care costs is at historic lows since the Affordable Care Act went into effect. And there are a wide variety of consumer protections that many Americans enjoy, including ensuring that they're not discriminated against for preexisting conditions, ensuring that young adults can remain on their parent's health care until age 26, and ensuring that Americans all across the country can get access to free preventative services, including birth control. That is also a requirement of Obamacare.\nSo there are a variety of ways in which the American people have benefitted from that historic law. But what the President has said is that we remain open to good-faith efforts by Democrats or Republicans to strengthen the law. We would welcome the opportunity to do that. But unfortunately, what we have seen from Republicans, almost 60 times now, I believe, is an effort to repeal in whole or in part the Affordable Care Act. And that's not going to keep health care costs low. That's not going to get anybody health insurance. It also didn't win them a presidential election in 2012. We'll see if it does this time.\nQ: What I was really trying to get at, is there anything in the Ryan plan that you see might be workable?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, basically the details that we have seen I'm not sure that many people support them. I think that's why Speaker Ryan doesn't even want to put Republicans in a position of having to vote for it. Because I don't think they would.\nBut -- and that's even before we see the details that are so unpopular they don't want to release them. And look, I understand why. It's not going to be popular to increase the deficit, which is exactly what would happen if Republicans were to repeal some of the measures included under the Affordable Care Act that they've identified. And they would be taking away health care from millions of people. We don't exactly how many millions because they've refused to release some key details that would provide insight into that.\nBut again, since this is a political document, I understand why they wouldn't want to release the details. But I think that's also why it's not worthy of consideration as a legislative proposal.\nKaren.\nQ: There's some signs, Josh, that there might be a deal coming soon on the Zika funding between the House and Senate numbers. You've gone over all the numbers. The President wants the $1.9 billion. But that is not in the cards. Are you prepared to accept a number that's somewhere between the House and the Senate numbers that they've agreed on?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it's not just the President who wants $1.9 billion in funding. It is the top scientists and public health professionals in the United States who say that we need $1.9 billion in funding to do everything possible to protect the American people from the Zika virus. So, again, I don't really understand why we would stop short of that.\nThe second thing I would say is that we've seen a significant group of Democratic and Republican governors come forward and say that Congress should approve significant resources to fight the Zika virus. But here we are, four months after the administration put forward our detailed, specific legislative proposal for this funding, and Republicans in Congress have not approved it, and we've seen half-measures put in place -- I don't even think you could call the House version a half measure. It's a third measure because it is barely a third of what our public health professionals say is necessary to protect the country from the Zika virus.\nSo I understand that there are bipartisan negotiations that are ongoing on Capitol Hill. But time's a wasting. It's been four months since the President identified this as a significant problem. It's actually been longer than that because the President met with his national security team back in January to begin discussing this issue because he recognized there's a significant threat here. But it's been four months since the administration put forward a very specific proposal backed by our nation's top public health professionals to outline exactly what's needed.\nAnd again, I don't understand why Congress would stop short of providing everything that our health care professionals say is necessary to do everything possible to protect the American people from the Zika virus.\nQ: But is something better than nothing? And if they don't get something done by recess, then what?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, I think if they don't get anything done by recess, I think you're going to find members of the -- Republican members of the United States Congress facing very tough questions from their constituents about why they are falling down on the job on something that is so critical to the public health of the American people, particularly given the unique threat that this poses to pregnant women and their newborn babies.\nQ: And a quick one. Hillary Clinton is in town today. She was meeting with Democrats on the Hill. Did she -- or is she planning to stop by the White House today?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any meetings that she has at the White House today.\nToluse.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I wanted to ask about Brexit. The vote is coming up tomorrow. I know you've been asked about this a couple of times. But is there any plan for the President to weigh in again in any significant way about this upcoming vote?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I'm not aware of any plans on the part of the President to weigh in once again. Obviously, when the President was in London earlier this year, he was asked about it. And he had an opportunity to give a rather robust explanation, or I should say description of his view of this matter.\nAnd look, the immediate impact of his comments were felt across the country -- both in terms of the news coverage, but also in some of the public opinion polling over there. But we'll have to see what the outcome is here. We've been very clear about the President's view that the United States benefits from having the UK as a member of a strong EU. But ultimately it's the British people who should decide for themselves. They're a sovereign country. They're a country with whom we have a special relationship. And the British people are certainly entitled to make these kinds of decisions for themselves and for their country.\nQ: If I can ask about the Syrian dissenters again --\nMR. EARNEST: I understand what you mean. Yes.\nQ: -- on Syria. You mentioned that sort of all the ideas that you understand are in the dissent are sort of ideas that have already been considered. But haven't -- sort of the situation on the ground, hasn't that changed to a certain extent to where those ideas may be worth revisiting? The Cessation of Hostilities was tried and to a certain extent hasn't held up. So isn't it somewhat worth sort of revisiting those old ideas now that the situation on the ground has changed?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Toluse, I don't think so. Again, for many of the reasons that Ron and I were discussing. Again, to the extent that there are specific proposals in there -- and again, I'm not sure what it means \"the judicious use of military force to enhance the leverage of American negotiators\". I understand what that means in principle, but I don't really know what that means in application. I'm not sure that such a thing exists.\nMore importantly I'm not sure that our military leaders know that such a thing exists. I think the real risk of that kind of approach is multifold. It certainly does raise questions about a slippery slope that could lead the United States deep into another ground war in the Middle East, focused on removing the leader of a Muslim country. That didn't turn out very well the last time we tried that.\nIt's unclear to me exactly what sort of legal authority the President would have to do something like that. It's also unclear exactly how that would have a positive impact on our efforts to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\nSo again, the President has been quite direct about how challenging the situation is inside of Syria. I think that -- but for all of the criticism, with the possible exception of the no-fly zone, our critics aren't really putting forward specific, tangible alternatives to the policy that the President is currently pursuing.\nQ: Secretary Kerry met with a group of these dissenters yesterday. I imagine during that meeting they may have put forward some specifics. Does the President have any interest in meeting with any of the people who wrote this dissent?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any sort of meeting like that, that the President would engage in. I think it's appropriate for the Secretary of State to meet with individuals inside his own agency who have written the memo. But I don't anticipate at this point that the President would meet with the authors of it.\nJerome.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. Just to follow up on the Brexit. You've stated many times the President's position on the subject. But can you tell us a bit about the way he approaches tomorrow's vote? How closely is he monitoring the polls, the debate over there? How worried is he about the outcome?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I know the President has been following the campaign and has certainly been aware of the advocacy that's gone on, on both sides. I don't anticipate that the President will be watching returns. The President is traveling tomorrow and will be on the West Coast for most of the day. But the President is certainly interested in the results. And once a result has been reached, I'm sure the President will be interested to hear what it is.\nThe President described, when he was in London, as you recall, that the stakes for the UK are quite high. But there are significant consequences for the United States, as well. So this is a decision for the British people to make. But the outcome matters a great deal to the people of the United States, and it's something that the President will monitor accordingly.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, in the interview with Derek Jeter, President Obama said that he's looking forward at the end of his presidency to catching up on some sleep. I was wondering if you've got any way of quantifying how much sleep does the President get most nights. (Laughter.) And should we be worried that he doesn't get enough?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what the President would say is that he gets enough, but I think like most of us, he'd be happy to get a little bit more. Look, I think that was mostly a lighthearted exchange about his post-presidency. And --\nQ: He sounded serious about it.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think he would certainly -- like I said, I think he would enjoy the opportunity to have some more sleep, and have some more sleep that I suppose would be more restful without the weight of the world on your shoulders. But I think what was also evident from that interview is how much the President has enjoyed being President. He's deeply enjoyed and derived great pleasure from having the opportunity to serve in this job. And to be the Commander-in-Chief of the finest fighting force that the world has ever known is something that gives him great pleasure and something of which he's immensely proud.\nBut the President has also had an opportunity to influence our country and our debates and the world, consistent with his values and consistent with the kinds of things that up to this point he's been fighting for throughout his career. So his tenure in the White House has been enormously satisfying, but he's also looking to a life post-presidency that includes more and more restful sleep.\nQ: Have you ever known him to take a nap during the course of a workday?\nMR. EARNEST: Certainly not during the course of a workday. No, I can't think of a situation in which I've observed the President napping.\nQ: Does he ever tend to sleep in?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have as much detail about the President's sleep habits as you might think. (Laughter.) I'm not sure why you would think that I would have a lot of details of the President's sleeping habits. I don't. I think like most people, I suspect the President does allow himself to sleep in a little later on weekends.\nJC, go ahead.\nQ: I'd like to follow up on the baseball theme, and I'd like to get off the nap theme.\nMR. EARNEST: You and me both. (Laughter.)\nQ: Is there a difference?\nQ: Is the President doing any yoga? (Laughter.)\nQ: Will the President sometime in his future consider becoming, if offered, the commissioner of Major League Baseball?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not aware of any offer like that that's being considered. Obviously the President is a fan of his hometown Chicago White Sox. But I think the President has discussed previously that he would have an interest, potentially, if the opportunity arose under the right circumstances, to be part of an ownership group of an NBA franchise. So the President is obviously a big NBA fan. So I don't know if that kind of opportunity will present itself, but I suspect that's something that he would enjoy.\nQ: It's now out there.\nMR. EARNEST: I guess it is. I guess it is.\nYes, sir.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. So at today's House Financial Services Committee hearing with Chairman Yellen, Republican Chairman Jeb Hensarling criticized the administration's close relationship with the Fed. He called it something like a revolving door. What does the President view is his relationship with Chairman Yellen? And is there any merit to a claim like that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I didn't watch the hearing today, so I don't know if the Chairman presented any evidence to substantiate his claim. What I will just say as a matter of principle and as a matter of policy is that the President believes that the United States and our economy benefits significantly from having monetary decisions made independently. And this is a principle that I think has been important to our country's economic success not just over the last seven years, but over the last several generations. So this is an important principle and one that the Obama administration has abided by scrupulously. And, in fact, that kind of independence was part of the criteria that the President has drawn upon in choosing someone to lead the Federal Reserve.\nSo the President's decision to re-nominate Chairman Bernanke earlier in his presidency, and then his decision to nominate Janet Yellen as chair of the Federal Reserve was in part influenced by both Mr. Bernanke's and Ms. Yellen's commitment to the independence of the Fed. They take that quite seriously, and the President does too.\nJohn.\nQ: If the Zika bill came over and looked more like the Senate bill, had some offsets -- you're not going to get the $1.9 billion -- can you rule out a veto of something like that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, John, this definitely falls in that category of things that if it were just you and me, and we had a blank piece of paper here, we could probably sketch out a pretty common-sense proposal just in our negotiations. Maybe we'd get the advice of Dr. Fauci a little bit, and we'd probably hammer out in an hour or two, even though neither you nor I is a public health professional.\nSo those kinds of negotiations, when they go through Congress, however, takes a bit longer. So it's hard to judge at this point exactly how it's going to turn out. And we'll obviously make sure that our views are known as that process continues. But unfortunately, I just won't be in a position to negotiate it from here.\nQ: Given how serious the White House feels about the gun issue and Zika, why hasn't the President done more? Why hasn't he picked up the phone, maybe schedule some meetings, had some members over here?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, the President believes that his number-one priority is protecting the country and protecting the American people. He believes that should be Congress's number-one priority too. I don't really understand why the President should be in a position where he has to twist arms in Congress to get Republicans to do the common-sense things that would protect the country from the Zika virus.\nSo again, the President lent his voice and his own legislative -- his team's legislative expertise to putting together and trying to advance the necessary funding to fight Zika that our public health professionals asked for. And we've continued to make the case for why that's important. We've certainly given Dr. Frieden and Dr. Fauci and other senior public health professionals in the United States a platform to help all of you understand exactly why this is an important issue. Dr. Frieden and Dr. Fauci and others have spent a lot of time on Capitol Hill. Secretary Burwell has as well. Those conversations have been focused on how this money would be spent and why it's critical to the health and safety of the American people, particularly pregnant women and newborn babies.\nBut, look, at some point, Republicans in Congress just have to decide if they're going to do their job. And, frankly, this one should be an easy one.\nQ: But isn't arm-twisting, or at least trying to twist a few arms part of the job?\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah. Look, and I think that's why we've advocated for it. The President has certainly made the case that this is an important thing for Congress to do. The President rolled this out with a lot of fanfare. The President discussed this proposal in an interview -- a nationally televised interview with CBS. The President has had individual conversations with members of Congress. We certainly have had -- you've seen Dr. Fauci and other senior officials at the CDC stand at this podium, making the case for why this is important.\nSo we've made a robust case. I know Secretary Burwell has spent a lot of time talking to individual members of Congress. So we've made a substantive case about why this is important. But at some point, Republicans in Congress actually have to do the job that they've worked so hard to get.\nYes, ma'am.\nQ: Hi, Josh. Over 100 House Democrats yesterday sent a letter to the President asking him to remove the citizenship requirement for federal aid, especially for DACA recipients who are not eligible for education federal help. Do you know if the President has received a letter and if there will be any consideration on the matter?\nMR. EARNEST: I am not aware of the letter, but why don't I check on it and we'll see if we can get you a response.\nYes, ma'am. I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. President Obama sent a notice and a message to the Congress on the continuation of the national emergency with North Korea. So do you have anything -- more detail on it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, that is just a regular notification to Congress that significant concerns about North Korea's provocations persist. And it explains why we continue to have tough sanctions in place to isolate North Korea and the work that we're doing to try to persuade them to come into compliance with their international obligations.\nSo that is just a notification to Congress that's required on a regular schedule to describe why we continue to have significant concerns with the decisions that are being made in North Korea.\nQ: You don't have anything -- any action to North Korea?\nMR. EARNEST: At this point -- and it was just yesterday that we did detect two missile launches from North Korea. And we're going to continue to consult with our allies and partners in the region, and certainly the members of the President's national security team will review additional information about these tests and consider an appropriate response.\nQ: One more question. The President played golf every weekend. I'm wondering what is his handicap? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: That's a national security secret. (Laughter.) That's just a joke. I don't know the President's handicap, but his golf game has improved.\nQ: Jess is a professional golfer.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, maybe we'll have you on the range sometime. Thanks, everybody. Have a good day.\nEND 1:29 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2016-06-22", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}

But we can't solve any of these problems by relying on the politicians who created them.\nWe will never be able to fix a rigged system by counting on the same people who rigged it in the first place.\nThe insiders wrote the rules of the game to keep themselves in power and in the money.\nThat's why we're asking Bernie Sanders' voters to join our movement: so together we can fix the system for ALL Americans. Importantly, this includes fixing all of our many disastrous trade deals.\nBecause it's not just the political system that's rigged. It's the whole economy.\nIt's rigged by big donors who want to keep down wages.\nIt's rigged by big businesses who want to leave our country, fire our workers, and sell their products back into the U.S. with absolutely no consequences for them.\nIt's rigged by bureaucrats who are trapping kids in failing schools.\nIt's rigged against you, the American people.\nHillary Clinton who, as most people know, is a world class liar –\njust look at her pathetic email and server statements, or her phony landing in Bosnia where she said she was under attack but the attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers, a total self-serving lie.\nBrian Williams' career was destroyed for saying far less.\nYesterday, she even tried to attack me and my many businesses. But here is the bottom line: I started off in Brooklyn New York, not so long ago, with a small loan and built a business worth over 10 billion dollars. I have always had a talent for building businesses and, importantly, creating jobs. That is a talent our country desperately needs.\nI am running for President to end the unfairness and to put you, the American worker, first.\nWe are going to put America First, and we are going to Make America Great again.\nThis election will decide whether we are ruled by the people, or by the politicians.\nHere is my promise to the American voter:\nIf I am elected President, I will end the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C.\nThe other candidate in this race has spent her entire life making money for special interests – and taking money from special interests.\nHillary Clinton has perfected the politics of personal profit and theft.\nShe ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund – doing favors for oppressive regimes, and many others, in exchange for cash.\nThen, when she left, she made $21.6 million giving speeches to Wall Street banks and other special interests – in less than 2 years – secret speeches that she does not want to reveal to the public.\nTogether, she and Bill made $153 million giving speeches to lobbyists, CEOs, and foreign governments in the years since 2001.\nThey totally own her, and that will never change.\nThe choice in this election is a choice between taking our government back from the special interests, or surrendering our last scrap of independence to their total and complete control.\nThose are the stakes.\nHillary Clinton wants to be President. But she doesn't have the temperament, or, as Bernie Sanders' said, the judgement, to be president.\nShe believes she is entitled to the office.\nHer campaign slogan is \"I'm with her.\"\nYou know what my response to that is? I'm with you: the American people.\nShe thinks it's all about her.\nI know it's all about you – I know it's all about making America Great Again for All Americans.\nOur country lost its way when we stopped putting the American people first.\nWe got here because we switched from a policy of Americanism – focusing on what's good for America's middle class – to a policy of globalism, focusing on how to make money for large corporations who can move their wealth and workers to foreign countries all to the detriment of the American worker and the American economy.\nWe reward companies for offshoring, and we punish companies for doing business in America and keeping our workers employed.\nThis is not a rising tide that lifts all boats.\nThis is a wave of globalization that wipes out our middle class and our jobs.\nWe need to reform our economic system so that, once again, we can all succeed together, and America can become rich again.\nThat's what we mean by America First.\nOur country will be better off when we start making our own products again, bringing our once great manufacturing capabilities back to our shores.\nOur Founders understood this.\nOne of the first major bills signed by George Washington called for \"the encouragement and protection of manufactur[ing]\" in America.\nOur first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned us by saying:\n\"The abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people.\"\nI have visited the cities and towns across America and seen the devastation caused by the trade policies of Bill and Hillary Clinton.\nHillary Clinton supported Bill Clinton's disastrous NAFTA, just like she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization.\nWe've lost nearly one-third of our manufacturing jobs since these two Hillary-backed agreements were signed.\nOur trade deficit with China soared 40% during Hillary Clinton's time as Secretary of State -- a disgraceful performance for which she should not be congratulated, but rather scorned.\nThen she let China steal hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property – a crime which is continuing to this day.\nHillary Clinton gave China millions of our best jobs, and effectively let China completely rebuild itself.\nIn return, Hillary Clinton got rich!\nThe book Clinton Cash, by Peter Schweitzer, documents how Bill and Hillary used the State Department to enrich their family at America's expense.\nShe gets rich making you poor.\nHere is a quote from the book: \"At the center of US policy toward China was Hillary Clinton…at this critical time for US-china relations, Bill Clinton gave a number of speeches that were underwritten by the Chinese government and its supporters.\"\nThese funds were paid to the Clinton bank account while Hillary was negotiating with China on behalf of the United States.\nShe sold out our workers, and our country, for Beijing.\nHillary Clinton has also been the biggest promoter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will ship millions more of our jobs overseas – and give up Congressional power to an international foreign commission.\nNow, because I have pointed out why it would be such a disastrous deal, she is pretending that she is against it. She has even deleted this record of total support from her book – deletion is something she is very good at -- (at least 30,000 emails are missing.)\nBut this latest Clinton cover-up doesn't change anything: if she is elected president, she will adopt the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and we will lose millions of jobs and our economic independence for good. She will do this, just as she has betrayed the American worker on trade at every single stage of her career – and it will be even worse than the Clintons' NAFTA deal.\nI want trade deals, but they have to be great for the United States and our workers.\nWe don't make great deals anymore, but we will once I become president.\nIt's not just our economy that's been corrupted, but our foreign policy too.\nThe Hillary Clinton foreign policy has cost America thousands of lives and trillions of dollars – and unleashed ISIS across the world.\nNo Secretary of State has been more wrong, more often, and in more places than Hillary Clinton.\nHer decisions spread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched.\nAmong the victims is our late Ambassador, Chris Stevens. He was left helpless to die as Hillary Clinton soundly slept in her bed -- that's right, when the phone rang at 3 o'clock in the morning, she was sleeping.\nAmbassador Stevens and his staff in Libya made hundreds of requests for security.\nHillary Clinton's State Department refused them all.\nShe started the war that put him in Libya, denied him the security he asked for, then left him there to die.\nTo cover her tracks, Hillary lied about a video being the cause of his death.\nHere is what one of the victim's mothers had to say:\n\"I want the whole world to know it: she lied to my face, and you don't want this person to be president.\"\nIn 2009, before Hillary Clinton was sworn in, it was a different world.\nLibya was cooperating.\nIraq was seeing a reduction in violence.\nSyria was under control.\nIran was being choked by sanctions.\nEgypt was governed by a friendly regime that honored its peace treaty with Israel.\nISIS wasn't even on the map.\nFast forward to 2013: In just four years, Secretary Clinton managed\nto almost single-handedly destabilize the entire Middle East.\nHer invasion of Libya handed the country over to the ISIS barbarians.\nThanks to Hillary Clinton, Iran is now the dominant Islamic power in the Middle East, and on the road to nuclear weapons.\nHillary Clinton's support for violent regime change in Syria has thrown the country into one of the bloodiest civil wars anyone has ever seen – while giving ISIS a launching pad for terrorism against the West.\nShe helped force out a friendly regime in Egypt and replace it with the radical Muslim Brotherhood. The Egyptian military has retaken control, but Clinton has opened the Pandora's box of radical Islam.\nThen, there was the disastrous strategy of announcing our departure date from Iraq, handing large parts of the country over to ISIS killers.\nISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made.\nISIS also threatens peaceful Muslims across the Middle East, and peaceful Muslims across the world, who have been terribly victimized by horrible brutality – and who only want to raise their kids in peace and safety.\nIn short, Hillary Clinton's tryout for the presidency has produced one deadly foreign policy disaster after another.\nIt all started with her bad judgment in supporting the War in Iraq in the first place.\nThough I was not in government service, I was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war, and yes, even before the war ever started.\nBut Hillary Clinton learned nothing from Iraq, because when she got into power, she couldn't wait to rush us off to war in Libya.\nShe lacks the temperament, the judgment and the competence to lead.\nIn the words of a Secret Service agent posted outside the Oval Office:\n\"She simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the office…from the bottom of my soul, I know this to be true…Her leadership style – volcanic, impulsive…disdainful of the rules set for everyone else – hasn't changed a bit.\"\nPerhaps the most terrifying thing about Hillary Clinton's foreign policy is that she refuses to acknowledge the threat posed by Radical Islam.\nIn fact, Hillary Clinton supports a radical 550% increase in Syrian refugees coming into the United States, and that's an increase over President Obama's already very high number.\nUnder her plan, we would admit hundreds of thousands of refugees from the most dangerous countries on Earth – with no way to screen who they are or what they believe.\nAlready, hundreds of recent immigrants and their children have been convicted of terrorist activity inside the U.S.\nThe father of the Orlando shooter was a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan, one of the most repressive anti-gay and anti-women regimes on Earth.\nI only want to admit people who share our values and love our people.\nHillary Clinton wants to bring in people who believe women should be enslaved and gays put to death.\nMaybe her motivation lies among the more than 1,000 foreign donations Hillary failed to disclose while at the State Department.\nHillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency.\nHere is some more of what we learned from the book, Clinton Cash:\n* A foreign telecom giant faced possible State Department sanctions for providing technology to Iran, and other oppressive regimes. So what did this company do? For the first time ever, they decided to pay Bill Clinton $750,000 for a single speech. The Clintons got their cash, the telecom company escaped sanctions.\n* Hillary Clinton's State Department approved the transfer of 20% of America's uranium holdings to Russia, while 9 investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation.\n* Hillary Clinton appointed a top donor to a national security board with top secret access – even though he had no national security credentials.\n* Hillary Clinton accepted $58,000 in jewelry from the government of Brunei when she was Secretary of State – plus millions more for her foundation. The Sultan of Brunei has pushed oppressive Sharia law, including the punishment of death by stoning for being gay. The government of Brunei also stands to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of Hillary's Trans-Pacific Partnership, which she would absolutely approve if given the chance.\n* Hillary Clinton took up to $25 million from Saudi Arabia, where being gay is also punishable by death.\n* Hillary took millions from Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and many other countries that horribly abuse women and LGBT citizens.\nTo cover-up her corrupt dealings, Hillary Clinton illegally stashed her State Department emails on a private server.\nHer server was easily hacked by foreign governments – perhaps even by her financial backers in Communist China – putting all of America in danger.\nThen there are the 33,000 emails she deleted.\nWhile we may not know what is in those deleted emails, our enemies probably do.\nSo they probably now have a blackmail file over someone who wants to be President of the United States.\nThis fact alone disqualifies her from the Presidency.\nWe can't hand over our government to someone whose deepest, darkest secrets may be in the hands of our enemies.\nNational security is also immigration security – and Hillary wants neither.\nHillary Clinton has put forward the most radical immigration platform in the history of the United States.\nShe has pledged to grant mass amnesty and in her first 100 days, end virtually all immigration enforcement, and thus create totally open borders in the United States.\nThe first victims of her radical policies will be poor African-American and Hispanic workers who need jobs. They are the ones she will hurt the most.\nLet me share with you a letter our campaign received from Mary Ann Mendoza.\nShe lost her amazing son, Police Sergeant Brandon Mendoza, after he was killed by an illegal immigrant because of the open borders policies supported by Hillary Clinton.\nSadly, the Mendoza family is just one of thousands who have suffered the same fate.\nHere is an excerpt from Mrs. Mendoza's letter:\n\"Hillary Clinton, who already has the blood of so many on her hands, is now announcing that she is willing to put each and every one of our lives in harms' way – an open door policy to criminals and terrorists to enter our country. Hillary is not concerned about you or I, she is only concerned about the power the presidency would bring to her. She needs to go to prison to pay for the crimes she has already committed against this country.\"\nHillary also wants to spend hundreds of billions to resettle Middle Eastern refugees in the United States, on top of the current record level of immigration.\nFor the amount of money Hillary Clinton would like to spend on refugees, we could rebuild every inner city in America.\nHillary's Wall Street immigration agenda will keep immigrant communities poor, and unemployed Americans out of work. She can't claim to care about African-American and Hispanic workers when she wants to bring in millions of new low-wage workers to compete against them.\nHere are a few things a Trump Administration will do for America in the first 100 days:\n* Appoint judges who will uphold the Constitution. Hillary Clinton's radical judges will virtually abolish the 2nd amendment.\n* Change immigration rules to give unemployed Americans an opportunity to fill good-paying jobs\n* Stand up to countries that cheat on trade, of which there are many\n* Cancel rules and regulations that send jobs overseas\n* Lift restrictions on energy production\n* Repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare -- it is a disaster.\n* Pass massive tax reform to create millions of new jobs.\n* Impose tough new ethics rules to restore dignity to the Office of Secretary of State.\nThere is one common theme in all of these reforms.\nIt's going to be America First.\nThis is why the stakes in November are so great.\nOn Election Day, the politicians stand trial before the people.\nThe voters are the jury. Their ballots are the verdict. We don't need or want another Clinton or Obama.\nCome November, the American people will have a chance to issue a verdict on the politicians that have sacrificed their security, betrayed their prosperity, and sold out their country.\nThey will have a chance to vote for a new agenda with big dreams, bold ideas and enormous possibilities for the American people.\nHillary Clinton's message is old and tired. Her message is that can't change.\nMy message is that things have to change – and this is our one chance do it. This is our last chance to do it.\nAmericans are the people that tamed the West, that dug out the Panama Canal, that sent satellites across the solar system that built the great dams, and so much more.\nThen we started thinking small.\nWe stopped believing in what America could do, and became reliant on other countries, other people, and other institutions.\nWe lost our sense of purpose, and daring.\nBut that's not who we are.\nCome this November, we can bring America back – bigger and better, and stronger than ever.\nWe will build the greatest infrastructure on the planet earth – the roads and railways and airports of tomorrow.\nOur military will have the best technology and finest equipment – we will bring it back all the way.\nMassive new factories will come roaring into our country – breathing life and hope into our communities.\nInner cities, which have been horribly abused by Hillary Clinton and the Democrat Party, will finally be rebuilt.\nConstruction is what I know -- nobody knows it better.\nThe real wages for our workers have not been raised for 18 years -- but these wages will start going up, along with the new jobs. Hillary's massive taxation, regulation and open borders will destroy jobs and drive down wages for everyone.\nWe are also going to be supporting our police and law enforcement -- we can never forget the great job they do.\nI am also going to appoint great Supreme Court Justices.\nOur country is going to start working again.\nPeople are going to start working again.\nParents are going to start dreaming big for their children again – including parents in our inner cities.\nAmericans are going to start believing in the future or our country.\nWe are going to make America rich again.\nWe are going to make America safe again.\nWe are going to make America Great Again – and Great Again For EVERYONE.", "timestamp": "2016-06-22", "title": "Remarks at Trump SoHo in New York City"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122641", "text": "On Friday, President Obama will speak at the 7th annual Global Entrepreneurship Summit (GES), bringing together over 700 entrepreneurs from every corner of the globe—and from all across America. Entrepreneurship is a fundamental American value, and it is also a force that has the ability to unlock opportunity for people globally. GES is a reflection of the U.S. Government's commitment to utilizing entrepreneurship as a foundational tool to build more economically prosperous, secure, and globally connected communities around the world.\nWith the eyes of the world on Silicon Valley, today the Obama Administration is announcing new commitments to advance inclusive entrepreneurship and innovation here at home. These announcements build on a week where the Administration has highlighted a powerful record of progress in  fueling American innovation over the last seven and a half years and announcing new steps to build on those efforts—including supporting  advanced manufacturing and  making, publishing a  new rule to enable non-recreational use of unmanned aircraft, and supporting next-generation technologies.\nToday's announcements include:\n•      Major expansion of the Small Business Administration's Startup in a Day initiative to nearly 100 U.S. cities and communities. This effort helps streamline licensing, permitting, and other requirements needed to start a business in their community, with the goal of enabling entrepreneurs to apply for everything necessary to begin within 24 hours.\n•      Three Federal agencies will adopt new expansions of the National Science Foundation's Innovation Corps (I-Corps) entrepreneurship-training program. Over 800 teams have completed the curriculum, from 192 universities in 44 states, resulting in the creation of over 320 companies.\n•      Over 30 companies are joining a new, industry-led Tech Inclusion Pledge. As part of the pledge, companies are committing to take concrete action to make the technology workforce at each of their companies more representative of the American people.\nBackground\nAmerica's spirit of innovation is a major reason why the U.S. economy is the strongest and most durable in the world, and it has inspired admiration from across the globe for generations. Since the beginning of his Administration, President Obama has worked to strengthen our innovation advantage—through investments and reforms to drive  technological and scientific breakthroughs that will power our economy and further enhance America's leadership in the industries of the future.\nToday's announcements build on the first-ever  White House Demo Day, held in August 2015, which focused on inclusive entrepreneurship and welcomed startup founders from diverse walks of life to demonstrate their innovations at the White House. Also, in response to the  Administration's efforts to inspire a diverse generation of innovators, the #SeeHer initiative to improve equal representation of women and girls in media was announced at last week's  White House United State of Women Summit.\nWhile America's entrepreneurial economy is the envy of the world, there is still much work to do to ensure that the United States is tapping the full entrepreneurial potential of Americans, so that individuals from all walks of life have a straight shot at success.\nFor example, just three percent of America's venture capital-backed startups are led by women, and only around one percent are led by African-Americans. Female entrepreneurs start companies with 50 percent less capital than male entrepreneurs, and only about four percent of U.S.-based venture capital investors are women. Capital for innovative startups is predominantly available in only a handful of large cities, making high-growth business creation a challenge in other locations.\nA new independent report released today by Intel Corporation and Dalberg Global Development Advisors quantifies the economic impact of improving diversity in the tech sector, estimating that an additional $470 to $570 billion in new value for the U.S. technology industry could be generated through full representation of ethic and gender diversity.\nDetails on the 2016 Global Entrepreneurship Summit\nFollowing his historic 2009 Cairo speech, President Obama elevated innovation and entrepreneurship in the U.S. global engagement agenda and hosted the first GES at the White House in 2010. Over the past 6 years, the United States has been a leader in catalyzing entrepreneurship globally by developing innovative ecosystems; advocating for stronger business climates through rule of law and transparent business conduct; promoting entrepreneurship for all, including women, youth, and marginalized communities; and mobilizing the private sector to expand impact.\nGES 2016 brings together entrepreneurs and investors from across the world for dynamic, outcome-oriented sessions; mentoring; and opportunities to showcase their work. GES has become a preeminent annual gathering that provides emerging entrepreneurs with exceptional networking, insight, and investment opportunities. This year's GES, held in the heart of Silicon Valley, also includes diverse entrepreneurs from every corner of America.\nNew Steps Being Announced by the Administration Today\nToday, the White House is announcing steps by the Administration to advance inclusive entrepreneurship and to make the innovation economy more accessible to all Americans. These actions build on prior efforts to expand the technology-talent pipeline, cut red tape, and accelerate research discoveries from the lab to the marketplace. New actions include:\n•      The Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service is announcing that later this year, it will provide up to $10 million in Conservation Innovation Grants to stimulate the development and adoption of innovative approaches and technologies for conservation on agricultural lands. The funding announcement will request proposals, including projects by innovative entrepreneurs, focusing on data analytics for conservation, precision conservation, and pay-for-success models to stimulate conservation adoption.\n•      The Department of Energy (DOE) is announcing nearly $16 million in funding to help DOE's National Laboratories and the private sector move promising energy technologies to the marketplace. This first Department-wide round of Technology Commercialization Fund selections will support 12 national labs partnering with 52 private-sector partners, including startups all across the country, from Alaska to Florida.\n•      The Innovation Corps (I-Corps) program, first launched in 2011 by the National Science Foundation (NSF), provides entrepreneurship training for teams of scientists and engineers, through an intensive curriculum focused on discovering a truly demand-driven path from their lab work to a marketable product.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "The President spoke at 11:34 a.m. in the South Court Auditorium of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Executive Office Building. In his remarks, he referred to Franklin Township, NJ, resident Lisa Huguenin; and Sen. Barbara Boxer, in her capacity as ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. H.R. 2576, approved June 22, was assigned Public Law No. 114-182.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117871", "text": "Thank you. Everybody, please have a seat. To begin with, let me thank Lisa for the wonderful introduction. And her wonderful family is here. And I just want you to know that advocates like you, who fight every day to make this country a little bit better, are why we're here today. And we're very proud of you.\nBack in the 1960s and seventies, Americans were becoming increasingly concerned with the fact that our natural resources and our communities and our health were threatened by pollution and toxins. And science backed it up. So, over the course of that decade, Republicans and Democrats in Congress came together again and again to produce landmark environmental victories: the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, the creation of the EPA. All of them have benefited this country greatly. And to be fair, all of them happened under the initiative and under the watch of a Republican President, Richard Nixon.\nIt made an enormous difference in people's lives. These days, my staff are too young to remember. [Laughter] I am not. [Laughter] I remember the first day I arrived in Los Angeles for college, and I had the bright idea of going for a jog. And after about 10 minutes, I was feeling this weird thing in my chest, and I was, like, am I asthmatic now, or what's the problem? And it turned out, it was on an alert day where you weren't supposed to be outside. So even in the late seventies, early eighties, for a lot of folks, it was just hard to breathe.\nIn Chicago, the river was polluted to the extent that people couldn't go in it. And this was true all around the country. And there was a transformation initiated by both parties that actually provided an outdoors that was safer and cleaner and better than what had existed a generation before. These regulations made a difference.\nNow, another law, the Toxic Substance Control Act, was signed by President Ford, and it was a part of this broader environmental effort. Congress passed the law to protect Americans from harmful chemicals in the products that we buy: cleaning agents, fabrics, plastics, paint thinners. The idea was to make sure that the chemicals we use every day were safe and wouldn't lead to cancer or birth defects or reproductive problems.\nBut even with the best of intentions, the law didn't quite work the way it should have in practice. In 1976, some 62,000 chemicals were already on the market. But the law placed demands on the EPA that were so tough, so onerous, that it became virtually impossible to actually see if those chemicals were harming anybody.\nIn fact, out of those original 62,000 chemicals, only 5 have been banned. Five. And only a tiny percentage have even been reviewed for health and safety. The system was so complex, it was so burdensome, that our country hasn't even been able to uphold a ban on asbestos, a known carcinogen that kills as many as 10,000 Americans every year. And I think a lot of Americans would be shocked by all that.\nThere have been court cases. There has been litigation. But from a regulatory perspective, this was tough. And I think most Americans would expect that we could come together to fix this law and do a better job protecting the American people. Well, here's the good news. That's exactly why we're here today. For the first time in 20 years, we are updating a national environmental statute. For the first time in our history, we'll actually be able to regulate chemicals effectively. And we're doing it in the same, overwhelmingly bipartisan fashion as happened with those pillars of legislation to protect our air and our water and our wildlife, the initiatives where Democrats and Republicans first came together to pass laws more than four decades ago. And that doesn't happen very often these days. So this is a really significant piece of business.\nThe Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety Act for the 21st Century will make it easier for the EPA to review chemicals already on the market, as well as the new chemicals our scientists and our businesses design. It will do away with an outdated bureaucratic formula to evaluate safety and instead focus solely on the risks to our health. And it will finally grant our scientists and our public servants at the EPA the funding they need to get the job done and keep us safe.\nSo this is a big deal. This is a good law. It is an important law. Here in America, folks should have the confidence to know that the laundry detergent we buy isn't going to make us sick, the mattresses our babies sleep on aren't going to harm them. And just like in the 1970s, when we decided to do something about smog that was choking our cities and our auto industry was able to innovate to make our cars cleaner; just like in the 1990s, when we had the problems with acid rain and our businesses figured out a way to do something about it and still keep growing and thriving—I'm absolutely confident that we can regulate toxic chemicals in a way that's both good for our families and ultimately good for business and our economy. Because nobody can innovate better than folks here in this country and our businesses.\nIn fact, we've got a lot of industry leaders here today who have pushed hard for this law, and I want to give them credit—from the American Chemical Council to S.C. Johnson—because they know that it gives them the certainty they need to keep outinnovating and outcompeting companies from other parts of the world. And the public health and environmental leaders who are [here; White House correction.] today, from March of Dimes to the Environmental Defense Fund, know that this law will help protect Americans, especially those who are particularly vulnerable to chemicals, and that includes children and pregnant women and the elderly and poorer communities.\nI have to say, this has been years in the making. You don't get all these people in the same room without a few late nights on Capitol Hill. [Laughter] I know there were times when folks questioned whether or not all the parties involved would be able to reach this agreement. I've been told that this process gave a lot of folks who worked on this law much greater appreciation for the zebrafish. [Laughter] But that's what public service is about: pushing through disagreements, forging compromise, especially when it's hard, and especially when it's about something as important as the health and safety of our kids and our families.\nI want to especially to thank Bonnie Lautenberg, who's here. Bonnie carried the torch on this issue, cementing her late husband's legacy as one of our Nation's finest environmental champions. I had the great privilege of knowing Frank. I served with him. This bill was being worked on when I was on Frank's committee and Barbara's committee—in the environmental and energy committee—10 years ago. And it—and Frank was passionate about this. And those of you who knew Frank, he was passionate about a lot of things, especially Bonnie. [Laughter] But this bill may have come in a close second. And he was just a wonderful man. He was a great friend to me. For him to be able to see this legacy completed must be greatly satisfying. He's looking down on us and feeling pretty good right now. And Bonnie, who kept on pushing on this, I think, deserves enormous credit as well.\nI also want to thank EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy and her whole team. They put a lot of technical work into making sure that this thing was going to be effective. It's now their task to implement it. We are very proud of them.\nThere are too many Members of Congress to name individually, but I just want to thank—everybody on this stage worked very, very hard to make this happen. There were countless staffers who pushed this across the finish line. And I want the American people to know that this is proof that even in the current polarized political climate here in Washington, things can work. It's possible. We can keep families safe and unleash the engine of American innovation. We can protect the planet and keep creating jobs. If we can get this bill done, it means that somewhere out there on the horizon, we can make our politics less toxic as well. [Laughter]\nSo this is a good day. And with that, I think it's time to sign the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act into law. Let's do it.\n[At this point, the President signed the bill.]", "timestamp": "2016-06-22", "title": "Remarks on Signing the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act"}

SCHULTZ: Welcome aboard Air Force One, everybody, en route to Silicon Valley, where the President will lead the U.S. delegation to the 7th Annual Global Entrepreneurship Summit. This summit was born out of the President's 2009 Cairo speech and has become an annual event in connecting entrepreneurs, investors, and ecosystem supporters from across the world.\nGES is a reflection of our commitment to build more prosperous, secure, and globally connected communities around the world. As you know, good ideas come from everywhere. However, access to capital and opportunity is not the same everywhere. That's why our goal at this year's summit is to connect the United States with new audiences and partners worldwide, especially focused on women, youth and minorities to fulfill their potential.\nPresident Obama will join approximately 1,200 attendees, including entrepreneurs, investors, ecosystem supporters, educators, business representatives, and government officials, all of whom represent the full measure of entrepreneurial talent from diverse backgrounds across our nation and around the world.\nThe spirit of innovation is what makes America exceptional, and its results continue to drive American leadership around the world. The President looks forward to his time with entrepreneurs and will continue his innovation efforts at home and abroad for the remainder of his term.\nI'm happy to take questions on that or any topic that may be on your mind.\nQ: Eric, could you talk a little bit about the court decision today? Another executive action falling by the wayside. The President talked ad nauseam about taking action when Congress wouldn't act. Does he have any regrets about that strategy?\nMR. SCHULTZ: No, Kevin. As you heard the President speak a few hours ago at the White House, he is disappointed that the Court couldn't issue a decision today. But as you point out, this dates back to comprehensive immigration reform. That was a bill that Democrats and Republicans in the United States Senate came together to work out. It was not a bill that Democrats jammed down Republicans' throats. It wasn't a bill that the President dictated.\nIn fact, he was quite clear at the time that if he was writing the piece of legislation, it would look different. But it represented a compromise. It represented Republicans and Democrats working together on one of the pressing issues of our time. And that passed by almost 70 votes in the United States Senate. And unfortunately, when it went to the House of Representatives, they didn't reject the bill, they didn't vote it down. They actually didn't even have the courage to bring it up for a vote. House Republicans completely abdicated their responsibility by not allowing a vote on this piece of legislation.\nSo many at the time speculated -- and I think with a lot of justification -- that the reason it didn't come up for a vote is it would have passed. So as you point out, the President at the time, and today -- at the time since, and even today, said the best way to deal with this problem is for Congress to pass comprehensive immigration. He was also very clear that that's very unlikely in this Congress, and that's why he made clear that there's going to have to be a debate in this country in order for that to get done.\nQ: Obviously the ruling today only applied to the parents of DREAMers or U.S. citizens. It does not apply to the President's executive action on DACA. What is your message to those children who were brought here illegally? Should they feel confident that the status that they've been given by the administration will hold up to any legal challenges that could go through the same system that this one did?\nMR. SCHULTZ: You are right, Justin -- the DACA program that the President announced in 2012 was not an issue in this case, so that wasn't subject to any judicial review. As the President pointed out, over 730,000 participants have gone through that program. That program will continue to be implemented. And recipients and the participants of that program are our teachers, they're our neighbors, they're our police officers, they're our small business owners. So they continue to be contributing members to society.\nThe other piece of the President's record on this that was not subject -- that was not a part of this case was the Department of Homeland Security enforcement priorities announced by the President in 2014. Again, those priorities remain unchanged and unaffected by this case. And to remind you, those priorities are criminals, recent border-crossers, and threats to national security. So the Homeland Security priorities that were announced also remain unchanged, and I think that's important.\nQ: Eric, the President has, as you point out, for a long time laid the failure to pass comprehensive immigration reform at the Congress's feet, at the Republicans' feet. But the fact remains that while he has been in office, there have been a large number of deportations and very little to show for his efforts to get a legislative -- nothing to show for his efforts to get a legislative solution through Congress. And now because of the Court's action today, not as much to show for his efforts to address this with executive power as he would have liked. Is he frustrated about that? He is going to be remembered by a lot of these groups that count immigration among their top priorities as not a very successful President on addressing the plight of the 11 million who are here. So what does he have to say to those people?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, Julie, I quibble with some parts of your question, namely that there wasn't much to show for the legislative effort. If you recall, there was a lot of independent reporting and analysis that getting the United States Senate to pass comprehensive immigration reform in a bipartisan way was a far-fetched prediction. It turns out Republicans and Democrats were able to roll up their sleeves and work together on one of the most challenging and complex issues of our time.\nSo I do think that that was an important milestone to show that comprehensive immigration reform isn't just common sense, it isn't just the right thing to do consistent with American values, it's not just widely supported by wide swaths of the American people, but it's also legislatively doable. Unfortunately, House Republicans, for reasons still unclear, refuse to call that bill up for even a vote.\nSo you're right, legislatively there still remains a lot of work to do. That's why the President was clear that the best way to fix to address this problem is going to be through comprehensive immigration reform. The President was also clear that that's unlikely to happen in this Congress, and that's why he expects a debate amongst the American people on the best pathway forward.\nThe other, I think, answer to your question is, there does remain additional work that the President has done on this issue that remains in place, and that, as Justin referenced, includes the DACA program announced in the summer of 2012. At the time, the President announced that our lowest priorities for enforcement were these diligent, patriotic young DREAMers who grew up pledging allegiance to the flag, and that they should be able to apply to work, study and pay their taxes here. Since then, more than 730,000 people have come out of the shadows and their lives have been changed as a result. Fortunately, today's decision doesn't affect those people.\nI'd also say, it's one of the reason why comprehensive immigration reform has such wide support. You've got support from the evangelical community. You've got support from business leaders, from law enforcement, obviously from the Hispanic community, from unions. So you see wide and diverse constituency groups supporting this, and yet you see Republicans on the Hill throwing up their hands and doing nothing about it.\nQ: In the meantime, some of these groups called today after the ruling for a flat halt on deportations. Not one more person to be deported until something can be done about the broader issue. Is that anything the President would consider?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I haven't heard that discussed. Again, the deportation priorities that the Department of Homeland Security announced back in 2014 remain in place. And those priorities are recent border-crossers, threats to national security, and criminals.\nQ: There's been some criticism from congressional Republicans about this latest detainee that was transferred out of Guantanamo. Are we more likely to -- first off, what's the justification for his release? And as the population dwindles, are we more likely to see some of these controversial figures and some of these more hardened terrorists, like this guy who evidently was a bodyguard for bin Laden -- are we more likely to see people like that transferred to other countries?\nMR. SCHULTZ: John, I haven't seen the criticism, so I don't know if there are specific points you'd like me to respond to. I can say generally speaking that Abdel Malik Rahabi was approved for transfer by the Periodic Review Board, a discretionary, administrative, interagency body that determined by consensus that his continued detention was no longer necessary to protect a significant continuing threat to the security of the United States.\nThe United States is very grateful to the government of Montenegro for its continued assistance in closing the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. Montenegro now joins other friends and allies in Europe in accepting multiple detainees for -- by bringing us closer to our shared goal of closing the facility. I'll also say that we only make these decisions when our national security officials are sure that the protections are in place to make sure that a former detainee doesn't pose a threat to the United States.\nI'll also say that this is consistent with the President's goal of closing down the facility at Guantanamo Bay. We've spent a lot of time talking about why the President believes that's a worthy goal. Namely, it's exorbitantly expensive. We can accomplish the same things. We can protect our security in a much more cost-effective way. This is a facility that's a known propaganda tool for terrorists who want to do us harm. It's also inconsistent with our values. As you all know, that is a goal that the President has, but it's also a goal shared by Republicans. President George W. Bush believes that facility should be closed. Senator John McCain believes that facility should be closed. And there's a wide number of national security experts, both affiliated with the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, who believe that facility should be closed.\nQ: Can I ask you on Zika?\nMR. SCHULTZ: You can.\nQ: We saw Josh's statement last night about the conference report, conference agreement. I'm wondering if you can explain a little bit about why -- I mean, $1.1 billion sounds like quite a bit. Why isn't that enough? And secondly, is the President prepared to veto it? Are his advisors going to recommend that he veto that bill?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Roberta, as you referenced the statement last night, we are disappointed that Republicans turned this into a political exercise. This is a conference report that doesn't look like it can even pass the United States Senate. But if it did, and the President was presented with the bill, he would veto it. And let me explain why.\nFirst of all, it's woefully inadequate. Our public health professionals estimate that the federal government needs $1.9 billion of funding to attack this emergency. This bill falls far short of that.\nThis is a bill that would also steal money from other critically important public health priorities, including those funded by the Affordable Care Act and those funded by our effort to combat Ebola. So at the end of the day, this bill does not provide adequate funding.\nThird, this bill unfortunately includes an ideological rider blocking access to contraception for women in the U.S., including those in Puerto Rico, even though Zika is a sexually transmitted disease and even though it has been transmitted in Puerto Rico. It makes no sense.\nI'd also draw your attention to provision in this bill that guts some provisions of the Clean Water Act. So for those reasons, the President would veto this bill if it ever got to his desk. Again I haven't seen much analysis that suggests it could even pass the United States Senate. And for that reason, we urge Republicans to stop turning this into a political football, to actually get to work, and come up with a proposal that's going to serve the American people.\nQ: But, I mean, it's a public health emergency. Isn't it better than nothing to have that money?\nMR. SCHULTZ: You're right, it is a public health emergency, and that's all the more reason why it's unfortunate that Republicans want to turn this into a partisan exercise. This isn't something that -- well, let me rephrase. In the past, when we've had public health emergencies like Ebola or like the H1N1 virus, Democrats and Republicans come together to make sure the federal government has the resources they need. One party doesn't just huddle in the corner, come up with an ideological bill, and then throw up their hands and leave. It's time for Republicans to join Democrats in coming up with a viable solution to make sure the government has the resources they need to combat this.\nAnd let me give you some examples. Money is desperately needed to fight Zika because mosquito control, a central element of efforts to combat the virus, is spotty and underfunded. Let's look at Florida, specifically. The battle to squash the virus began many months ago, but some two dozen local governments in Florida are collectively seeking millions of dollars to stop that threat. Florida needs to hire more inspectors, buy more insecticide, lay more mosquito traps, and conduct a more effective campaign to enlist the public's help in eradicating mosquito-breeding areas. Nothing the House has done so far furthers any of those goals.\nQ: Be that as it may, though, isn't the White House, or isn't the President worried that by potentially blocking or turning down this legislation, that it will look like it's your fault, it's the White House's fault for not getting people the money that they need for mosquito programs or what have you?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Roberta, this is a plan that doesn't adequately fund the crisis, that actually blocks contraception for women in the United States and in Puerto Rico, even though this exact virus is a sexually transmitted disease. And it also steals money away from critically important public health priorities. We have public health experts on the ground right now in West Africa, making sure that the precautions and safeguards are in place to prevent another Ebola outbreak.\nI don't know why Republicans think it's a good idea to take those people off duty, underfund that effort in order to rob Peter to pay Paul.\nQ: He's talked in the past about Freddie Gray, and I know Officer Caesar Goodson today was found not guilty on all accounts in that case. I'm just curious about the President's reaction and if the White House has any reaction to that decision today.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Darren, I don't have a reaction from the President to read out to you, namely because there are ongoing federal investigations in the Baltimore Police Department and into the death of Freddie Gray, so it's going to be difficult for us to comment on today's decision by the Court. But generally speaking, I would say our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the loved ones of Freddie Gray. As you may remember, the President discussed this issue at length last April. And so for more on how the President views this, I would draw your attention to that.\nQ: Eric, can I ask about the incident in the theater in Germany, if you have any details on what exactly transpired there? Whether the President has been in touch with Chancellor Merkel, or top U.S. officials have. If there's any nexus with ISIS, of course. And if the U.S. has taken any counterterrorism steps after that incident.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Justin, obviously we're aware of the situation you mentioned. I can tell you that United States officials were in touch with their German counterparts. Usually that's communication that's handled through our National Security Council and through the State Department. The President was briefed on this earlier today, but I don't have any steps to announce in response to it.\nQ: Do you have any indication if there was a relation to terrorism?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I think we're going to defer to the German authorities. If they have any results of their preliminary investigation, I'm sure they'll share it.\nQ: Eric, how is the President -- or is he staying abreast of the Brexit vote? Has he talked to Cameron? Has he talked to anyone in the UK today about what's going on there?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Julie, I don't have any calls from the President to read out to you. I would expect that we'd have a reaction once there's results. But until then, I think our position has been clear, which is ultimately this is a decision for the British people to make. But the President believes that a strong United Kingdom voice in a strong EU has great benefits to the United States and to the international community. As you know, we had a chance to make that case in a trip to London earlier this year. Some of you were able to join us on that. He laid out a handful of reasons why he thinks that.\nFirst, the United Kingdom historically has outsized influence on the economic and security issues around the world. We want to make sure that influence continues. We believe that the UK can exercise that influence and leverage its relationships more effectively if it remains in the European Union.\nSecondly, on the economic front, we believe that jobs, investment, trade, that the UK is better off if it stays within the EU.\nAnd then third, on a host of issues facing Europe -- ranging from migration to the economy to terrorism -- the EU is more capable of facing down those issues with a strong United Kingdom included.\nSo I don't have any real-time updates for you on the White House reaction to the vote as it undergoes -- or as it happens.\nQ: He's not getting briefed on any --\nMR. SCHULTZ: I think he'll be briefed as soon as there's something to brief him on.\nQ: Eric, kind of related to politics. I know the tragedy in Orlando postponed him actually campaigning with Hillary Clinton. Is there any update on when that might sort of come back into something that the White House is going to do?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Darren, as you mentioned, there was a trip to Green Bay, Wisconsin for President Obama and Hillary Clinton. That did get postponed in the wake of the terrorist attack in Orlando. We don't have a new date yet on the books, but I do know the President, which he has said, is looking forward to campaigning. As soon as an event for the both of them is scheduled, we'll make sure to let you know.\nQ: Can I follow up on that? Would they try to go back to Green Bay? Or are they looking at something completely different? Whatever Hillary Clinton is coming up next in her schedule fit in that way?\nMR. SCHULTZ: As soon as we have another event at which the President plans to campaign with Secretary Clinton, we'll let you know. I'm not sure if we've locked in a location yet.\nQ: Eric, just staying with the campaign fundraising theme, can I ask about the Seattle trip real quick? He's campaigning for the DCCC and for the governors' race. Does the President believe that Democrats -- he can help them make a lot of inroads with the House and with the, I guess, the minority among the governorships across the country?\nMR. SCHULTZ: The President is not only President of the United States, but in that role he's also the head of the Democratic Party, and he does take his responsibilities seriously to make sure that campaigns have the resources they need to wage effective campaigns. And so you've seen him fundraise aggressively for the congressional campaign committees. We obviously have a DCCC event later on this trip and an event for Governor Inslee.\nSo, yeah, I do think you'll see the President out there both making sure that campaigns and committees have the resources they need to wage effective campaigns, but also making the public case for why he believes Democrats would be the best stewards of --\nQ: Does he think Democrats can take the House this election?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, he absolutely believes that the elections are going to be an important moment -- an historic election, actually -- and that the opportunity that Democrats have to make inroads in the House and in the Senate are opportunities that are going to be important. And he's going to make sure -- he's going to work to make sure that he does his part.\nQ: Did the President speak with John Lewis after the sit-in?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Roberta, I don't have any calls like that to read out to you. I can tell you that everyone at the White House was and is very supportive of Congressman Lewis's actions that he took yesterday. And that includes the President being supportive. I think you saw the President tweeted out a message of support, and that's just the latest gesture in support of Congress taking action and demanding action. I think what you saw in the House over the past 24 hours is embarrassing for House Republican leadership. They won't even call for a vote. These are common-sense reforms supported by bipartisan majorities around the country, supported by law enforcement. My colleague Josh Earnest called the Senate vote \"a shameful display of cowardice.\" I don't even know what to call the House Republican leadership because they won't even have the courage to call for a vote.\nIf the Speaker of the House believes that those who are too dangerous, as determined by our Homeland Security officials, to board a plane, but that that same individual ought to be able to purchase a firearm, then the Speaker of the House should have the courage to call the yays and nays and call for a vote.\nIf the Speaker of the House believes that we shouldn't have universal background checks, a position -- by the way, universal background checks enjoys 85 percent support in the state of Wisconsin. If the Speaker of the House doesn't believe that's worth a vote, isn't worth passing, then call the bluff and call a vote. Have it be voted down. But instead, they decided to shill for Wall Street banks.\nQ: Republicans, though, said that they called the sit-in a stunt and criticized Democrats for fundraising off of it. I'm just wondering what the White House thinks. Is it appropriate for members to be fundraising off of what essentially was a protest?\nMR. SCHULTZ: If Republicans think it's a stunt, they should call our bluff. Call the yays and nays. Make everyone vote. The sit-in will end. But instead, they don't even have the courage to call for a vote. They don't even want their members to be on the record opposing these common-sense gun safety reforms.\nAgain, nothing that's being proposed is particularly controversial or counter-intuitive. But if our Homeland Security officials decide that you're too dangerous to board a plane, then it only follows that you're probably not the right person to purchase a firearm. And if the Speaker of the House wants to go to bat for someone suspected of terrorist ties to be able to purchase a firearm, then he should go ahead and take back the floor of the House, and make a speech and then call the votes.\nQ: So it's okay to fundraise off it? No problem with that?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Again, one way for -- if Republicans were really upset about this, they could end it by allowing these common-sense measures supported by a bipartisan number of Americans -- I'm sorry a vast majority of Americans from both political parties call it for a vote.\nQ: Did you guys send over pizza or coffee or anything? (Laughter.)\nMR. SCHULTZ: I don't believe so. But I can tell you that everybody in the White House, including the President, believes what Congressman Lewis has led was an important thing to do, and underscored the dereliction of responsibility by the House leadership.\nQ: Do you expect the President to fundraise off of this debate at all?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I haven't heard any plans to do that.\nQ: Some opponents of this have said that it's kind of an unprecedented breakdown of order up on Capitol Hill. The President has spoken a lot recently about the need to un-coarsen our discourse and to sort of return to a normal dialogue where people can come together. Is there any worry that this sets a precedent of kind of more dysfunction on Capitol Hill?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, if you want to talk about dysfunction on Capitol Hill, I don't think there's any new precedent needed. We have an unquestionably qualified Supreme Court nominee languishing in the United States Senate for 99 days because Senate Republicans have failed to do their job.\nIt's not just the President or Democrats who believe that this nominee is qualified to be on the Supreme Court. It's Republicans who believe that this nominee is qualified to be on the Supreme Court. It's Bush administration officials, like the Bush administration attorney general, Alberto Gonzalez, who believes that Merrick Garland should be confirmed for the United States Supreme Court. It's legal scholars from across the political spectrum who believe Merrick Garland should be confirmed for the United States Supreme Court. It is United States Senator Orrin Hatch who called Merrick Garland a consensus nominee.\nSo if Republicans for the first time in American history want to abdicate their responsibility in the United States Senate to do their job, I'm not sure there's much new precedent that can be set for congressional dysfunction.\nQ: Can I just follow up on that? The President seemed to suggest in his comments today after the immigration ruling that, had Republicans in Congress been willing to take a vote on Merrick Garland's nomination, then the outcome here would have been different, and I have to assume he meant that his executive actions would have stood. How does he know that? Has he talked with Judge Garland about how he would have ruled in this case?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, I think what the President was talking about was, if the Court was fully staffed, it wouldn't have been a 4-4 indecision. So we would have had a fully staffed Court. I can also tell you the President has actually been very clear that when he meets with potential Supreme Court nominees, he actually doesn't bring up pending cases or likely cases that would be heard before the Supreme Court. So I think we actually know that he has not spoken with Chief Judge Garland about this issue.\nBut what I do think the President was talking about is a sentiment that he actually put forward before he selected Chief Judge Garland for this spot, which is the Court should be fully staffed. Never in its history has the Court gone -- never in its history will the Court have gone as long as it's going to go because of Republican intransience.\nAnd again, this isn't a sentiment just expressed by the President or by Democrats. Republicans feel this way too. President Reagan said with each passing day that when the Court isn't fully staffed, it impairs its ability to do its job. We have no more starker example of that than today's non-decision.\nQ: But isn't the sort of implication here that he said this election matters and is sort of an evaluation of where we are as a country? Isn't it implicit in that that if you vote for Hillary Clinton, you're going to get a judge to kind of affirm my executive orders on immigration? Or would you not make that link that voting for Democrats this fall equals immigration protection for more undocumented immigrants?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I would not make that link. I actually think that the President was making a broader argument, which is if you go back to comprehensive immigration reform, which failed in the United States House of Representatives because the leadership wouldn't bring it up for a vote, that was a sign of dysfunction. That was House Republican leadership being too scared to bring up a bill for a vote because they knew it would pass. That dysfunction has now metastasized to the United States Senate, where they won't even hold a hearing for a Supreme Court nominee who everybody agrees is eminently qualified. He actually brings more experience to this nomination than any Supreme Court nominee in the history of the country.\nQ: So just to be -- just so I'm crystal clear, the President was not suggesting that had Merrick Garland been on the Supreme Court, that the decision would have gone in the President's favor?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Correct. The President has been clear previously that he doesn't discuss pending cases before the United States Supreme Court, or even likely cases with potential nominees. That comes from an interview with National Public Radio, in case you want to reference those quotes directly.\nBut what I think the President was saying is this dysfunction we've seen in the legislative branch in now infecting the judiciary, and that Senate Republicans refusing to do their job and refusing to allow the Court to be fully staffed impairs the ability of that Court to do its job. And that's not just my argument; President Reagan made that as well.\nQ: There's been reports that Volkswagen has reached a settlement of more than $10 million for the scandal surrounding diesel cars. I'm wondering if the President, if the White House has a reaction to that, and your guys' involvement in sort of negotiating that settlement.\nMR. SCHULTZ: I don't have a reaction to you for that. Obviously, I'd refer you to the parties involved.\nQ: Did Congressman Fattah do any favors for Democrats by resigning effective immediately rather than serving until -- he said he was going to go until October 3rd. And then it seemed like Republicans were threatening to exploit him.\nMR. SCHULTZ: John, I saw some news reports on the Congressman's decision before we took off this morning. But I don't have any additional reaction to you from the President.\nQ: Week ahead?\nQ: That's tomorrow.\nMR. SCHULTZ: That's tomorrow.\nQ: Are there any lawmakers on board?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Yes, I'll get you a list.\nQ: And any tech luminaries or CEOs?\nMR. SCHULTZ: No.\nQ: Can I ask one quick question? To follow up on Josh yesterday, he said that the President is discussing being an NBA minority owner in his post-presidency. How seriously is he considering that? And is he at all advancing in those discussions?\nMR. SCHULTZ: John, for more details on that, I would refer you to the President's conversation with Bill Simmons, where this came up. That's what Josh was referring to yesterday. I think the President is very focused on his remaining days in office. We have about six or seven months left. He's made clear to us that he's not going to take his foot off the gas. So I am sure in the back of his mind he's thinking about the post-presidency, but I know in the front of his mind are a lot of priorities left to fulfill.\nThank you, guys.\nEND 4:07 P.M.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118136", "text": "Columbus, OH is the winner out of 78 cities that accepted the challenge, will receive up to $40 million from the Department of Transportation to prototype the future of transportation s as part of the Obama Administration's efforts to accelerate game-changing technologies from self-driving cars to smart traffic lights to vehicle to vehicle communications.\nThroughout this week, the Obama Administration will be highlighting America's capacity for creativity and invention and how our innovative progress over the last seven and a half years has helped continue to make our economy the strongest and most durable in the world. As part of this effort, today, the Administration is announcing that Columbus, OH is the winner of the Smart City Challenge.\nIn December 2015, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx issued an unprecedented challenge to U.S. cities. He called for cities to come up with a plan to reshape their transportation systems as part of a fully-integrated city that harnesses the power and potential of technology, data and creativity to reimagine how people and goods move. Through the Smart City Challenge, the Department committed up to $40 million, and private partners committed over $20 million to help make this Smart City vision a reality. Today, at an event in Columbus with Mayor Andrew Ginther and local community leaders, Secretary Foxx announced that Columbus, OH has been selected as the winner of the Smart City Challenge.\nRevolutionary new transportation technologies and the smart use of data have the potential to save lives; give us back hours lost in traffic; reduce harmful carbon emissions; and provide greater dignity, mobility, and access to opportunity for millions of our fellow Americans. The Obama Administration is committed to accelerating these technologies and will be taking action this summer to facilitate the safe, efficient, commercial deployment of self-driving cars and vehicle to vehicle communication. In addition, the  White House Smart Cities Initiative is investing over $160 million to grow the pipeline of technologies available to help cities solve pressing urban challenges.\nThe Smart City Challenge called on cities to do more than merely introduce new technologies onto city streets. Rather, the Challenge called on mayors to boldly envision new solutions that change the very face of transportation in our cities by closing the gap between rich and poor; capturing the needs of both old and young; and through smart design, bridging the digital divide so that the future of transportation meets the needs of all city residents, not just those who are technology savvy.\n78 cities, including nearly every mid-sized city in America, answered the call by creating blueprints for the future of transportation today on their city streets. The seven finalist cities - Austin, Columbus, Denver, Kansas City, Pittsburgh, Portland, and San Francisco -have proposed first-of-a-kind use of these new technologies to solve the real-world challenges facing cities today, from self-driving shuttles that could cut in half the commute from underserved neighborhoods to centers of jobs and opportunity to the use of smart sensors to accelerate freight delivery while improving safety. Over 150 diverse industry and non-profit partners have pledged more than $500 million in resources, technology solutions, and support to help carry out these Smart City plans.\nAt its core, the Challenge is designed to advance progress in cities across the country - not just a single winning city. Already, the seven finalists have taken great strides in planning for adoption of new technologies and gaining commitments from a broad range of new private sector partners to help execute these visions. The Department and its federal partners are committed to helping all cities that applied to the Smart City Challenge identify resources to carry out their plans. Already, the Department has provided technical assistance to all 78 cities to help them identify and apply for approximately $6 billion in federal funding that cities could use for these innovative transportation projects. Interested cities should go here to learn more about resources available to help implement their Smart City plans.\nTHE WINNER OF THE SMART CITY CHALLENGE\nToday, Columbus, OH has been selected to receive up to $40 million from the Department of Transportation to carry out its Smart City Plan. Paul G. Allen's Vulcan, Inc. will provide an additional $10 million to Columbus, OH. And a range of national industry partners will provide the winning city with technology to help implement its plan, including NXP© Semiconductors, Amazon Web Services, Mobileye, Autodesk, Alphabet's Sidewalk Labs, AT&T, and DC Solar.\nColumbus has a holistic vision for how technology can help all of its residents move better and access opportunity. Working with industry and philanthropic partners, the city has leveraged the Smart City Challenge to raise an additional $100 million in non-Federal resources to carry out its plan.\nIn its Smart City plan, Columbus will leverage a new central connected traffic signal and integrated transportation data system to address specific transportation challenges faced in four districts across the city. To address these challenges, the city will:\n• Use transportation data analytics and improved first-mile-last-mile connections to public transportation - such as street-side mobility kiosks, a new bus-rapid transit system, and smart lighting to increase safety for pedestrians - to improve health care access in a neighborhood that currently has an infant mortality rate four times that of the national average, allowing Columbus to provide improved transportation options to those most in need of prenatal care and enable more Columbus residents to celebrate their first birthdays.\n• Deploy fully electric self-driving shuttles on three fixed routes to connect a new bus rapid transit center to a retail district, connecting more residents to jobs and helping fuel the district's growth.\n• Equip city fleet, transit vehicles, and many intersections with connected vehicle technology to optimize traffic flow and demonstrate safety applications.\n• Test connected vehicle technology in their freight district, including automated truck platooning and traffic signal management. The city will also work with freight operators to communicate parking availability both in the city and in the surrounding multi-state region.\n• Address climate change by expanding their investment in electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, providing assistance to fleet operators to encourage EV adoption, creating customer education programs such as ride-and-drive events with local dealers, and create an EV cooperative buying program.\n• Create an integrated payment system for residents to access transportation solutions throughout the city, regardless of whether they have a credit card or rely on cash, and offer a trip planning smart app to help residents plan their trips across many different modes and public and private operators.\nSEVEN SMART CITIES\nThe seven finalist cities rose to the Smart City Challenge in an extraordinary way, proposing first of a kind technology deployments and imaging novel solutions to the persistent challenges that plague our transportation system today. And the seven finalist cities have dared big - proposing to create new first of a kind corridors for autonomous vehicles to move city residents, to electrify city fleets, and to collectively equip over thirteen thousand buses, taxis, and cars with vehicle to vehicle communication.\nThe Department of Transportation and its federal partners, including the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Energy, and the National Institute for Standards and Technology, have formed the Smart City Challenge Collaborative, a commitment to working with these seven finalist cities to identify potential federal, state, local, and private resources to help carry out their Smart City plans. In addition, Vulcan, Inc. has announced a new commitment to provide additional funding to support the climate and electrification efforts of all seven cities.\nThe following highlights just a few examples of the revolutionary visions the seven Smart City finalists proposed. You can read each finalist city's full application and a summary of technology trends across all 78 cities that applied here.\n• Austin, TX: The fastest growing city in the nation with over 100 new residents a day, Austin faces unique challenges with growing congestion and increasing commutes. To target the challenges facing its commuters, Austin has proposed to remake the traditional \"park-and-ride\" into a \"one-stop shop\" with even more mobility options including public transit buses, trains, car share, bike share, automated vehicles, and connected vehicles, to be strategically situated near community health centers, the community college, housing developments, and the airport.\n• Denver, CO: Situated at the crossroads of three nationally important freight highways, Denver is applying its pioneering spirit to accelerate freight while improving safety. With partners like FedEx, Peloton, and UPS, Denver is equipping trucks with vehicle to vehicle communication technology to optimize routing and traffic signals and to experiment with connected, autonomous truck platooning, accelerating freight while reducing the impact on low-income neighborhoods that bear the brunt of this traffic flow today.\n• Kansas City, MO: Kansas City proposed to revitalize a historically black and underserved community by installing ubiquitous public Wi-Fi along sidewalks and on new electric, connected public buses, including on self-driving shuttles connecting underserved areas with the existing streetcar route. Each bus stop will have large-screen state-of-the-art kiosks to help residents access transportation information and will be equipped with voice-activated wayfinding technology to help the visual impaired navigate the city's streets.\n• Pittsburgh, PA: Pittsburgh is proposing to cut in half the time it takes workers from Hazelwood, a historically underserved community, to reach the city's urban jobs core by partnering with Carnegie Mellon, a pioneer of self-driving technology, to construct a thirty minute loop for autonomous shuttles. Throughout the city, Pittsburgh will also deploy state-of-the-art traffic signal technology - proven to reduce congestion at street lights by up to forty percent - to significantly reduce travel and idle time for all residents.\n• Portland, OR: Portland proposed to launch the nation's first bulk-buy program for used EVs to put affordable EVs in the hands of low-income drivers in demonstration corridors and promote electric car sharing and electric bike sharing in low-income communities. At the same time, Portland is partnering on autonomous vehicle demonstrations from campus shuttles and airport buses to self-driving taxis and tractor trailers. Portland is also developing a smart housing app with real transparency about the true cost of an apartment, including both rent and transportation costs.\n• San Francisco, CA: San Francisco has set a goal of eliminating one out of every ten single occupant car trips by shifting travelers onto carpooling and public transit. To increase uptake of innovative carpooling and ridesharing models, San Francisco envisions a system of new carpooling HOV lanes and reserved curbside pickup areas. In addition, San Francisco has proposed using self-driving cars to shuttle passengers for the first and last mile onto public transit. The city, long a leader in innovation, has also proposed sharing its learnings with a tech transfer network of 50 cities and 25,000 transportation professionals.\nINDUSTRY COMMITMENTS TO THE SMART CITY CHALLENGE\nOver 150 industry and non-profit partners stepped up to the challenge alongside the cities, pledging more than $500 million in resources and technology solutions. In addition to the resources pledged by companies and partners to individual cities, the Department of Transportation has announced private sector partnerships to outfit the winning city with new transportation technology solutions:\nPaul G. Allen's Vulcan Inc.: Vulcan will provide an additional $10 million to the winning city to demonstrate \"what's possible\" by transforming a city's transportation system into one that is electrified and low-carbon, in addition to showcasing new ideas and bold innovations.\nMobileye: Mobileye will equip the every city bus in the winning city with their advanced collision warning and pedestrian detection technology to help bus drivers avoid traffic collisions and protect road users including bicyclists, pedestrians, and motorcyclists.\nAutodesk: Autodesk will provide access to and training on its advanced virtual design and modeling platform that uses 3-D visualizations and real-world data to help the winning city plan the significant engineering and infrastructure projects needed to carry out its plan.\nNXP: NXP will provide the contest's winning city with vehicle-to-vehicle wireless communication modules that allow cars to securely exchange data, such as hazard warnings, over distances of more than a mile to prevent accidents and improve traffic flow.\nAmazon Web Services: Amazon Web Services will provide solution architecture, best practices on managing the tremendous quantities of data produced in a Smart City, and $1 million of credits to use its cloud-based data services to warehouse this data.\nAlphabet's Sidewalk Labs: Sidewalk Labs will partner with the finalist cities on a first-of-a-kind transportation analytics platform using data from billions of miles of trips and citizen interactive input. Sidewalk Labs will install over 100 kiosks equipped with this mobility platform in four neighborhoods, roughly 25 blocks, of the winning city.\nDC Solar: DC Solar Solutions will offer the winning city $1.5 million worth of electric vehicle chargers and mobile solar generators. In addition, DC Solar will assist all seven finalist cities in building strategies for electric vehicle charging infrastructure to encourage and facilitate the adoption of electric vehicles by individuals, businesses and municipalities.", "timestamp": "2016-06-23", "title": "Fact Sheet: Obama Administration Announces Columbus, OH Winner of the $40 Million Smart City Challenge to Pioneer the Future of Transportation"}

We need to guarantee that the doors to higher education are open not just to some, but to all—and that we are giving students equal opportunities to succeed and thrive. Today's Supreme Court decision affirms a basic truth about our country: we are stronger together.\"", "timestamp": "2016-06-23", "title": "Hillary Clinton Statement on Fisher v.

These are our friends and family members; neighbors and classmates; DREAMers and parents of Americans and lawful permanent residents. They enrich our communities and contribute to our economy every day. We should be doing everything possible under the law to provide them relief from the specter of deportation.\n\"Today's decision by the Supreme Court is purely procedural and casts no doubt on the fact that DAPA and DACA are entirely within the President's legal authority. But in addition to throwing millions of families across our country into a state of uncertainty, this decision reminds us how much damage Senate Republicans are doing by refusing to consider President Obama's nominee to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court. Our families and our country need and deserve a full bench, and Senate Republicans need to stop playing political games with our democracy and give Judge Merrick Garland a fair hearing and vote.\n\"This decision is also a stark reminder of the harm Donald Trump would do to our families, our communities, and our country. Trump has pledged to repeal President Obama's executive actions on his first day in office. He has called Mexican immigrants 'rapists' and 'murderers.' He has called for creating a deportation force\" to tear 11 million people away from their families and their homes.\n\"I believe we are stronger together. When we embrace immigrants, not denigrate them. When we build bridges, not walls. That is why, as president, I will continue to defend DAPA and DACA, and do everything possible under the law to go further to protect families. It is also why I will introduce comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship within my first 100 days. Because when families are strong—America is strong.\"", "timestamp": "2016-06-23", "title": "Hillary Clinton Statement on Texas v. United States"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "The President spoke at 11:53 a.m. in the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117876", "text": "The President. Good morning, everybody. I wanted to say a few words on two of the cases the Supreme Court spoke on today.\nFirst, in the affirmative action case, I'm pleased that the Supreme Court upheld the basic notion that diversity is an important value in our society and that this country should provide a high-quality education to all our young people, regardless of their background. We are not a country that guarantees equal outcomes, but we do strive to provide an equal shot to everybody. And that's what was upheld today.\nSecond, one of the reasons why America is such a diverse and inclusive nation is because we're a nation of immigrants. Our Founders conceived of this country as a refuge for the world. And for more than two centuries, welcoming wave after wave of immigrants has kept us youthful and dynamic and entrepreneurial. It has shaped our character, and it has made us stronger.\nBut for more than two decades now, our immigration system, everybody acknowledges, has been broken. And the fact that the Supreme Court wasn't able to issue a decision today doesn't just set the system back even further, it takes us further from the country that we aspire to be.\nJust to lay out some basic facts that sometimes get lost in what can be an emotional debate. Since I took office, we've deployed more border agents and technology to our southern border than ever before. That has helped cut illegal border crossings to their lowest levels since the 1970s. It should have paved the way for comprehensive immigration reform. And in fact, as many of you know, it almost did. Nearly 70 Democrats and Republicans in the Senate came together to pass a smart, commonsense bill that would have doubled the border patrol and offered undocumented immigrants a pathway to earn citizenship if they paid a fine, paid their taxes, and played by the rules.\nUnfortunately, Republicans in the House of Representatives refused to allow a simple yes-or-no vote on that bill. So I was left with little choice but to take steps within my existing authority to make our immigration system smarter, fairer, and more just.\nFour years ago, we announced that those who are our lowest priorities for enforcement—diligent, patriotic young DREAMers who grew up pledging allegiance to our flag—should be able to apply to work here and study here and pay their taxes here. More than 730,000 lives have been changed as a result. These are students, they're teachers, they're doctors, they're lawyers. They're Americans in every way but on paper. And fortunately, today's decision does not affect this policy. It does not affect the existing DREAMers.\nTwo years ago, we announced a similar, expanded approach for others who are also low priorities for enforcement. We said that if you've been in America for more than 5 years, with children who are American citizens or legal residents, then you, too, can come forward, get right with the law, and work in this country temporarily, without fear of deportation. Both were the kinds of actions taken by Republican and Democratic Presidents over the past half-century. Neither granted anybody a free pass. All they did was focus our enforcement resources—which are necessarily limited—on the highest priorities: convicted criminals, recent border crossers, and threats to our national security.\nNow, as disappointing as it was to be challenged for taking the kind of actions that other administrations have taken, the country was looking to the Supreme Court to resolve the important legal questions raised in this case. Today the Supreme Court was unable to reach a decision. This is part of the consequence of the Republican failure so far to give a fair hearing to Mr. Merrick Garland, my nominee to the Supreme Court. It means that the expanded set of commonsense deferred action policies—the ones that I announced 2 years ago—can't go forward at this stage, until there is a ninth justice on the Court to break the tie.\nNow, I know a lot of people are going to be disappointed today, but it is important to understand what today means. The deferred action policy that has been in place for the last 4 years is not affected by this ruling. Enforcement priorities developed by my administration are not affected by this ruling. This means that the people who might have benefited from the expanded deferred action policies—long-term residents raising children who are Americans or legal residents—they will remain low priorities for enforcement. As long as you have not committed a crime, our limited immigration enforcement resources are not focused on you.\nBut today's decision is frustrating to those who seek to grow our economy and bring a rationality to our immigration system and to allow people to come out of the shadows and lift this perpetual cloud on them. I think it is heartbreaking for the millions of immigrants who've made their lives here, who've raised families here, who hoped for the opportunity to work, pay taxes, serve in our military, and more fully contribute to this country we all love in an open way.\nSo where do we go from here? Most Americans—including business leaders, faith leaders, and law enforcement, Democrats and Republicans and Independents—still agree that the single best way to solve this problem is by working together to pass commonsense, bipartisan immigration reform.\nThat is obviously not going to happen during the remainder of this Congress. We don't have a Congress that agrees with us on this. Nor do we have a Congress that's willing to do even its most basic of jobs under the Constitution, which is to consider nominations. Republicans in Congress currently are willfully preventing the Supreme Court from being fully staffed and functioning as our Founders intended. And today's situation underscores the degree to which the Court is not able to function the way it's supposed to.\nThe Court's inability to reach a decision in this case is a very clear reminder of why it's so important for the Supreme Court to have a full Bench. For more than 40 years, there's been an average of just over 2 months between a nomination and a hearing. I nominated Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court more than 3 months ago. But most Republicans so far have refused so—to even meet with him. They are allowing partisan politics to jeopardize something as fundamental as the impartiality and integrity of our justice system. And America should not let it stand.\nThis is an election year. And during election years, politicians tend to use the immigration issue to scare people with words like \"amnesty\" in hopes that it will whip up votes. Keep in mind that millions of us, myself included, go back generations in this country, with ancestors who put in the painstaking effort to become citizens. And we don't like the notion that anyone might get a free pass to American citizenship. But here's the thing. Millions of people who have come forward and worked to get right with the law under this policy, they've been living here for years too, in some cases, even decades. So leaving the broken system the way it is, that's not a solution. In fact, that's the real amnesty. Pretending we can deport 11 million people or build a wall without spending tens of billions of dollars of taxpayer money is abetting what is really just factually incorrect. It's not going to work. And it's not good for this country. It's a fantasy that offers nothing to help the middle class, and it demeans our tradition of being both a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants.\nIn the end, it is my firm belief that immigration is not something to fear. We don't have to wall ourselves off from those who may not look like us right now or pray like we do or have a different last name. Because being an American is about something more than that. What makes us America is our shared commitment to an ideal that all of us are created equal, all of us have a chance to make of our lives what we will. And every study shows that whether it was the Irish or the Poles or the Germans or the Italians or the Chinese or the Japanese or the Mexicans or the Kenyans—[laughter]—whoever showed up, over time, by a second generation, third generation, those kids are Americans. They do look like us, because we don't look one way. We don't all have the same last names, but we all share a creed, and we all share a commitment to the values that founded this Nation. That's who we are. And that is what I believe most Americans recognize.\nSo here's the bottom line. We've got a very real choice that America faces right now. We will continue to implement the existing programs that are already in place. We're not going to be able to move forward with the expanded programs that we wanted to move forward on, because the Supreme Court was not able to issue a ruling at this stage. And now we've got a choice about who we're going to be as a country, what we want to teach our kids, and how we want to be represented in Congress and in the White House.\nWe're going to have to make a decision about whether we are a people who tolerate the hypocrisy of a system where the workers who pick our fruit or make our beds never have the chance to get right with the law or whether we're going to give them a chance, just like our forebears had a chance, to take responsibility and give their kids a better future.\nWe're going to have to decide whether we're a people who accept the cruelty of ripping children from their parents' arms or whether we actually value families and keep them together for the sake of all of our communities.\nWe're going to have to decide whether we're a people who continue to educate the world's brightest students in our high schools and universities, only to then send them away to compete against us, or whether we encourage them to stay and create new jobs and new businesses right here in the United States.\nThese are all the questions that voters now are going to have to ask themselves and are going to have to answer in November. These are the issues that are going to be debated by candidates across the country, both congressional candidates as well as the Presidential candidates. And in November, Americans are going to have to make a decision about what we care about and who we are.\nI promise you this though: Sooner or later, immigration reform will get done. Congress is not going to be able to ignore America forever. It's just—it's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when. And I can say that with confidence because we've seen our history. We get these spasms of politics around immigration and fear-mongering, and then our traditions and our history and our better impulses kick in. That's how we all ended up here. Because I guarantee you, at some point, every one of us has somebody in our background who people didn't want coming here, and yet here we are.\nAnd that's what's going to happen this time. Now, the question is, do we do it in a smart, rational, sensible way, or we just keep on kicking the can down the road? I believe that this country deserves an immigration policy that reflects the goodness of the American people. And I think we're going to get that. Hopefully, we're going to get that in November.\nAll right. I'll take two questions.\nQ. Mr. President——\nThe President. Two questions. Go ahead.\nImmigration Policy\nQ. Thank you. Realistically, what do you see is the risk of deportation for these more than 4 million people? I mean, you say we can't deport 11 million. This is 4 million, and there's a chunk of time here before something else——\nThe President. Well, let me just be very clear. What was unaffected by today's ruling—or lack of a ruling—is the enforcement priorities that we've put in place. And our enforcement priorities that have been laid out by Secretary Jeh Johnson at the Department of Homeland Security are pretty clear: We prioritize criminals, we prioritize gangbangers, we prioritize folks who have just come in. What we don't do is to prioritize people who have been here a long time, who are otherwise law abiding, who have roots and connections in their communities. And so those enforcement priorities will continue.\nThe work that we've done with the DREAM Act kids, those policies remain in place. So what this has prevented us from doing is expanding the scope of what we've done with the DREAM Act kids. Keep in mind though that even that was just a temporary measure. All it was doing was basically saying to these kids, you can have confidence that you are not going to be deported, but it does not resolve your ultimate status. That is going to require congressional action.\nSo although I'm disappointed by the lack of a decision today by the Supreme Court, a deadlock, this does not substantially change the status quo, and it doesn't negate what has always been the case, which is if we're really going to solve this problem effectively, we've got to have Congress pass a law.\nI have pushed to the limits of my executive authority. We now have to have Congress act. And hopefully, we're going to have a vigorous debate during this election—this is how democracy is supposed to work—and there will be a determination as to which direction we go in.\nAs I said, over the long term, I'm very confident about the direction this country will go in, because we've seen this in the past. But—if we hadn't seen it in the past, America would look very different than it looks today. But whether we're going to get this done now, soon, so that this does not continue to be this divisive force in our politics and we can get down to the business of all pulling together to create jobs and educate our kids and protect ourselves from external threats and do the things that we need to do to ensure a better future for the next generation, that's going to be determined in part by how voters turn out and who they vote for in November.\nAll right. One more question. Go ahead, Mike [Mike Dorning, Bloomberg News]. Immigration Policy/The President's Executive Authority/Judicial Confirmation Process\nQ. Two practical, going-forward questions. Number one, is this going to—are you going to be able to do anything more at all for immigrants going forward in terms of executive action before the election of the next President? And number two, do you in any way take this as some Republicans have presented this, as a slap at your use of executive authority, this tie vote? And will this in any way circumscribe how aggressively or forcefully you use executive authority in the remainder of your time in office?\nThe President. Okay. I—on the specifics of immigration, I don't anticipate that there are additional executive actions that we can take. We can implement what we've already put in place that is not affected by this decision. But we have to follow now what has been ruled on in the Fifth Circuit because the Supreme Court could not resolve the issue.\nAnd we're going to have to abide by that ruling until an election and a confirmation of a ninth justice of the Supreme Court so that they can break this tie. Because we've always said that we are going to do what we can lawfully through executive action, but we can't go beyond that. And we've butted up about as far as we can on this particular topic.\nIt does not have any impact on, from our perspective, on the host of other issues that we're working on, because each one of these issues has a different analysis and is based on different statutes or different interpretations of our authority.\nSo, for example, on climate change, that's based on the Clean Air Act and the EPA and previous Supreme Court rulings, as opposed to a theory of prosecutorial discretion that, in the past, has—every other President has exercised. And the Supreme Court wasn't definitive one way or the other on this. I mean, the problem is, they don't have a ninth justice. So that will continue to be a problem.\nWith respect to the Republicans, I think what it tells you is, is that if you keep on blocking judges from getting on the bench, then courts can't issue decisions. And what that means is, then, you're going to have the status quo frozen, and we're not going to be able to make progress on some very important issues.\nNow, that may have been their strategy from the start. But it's not a sustainable strategy. And it's certainly a strategy that will be broken by this election, unless their basic theory is, is that we will never confirm judges again. Hopefully, that's not their theory, because that's not how our democracy is designed.\nThe President's Executive Authority\nQ. But you reject their portrayal of this as a chastisement of you for your use of executive authority?\nThe President. It was a one-word opinion that said, we can't come up with a decision. I think that would be a little bit of a stretch, yes. Maybe the next time they can—if we have a full Court issuing a full opinion on anything, then we take it seriously. This we have to abide by, but it wasn't any kind of value statement or a decision on the merits on these issues.\nAll right?

Welcome aboard Air Force One en route to Seattle, Washington. I actually don't have any announcements off the top, so I'm happy to go right to your questions -- which I presume will be mostly on the Global Entrepreneurship Summit. (Laughter.)\nQ: Who else has the President spoken to today after the Brexit?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Roberta, I can tell you that the President, as he mentioned, spoke with Prime Minister Cameron. Obviously, in that conversation, they discussed the referendum. And the President made clear that despite the British people's desire to leave the EU, that the U.S. special relationship with the United Kingdom will remain unchanged. Both of the leaders highlighted that the United Kingdom's membership in NATO and contributions to NATO remain intact.\nAnd the President did express regret about the Prime Minister's decision to step aside. Obviously the Prime Minister has been a trusted friend, trusted advisor to this President, and a good partner in facing a host of issues around the globe. President Obama also feels that Prime Minister Cameron is deeply committed to democratic values and has a strong record to show for that over his time in office.\nAt the same time, the EU will remain an indispensable partner of the United States. And both Prime Minister Cameron and President Obama, in that conversation, talked about their shared goals to promote stability, stimulate growth, and foster democratic ideals in Europe and beyond. Obviously, there will be an orderly process of negotiating the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union. And as leaders from around the world have expressed today, that process will be done in a way that ensures financial stability, continued investment, and economic prosperity.\nThe President also had a chance to speak with Chancellor Merkel this morning. Both of them together expressed regret over the decision yesterday, but also expressed respect. This was a decision that was up to the British people, and they made their voice heard. And both Chancellor Merkel and President Obama acknowledged that.\nThe Chancellor and the President also spoke about making sure that the G7 partners work closely on this transition, and they made a point to say that this will surely be on the agenda for the NATO Summit in Poland in a few weeks.\nThe other call that I'll mention that the President had this morning was with Secretary Jack Lew, Treasury Secretary. The Secretary briefed the President on the latest developments on the international economy and also Secretary Lew's conversations with his counterparts around the world. Both the President and the Secretary reiterated their shared goals of focusing on stability, security, and economic growth both in Europe, including the United Kingdom, and around the world.\nQ: How worried should Americans be about the financial turmoil that we saw today?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, I think it's important to note a few things, Roberta -- that the UK and EU policymakers have sufficient tools to support economic and financial stability. And European resilience to economic shocks has improved significantly in recent years. As I think the Treasury Secretary relayed, he's been in touch with his counterparts around the world, and we're going to continue to consult and cooperate as appropriate, underscoring that this only reinforces the importance of all countries meeting their G20 commitments to use fiscal, monetary, and structural tools to strengthen their economies.\nI'm happy to talk to you about where we see the U.S. economy right now. As you know, the U.S. economy has substantial domestic strength. For example, we've seen strong consumer spending and unemployment insurance claims near the lowest levels in decades. But there's no doubt that the vote has heightened uncertainty in financial markets, and that underscores the importance of continuing to work with both the UK and other partners to foster orderly markets and support economic growth, while making sure the departure from the United Kingdom is done in an orderly way -- the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union is done in an orderly way.\nQ: Are we going to see the President sort of give a message to the American people along those lines about what's being done to sort of help with this orderly transition and give them this sort of reassurance about the stability of the U.S. economy?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, like I said, the Treasury Department is actually in close contact with our G7 and international counterparts. Secretary Lew, I understand, participated in a conference call earlier today with the G7 counterparts, and has been and will remain in close contact with the major economies. Obviously, the President had a chance to speak with Secretary Lew earlier today.\nAnd when it comes to the domestic economy, I think it's important to put where we are in some context. As you know, we are now experiencing the longest stretch of private sector job growth in our nation's history. To date, our economy has added 14.5 million private sector jobs over 75 straight months. In the past year alone, our businesses have added 2.3 million jobs. Rising home prices have brought millions of homeowners back up above water. Health care prices have risen at their lowest rate in 50 years since the Affordable Care Act became law. The budget deficit has been cut by three-quarters.\nSo the President has a strong record of stewardship over the American economy. And his focus on that isn't going to change.\nQ: Eric, how long do you expect the type of market fluctuations like we saw today, the Dow falling 600 points, how long do you expect those to last? And does the Treasury Department or any part of the U.S. government need to take steps right now to shore up the economy?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Justin, as you know, we don't comment on individual market movements, so I'm not going to do that here today. I will say, generally speaking, obviously the Secretary of the Treasury Department is closely monitoring this. He's briefing the President as appropriate. And he's also working with his counterparts across the world to make sure that the President's view of stability, security and prosperity help guide decisions in the coming weeks and months.\nQ: Did the President screw this one up? He came to the UK a few months ago. There was a lot of criticism that he was an outsider coming in. Similarly, we didn't hear from him in the week before Brexit to kind of lobby what was a very narrow vote. Could President Obama have done more or done something differently?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Justin, you put it so eloquently. (Laughter.) I will say that the trip earlier this year to England was an opportunity for the President to speak out on this. Every time he spoke out on this, though, he made clear that this was a decision for the British people -- and I think that's important. He also made clear that because of the closeness of our countries, and specifically the interconnectedness of our economies, that he wanted to speak out on this, that he had views not just because he thought the United Kingdom staying in the European Union was good for the United Kingdom and for Europe, but because he thought it was the in the United States' interest as well.\nAnd, by the way, he wasn't alone. He joined every Western leader who also thought that that was the right thing to do. And leaders of large international financial institutions also thought that was the right thing to do. One could imagine a scenario where the vote last night happened and the President hadn't taken that opportunity to speak out, I think you'd be asking me a much different question about why didn't the President do what he could. So, again --\nQ: I was sort of asking that question. Why wasn't the President more vocal in the week before Brexit? I mean, I asked Josh multiple times, I think my colleagues did, as well, why the President wasn't out there in the final days.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, again, the President was in the United Kingdom earlier this year making this precise case. And at the time, I know the Prime Minister and his team were grateful for the President for doing that. They expressed appreciation both publicly and privately to the President for his remarks during his trip. But at the end of the day, Justin, this was a decision for the British people to make. The President respects that.\nQ: Eric, you talked about Cameron and the President having expressed regret over his resignation. Is that more because of their kind of personal relationship? Or is that because he feels as though that the situation was tenable for Cameron in the UK?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, Darren, I'd say that you are right, they have a -- Prime Minister Cameron and President Obama have a very good, close working relationship, and I think's that borne out of the special relationship between our two countries. Prime Minister Cameron and President Obama have worked very closely together on a host of challenges around the world. That includes a Counter-ISIL Coalition. That includes their work together in NATO. Britain is one of the countries that is committed to -- 2 percent of their GDP is defense spending. They've lived up to their commitment. The United Kingdom and the United States have a robust intelligence-sharing relationship that has proved to be beneficial for law enforcement and national security officials on both sides of the Atlantic. We obviously have a close bilateral trade relationship. Our economies are intertwined. And there's infinite cultural exchanges that happen all the time.\nSo the President does feel a close relationship to the Prime Minister. But all of those links which I've just outlined are not going to change last night's vote or the Prime Minister's decision to step aside. The relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom transcends any one or two particular leaders. It also transcends political parties. So that relationship is going to be enduring, and I think that was reflected in the President's statements that we released earlier.\nQ: Can I ask, when the President was in the UK in April, he said that the Brits would go to the back queue in terms of trade agreements with the U.S. if they left Brexit. Does that still hold? Or are we rethinking that because our economies are so intertwined?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Greg, what I'd say about this is that the economic rationale for T-TIP remains strong, and nothing that happened last night changes that rationale. We're going to continue to work with the EU to conclude those negotiations by the end of the year. We are right now evaluating the impact of last night's decision on T-TIP, but we're going to be engaging our counterparts both in Brussels and in London on this. I think that helps underscore what I said earlier and what the President has said, which is this is all the more reason for an orderly sequence to the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union.\nQ: But wait a minute, just to explore that a little bit. He said that Britain would move to the end of the queue, but you're not saying that right now, are you?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, I don't have -- obviously the President stands by what he said, and I don't have an update to our position. All I was saying is that it's going to take some time to assess what the impact of last night's decision was on the\nT-TIP negotiations. The T-TIP negotiations continue in earnest. We said we wanted those to conclude by the end of the year. And so those are negotiations housed out of the office of the United States Trade Representative, Michael Froman. So if you have details about where those negotiations stand, you should check in with that office.\nQ: Eric, another big theme of the visit in April was some controversial comments by London Mayor Boris Johnson. He's now potentially in line to become England's next Prime Minister with the resignation of David Cameron. If that were to transpire, is he somebody the President can work with after what he said about him?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Justin, I've seen some news reports on that, but I think it's far too early for me to speculate on the British domestic politics on how that goes. As I understand it, it's not even clear how this succession will work. They might be able to do this via a party conference in a few months, or they might need to hold elections.\nQ: Maybe I'll get you to speculate on politics here. The Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, was in Scotland today, and he said that the Brexit was basically a vindication of what he's been talking about and also has some parallels to the campaign that he thinks he's running. Is that a concern for the President and Democrats, that this sort of populous sentiment is going to lead to a surprise victory by Donald Trump? And similarly, are you worried that the sort of economic ramifications make it harder for you to prosecute your case about the President's economic success?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I'm going to leave it to the pundits and all of you to assess if a domestic economic referendum in Europe, how that -- what that says about a domestic political election here in the United States in five months. So I will leave it to all of you to sort of assess if there's any tea leaf reading that's possible.\nIn terms of the President's record, I don't think we're going to have any problem making that case. As I mentioned, we are now in the longest stretch of private sector job growth in our nation's history. The budget deficit has been cut by three-quarters. For middle-class families, wage growth is accelerating. Wages have risen at an annual rate of over 3 percent so far in 2016. The United States is less reliant on foreign oil than we have been in nearly three decades. Manufacturing has added 832,000 jobs over the past 75 months and has experienced the fastest streak of manufacturing job growth since the 1990s.\nSo the President is enormously proud of his record over the past seven years. And that's definitely a case we'll be making through the fall.\nQ: And on the summit, what indication do you have that the President is going to be focusing on entrepreneurship in the post-presidency? He spent a lot of time here. He seemed to be really invested in the young people. He had a long dinner on Friday night -- last night, rather. What indication do you have that this is going to be something that he focuses on in the post-presidency?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, I think you can tell by observing the President today that this is something that's very close to his heart. He believes that entrepreneurship is an American value. It's one that demonstrates our strength. And that's why he's so proud to showcase this.\nThis was actually born out of one of the President's first significant speeches while President, back in 2009 in Cairo. And he sees this as an important opportunity for a host of reasons, one of which is these are young people solving problems. And he gave a few examples today in his remarks. But we talk a lot about the challenges around the world, in some unstable places, and places that aren't on as sure footing as we'd like. And the President believes that one of the ways to dig out of those holes is economic prosperity.\nAnd when people have a life's work that is also benefiting the community that they're in, that's a good thing. I think that's why the President is so focused on it. I will also say that this is a commitment shared by the President's counterparts around the world. As you know, a few weeks ago when Prime Minister Modi was in the White House -- was in Washington, they announced that the next Global Entrepreneurship Summit would be in India. And so this is something that the President is gratified is not going to stop when he leaves office.\nLet me give you a few examples of why the President feels that this type of effort is so instrumental to our global development agenda. Small and medium-sized enterprises generate 78 percent of jobs in low-income countries and are particularly important sources of livelihoods in poor and rural communities. In fact, today over 341 million youth in developing countries are unemployed, and another 536 million are under-employed. So creating jobs for these young people is going to be one of the best ways to not only tackle poverty, but also bring stability to some of these areas.\nThe last point I'll make on this is the point of the summit today -- and actually, Mark Zuckerberg touched on this -- connectivity. When the President has the opportunity to connect someone with a smart idea with someone who has the resources to fund it along with people to make it happen, that connectivity sometimes takes a convening power like we see the President of the United States have. So absent that convening power, sometimes those entities don't get connected. That's why the President is so encouraged by what he saw this week.\nQ: On the national security aspects of the Brexit, you talked about how the President was briefed by Secretary Lew. But I'm wondering whether he was also briefed by any members of his national security team about what this would mean for NATO, and all those sort of aspects of it.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Yes. So last night the President was at a dinner with some of the leaders of the Global Entrepreneurship Summit. Also at that dinner was his National Security Advisor Susan Rice, so she was able to keep him up to date in real time as anything determinative came in.\nQ: What consideration was given to changing the President's schedule today in light of the remarkable events?\nMR. SCHULTZ: There was no change to the President's schedule today.\nQ: Was any consideration, though -- what consideration was given to changing his schedule?\nMR. SCHULTZ: The President -- well, I should say there was no change to the President's public schedule, because, as I mentioned, he did speak with Prime Minister Cameron --\nQ: I'm talking about the public schedule.\nMR. SCHULTZ: So the President felt like this was a worthy endeavor to be here. I just went through some of the sort of global aspects of why we think supporting entrepreneurship is important. And again, he had a chance to both speak with Prime Minister Cameron and Chancellor Merkel. He had a chance to read out those conversations to all of you in the opening of the remarks and also put last night's developments into some context, which I think he did.\nQ: There's been a renewed call for Scotland to now leave the United Kingdom. They voted heavily to stay in the EU. Obviously the rest of the UK did not. The President spoke at the time about the importance of a united United Kingdom. Does that still hold true, or does the President think that Scotland should reconsider in light of what happened yesterday?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I don't have any updated position from the President for you on this. I think his comments the last time he addressed this still stand.\nQ: It seems like the President has been talking a lot lately about sort of fear caused by globalization, terrorism, immigration policy. Is there more he can do -- after Orlando, after this Brexit, after the Supreme Court ruling -- is there more he can do to sort of calm people?\nMR. SCHULTZ: You've grouped a lot of episodes in there, Greg, so let me --\nQ: well, the same things seem to come up after each one, which is why I grouped them together.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Fair question. Let me see what I can -- how I can respond. I think that the President has spoken out about this theme. He has said that when there's instability and some unpredictability in the world that some people have an impulse to cower and to back away and to isolate themselves. The President believes that's never the right approach, that we live in an interconnected global economy. We also live in the greatest country on Earth. And as the President made remarks -- I'm going to mix up my days, but I think it was yesterday now in the Briefing Room -- that one of America's greatest strengths is the diversity of our people.\nWe are a nation of immigrants. Immigrants are our teachers, our neighbors, our doctors, our firefighters, our police officers. And he believes that diversity is not just an American value, it's a defining characteristic of why we are the greatest country on Earth. So the President isn't going to shy away from making that case. You heard him make that case in light of the Supreme Court ruling yesterday.\nThe other episodes you mentioned are different fact patterns. In light of Orlando and in light of the threat we face by violent extremists, some have called for more isolation. The President doesn't believe that that's the answer either. He obviously wants to do everything in his power to protect and shore up our homeland security, but at the end of the day, if we start to alienate certain populations, that's going to be counterproductive. That not only feeds the propaganda of those who wish to do us harm, it also alienates the most vulnerable populations who are being targeted to commit this violence.\nQ: Is the President going to hit the campaign trail and talk about some of these issues that are obviously very political here and overseas?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I think -- well, you'll have an opportunity to hear the President at some campaign events later this evening, so you'll have a chance to hear the President's take. I believe that -- going back to Justin's question and Greg's question -- that, yes, that clearly we are having a debate in this country about a lot of these issues, and the President isn't going to hesitate to make his case. I think you heard him do that in the context of national security proposals that he thought we're misguided. You heard him do that in terms of economic policies that he thinks are misguided. So I do think you'll hear the President make the case.\nQ: Any idea when?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, you'll have an opportunity tonight to hear the President talk about what he thinks is at stake in this election. But I don't have any additional events to preview right now.\nQ: Does he worry at all that that case is not being heard, in other words, that he's not sort of penetrating the debate and the discussion? Or do you feel like it is?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I don't think there's a lot of evidence to that. I think the President feels that some of these questions are fundamental to the identity of our country, and so whether it's the economic case -- and I don't know if you all saw that Speaker Ryan released a tax plan today, which essentially codified the Republican Party beliefs that tax cuts should go to the wealthy and the middle class should pay the price. Or if it's on national security issues where the President believes that the best thing we can do is really work with our partners and work with the American people to make sure that we keep our homeland safe, and to make sure that we're doing everything we can on the international scene to degrade and ultimately defeat those who wish to do us harm.\nThe President assembled a coalition of 66 partners, a coalition that was -- with deep representation in the Arab world, because he believes that the fundamental way to root out terrorism and to root out violent extremism is to make sure that we're more inclusive, and to make sure that we not only do everything we can to go after the terrorists, but also to make sure that we respect our values at the same time. And that means not going after vulnerable populations or vulnerable minorities in the United States. That's not an American value. That's not something we believe in here.\nQ: There was pretty violent flooding in West Virginia. More than a dozen people died. I'm wondering if the President has been briefed on what federal resources are being deployed there.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Thank you, Justin, for bringing that up. We have seen the extreme flooding in West Virginia. Our thoughts and prayers go to the families and communities affected. And we are very much focused on the response on the ground. FEMA, through its regional office in Pennsylvania, is closely monitoring the severe flooding and is working closely with state emergency managers and local officials in West Virginia.\nAs of now, there have not been any requests for federal assistance. However, as part of FEMA's forward-leaning posture, they have deployed teams to West Virginia to provide support to state and local officials on the disaster declaration process, to help them work through that process, and to assist state and local officials on assessing the damages and impact to these communities. So we're going to continue to learn -- to be forward to make sure that they're getting the resources they need.\nQ: And just to put a finer point on the scheduling questions, first, do we expect the President to touch on Brexit again tonight in his conversations with donors? And secondly, segue into perhaps the week ahead if nobody else has anything, but people might -- can you rule out whether the President will do his first campaign event with Hillary Clinton next week? Or is that still a possibility?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I don't have a preview of the President's remarks tonight for you, but I think I wouldn't expect anything additional than what he had to offer earlier today. On the event with Secretary Clinton, that's obviously something the President looks forward to. We haven't yet nailed that date down in the books yet, but as soon as we do we'll let you know.\nQ: Is it possible it could be next week?\nMR. SCHULTZ: As soon as that's nailed down we'll let you know.\nQ: Did any of these political topics come up even in passing in his conversation with his pretty good pal, David Cameron?\nMR. SCHULTZ: The President has spoken before -- you mean our domestic politics?\nQ: Yes.\nMR. SCHULTZ: The President has spoken before that people around the world pay close attention to American politics. So our domestic campaign season has come up in conversation with foreign leaders. I think that most recently happened at the G7, which we were at earlier this year. I don't know if it came up in the conversation this morning with Prime Minister Cameron.\nQ: Week ahead?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Happy to, Roberta.\nOn Monday, the President will welcome the 2015 WNBA champions, the Minnesota Lynx, to the White House to honor the team and their championship victory.\nOn Tuesday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.\nAnd on Wednesday, the President will travel to Canada for the North American Leaders Summit, where he will meet with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, and President Enrique Peсa Nieto of Mexico. The summit is further recognition of the value of a more integrated North America to advance the security and prosperity of the continent. It also highlights the importance of continuing to strengthen the bilateral and trilateral ties between the United States, Canada, and Mexico.\nWhile in Ottawa, the President will also address a joint session of the Parliament of Canada.\nOn Thursday and Friday, the President will hold meetings at the White House.\nQ: Thank you.\nEND 2:43 P.M.

Over 2.2 million individuals are in American prisons and jails, and the vast majority of them will return to their communities. Improving education and job opportunities has a  recognized effect of reducing crime, making our communities safer and reducing barriers to success.\nToday, the Administration announced a series of education and jobs programs along with other supportive measures designed to ensure that people who are returning from prison to the community are equipped with the skills and resources necessary to obtain employment, support their families, and contribute to society. Today at 10:00am ET, the Center for American Progress (CAP) will host a conversation on criminal justice with U.S. Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch, U.S. Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez, U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro, and U.S. Secretary of Education John B. King, Jr. These efforts build on the momentum around the Roadmap to Reentry announcement, National Reentry Week, and progress made by the Federal Interagency Reentry Council.\nToday's Administration announcements include:\n• Second Chance Pell Pilot Program.  The Department of Education selected 67 colleges and universities who will partner with more than 100 Federal and state correctional institutions to enroll roughly 12,000 incarcerated students in educational and training programs. Selected schools will offer classroom-based instruction, online education, or a hybrid of both at corrections facilities; the vast majority of selected schools are public two- and four-year institutions. Recent studies show that incarcerated individuals who participate in correctional education are 43 percent less likely to return to prison within three years than prisoners who did not participate in any correctional education programs, resulting in estimates that for every dollar invested in correctional education programs, four to five dollars are saved on re-incarceration costs. Through the Second Chance Pell pilot program, institutions may provide Federal Pell Grants to qualified students who are incarcerated and eligible for release, particularly those who are likely to be released within five years of enrolling in coursework. The Second Chance Pell program responds to recommendations put forth by the President's My Brother's Keeper Task Force to promote successful alternatives to incarceration and eliminate unnecessary barriers to reentry.\n• Reentry Demonstration Project for Young Adults. The Department of Labor announced over $31 million in grants to seven organizations to design programs for adults ages 18 to 24 to provide job training and a path to meaningful employment. The organizations apply evidence-based interventions in fields including mentoring, career pathways, and registered apprenticeship, with a focus on providing occupational training and credentials.\n• Training to Work. The Department of Labor awarded grants totaling over $21 million to 16 organizations to serve individuals in high-poverty and high-crime areas. These grants offer returning citizens in a state or local work release program an opportunity to participate in a career pathway program that defines and maps out a sequence of educational and workforce training resulting in skilled workers who meet the needs of local employers. These programs will also provide services such as case management, mentoring, and follow-up services.\n• Linking to Employment Activities Pre-Release. The Department of Labor announced 11 grants totaling over $5 million to organizations operating specialized American Job Centers inside correctional facilities. The organizations assist soon-to-be-released inmates with the transition to life in their communities by providing services to prepare for employment and increase opportunity for successful reentry. These awards build on an award of $10 million to 20 organizations providing similar services in 2015.\n• Pathways to Justice. The Department of Labor awarded grants totaling $6.5 million to five non-profit organizations and two local governments to provide mentorship and career training to youth ages 16 to 21 who are at risk of dropping out of high school, becoming involved in the juvenile or criminal justice systems, or have juvenile records. Students will be mentored by justice and emergency services personnel to explore career paths as police officers, firefighters, lawyers, and paramedics and other related professions.\n• Permanent Supportive Housing through Pay for Success. Research consistently demonstrates a correlation between homelessness and incarceration. The Department of Housing and Urban Development and Department of Justice awarded $8.7 million to seven organizations to address individuals cycling between the criminal justice system and homeless services. The grants will fund Permanent Supportive Housing, an evidence-based intervention shown to lead to decreases in homelessness, arrests, hospitalization, and emergency room visits. The Pay for Success model—which enables government to pay only when positive outcomes are achieved—presents a promising way for communities to scale innovative solutions, paying once value of reduced remedial services are realized.\n• Toolkit for Housing Reentry Programs. The Department of Housing and Urban Development is releasing a toolkit entitled It Starts with Housing: Public Housing Agencies Are Making Second Chances Real. This publication highlights best practices and case studies that can be replicated by communities looking to build their own reentry housing programs to improve housing opportunities for returning citizens across the country.\n• Protecting the Children of Incarcerated Parents. The Department of Justice will support the development of model family strengthening policies that can be adopted by and implemented in prisons and jails. The policies will address referral and case management for incarcerated parents; visiting policies and procedures; visiting room and waiting room environments; parenting and other programming offered in correctional facilities; family reunification and reentry planning; and identifying and incorporating local services.\nThese announcements build on the Administration's longstanding commitment to improving reentry outcomes and removing unnecessary obstacles facing the formerly incarcerated individuals, including:\n• Establishing the  Federal Interagency Reentry Council to lead the Government's work on the rehabilitation and reintegration of individuals returning to their communities from prisons and jails.\n• Calling on the private sector to create pathways to jobs for formerly incarcerated individuals. Over 100 employers, employing over 1.5 million individuals have taken the  Fair Chance Business Pledge and committed to take action to reduce barriers to a second chance.\n• \"Banning the Box\" in federal employment by prohibiting federal agencies from asking questions about criminal and credit history to applicants for tens of thousands of government jobs until a conditional offer of employment has been made.\n• Releasing  guidance on the application of Fair Housing Act standards to the use of criminal records by providers of housing and providing guidance for public housing authorities on excluding the use of arrest records in housing decisions.\n• Clarifying that individuals in state or local halfway houses and those on probation or parole are not excluded from Medicaid and describing how states can better facilitate access to Medicaid services for individuals reentering the community.\n• Making available Veterans Affairs services and support to justice-involved veterans in over 350 Veterans Treatment Courts and other Veteran-focused court programs and 1,284 local jails.\n• Removing unnecessary barriers to college access. The Department of Education issued Beyond the Box Guidance and higher education institutions from across the country joined the  Fair Chance Higher Education Pledge to voice their support for the reforms needed to expand college opportunity.\n• Establishing the My Brother's Keeper Task Force in February of 2014, which is charged with addressing persistent opportunity gaps facing boys and young men of color and ensuring all young people can reach their full potential. Many of the announcements being made today respond to the  Task Force's May 2014 Report to the President, which included a wide range of recommendations designed to create clear pathways to opportunity and \"eliminate unnecessary barriers to giving justice-involved youth a second chance.\"", "timestamp": "2016-06-24", "title": "Fact Sheet: President Obama Announces New Actions to Reduce Recidivism and Promote Reintegration of Formerly Incarcerated Individuals"}

ROSHOLM: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today on this on-the-record conference call to discuss the First Lady's upcoming trip to Liberia, Morocco and Spain. We're joined today by Tina Tchen, Chief of Staff to the First Lady; Ben Rhodes, Assistant to the President and Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications and Speechwriting; and Mary Beth Goodman, Senior Director for Development and Democracy, National Security Council.\nIf you would like to get updates on the trip, please feel free to email us at any time at FirstLadyPress@who.eop.gov. And you can also follow along on the First Lady's trip next week across her social media accounts, including her brand new Snapchat account, which was launched on the occasion of this visit to encourage young people here in the U.S. to engage in her trip.\nWith that, I'm going to hand it over to Tina, Ben and Mary Beth for some brief opening remarks. And then, depending on time, we'll take a few questions at the end.\nTina.\nMS. TCHEN: Thank you, Joanna. And thank you for all of us -- to all of you for joining us on the call on a Friday afternoon. We are delighted to talk about the First Lady's upcoming trip to Liberia, Morocco and Spain. This is a great way for the First Lady to highlight one of her core initiatives, Let Girls Learn.\nIn March of 2015, the President and the First Lady together launched Let Girls Learn, which is a whole-of-U.S.-government effort to address the barriers that keep over 62 million girls around the world out of school, in particular adolescent girls. As the President and the First Lady said when they launched the initiative, we know that adolescent girls face specific challenges when they're trying to attend school, in particular the cultural beliefs about the proper role of women and girls in their societies. And when girls don't attend school, that doesn't just harm their own prospects, it harms their families, their communities, and, ultimately, their countries.\nAs part of that launch, the U.S. committed to expanding its work in diplomacy, development and outreach in support of adolescent girls' education. And that's what we'll be doing on this trip.\nOur first stop will be in Liberia. The First Lady on Monday will participate in an official meeting with President Sirleaf. President Sirleaf, as you probably know, is the first elected female head of state in Africa, a Nobel Prize winner, and has been a long-time champion -- empowering women and girls worldwide.\nAfter her meeting with President Sirleaf, the First Lady will head to a Peace Corps training facility in Kakata in Liberia, where -- she will be joined there by Peace Corps Director Carrie Hessler-Radelet. They will meet with girls and young women participating in a GLOW Camp; GLOW stands for Girls Leading Our World, and are girls' leadership camps sponsored by the Peace Corps. They'll also meet with Peace Corps volunteers and trainees.\nThe Peace Corps has just recently returned to Liberia as the country moves beyond the Ebola epidemic. The Peace Corps volunteers will be taking up their work again as volunteers in Liberia, and continuing to work with Liberia as a Let Girls Learn country. What that means is that they've been trained in gender-equality issues in their communities no matter what their main project is. They will work with their communities to identify the barriers to that community's girls completing their education, and design a project that is led by the community that we can help support and fund through the Let Girls Learn fund in the Peace Corps. And if you go to that website, the LetGirlsLearn.gov website, it will connect you over and you can see the many projects that we already have going on around the world in Let Girls Learn countries across the globe.\nFollowing her GLOW Camp visit, the First Lady will visit a school in Unification Town, a town in Liberia, for a discussion with adolescent girls who have faced serious obstacles in obtaining an education. The First Lady will be joined by actress Freida Pinto, who has been an advocate for girls' education, and she will moderate the conversation. The conversation will highlight both the educational barriers girls face as Liberia moves beyond the Ebola epidemic, and the U.S. government's efforts to continue to address those barriers and provide adolescent girls with equitable access to safe and quality education.\nI should mention, which I didn't at the top, that the First Lady is joined on this trip by her two daughters, Malia and Sasha, and Mrs. Robinson. And from Liberia, the First Lady and her family will travel to Marrakech, Morocco.\nIn Marrakech, on Tuesday, the First Lady will be joined by Meryl Streep, who has also been an advocate for girls' education, and Freida Pinto. And they will participate in a conversation with adolescent girls, moderated by CNN's Isha Sesay. In that discussion, the participants will discuss the many challenges girls in Morocco face in getting a quality education. And our visit will also highlight the commitments made by the U.S. government through the Peace Corps, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, and USAID, in partnership with the Kingdom of Morocco, to help adolescent girls in Morocco go to school and stay in school. The First Lady will also attend an Iftar hosted by Her Royal Highness Lalla Salma.\nIn Madrid -- from Morocco, we will go to Madrid on Wednesday evening. The First Lady will deliver a speech on Thursday on Let Girls Learn to hundreds of girls and young women, sharing the stories of girls she had met in Liberia and Morocco as well as her prior travels, and highlighting the new commitments to support Let Girls Learn. Mrs. Obama is going to encourage the audience to value their own educational opportunities, to continue to strive for progress for girls and young women in their country, and to take action to help the more than 62 million girls around the world who are out of school. She'll talk about our 62MillionGirls.com effort, which is also available in Spanish.\nAnd following the First Lady's speech, Her Majesty Queen Letizia will deliver remarks. Mrs. Obama and Her Majesty Queen Letizia will meet following the event.\nThroughout the trip, CNN Films will be filming a documentary featuring the stories of girls in Liberia and Morocco who have overcome barriers to going to and staying in school. This documentary will air in the fall of 2016.\nAs Joanna just mentioned, there are many ways to follow the First Lady on her trip. We launched our Snapchat account, and you can follow her on Snapchat by adding MichelleObama -- no space -- to your Snapchat account. And you can also follow her on Twitter, @FLOTUS; on Instagram at @MichelleObama. And she will be chronicling her travels in a daily trip diary on HelloGiggles.com. And you can encourage others to join the conversation by using the hashtag #LetGirlsLearn and the hashtag #62MillionGirls.\nAnd with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ben Rhodes, who can talk about -- more about our value relationship with both of these countries.\nMR. RHODES: So I'll just say a few words about the three countries that the First Lady is visiting, and then my colleague, Mary Beth, can speak a little bit more about some of our programming in the two countries -- first two countries.\nThis is a unique trip in the sense that the First Lady is going to three different regions that are important to the United States -- Sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa and then Europe. But each of these countries in their own way has been a very important partner for the United States on a host of issues for many years. And so this trip will allow the First Lady to reach directly to publics of three important U.S. partners and talk about an issue that is important to all of us: The education of girls, and the empowerment of women and girls more broadly.\nFirst of all, in Liberia, we have long and deep historical ties with the people of Liberia. And we've also had, over the years, significant cooperation on a range of issues, including a substantial assistance relationship and support for Liberia, first as it emerged from many years of civil war, as President Sirleaf consolidated democratic gains in the aftermath of that civil war, and then, most recently, in coordinating a global response to the Ebola epidemic.\nLiberia is one of our anchor partners in West Africa. And we believe that the success of Liberia's democracy and its people is critical to the future of the broader region. And again, the United States enjoys overwhelming popularity among the people of Liberia who also very much value this relationship. And the opportunity to have the First Lady go and speak to the importance that we place not just on foreign policy issues but on human development will be critical.\nAnd I should just add that in Africa generally, the President and First Lady have stressed the message of empowerment and engagement not just with governments but with peoples, whether it's through our young leaders initiatives, our education initiative, and our broader assistance that has focused very much on capacity-building and empowering people, as well as assisting governments.\nThen Morocco also has been a longstanding partner of the United States on a range of issues. Of course, given the security environment in North Africa, they have been a critical counterterrorism partner for the United States, and they've been a partner in addressing some of the myriad diplomatic challenges that confront the Middle East and North Africa.\nBut beyond that, Morocco has also always put a premium on social development and education in particular. And again, we believe very strongly that education and the empowerment of young people is going to be critical to a region that has known so much turmoil, particularly given the enormous youth populations in those countries. So it's very relevant to our broader objectives in supporting Morocco and the North Africa region that the United States is demonstrating that just as we focus on areas of security cooperation, we're also focused on the empowerment of young people.\nNow, Morocco of course has been, again, relatively stable and successful in a very difficult neighborhood. And we of course want to see their ongoing efforts to improve the livelihoods of their people and to pursue reforms -- is successful. And the First Lady's trip will certainly advance that relationship.\nAnd then lastly, in Spain, this is a key NATO ally, a close partner of the United States. And it is also a country that has dealt with significant challenges in recent years as they've dealt with a difficult economy -- in particular, their economy has faced challenges with a significant youth population that has been seeking employment. And again, the things that we can to build bridges between the United States and Spain and Europe more generally has focused on promoting growth and opportunity for people, especially young people, and therefore it's the perfect place for the First Lady to deliver her global message about the value of lifting up women and girls.\nBeyond that, of course, they're a NATO ally and security partner of the United States. And the President will be visiting Spain shortly after the First Lady to speak to our security cooperation, our alliance, and our support for Spain continuing to move on a trajectory of greater economic growth and prosperity.\nSo in sum, again, the First Lady, by going to these three countries, is able to visit three important regions to the United States, is able to speak not just to governments but to speak to peoples and to make clear that with all the United States is doing around the world, a key part of our leadership is what we can do to lift up the lives of young people, particularly girls.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Mary Beth.\nMS. GOODMAN: Thanks very much, Ben. We have, globally, 62 million girls under the age of 18 that are not in school. Two-hundred-fifty million girls live in poverty. And one out of three girls in the developing world is married by the time she's 18 with one in nine married by the time she's 15.\nAs Tina mentioned, what we're hoping to ultimately do through Let Girls Learn is to develop a successful model to keep adolescent girls in school around the globe. The First Lady's trip next week is going to highlight the ongoing work across the U.S. government. It's really become a whole-of-government effort with contributions from the State Department, the U.S. Agency for National Development, the Peace Corps, the Millennium Challenge Corporation. And we'll be announcing some new commitments to our global education effort through Let Girls Learn on the trip.\nEducated girls can have a hugely positive impact on the next generation. Researchers estimate that over 50 percent of the reduction in child death between 1970 and 2009 can be attributed to increased education attainment in women of reproductive age. We know the benefits to girls' education go well beyond health and nutrition -- for every extra year of secondary schooling, a girl's future earnings increase by 10 to 20 percent. And if 10 percent more girls were actually to attend school, a girl's -- GDP can increase by an average of 3 percent.\nWe're going to be traveling to Liberia and Morocco, as you've heard. In Liberia, nearly two-thirds of Liberia's school-age children do not attend class. It's one of the poorest countries in the world. And the gender disparities really widen with secondary education, particularly for adolescent girls. We have just 33 percent of girls enrolled in secondary education. The national statistics are quite alarming -- we see that girls overall between ages as young as 15 really can't even read a basic sentence. We have a huge illiteracy rate in Liberia.\nAnd girls dropping out of school have sharply risen since the Ebola crisis, where we've seen more girls who became pregnant or were subjected to domestic violence, rape -- they're not able to get back in school. And so we'll really be looking at some of the efforts that the U.S. government can provide to assist them with an opportunity to get a secondary education.\nIn Morocco, we also see that adolescent girls face a particular threat in rural areas where they're simply not allowed to go to secondary school. Often these girls live very far from the middle schools and the high schools and have to travel great distances to get there, and their families simply don't prioritize paying the schools fees for them over boys. So we have an incredibly high drop-out rate of girls from school. And while we have about 85 percent of girls enrolled in primary school, that number drops to as low as 14 percent for high schools.\nSo one of the reasons we're focusing on Morocco is because we do have a key strategic partner in Morocco, as Ben noted. A lot of the effort there has been working in cooperation with the government on some of their educational platforms. While Morocco ranks one of the lowest countries in the Arab world for overall education, their girls' education rates are well below the regional averages. So part of our effort there is focused on what more we can do to cooperate with the government to ensure that we're expanding education opportunities for adolescent girls, particularly in these rural areas.\nIn Liberia, again, we have a very strong strategic partner there in West Africa. And we also want to make sure that we're doing our utmost to continue to provide the support for them as they're seeking to recover from Ebola. The efforts there -- the U.S. government has worked in cooperation to lead the effort to combat Ebola, but that doesn't stop now. We're going to continue to work with the government to ensure that we're providing the opportunities for these educational endeavors to continue so that we're once again helping Liberia to do more to get back on track to overcome their extreme poverty.\nMS. ROSHOLM: All right, and with that we can go ahead and open the line up for questions.\nQ Thank you. My question is what is the U.S. doing currently to provide hygienics or hygiene services for the girls and women in Liberia? That includes sanitary napkins, soap, and gynecological services.\nMS. GOODMAN: So there are several ongoing programs that we have in Liberia that work with young women at all ages. So we have the focus on primary education, and we're expanding our focus on adolescent education.\nSo some of the specific efforts that we have through USAID have focused on ensuring that we do have some programs for water, sanitation and hygiene. And some of the efforts even get into programs that provide reusable sanitary pads for young girls. Poverty is, again, one of the critical issues facing Liberia, so things as simple as having the ability to acquire sanitary napkins and different things that you can use when you're having your menstrual cycle can make all the difference of being able to go to school or whether you're having to stay at home out of school.\nQ Hi, thanks for taking the question. I have two quick ones. Who is paying the expenses for both actresses to join the First Lady on her stops in Africa? And secondly, I was wondering if somebody could just talk a little bit about why the First Lady is going to Spain when the President, as Ben mentioned a little bit ago, will be stopping there in a couple of weeks himself. Thank you.\nMS. TCHEN: So the expenses associated with the CNN documentary are being covered by CNN. So that would include -- for Freida Pinto and Meryl Streep, as well as Isha Sesay.\nAnd Spain for -- much like our trips -- prior trips that included Japan and Cambodia, our trip to the UK, it's an opportunity -- as we did also in Argentina -- to speak to an audience in the developed world about the importance of focusing on the 62 million girls.\nFrom the very beginning, with Let Girls Learn, it has been -- included a prong that was awareness-raising. We have a robust set of efforts here in the United States through Girl Scouts and Girls Inc. and with media partners to elevate the issue of the 62 million girls -- that's why the First Lady was at the Global Citizens concert in New York last September -- so that the developed world -- whether it's the U.S., Spain, Japan, the UK -- that young people here understand the issue confronting the 62 million girls around the world, and take action and use their voices to support them. And that's the message she'll be conveying in her speech in Spain.\nMR. RHODES: I will add to that, Tina, that Spain is a country that the President has not yet visited. It's the largest European country that he has yet to visit. And he felt it was important in his last year to travel to Spain for that purpose, and also because we have worked hard to try to restore greater economic growth to southern Europe, even as, of course, the President has been engaged deeply with northern European countries, including the Nordic countries.\nBut what I'd tell you is that their agendas are very different. The President is going really to discuss our security cooperation, the value of our NATO alliance, the ways in which we cooperate in transatlantic institutions, whereas the First Lady is going with a message focused on what we can do together as a national community to empower women and girls.\nSo they are able to speak to very different issues. And I think that that demonstrates the comprehensive nature of how we approach global engagement. Government-to-government relations are critical. Engagement with publics are critical. And the cooperation on foreign policy and security issues is important, but also benefits from a focus on what we can do in countries or together as developed countries to support women and girls around the world.\nQ Thanks for having the call. Just a couple of basic questions. When is the actual departure date from D.C., and when is the return date? And how many people will be going in Mrs. Obama's party? Lastly, can you all give us a list of all the Let Girls Learn foreign country stops Mrs. Obama has made prior? Thank you.\nMS. TCHEN: So we depart D.C. Sunday morning. We'll return to D.C. Friday evening. I think we'll be in Liberia on Monday and Morocco Tuesday and Wednesday, and Spain Thursday and Friday.\nWe'll get back to you, we can send you the list of the prior trips and the stops. That's probably easier to do on the trip. And I don't -- people traveling with us will be our usual staff of our communications team, our foreign policy team, myself, and just the general support that we have with security. But I don't have a total count for you.\nQ Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my call. Just two quick questions to confirm -- in how many countries does the Let Girls Learn initiative work in? And how many countries has the First Lady in Africa visited as First Lady before this trip?\nMS. TCHEN: As to her prior trips to Africa, we can get that to you separately as well, afterwards. To be clear about Let Girls Learn countries -- so Peace Corps -- one particular program through the Peace Corps of this community-based, community-led effort. And the Peace Corps operates in Let Girls Learn countries -- now in 36 countries.\nWe also -- I mean, I think it's fair to say USAID, the PEPFAR, other U.S. government entities also are doing girls' education projects. So Let Girls Learn is the -- we've announced initiatives in the Congo, we've announced initiatives in Pakistan, in Malawi, Tanzania. We've also announced cooperative efforts with donor countries, developed countries, and we've done that so far with Japan, the United Kingdom, Canada, South Korea and in the most recent trip with the Nordic -- state visit by the Nordic countries that Ben referenced, we collectively made commitments to work together on girls' education.\nMS. ROSHOLM: All right, and with that, we are at 4:00 and we are out of time. But if anyone has any additional questions, if you want to go ahead and email those again to FirstLadyPress@who.eop.gov, we'd be happy to take them there. And I will get back to our questions on Africa trips and other countries we've visited as part of Let Girls Learn.\nThank you guys so much for joining, and we'll talk to you soon.", "timestamp": "2016-06-24", "title": "Press Call by Tina Tchen, Chief of Staff to the First Lady, Ben Rhodes, Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications, and Mary Beth Goodman, Senior Director for Development and Democracy at the National Security Council on the First Lady's Let Girls Learn Trip to Liberia, Morocco, and Spain"}
{"author": "Joe Biden", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=121177", "text": "THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hello, hello, hello. (Applause.) Taoiseach, thank you for only for being here, but being my friend. I truly appreciate it.\nThank you all for coming out in the rain and the sun and the rain and the sun and the rain and the sun. (Laughter.) I know the Irish never mind a soft rain. But I tell you what, I like the sun even better. (Laughter.)\nAnd thank you to the wonderful line up of musicians and speakers who performed earlier. And thank all of you for sharing your talents and your passions.\nMichael, we did meet before. And it's great to meet you again. And thank you so much for the incredibly moving introduction. Your words are powerful, but quite frankly, the message is even more important.\nAnd, Taoiseach, it's, indeed, wonderful of you spend so much time with me. He's going to be so happy when I go home. (Laughter.) He's been spending about 24/7 with me, but I like Fionnuala even better. (Laughter.) But I'm indebted for your hospitality. I mean that sincerely, and for all you've shown me this week.\nAnd I want to give a special thanks to the Chieftains. (Applause.) They were kind enough to perform for us on Wednesday in Westport, as well. And right in the middle of an incredibly beautiful rendition of \"Foggy Dew,\" a massive cheer went up in the bar. Ireland beat Italy. (Applause.) And the pub broke out in song.\nYou know, the longer I'm here, the more I wonder why in the hell did my relatives ever leave. (Laughter.) You're an incredible, incredible country.\nAnd my entire family here, my five grandchildren, my sister, my brother, my niece, and my sister-in-law. The only two who are not here is my wife, Jill, who is in -- actually, she's now in southern Argentina, working throughout the continent to help promote opportunities for young girls and women. (Applause.)\nAnd by the way, we have an expression back home -- I'm sure there's a better one in Gaelic, but if you saw her you'd know I married way up. I married way up. (Laughter.) Is that a Syracuse jersey, child? All right. That's my alma mater.\nAnyway, a few days ago -- I tell you what, tell her to tell you about Syracuse weather. It's hell. They get about 197 inches of snow a year. It's a great place to be from. (Laughter.)\nA few days ago three generations of my family walked along Garden Street in Ballina, in Mayo. The town that was once home to my great-great-great grandfather, Edward Blewitt and his son, Patrick, my great-great grandfather.\nPatrick, when he was a teenager, went to sea, as they say, became a seaman, traveled to the United States, found a home in my country and returned to Ireland in 1851 to gather up the entire Blewitt family -- mom, dad and eight children.\nThey left Ireland for Liverpool, where they boarded the Excelsior to sail to America. As we Bidens walked Garden Street, my family and I literally wondered what it must have been like to leave everything behind. We imagined attending an American wake -— the last time you'd see your family, your friends, the soil that you love.\nWe imagined writing that first \"Amerikay\" letter -- asking loved ones to join them, yearning for home. One of my great, great uncles wrote the following letter home. He said: \"If there was a road made of furze from America to Ireland, I'd walk it in my bare feet\". I'd walk it in my bare feet. What a plaintive notion.\nTomorrow, we'll wonder the same in County Louth. All right. We're looking for you, man. (Laughter.) We're looking for you. We Bidens are like poor relatives, we show up, we're invited. (Laughter.) We'll visit the church where my great-great grandfather, Owen Finnegan, and his family were baptized. They were in the Cooley Peninsula, down at the very tip, near Carlingford where they made their living from the land and the sea. Later Owen became a shoemaker.\nIn May of 1849, Owen traveled to Newry, where he boarded the Brothers, another ship bound for America. And a year later, Owen's wife, Jane, and their children -- they had at the time, including my great-grandfather James, who was in the census books in New York listed as a blind fiddler -— boarded the Marchioness of Bute to join him.\nFor 60 years, the Blewitts and Finnegans brought Ireland to their home in America. They worked hard. They raised their families. But they never, never, never forgot where they came from. Every time I'd walk out the door, my Grandfather Finnegan would say, not a joke, Joe, remember, the best drop of blood in you is Irish. He'd never been to Ireland. (Laughter.)\nIn Scranton, Pennsylvania, by 1909, my grandparents, Ambrose Finnegan and Geraldine Blewitt, met and married. It was in Scranton, where Catherine Eugenia Finnegan, our mother, was born and later married my father Joseph R. Biden, Sr., whose saving grace was that on his mother's side there was a Hanafee from Galway. (Laughter.) Otherwise, my Grandfather Biden -- they'd ask my Grandpop Biden, they'd say, what kind of name is Biden? He'd say, Dutch. It's English. Full confession. Bless me father, for I have sinned. (Laughter.)\nBut it was in Scranton where I were born that I inherited my mother's side of the family's overwhelming pride in being Irish, a pride that spoke to both continents, a heart and soul that drew from the old and new.\nMy great-grandfather was the first Irish-Catholic state senator, they say -- I can't prove that -- in Pennsylvania, Edward Francis Blewitt. He had an engineering degree from Lafayette College, but he had a poet's heart.\nIn 1919, one of the over hundred poems he wrote, had the following lines, speaking of \"his Ireland\". He said:\n\"From the fairest land, except my own,\n'Neath sun or star or moon,\nthe citadel of Liberty,\nMy mother's land, aroon.\"\nThat pride has been passed down in every generation in our family. And my mother imbued in her children and her grandchildren an absolute certitude that they were equal -- and I mean this sincerely -- they were equal to any man or woman on Earth; and that everyone was our equal, deserving of dignity. (Applause.)\nLadies and gentlemen, that's the passion. And with regard to my introduction, I'll never forget the first time I was in high school being dropped off at the city building to make out an application to be a lifeguard in the city swimming pools in the downtown corporate center of my state. And two men, very well dressed at the corner, leaned over and kissed one another, this was 1959 or '60, and walked their separate ways. And I looked back at my dad. I'll never forget what he said. He said, Joey, it's easy, they love one another. That was the essence of it. (Applause.)\nSo that passion that built both of our nations and that runs through the bloodstream of Irish and Irish Americans; our nations have always had a deep spark; linked in memory, imagination;\njoined by our histories and equally as important, as the Taoiseach and I talk about all the time, by our futures.\nEverything between us runs deep -- literature, poetry, sadness and joy, but most of all, resilience. Despite everything, we've never stopped being dreamers. I think we Irish are the only people in the world who are actually nostalgic about the future. (Laughter.) You think I'm kidding. Think about it. (Laughter.)\nWe're defined by a common creed that says to our children if they work hard, if they're loyal, they can live a better life than the generation before them.\nMy mother used to have an expression -- she said, Joey, courage is the greatest virtue because without courage, you cannot love with abandon, and without being able to love with abandon, you can never be who you might be. It's defined by a simple, simple belief that we share that anything, anything, anything is possible -- a belief shared by the vast majority of immigrant families that have come to the United States from all other parts of the world.\nThat's what I'd like to spend a few minutes talking about just for a second, our shared values. As Ireland marks the centennial of the Easter Rising of 1916, I'm reminded of a line in Yeat's poem that describes, I think, our world today better than it described his Ireland on Easter, 1916. And you'll all remember the line. He said, \"All's changed, changed utterly. A terrible beauty has been born.\"\nIn the past 15 years, all has changed in the world. We've seen more changes and challenges and more opportunities than any time since World War II, and maybe before. In this age of instant hyper-connectivity, instant communication, violence and turmoil in any part of the world once unseen now appears on your cell phone instantaneously. Mass migration. War. Terrorism. Infectious disease. Climate Change. Economic unease and anxiety, and the inevitable human reaction of frustration and anger.\nAll this provides fertile terrain for reactionary politicians and demagogues peddling xenophobia, nationalism and isolationism. We see it in Europe. We see it in other parts of the world. And we see it in my home country, where some politicians find it convenient to scapegoat immigrants\ninstead of welcoming them; to play to our fears -- (applause) -- rather than, as Abraham Lincoln said, appeal to our better angels; divide us based on religion or ethnicity rather than unite us on our common humanity; build walls instead of bridges. It has been un-American what we have been seeing. (Applause.)\nIt's not -- and I'm here to tell you it's not who we have become. It is not who we are. At the same time, here in this beautiful castle ground -- so long the symbolic center of British occupation and oppression of Ireland -- we're also reminded that people everywhere share the same basic desires, a yearning to breathe free, to be able to express themselves, to follow their own North Star.\nWe remember that all men and women on Earth are equal in human dignity, something President Higgins and I had a long talk about on Wednesday. So today, perhaps more than ever, our two nations' longstanding commitment to global peacekeeping and humanitarian efforts stand as an example to the world. And as partners in the 66-nation coalition to defeat and ultimately destroy ISIL, Ireland and the United States are working side-by-side not only to counter ISIL's ideology of hate and destruction, but to address the largest humanitarian and refugee crisis since World War II.\nOn the economic front, our partnership has helped both our nations navigate the global economic crisis and emerge stronger and more resilient. We want to keep growing the economic partnership between the United States and Ireland, between the United States and the European Union -- already the largest economic relationship in the world. Of course, yesterday, the majority of the British people voted to leave the European Union. And as longstanding friends of the United Kingdom, the United States respects their decision -- not how we would have preferred it to be, but respect their position.\nOur relationship with the United Kingdom and with our allies across Europe are indispensable for America's economic as well as national security. So as the leadership in London and Brussels determines what this new relationship will look like, we will continue to work with our partners to navigate a new road ahead while continuing to promote stability, security and prosperity around the world.\nIn this complex age, with the constant pull between the challenges as well as the opportunities, it's important as ever to remember who we are as nations -- we are both self-reflective. We have both been self-critical. And we're both self-corrective.\nTerrible things have happened in both Ireland and America over the years -- war, civil unrest, racial and religious discrimination. But our nations are places where hope reigns. I was asked by President Xi, I told the Taoiseach -- I've gotten to know him better than most because I've spent more time with him than any world leader, for real. (Laughter.) I was in a town called Chengdu that went from 4 million, Father, to 20 million people on the Tibetan plane. We were having -- one of -- the State Department tells me I've had 25 hours of private dinners with him, he and each of us with an interpreter.\nAnd he looked at me and he asked me a question. He said, Mr. Vice President, can you define America for me? And I said, yes I can, in one word -- and I meant it -- possibilities. Possibilities. What is that notion if not an Irish notion? What is that notion if not the cause of the overwhelming resilience of the people of Ireland?\nSo it's up to us in the States to remember, we meant what we said in our Declaration. We said, \"We hold these truths self-evident that all men are created equal.\" And in your 1916 Proclamation, the commitment to cherish \"all of the children of the nation equally.\" Both these notions are grounded -- (applause) -- they're not empty words on a page. Both these notions are grounded in equal rights, equal opportunity, religious and civil liberty for everyone. And both our nations have striven -- as the American founders put it -- to form a more perfect union.\nWe have a hell of a lot further to go. But as Martin Luther King said, the arc of history bends towards justice. And it's toward that more perfect union that tomorrow in Dublin you will host one of the largest pride parades in the world. (Applause.) Now it's up to us, as nations where same-sex marriage is proudly legal, to stand up for the civil liberties and civil rights of LGBT brothers and sisters, wherever they live, in whatever part of the world in which they live. (Applause.) There cannot be any cultural justification for denial of human rights.\nIn America and Ireland, we have to remember that we are a nation of Immigrants and of emigrants -- with an \"i\" and with an \"e.\" In the face of rising xenophobia, we have to remember the dreams of our ancestors who left aboard ships that ended up, for many, coffins. Our great-great-grandparents, and grandparents who made it -- but when they made it they were initially turned away. It wasn't like they found Shangri-la. They were turned away.\nI was telling the Taoiseach, in our second campaign for President and Vice President, I was in a town called Pueblo, Colorado -- overwhelmingly Hispanic. And I was with one of the leading Hispanics, a former senator and then Secretary of the Interior, who was about to introduce me in his home state. And a wealthy fellow had come in and bought the old Pueblo railroad station that was built in the 1860s, and completely restored it to its original state. And Senator Salazar, my friend, was telling me, you have to understand, Joe, those 30,000 people waiting out there, they like you because of your commitment to equality. But, Joe, you have to understand they've been through a rough period, not being accepted.\nAnd while I was doing this, having this conversation, I looked around this beautifully restored waiting room. It was about 50 by 50, maybe a little -- 50 feet by 50 feet. And on each wall there were three plaques that were about two feet long and a foot high. And on every plaque, it said -- as I pointed to him -- I said, I understand. And I pointed -- it said, \"No Irish Allowed.\" So people did not find Navarra when they came to America.\nWe have to remember how a Catholic-American President, who returned to his homeland 50 years ago last month, and was attacked for being too close to a Pope. But there is progress. As a Catholic-American Vice President, who's established and fully embraced for the world to see, a friendship with a present Pope, and no one says anything other than hurrah. (Applause.) There is progress.\nWe are the most independent peoples on Earth, but we are sustained by a heart and the foresight to lead and lend a hand to people who are in need, who were where we used to be. We're sustained by a spirit of resilience, grit and determination, and tolerance. I'm reminded of that every day. My son Beau -- of Irish blood -- passed away a year ago, May 30th. He was the most popular elected political official in my constituency -- for real. After we won reelection, the headline said, \"Biden, Most Popular Politician -- Beau.\" (Laughter.) And I was proud.\nWhen President Obama gave the eulogy for my son, he quoted\nPatrick Kavanagh's \"Raglan Road\" -- and he said, \"And I said let grief be a fallen leaf at the dawning of the day.\" Let grief be a falling leaf at the dawning of the day. That's the Irish of it. That's the Irish of it. (Applause.)\nAnd around the same time, my great-great-grandfather, Owen Finnegan, the shoemaker, boarded the Brothers on May 31, 1844 -- another shoemaker named Joseph Kearny, from Moneygall, sailed aboard the Caroline Reade, arriving in America just five weeks before my great-great-grandfather. It's doubtful they ever knew each another. But one thing we do know -- they left everything behind for an uncertain future. And in all of their dreams could they ever have dreamt that 160 years later, two great-great-grandsons of shoemakers from Ireland would be sworn in as President and Vice President of the United States of America? (Applause.)\nSo, folks, my message is basic. It's up to all of us -- and I mean this sincerely -- to keep that sense of possibility for every man, and woman, and child who gives up everything in search of a better life -- give them a chance in the dawn of a new day.\nThat's been our history. It's our present. And if we're lucky, it will be our future. A thousand thanks to all of you. Your generosity has been heartwarming. And as I said, I don't know why the hell my ancestors ever left. (Applause.) Thank you all so very much. (Applause.)", "timestamp": "2016-06-24", "title": "Remarks by the Vice President to the Irish People in Dublin"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=121467", "text": "~ First National Monument Honoring LGBT Rights ~\n\"We, the people, declare today that the most evident of truths –- that all of us are created equal –- is the star that guides us still; just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls, and Selma, and Stonewall; just as it guided all those men and women, sung and unsung, who left footprints along this great Mall, to hear a preacher say that we cannot walk alone; to hear a King proclaim that our individual freedom is inextricably bound to the freedom of every soul on Earth. It is now our generation's task to carry on what those pioneers began.\" - President Barack Obama, 2013 Inaugural Address\nSince taking office, President Obama and his Administration have made historic strides in expanding opportunities and advancing equality and justice for all Americans, including lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) Americans. From major legislative achievements to historic court victories to important policy changes, the President has fought to promote the equal rights of all Americans — no matter who they are or who they love. That commitment to leveling the playing field and ensuring equal protection under the law is the bedrock principle this nation was founded on and has guided the President's actions in support of all Americans.\nToday, President Obama will designate a new national monument at the historic site of the Stonewall Uprising in New York City to honor the broad movement for LGBT equality. The new Stonewall National Monument will protect the area where, on June 28, 1969, a community's uprising in response to a police raid sparked the modern LGBT civil rights movement in the United States.\nThe designation will create the first official National Park Service unit dedicated to telling the story of LGBT Americans, just days before the one year anniversary of the landmark Supreme Court decision guaranteeing marriage equality in all 50 states. Additionally, in celebration of the designation and New York City's Pride festival, the White House, in coordination with the National Park Foundation and the Outdoor Advertising Association of America, is releasing a video that will be played on the billboards in Times Square on Saturday, June 25, beginning at 12:00pm ET.\nThe new Stonewall National Monument will permanently protect Christopher Park, a historic community park at the intersection of Christopher Street, West 4th Street and Grove Street directly across from the Stonewall Inn in Manhattan's Greenwich Village. The monument's boundary encompasses approximately 7.7 acres of land, including Christopher Park, the Stonewall Inn, and the surrounding streets and sidewalks that were the site of the 1969 Stonewall Uprising.\nToday's designation follows years of strong support from local officials, organizations, members of Congress and citizens in New York City and across the country, as demonstrated recently at a public meeting held in New York City in May. The National Park Foundation is also today announcing that it will support the establishment of a local Friends Group to support the monument and that it will work with local and national organizations and the community to raise funding for dedicated National Park Service personnel, a temporary ranger station and visitor center, research and materials, exhibits, community outreach, and public education.\nThe Stonewall Uprising\nOn June 28, 1969, the Stonewall Inn, one of the most frequented LGBT bars in the city, was raided by the New York City Police Department to enforce a law that made it illegal to sell alcoholic drinks to \"homosexuals.\" Customers and their allies resisted the police by refusing to show identification or go into a bathroom so that a police officer could verify their sex, and a crowd gathered outside. As word spread, the gathering grew in size and a riot ultimately ensued. Within days, Stonewall seemed to galvanize LGBT communities across the country, with LGBT activists organizing demonstrations to show support for LGBT rights in several cities. These events, which are now often referred to as the Stonewall Uprising, are widely considered to be a watershed moment when the LGBT community across the nation demonstrated its power to join together and demand equality and respect.\nAlthough the LGBT civil rights movement has made significant progress in the pursuit of equal rights and protections under the law, there is still more work to do. As seen two weeks ago in Orlando, FL, LGBT Americans continue to face acts of violence, discrimination, and hate. LGBT people of color are especially at risk. The Administration is committed to continuing the fight for dignity, acceptance and equal rights for all Americans — no matter who they are or who they love.\nAbout President Obama's Record and the LGBT Community\nIn addition to protecting more land and water than any President in history – more than 265 million acres – President Obama has sought to protect places that are diverse, culturally and historically significant, and that reflect the story of all Americans. By honoring the history and accomplishments of the movement for LGBT equality, today's designation will be a historic moment in this effort towards a more inclusive National Park System.\nUnder President Obama's leadership, there have also been other efforts to recognize historic sites associated with LGBT Americans. In May 2014, the Department of the Interior announced that the National Park Service would begin a LGBT theme study and since then, a number of LGBT sites have been designated as a National Historic Landmark or listed on the National Register of Historic Places:\n•     Dr. Franklin E. Kameny Residence in Washington, DC (November 2, 2011)\n•     James Merrill House in Stonington, CT (August 28, 2013)\n•     Carrington House in Fire Island Pine, NY (January 8, 2014)\n•     Cherry Grove Community House & Theater in Cherry Grove, NY (June 4, 2014)\n•     Bayard Rustin Residence in New York, NY (March 8, 2016)\n•     Julius' Bar in New York NY (April 20, 2016)\n•     The Furies Collective house in Washington, DC (May 5, 2016)\n•     Edificio Comunidad de Orgullo Gay de Puerto Rico (commonly known as Casa Orguillo, or Pride House) in San Juan, Puerto Rico (May 5, 2016)\n•     Henry Gerber House in Chicago, IL (June 9, 2015)\nThe progress achieved over the last seven years mirrors the changing views of the American people, who recognize that fairness and justice demand equality for all, including LGBT Americans. The Obama Administration's record on social progress and equality includes:\n•     Preventing Hate Crimes: Overcoming years of partisan gridlock, the President worked with Congress to pass and sign into law the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act into law in October 2009, which extends the coverage of Federal hate crimes law to include attacks based on the victim's actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity.\n•     Expanding Same-Sex Domestic Partner Benefits: In June 2009, President Obama issued a directive on same-sex domestic partner benefits, opening the door for the State Department to extend the full range of legally available benefits and allowances to same-sex domestic partners of members of the Foreign Service sent to serve abroad. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) also expanded federal benefits for same-sex partners of federal employees and allowed same-sex domestic partners to apply for long-term care insurance.\n•     Ending Discrimination in Healthcare: In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was signed into law by President Obama and ensures that Americans have secure, stable, and affordable insurance. Insurance companies are no longer able to discriminate against anyone due to a pre-existing condition, and because of the law, insurers can no longer turn someone away just because he or she is lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. The Affordable Care Act also makes it easier for people living with HIV and AIDS to obtain Medicaid and private health insurance and overcome barriers to care from qualified providers. HHS now requires all hospitals receiving Medicare or Medicaid funds – just about every hospital in America – to allow visitation rights for LGBT patients. The President also directed HHS to ensure that medical decision-making rights of LGBT patients are respected.\n•     HIV/AIDS Strategy: President Obama developed and released the first comprehensive National HIV/AIDS Strategy for the United States in 2010, updated it through 2020, and is implementing it to address the disparities faced especially by gay and bisexual men of all races and ethnicities and transgender women of color.\n•     Repealing Don't Ask Don't Tell: The President signed bipartisan legislation to repeal Don't Ask Don't Tell on December 22, 2010, allowing gay, lesbian, and bisexual Americans to serve openly in the Armed Forces without fear of being dismissed from service because of who they are and who they love, and putting in motion the end of a discriminatory policy that ran counter to American values.\n•     Ending the Legal Defense of the Defense of Marriage Act: In February 2011, the President and Attorney General announced that the Department of Justice would no longer defend the Defense of Marriage Act's provision defining marriage under federal law as only between a man and woman, a provision subsequently struck down as unconstitutional by a landmark Supreme Court's decision.\n•     Recognizing the Rights of Same-Sex Couples After ‘Windsor' Decision: After the United States v. Windsor decision, in which the Supreme Court held that Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act was unconstitutional, the President instructed the Cabinet to review over 1,000 federal statutes and regulations to ensure the decision was implemented swiftly and smoothly by the federal government to recognize the rights of same-sex couples.\n•     Constitutional Guarantee of Marriage Equality: The Administration has long advocated for a Constitutional guarantee of marriage equality for same-sex couples—a position the Supreme Court vindicated in its historic decision in Obergefell v. Hodges. In October 2015, after the Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced proposed regulations implementing the Supreme Court's same-sex marriage decision for federal tax purposes to ensure all individuals would be treated equally under the law. And the Social Security Administration (SSA) began to recognize all valid same-sex marriages for purposes of determining entitlement to Social Security benefits or eligibility for Supplemental Security Income. SSA continues to work closely with the LGBT advocacy community to conduct outreach to ensure that same-sex couples are aware of how same-sex marriage affects benefits.\n•     Prohibiting LGBT Discrimination for Federal Contractors: In July 2014, the President signed an Executive Order prohibiting federal contractors from discriminating against any employee or applicant for employment \"because of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin,\" continuing to set an example as a model employer that does right by its employees.\n•     Supporting Efforts to Ban \"Conversion Therapy\": The President has supported legislative efforts to ban the use of so-called \"conversion therapy\" against minors and released a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) study condemning the practice. This report, which was developed in collaboration with the American Psychological Association and a panel of behavioral health experts, is the first federal in-depth review of conversion therapy. As SAMHSA reported, variations in sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression are normal. Conversion therapy is not effective, reinforces harmful gender stereotypes, and is not an appropriate mental health treatment.\n•     Protecting the Rights of Transgender Americans: The Administration has taken unprecedented steps to protect and promote the rights of transgender and gender non-conforming Americans. These actions have included the release of joint guidance from the U.S. Departments of Education and Justice to provide educators with the information they requested to ensure that all students, including transgender students, can attend school in an environment free from discrimination. These actions also include the issuance of guidance from the Department of Justice that concluded that the prohibition against sex discrimination in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 encompasses claims of discrimination on the basis of gender identity, including transgender status. Additionally, agencies, including OPM, the State Department, SSA, and HHS, took various actions to ensure that transgender Americans were treated fairly and without discrimination in the workplace, in official documents, and in the health care system.\n•     Promoting the Rights of LGBT People Around the World: The Obama Administration continues to engage systematically with governments around the world to advance the rights of LGBT persons. President Obama issued a presidential memorandum that directs all Federal agencies engaged abroad to ensure that U.S. diplomacy and foreign assistance promote and protect the human rights of LGBT persons. And, in February 2015, the U.S. State Department appointed the first-ever Special Envoy for the Human Rights of LGBTI Persons to lead and coordinate U.S. diplomatic efforts to advance LGBTI rights around the globe.", "timestamp": "2016-06-24", "title": "Press Release - President Obama Designates Stonewall National Monument"}

Following his historic 2009 Cairo speech, President Obama elevated innovation and entrepreneurship in the U.S. engagement agenda and hosted the first GES at the White House in 2010. The United States has made significant strides in supporting entrepreneurship around the world by developing innovative ecosystems; advocating for stronger business climates through rule of law and transparent business conduct; catalyzing capital; building networks of innovators; promoting entrepreneurship for women, youth, and marginalized communities; and partnering with the private sector to expand impact.\nWith the eyes of the world on Silicon Valley, today the Obama Administration is announcing new commitments to advance entrepreneurship around the world. These announcements build on a week where the Administration has highlighted a powerful record of progress in fueling American innovation over the last seven and a half years and announcing major new steps we are taking to build on those efforts—including supporting advanced manufacturing and making, laying the groundwork for smart and connected cities, supporting next-generation technologies, and promoting inclusive entrepreneurship and innovation here at home.\nGES 2016 has brought the best entrepreneurs and investors from 170 countries to the birthplace of modern innovation, highlighting that the dynamic enterprises driving new solutions can be found in every corner of the world. The summit convenes approximately 1,200 outstanding entrepreneurs and investors from across the world for dynamic, outcome-oriented sessions; mentoring; and opportunities to showcase their work. The summit showcases how investors and entrepreneurs from around the world are embracing the culture of entrepreneurship far beyond Silicon Valley.\nGES has become a preeminent annual gathering that provides emerging entrepreneurs with exceptional networking, insight, and investment opportunities. During Indian Prime Minister Modi's visit to the White House on June 7, President Obama and Prime Minister Modi were pleased to  announce India as the host of the 2017 Global Entrepreneurship Summit, becoming the seventh country to host the event.\nThe President signed an Executive Order to institutionalize key entrepreneurship programs of his Administration in recognition of the fact that entrepreneurship is a hallmark of American leadership in the world. The President also will speak to U.S. government commitments and highlight private sector announcements that will provide entrepreneurs across the globe new opportunities for capital and mentorship, build their networks, and gain skills that will help their companies grow and thrive. The President will place a special emphasis on supporting youth, women, and minority entrepreneurs as drivers of innovation and investment in their home communities.\nU.S. Government Commitment to Global Entrepreneurship\nThe U.S. Government is committing significant new resources to advance entrepreneurship around the world:\n•      President Obama signed an Executive Order institutionalizing programs that support entrepreneurship around the world, including the Presidential Ambassadors for Global Entrepreneurship, the Global Entrepreneurship Summit, and the Global Connect Initiative.\n•      USAID's Power Africa initiative launched the Scaling Off Grid Energy Grand Challenge for Development that will invest $36m in promising enterprises, innovative technologies, and partnerships with local stakeholders to scale up clean energy solutions to reach millions of households that live beyond the reach of the electricity grid. This effort will bring together entrepreneurs, investors, philanthropists, and governments to support the growth of innovative ventures that are making off-grid solutions affordable for rural families and catalyze private investment to help these enterprises reach new markets.\n•      President Obama will announce the launch of an effort to encourage greater investments in small-scale clean energy entrepreneurs from developing countries. The Administration will identify and highlight entrepreneurs working to provide affordable, reliable, and significantly scalable on-grid or off-grid energy solutions that meet the renewable energy and energy efficiency needs of individuals, enterprises, and communities in the developing world, and in particular in sub-Saharan Africa. Entrepreneurs will be identified and highlighted from the large cadre of energy innovators, researchers and partner institutions in the developing world that have worked with U.S. Government entities, including USAID, the Departments of Defense and Energy, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and the U.S. Trade and Development Agency.\n•      The Administration will facilitate opportunities for leading clean energy investors to evaluate and consider providing seed funding and similar investments to these entrepreneurs. Building in part on the work and vision of the Breakthrough Energy Coalition (BEC), launched in Paris last year, a number of BEC members and other leading international investors have agreed to support this effort by working with the US Government to develop a process to consider potential investments. These investors include Aliko Dangote, Bill Gates, Paul G. Allen (Vulcan Capital), Strive Maisiyiwa, Matt Rogers and Swati Mylavarapu, Nat Simons and Laura Baxter-Simons (Prelude Ventures), Dipender Saluja (Capricorn Investment Group), Tom Steyer, and Mark Zuckerberg. The first round of the Administration's work on this initiative will be completed by November 1.\n•      The U.S. Department of State and Kiva, the world's largest crowdfunding platform for loans, have joined forces to launch the Women's Entrepreneurship Fund, which aims to help crowdfund loans to one million women entrepreneurs over the next five years. The Fund has a special focus on women entrepreneurs in the growth phases, offering loans greater than the average microfinance loan. To date, an estimated $500,000 has been pledged with commitments from corporations and foundations.\n•      USAID announced its Feed the Future Call for Cool Storage Solutions. Through a competitive call for innovations, USAID will provide up to $2.5 million in funding and mentoring to entrepreneurs to help them adapt, pilot and scale their proven cool storage solutions to prevent food loss and waste in countries where the U.S. Government's Feed the Future initiative focuses efforts. This call will expand the impact of USAID's investment by catalyzing private investment that strengthens food chains between farms and markets.\n•      President Obama will speak to the Young Transatlantic Innovation Leaders Initiative (YTILI) to develop entrepreneurial skills and enhance economic opportunities for young professionals across Europe. To counter the challenges of inclusion and integration facing European youth, YTILI will support European entrepreneurs by offering training and exchanges, and building a European-Transatlantic network. YTILI will bring 200 Fellows to the United States in 2017. This is the fourth regional program within the U.S. Government's Young Leaders Initiatives.\n•      To connect America's top technologists and innovators with entrepreneurs in Africa, USAID and 500 Startups announced they will bring the Geeks on a Plane tour to Sub-Sahara Africa for the first time in March 2017. The 11-day trip to Accra, Lagos, Cape Town and Johannesburg will engage with African entrepreneurs and innovators and explore partnership and investment opportunities. The trip will culminate with the 2017 Global Entrepreneur Congress in Johannesburg.\n•      The State Department's International Visitor Leadership Program will host an exchange program for government technology leaders and their private-sector partners from more than a dozen countries this fall. Participants will take part in a design sprint developed in partnership with the U.S. Digital Service, the Presidential Innovation Fellows, and 18F. After traveling to cities around the U.S., including San Francisco, to look at how governments at the city, state, and federal level are partnering with the tech sector, they will return home and drive digital transformation within their governments to better tackle policy challenges and deliver improved services to citizens.\n•      The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office at the Department of Commerce launched its online Global Entrepreneurship Portal to provide U.S. innovators and business the knowledge, tools, and guards necessary to protect their technologies, and navigate intellectual property regimes in foreign countries, as they scale their businesses across borders and markets. The Global Entrepreneurship Portal will arm innovators – from solo inventors to Fortune 500 companies -- with tools to facilitate exports and empower global expansions.\n•      U.S. development and financing agencies have surpassed the $1 billion mark over the past year in financing and investment for global ICT and connectivity projects, bringing Internet access to millions around the world. These efforts represent the Administration's commitment to closing the digital divide and bring an additional 1.5 billion people online by 2020 through the Global Connect Initiative [https://share.america.gov/globalconnect/].\nPrivate Sector Impact\nAt GES 2016, private sector companies around the world announced initiatives that support to the next generation of entrepreneurs through capital mentorship and training, ecosystem support, and research:\nCapital Commitments\n•      CalPERS—California announced that they will open up an $11 billion global solicitation for new emerging manager investment strategies. This will identify early funds that include international investments in global entrepreneurs with strong potential for success; accessing unique investment opportunities that may otherwise be overlooked; and cultivating the next generation of external portfolio management talent.\n•      Endeavor, an organization that supports entrepreneurs around the world, launched a $100 million co-investment fund -- Endeavor Catalyst II -- to invest in high-growth companies across Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia. Endeavor Catalyst II is a commitment by Endeavor and private sector leaders to support projects across the globe over the next four years. To date the fund has $30 million in pre-commitments.\n•      Capria Ventures, the first global business accelerator for impact fund managers, announced the launch of the Capria Emerging Managers Fund, a $100M venture fund that will invest in fund managers who have compelling investment programs targeting entrepreneurs in emerging economies across Africa, Central and South America, and South and Southeast Asia. Capria has also selected its next cohort of fund managers who will come to a multi-week acceleration program later this year.\n•      The Draper Richards Kaplan Foundation announced the launch of a new fund totaling $65 million to find, fund and support 100 early stage, high impact social enterprises that are tackling some of the world's most challenging problems in our world, including access to healthcare, education, poverty alleviation, opportunity equality, social justice, and the environment.\n•      The SDG Philanthropy Platform [sdgfunders.org], an initiative of Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors, UNDP, and the Foundation Center, announced an initiative launching in India later this year that focuses on women's empowerment through entrepreneurship, mobilizing at least $500,000 in financial contributions within the next six months. The Platform will engage philanthropy more deeply on the Sustainable Development Goals by partnering with governments, the United Nations, philanthropy, civil society, and business.\n•      NOW Ventures (NOW) is a new venture capital platform that will invest in, enable and amplify early stage startups that deliver positive social benefits alongside competitive financial returns. NOW launched the first ever use of AngelList to support impactful and mission-driven founders through a dedicated syndicate. NOW will mobilize early stage funding, with the first phase targeting forty investments of $200,000 each. Each founder will receive mentoring and be featured on AngelList.\n•      Obvious Ventures, an early-stage venture capital firm focused on investing in entrepreneurs who are passionate about solving the systemic challenges of our time, awarded a GES delegate a $50,000 #worldpositive prize to a business that every dollar of profit made aligns with a mission driven purpose.\nMentorship and Training Commitments\n•      1776, in partnership with Dell, launched Union to empower entrepreneurs around the world by connecting the global startup economy. Accessible through the Startup Federation -- a worldwide network of startup campuses and mega-hubs -- or virtually for entrepreneurs in remote areas, Union will provide entrepreneurs anywhere in the world the ability to reach the people, resources and education they need to take their ideas from seed to scale. Union is available via a mobile app and web tool, enabling entrepreneurs at all stages of growth to tap into the resources they need to scale and succeed no matter what city or country they live in.\n•      The World Bank launched the Women for Resilience Initiative to strengthen the entrepreneurial capabilities of women entrepreneurs from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region in the resilience value chain by providing them with funding and business support services. The program connects and trains women from across MENA and creates a vibrant community of leaders of tomorrow who will positively impact the region and the world.\n•      Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship (PAGE) Antonio Gracias launched ADELANTE, an international exchange program for Cuban entrepreneurs. This program provides emerging Cuban entrepreneurs with an opportunity to visit the U.S., meet and exchange ideas with U.S. entrepreneurs, network with business leaders, and receive relevant training. By building connections between entrepreneurs in Cuba and the United States, Adelante seeks to foster a closer relationship between the people of the two countries.\n•      The KIND Foundation, in partnership with Venture for America, announced that it will host its first Entrepreneur Summit. The convening, which will take place during National Entrepreneurship Month, aims to support aspiring and early stage entrepreneurs in building businesses that are not only economically sustainable but also socially impactful.\n•      Affinis Labs announced Rising Margins, a series of hackathons and training sessions to support entrepreneurship and job creation for socioeconomically disadvantaged communities around the world. The initiative seeks to broaden economic inclusivity by empowering communities as grassroots drivers -- not simply beneficiaries -- of economic growth.\nEcosystem Support Initiatives\n•      IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, announced the \"Startup Catalyst\" initiative that will invest in accelerators and seed funds to support innovation ecosystems in emerging economies. Startup Catalyst aims to support and invest in seed funding mechanisms around the world to help build innovation ecosystems that support entrepreneurship and create jobs in developing countries. The first three Startup Catalyst initiative investments include Flat6Labs, a Cairo-based accelerator supporting technology startups throughout Egypt; CRE, a Sub-Saharan focused seed fund investing in visionary entrepreneurs; and 500 Mexico City, an accelerator working to spur the growth of technology startups across Latin America.\nResearch Initiatives\n•      RippleWorks released the \"The Human Capital Crisis: How Social Enterprises Can Find the Talent to Scale\" report. Through analysis of 628 entrepreneurs around the world and interviews with more than 40 organizations, the report found that human capital, not funding, is the biggest challenge as companies grow. This study provides new insights and actionable recommendations for how social entrepreneurs and impact investors can scale their businesses and their impact, and underscores the need for seasoned entrepreneurs from Silicon Valley and beyond to become more actively engaged in supporting the development of social enterprises.\n•      Silicon Valley Bank released their StartupOutlook 2016 survey that focused on women achieving leadership positions and women leadership programs in companies in the United States, United Kingdom, and China. The report showed that 46 percent of U.S. technology and life science companies had no women in executive positions, and 66 percent had no women on their boards of directors.", "timestamp": "2016-06-24", "title": "Fact Sheet: Global Entrepreneurship Summit"}

Everybody, have a seat. Thank you so much. Well, this is a good-looking group. Thank you.\nWell, first of all, let me thank President Hennessy for the introduction, and the entire Stanford family for letting us take over the campus for a few days. As some of you know, John is stepping down after 16 years as president of Stanford. Fortunately for me, I cannot do that, to just stick around longer than my term limit. John, I'm sure there are some people who want you to stick around longer, but I've—I'm confident that you're going to do extraordinary things. And we could not be prouder of John Hennessy and Stanford and all the great work that they have done. So please give him a big round of applause.\nNow, it's summer break. Just so all of you know, Stanford is not always this quiet. This school is unique. Folks ride on bicycles everywhere. [Laughter] And athletes are also computer engineers. This is the place that made \"nerd\" cool. [Laughter] So we are thrilled to be here.\nI know that I am not the first speaker that you've heard from. But many of you have traveled here from a long ways. We've got more than 170 countries from every region of the world represented. Some of you, this is the first time you are visiting our country. So let me just say, on behalf of the American people, not only welcome to our Global Entrepreneurship Summit, but welcome to the United States of America. We are glad to have you.\nUnited Kingdom's European Union Membership Referendum\nI am not going to give a long speech, because what I really want to do is have a conversation with some outstanding young people who are part of our panel and we're going to introduce in a moment. But I do want to begin by offering some opening thoughts about the time in which we gather here today. And I'm going to start with the British people's decision to leave the European Union, the vote that took place yesterday.\nJust a few hours ago, I spoke with Prime Minister David Cameron. David has been an outstanding friend and partner on the global stage. And based on our conversation, I'm confident that the U.K. is committed to an orderly transition out of the EU. We agreed that our economic and financial teams will remain in close contact as we stay focused on ensuring economic growth and financial stability. I then spoke to Chancellor Merkel of Germany, and we agreed that the United States and our European allies will work closely together in the weeks and months ahead.\nI do think that yesterday's vote speaks to the ongoing changes and challenges that are raised by globalization. But while the U.K.'s relationship with the EU will change, one thing that will not change is the special relationship that exists between our two nations. That will endure. The EU will remain one of our indispensable partners. Our NATO alliance will remain a cornerstone of global security. And in a few weeks, we'll be meeting in Warsaw for the NATO summit. And our shared values—including our commitment to democracy and pluralism and opportunity for all people in a globalized world—that will continue to unite all of us. And that is the work that brings us here today. Global Entrepreneurship\nThe world has shrunk. It is interconnected. All of you represent that interconnection. Many of you are catalyzing it and accelerating it. It promises to bring extraordinary benefits. But it also has challenges. And it also evokes concerns and fears. And so part of why this Global Entrepreneurship Summit has been so close to my heart, something that I've been so committed to, is because I believe all of you represent all the upside of an interconnected world, all the optimism and the hope and the opportunity that that interconnected world represents.\nBut it's also important in these discussions to find ways in which we are expanding and broadening the benefits of that interconnection to more and more people. And that's what so many of you are doing.\nWe're gathered here at Stanford, in the heart of Silicon Valley, which is one of the great hubs of innovation and entrepreneurship not just for America, but for the world. This is a place that celebrates our ability as human beings to discover and learn and to build, to question, to reimagine, to create new ways to connect and work with each other.\nIt's where two guys in a garage, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, launched a global company; where student projects became Yahoo! and Google. Those were really good student projects. [Laughter] My student projects weren't as good. [Laughter] It's where entrepreneurs like so many of you get an idea, and you build a team, and you work to turn it into reality, and you launch products and companies and entire industries that transform the world. That's the power of entrepreneurship. And it's never been more important.\nIn today's world, where our economies have undergone dramatic shifts, where businesses don't stop at borders, where technology and automation have transformed virtually every industry and changed how people organize and work, entrepreneurship remains the engine of growth. That ability to turn an idea into a reality—a new venture, a small business—that creates good-paying jobs; it puts rising economies on the path to prosperity, and empowers people to come together and tackle our most pressing global problems, from climate change to poverty.\nWhen people can start their own businesses, it helps individuals and families succeed. It can make whole communities more prosperous and more secure. It offers a positive path for young people seeking the chance to make something of themselves and can empower people who have previously been locked out of the existing social order—women and minorities, others who aren't part of the \"old boys\" network—give them a chance to contribute and to lead. And it can create a culture where innovation and creativity are valued, where we don't just look at the way things have always been, but rather we say, how could things be? Why not? Let's make something new.\nThis spirit speaks to something deep inside of all of us, no matter who we are, what we look like, where we come from. You look out across this auditorium, you're all of different backgrounds and cultures and races and religions. Some of you are from teeming cities; others are working in small rural villages. But you have that same spark, that same creative energy to come up with innovative solutions to old challenges. And entrepreneurship is what gives people like you a chance to fulfill your own dreams and create something bigger than yourselves.\nWe live in a time when more than half the world is under the age of 30. And that means we've got to make sure that all of our young people around the world have the tools they need to start new ventures and to create the jobs of the 21st century and to help lift up entire populations. And so many of you are already doing this. As I travel around the world, one of the extraordinary things that I have the opportunity to do is to meet young people in every region and to see the problem-solving and the energy and optimism that they're bringing to everything from how to generate electricity in environmentally sound ways in remote places that are off the grid right now, to how do you employ women in remote areas who all too often have been locked out of opportunity. You just see enormous creativity waiting to be tapped.\nAnd part of our job, part of this summit's job, is to make sure that we're putting more tools, more resources into the hands of these folks who are changing the world and making sure that all of you know each other so that you can share best practices and ideas and spread the word.\nNow, I know that the daily reality is not always as romantic as all this. [Laughter] It turns out that starting your own business is not easy. You have to have access to capital. You have to meet the right people. You have to have mentors who can guide you as you get your idea off the ground. And that can be especially difficult for women and young people and minorities and others who haven't always had access to the same networks and opportunities. You deserve the same chance to succeed as everybody else. We've got to make sure that everybody has a fair shot to reach their potential. We can't leave more than half the team on the bench.\nThat's why we've invested so much time and effort to make sure that America is helping to empower entrepreneurs like you. So we held our first summit back in 2010. Since then, we've brought entrepreneurs like you together in Turkey and the Emirates and Malaysia, Morocco, Kenya. And all told, we've helped more than 17,000 entrepreneurs and innovators connect with each other, access capital, find mentors, and start new ventures—17,000.\nSo I think of the Tanzanian startup that helps farmers reduce their harvest losses or the company in Nepal that's helping to improve charity health care. There are 11 Cubans who are here today, the first Cubans to join us at one of these summits. [Applause] Hola! Mucho gusto. They're ready to help create new opportunities for the Cuban people. Where are they? [Applause] There they are.\nI want to thank Antonio Gracias, a leader in private equity and one of our Presidential Ambassadors for Global Entrepreneurship, because his support was critical in bringing these young Cuban entrepreneurs here. So that's deserving of a hand.\nI'm also pleased to announce that we have a new group of business leaders signing on as entrepreneurship ambassadors. This is something that we started as part of the summit, and they have put their time, energy, effort, and in some cases, their money behind entrepreneurs around the world. So some of our new ambassadors: Sara Blakely, CEO of Spanx; Jane Wurwand, CEO of Dermalogica; Steven Jurvetson, partner at Draper Fisher Jurvetson; and Patrick Collison, CEO of Stripe.\nNow, supporting entrepreneurs isn't just something we do around the world, it's also a key part of how we create jobs and fuel innovation here in the United States. And it's why we're working with communities to streamline the process for launching a company: \"Startup in a Day.\" It's why we're expanding Innovation Corps, our program to equip more scientists and engineers with entrepreneurial skills. And it's why, at this summit, dozens of top tech companies, from giants to startups, are committing to make their technology workforces look like America, including by publishing data on diversity each year and developing the tech talent of people from all backgrounds. We're very happy for the commitments that they've made, so give them a big round of applause for that. Here at this summit, we're also building on our progress with new commitments from government and business and philanthropists. So at last year's Paris climate talks, for example, Bill Gates and other top global investors committed to partnering with governments to invest in cutting-edge clean energy solutions. Today we're launching an initiative to connect some of these global investors and others with clean energy entrepreneurs from developing countries.\nWe're also announcing the Young Transatlantic Innovation Leaders Initiative, which will bring 200 of Europe's innovators to the United States each year to develop their skills. And we've got organizations like Endeavor, which supports entrepreneurs, starting a $100 million fund to invest in companies across Latin America and the Middle East, in Africa, and Southeast Asia. Investment firms like Capria Ventures, which will help fund international startups. So these are just a handful of the commitments—and I suspect, new ventures—that are going to come out of this year's summit.\nSo, all of you budding entrepreneurs, don't be shy while you're here. Talk to the experts. Make your pitch. Network with potential investors. Find that mentor who might help you navigate through a tough patch. Connect with your fellow innovators. Because ultimately the world needs your creativity and your energy and your vision. You are going to be what helps this process of global integration work in a way that is good for everyone and not just some.\nNow, I've spoken about this before. I believe we are better off in a world in which we are trading and networking and communicating and sharing ideas. But that also means that cultures are colliding, and sometimes, it's disruptive, and people get worried. You're the bridge, you're the glue—particularly the young people who are here—who can help lead towards a more peaceful and more prosperous future that provides opportunity for everybody.\nAnd because this is about more than just this one event—or for that matter, this one President—we're going to make sure that the United States continues to help developing the next generation of entrepreneurs. We are very proud to announce that next year's Global Entrepreneurship Summit will be hosted in India.\nAudience members. Woo! [Applause]\nThe President. [Laughter] Got the Indian contingent in the house. I'll try to stop by if I'm invited. [Laughter]\nBut the point is, I believe in you, and America believes in you. And we believe that you have the talent and the skills and the ambition not just to pursue your dreams, but to realize them; that you can lift up not just your own families, but communities and countries, and create opportunity and prosperity and hope for decades to come. That's the promise that we see in all of you.\nAnd that is the promise that we see in our outstanding panelists that you're going to hear from. Mai Medhat, of Egypt, who is a software engineer, who started a company called Eventtus, which is a one-stop online shop for people who organize events; Jean Bosco Nzeyimana, of Rwanda, who is the founder and CEO of HABONA Limited, a company that uses biomass and waste to develop eco-friendly fuels that are used in rural Africa; Mariana Costa Checa, of Peru. Mariana is the founder of Laboratoria, which gives young women from low-income backgrounds the education and tools they need to work in the digital sector.\nAnd if that lineup is not enough, you also see it in a guy that you may have heard of who has done pretty well for himself, the founder and CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg. They're the real experts. Let's welcome them on stage, and we'll start having a conversation with them. Thank you.\nAll right. This is a good-looking group. [Laughter] And I could not wear a T-shirt like Mark—[laughter]—for at least another 6 months, but I will take off my jacket so that I don't look too formal.\nFacebook, Inc., Founder and Chief Executive Officer Mark E. Zuckerberg. Soon. Soon.\nEntrepreneurship Promotion Efforts\nThe President. Soon. It's going to happen soon. The—so——\nAudience member. [Inaudible]\nThe President. Yes, sit down, everybody. The—relax. [Laughter] So these are some extraordinary entrepreneurs. Some are just getting started, some seem to be moving along pretty well. [Laughter] And—but I thought this was wonderfully representative because it's from different regions of the world, it's companies that are at different stages.\nAnd maybe we can just start by having everybody introduce themselves, describe a little bit about what they're doing. And then, we can sort of have a discussion about what's been easy, what's been hard, how can government policy like the U.S. Government policy help in advancing some of these issues. How can other countries' governments—because we have 20 representatives from other governments participating in this summit—how should they think about encouraging entrepreneurship. And then, most importantly, how can other businesses and venture capital, et cetera, think about some of these international opportunities.\nSo, Mai, why don't we start with you? And tell us—I was hearing some of the great work you're doing. Tell us more about it.\nEventtus Cofounder and Chief Executive Officer Mai Medhat. Thank you. [Laughter] It's so great to be here. [Laughter] I started—I'm software engineer. I have an engineering background. And one day, I heard that the first Startup Weekend is happening in Cairo. And I was not invited, but I went anyway with my friend.\nThe President. Good for you.\nMs. Medhat. [Laughter] I went with my friend Nihal. She was invited, and we—she turned out to be my cofounder. And we were there just to learn about startups, meet mentors and other entrepreneurs.\nAnd—but it was very hard to network and meet people during the event. We felt like there was a gap between the organizers and the attendees. And then, a week after, we attended TEDxCairo, and we had the same experience. We felt like there should be a better way for organizers to organize events and for the attendees to experience events.\nEveryone is there for networking, connecting people, and sharing experience. So we did our research, and we were very passionate about the idea. We felt like we can do something in the event space. So we quit our jobs, and we started working on this full time before even having the name Eventtus. And now we have a full engagement and networking platform for events. It's a very interactive app with 86 percent engagement in most of our events. So we are helping people getting together during events. And now we have a great team, two offices: in Cairo and Dubai. And we are working with most of events in our region. When I look back on the journey, it wasn't easy at all. It was very challenging. It was very exciting as well. But it was full of ups and downs. And we started before even the first accelerator in Egypt was started. We had few mentors back then. But now we have a number of amazing startups, a number of mentors and support organizations who are working together to build the ecosystem. So I can see it's—the ecosystem has grown very well, but we still have a lot to do.\nThe President. That's great.\nMs. Medhat. Thank you.\nThe President. Thank you. Jean Bosco.\nHABONA Ltd. Founder and Chief Executive Officer Jean Bosco Nzeyimana. Thank you. It's an honor to be here.\nSo when I was growing up in the rural villages in Rwanda, I used to spend countless hours in the forest collecting firewood for my parents and fetching water. And that was not just me, but dozens of other children in Africa are facing the same challenges. They are involved in laborious activities to help their parents just to prepare their meal, instead of going to school.\nSo as I was growing up, I kept thinking about something that I can do to help these families have access to other alternative fuels that they can use to replace charcoal wood that they have been using for many years. So I came up with an idea of an integrated waste management approach, whereby we collect waste, and then we turn them into affordable and environmentally friendly products in form of briquettes and biogas that the people can then use. And that is like a green cooking fuel, which can improve health and sanitations in homes.\nAs we started, it has been 2 years, and I have employed more than 25 people, giving them permanent jobs. And we are trying to expand to other areas of the country so that we can continue to improve sanitation, as well as providing these kind of alternative fuels, which can improve health and mitigate climate change in the country and Africa in general.\nThe President. Excellent. Mariana.\nLaboratoria Cofounder and Executive Director Mariana Costa Checa. It's an honor to be here. I'm still trying to get over the fact that you just introduced me. [Laughter] I'm so happy.\nSo I did Laboratoria. We are a social enterprise. And we—I started it in Peru 2 years ago. We are now in Peru and Chile and Mexico. And what we tried to do is to go out and find talent where nobody else is looking for it. So we tried to identify young women who haven't been able to access quality education or job opportunities because of economic limitations and train them to become the most awesome web developers they can be and connect them with employment opportunities in the tech sector.\nSomething that I realized is that when our students join our program, they are—most of them are completely unaware of their potential, and they come thinking that it's going to be really hard to break this vicious cycle of low-skilled employment, underpaid employment, or just domestic work. But they soon start learning to code, and it's just such a powerful skill set. They—a few weeks into the program, they start building their first websites, their first apps, their games, and showing them to the world. And it's so empowering. And 6 months after joining, they're ready to go out and join the workforce.\nSo we have students who get three job offers from the coolest companies in town. They go out, they get to decide where they want to go and work. They triple their income, so they significantly improve their economic circumstances. They start supporting their families. And I think, most importantly, they start realizing that anything is possible if they work hard enough for it, no? And we have students that have gone from working at a corner shop in a slum to working at the IDB in Washington as developers, a few blocks from the White House. So really, they are an example that anything is possible, no?\nAnd they're changing not only their lives, but they're changing their communities, their cities. And I think they are transforming the tech sector in Latin America. They are bringing the diversity and the talent that the sector needs to really become a leading force in our economies. And I'm pretty sure that as we continue to grow and reach thousands of women in the region, they are going to change our countries for the better, and making sure that we can actually base our growth on the most important thing that we have; that's our young talent.\nThe President. That's great. Now, the—should—[applause]. When we were talking backstage, I had been reading about this, and I said, 60 percent of the women who had gone through this program now were employed. And I was corrected: It's now 70 percent. I had old data. [Laughter] But I think it's important to point out that your success rate has been quite extraordinary already. So it's wonderful.\nMs. Costa Checa. Thank you.\nGlobal Entrepreneurship\nThe President. Mark, when the—there was a time when you were sort of in their shoes. And—[laughter]. But now, obviously, Facebook's success has been extraordinary. But I'm sure that you still can connect with the stories that are told here, and some of the stories out there. How is Facebook thinking about its own role in creating this platform for entrepreneurship around the world? I know that's something that you've been thinking a lot about.\nMr. Zuckerberg. Well, it's really inspiring to be here with so many great entrepreneurs and to hear about all the work that you're doing, and it's an honor. So thanks for having me.\nTo me, entrepreneurship is about creating change, not just creating companies. And the most effective entrepreneurs that—who I've met care deeply about some mission and some change that they're trying to create. And often, they don't even start because they're trying to create a company.\nRight? And that's how I think about my connection to all of us here, is when I was getting started, I wanted—I cared deeply about giving everyone a voice, right, and giving people the tools to share everything that they cared about and bringing a community together. And it started small in one university. And I didn't think it was going to be company at the time. As a matter of fact, I was pretty convinced that at some point someone would build something like this for the world, but I thought that that would be some other company that already had thousands of engineers and was used to building stuff for hundreds of millions of people around the world.\nAnd what ended up happening was that no one built it, right, so we just kind of kept on going. [Laughter] Right? I mean, people said at each step along the way, what you're doing, all right, maybe college students like it, but no one else is going to like it and there's not going to be any money in doing this. So, all right, you only really do it if you care, right, if you're passionate about doing it.\nAnd then, it started growing, and people said it would be fad and it would never be a good business. But you keep going because you care, not because you're trying to create a business. And then, there's the shift to mobile where people thought that it wouldn't be a sustainable business. And it—through each of these things, the entrepreneurs who I think build things that last for a long time keep going because they care fundamentally about the change that they're trying to create in the world. And they're not in it just to build a company.\nAnd I carry that with me today. So today, we have—we live in a world with more than 7 billion people, but more than 4 billion of us are not on the Internet. And we talk about having an equal opportunity to be able to create a change in the world, and I think that's a really hard thing to do if you don't have access to some of the basic infrastructure and technical tools that are necessary to build this kind of—these kinds of technical products.\nSo I, kind of, think about what we're doing today very similarly to how I thought about where we were at the beginning. It's—I get people all the time who come to me and say, all right, well, you're investing billions of dollars in trying to put Internet connectivity in places where we don't get paid for it. It's not something that we'll make any money from for a very long period of time, if it works out. But it's this deep belief that you're trying to make a change. You're trying to connect people in the world. And I really do believe that if you do something good and if you help people out, then eventually, some portion of that good will come back to you.\nAnd you may not know up front what it's going to be, but that's just been the guiding principle for me in the work that we've done. And I hope that some of the work that we do can play a role in empowering you and so many more entrepreneurs to build the next great companies.\nChallenges Faced by Entrepreneurs\nThe President. Excellent.\nSo for the three budding entrepreneurs, you've already had some success and positive feedback. But I know that this is still hard sometimes and frustrating. And let's go back to the earlier question that I asked: What do you find to be some of the biggest hurdles for your success? And are there policies that either your governments could be pursuing or that the United States, in conjunction with your governments, could be pursuing that would really make this process, if not easy, then at least a little bit smoother? And are there questions or concerns that you have in terms of how more established businesses like Facebook, how they might be able to interact with startups like yours?\nSo why don't we—we'll go in reverse order this time. Why don't we start with you?\nMs. Costa Checa. Yes, so I think there's been many challenges along the way. In our case, we try to disrupt many preconceptions, I think. So at the beginning, many people were, like, how are you going to train people in months and get them a job? How are you going to get young women who went to a public high school that's not very good to actually become competitive in the labor market?\nAnd I think, luckily, we've overcome those, and we've proved that they are incredibly talented, that you can learn in months instead of years.\nThe President. Right.\nMs. Costa Checa. And most of the companies that hire our developers actually rehire. So they realize that they're great, and they're as competitive as anyone else who comes from a different background. So I think that's been very, very encouraging in—on our way. And I mean, the little secret that I have, I think, being a social entrepreneur is that motivation is everything, you know? And when we—when there's bad times, and where we are not making the end of the month to pay all our people, and when we're facing all these challenges, I usually just go into the classroom. You know? I'm like, okay, let me go into the classroom, and I talk to the girls who study with us. And it's just, they are the main force behind not only myself, but all my team—my partners and all my team—because they are fighting so hard to making it happen. They are traveling—sometimes, commuting 4 hours a day to come and go back. They are—they have on top of their studies a lot of domestic responsibilities, and they're proving that it can be done. So that's always a reality check to say, you know I have everything I need to keep going at this.\nThe President. Good. Jean Bosco.\nMr. Nzeyimana. Great, I think one of the most—biggest challenges that I have faced was because I started this company very young. At that time, I was 19 years old, and in my culture, it is believed that those great initiatives are started by old people and those things which have been difficult for other people cannot be possible for young people.\nSo I tried to disrupt that status quo, and I created this company. But of course, during that period, no one was even trusting me so that they can be my employee, so I had to be my own marketer. I had to be the technical boss. I had to be everything in the company so that I can build that kind of a first impression so that I can impress a few people to come to me and help me run this cause.\nAnd the other challenge that we were facing is that a lot of financial institutions didn't even know what we were talking about because this is—these are the kind of renewable energy that we wanted to bring to Rwanda. And you would find a lot of folks working in banks asking you, what are you trying to do? Because they don't even understand what you are doing. It was, like, very difficult for them to analyze and calculate the risk that might be involved in the activities that we're trying to do.\nBut because I trusted in my solution and this kind of thing that I wanted to do to my community, I kept pushing, applying for different competitions. And luckily, I won the United States African Development Foundation grant to start this initiative.\nAnd when I started, people started to see how you can take advantage on ways that you already have to produce some products which can then go back in communities and be solutions which can improve lives of many people. And then, from there, people started coming.\nBut the lesson that I learned from that very basic experience is that no matter what you are trying to do—necessary is that you are having the kind of motive in your mind that you want to help your society move forward. So the policies and the other partners take hold as we come along the way to help you run that initiative. But that will happen once you start. If you don't start, no one will come and join you.\nChallenges Faced by Entrepreneurs\nThe President. Good. The—so we've heard—no, it's interesting, I mean, part of what the two of you have described, is first of all, each country has its own culture and there are going to be sometimes some cultural barriers, whether it's attitudes about women and what they can do, whether it's attitudes about young people and how seriously they take a young person. Mark had to deal with that a little bit. But here, obviously, in the United States, and particularly in Silicon Valley, I think that's begun to change.\nBut there's also just basic issues like financing and having access to capital, particularly when it's a new idea and it doesn't fit the existing models that the banks or other financial institutions may have.\nMai, what—do those kinds of challenges resonate in your experience?\nMs. Medhat. Definitely.\nThe President. And how did you navigate through those?\nMs. Medhat. Yes, definitely. Like, I think all the entrepreneurs, like everywhere in the world, we share the same challenges. I think I did almost every single mistake that you read about in every startup-related book. [Laughter] I learned everything the hard way. So, yes, it's a learning process.\nIt's a—funding was one of the challenges, of course. The other one was the legal system and the legal structure, especially in Egypt. It's not startup friendly. So you have to do all of the work-arounds, and you have to be persistent to get over that, building a team as well. And, like, I'm a woman. And I started—I was young.\nThe President. You're still young, I think.\nMs. Medhat. Yes. [Laughter]\nThe President. I think you qualify as young.\nMs. Medhat. So, yes, I had almost the same challenges. It's—I would say that the only thing that keeps us going is believing in our idea, believing that we can do something, we can add value to people's life. And this is the only thing that keeps me—woke every day in the morning and go to work. So——\nU.S. Entrepreneurship Promotion Efforts/Global Entrepreneurship\nThe President. Yes. Well look, all of you just are expressing what Mark said, which is, it starts with a passion. If you start off just saying I want to make money, but there's no clear mission in—behind it, then when you start hitting some of these barriers, sometimes, it's very hard to push through them.\nWith respect to some of the barriers that you're talking about, the U.S.—in connection to the Entrepreneurship Summit, what we've been trying to do is take best practices and learn lessons about what's working and what's not. And so in the grants that we're providing or the training that we're providing, what these summits have been really useful in doing is hearing directly from entrepreneurs and say this program doesn't work as well as it could; this one works really well.\nWhat we're also trying to do, though, is encourage governments to listen and hear from entrepreneurs to build a different kind of culture.\nSo the point you made, Mai, about how hard is it to get a business started? Right? How much paperwork do you have to fill out? What kinds of fees do you have to pay? How much bureaucracy do you have to sort through?\nThat's something that here in the United States, we've had to deal with ourselves. And what we've tried to do is to both simplify processes, but also use technology in ways that means you don't have to travel across town in Cairo to go to an office, and the person you need to see isn't there, and then you have to travel back and reschedule the next day. And the traffic is terrible, and you're—it's driving you crazy. If you can go on the net and do a lot of that work ahead of time that can make a huge difference in accelerating the process that you're doing.\nAnd so I'm very glad that we have 20 countries represented here, because part of what we're doing is getting commitments from those other countries to say, we're going to learn from each other and figure out how we can streamline these efforts so that we're making life a little bit easier for young people like you.\nMs. Medhat. Yes, actually, back when we started, we didn't know where to start from. Like we couldn't find any information online, for example, on how to get the company registered in Egypt. We didn't know any startup lawyers or anyone who can register the company for us. So we had to go ourselves and ask for help from other people.\nThe President. Right.\nMs. Medhat. And we couldn't find any information. It took us so much time, efforts, and money.\nU.S. Entrepreneurship Promotion Efforts\nThe President. Yes. Well, even here in the United States where it's much easier to do business, we have—we still have 16 agencies that are in charge of doing business. [Laughter] We've tried to streamline them into one. It requires congressional action. [Laughter] So the—so at least, what we've tried to do is to consolidate the websites so that it's easier to get the information, even though you still have to deal potentially with 16 different agencies for different needs.\nSo there are specific things that the government can do to be more entrepreneur friendly. How can companies like Facebook or Google or some of the venture funds that are represented here, how should they think about finding good ideas? What sorts of mentorship or training would you find most helpful? Obviously, having experienced entrepreneurs or people who have seen startups in the past maybe can help you avoid a few of the lessons. And part of the goal of the summit here is to build these networks so that that kind of mentorship is available.\nBut, Mark, I know that Facebook is already doing some of these issues. Tell us about some of the things that you're excited about. And then, maybe we hear from them about other networking opportunities that they'd be looking for.\nMr. Zuckerberg. Sure. Well, we have a developer program all over the world, where we go around—and it's called FbStart. And we give entrepreneurs free access to tools, and some of them—a lot of the tools that people can use are free from Facebook and other places. But in order to help get started with businesses, we give to different companies tens of thousands of dollars' worth of Facebook tools to get started.\nBut it's also important to help people learn how to use the tools, so we do these entrepreneurship workshops around the world and—for both people who are starting to create technical companies, but also for small businesses, which are, I think, an important part—maybe less the focus of this summit—but that's a huge part of what we try to do around the world and help people get on the Internet and connect with people that they're trying to sell their products to. And we have more than 50 million small-business pages that are on Facebook, and a large number of them use it as their primary presence for communicating with people and attracting new customers. So that's a pretty good basic tool that's out there.\nThe biggest thing that I'm personally focused on is connectivity though. I mean, it's—I think for you guys—and we talked about this a little bit backstage—I think you're mostly in places that have reasonable connectivity. I mean, you were talking about how sometimes, when you go home, it's not so good, but in general, I think for a whole other big population, wave of folks, this really is a blocking factor. Right? If you grew up and you've never used a computer or you've never had access to the Internet, it's often hard to even imagine what you're missing out on.\nAnd so I—this is a local problem that I think we need to do a better job of empowering folks in different countries to be able to spread connectivity. I mean, this isn't something that the U.S. or some American company can come in and do. In the places where it's worked, it's been in partnership with local companies and local entrepreneurs and local governments.\nAnd that's also something that I'd love your guys' advice on: how you think we could be doing a better job of spreading connectivity to enable not just you guys, but other entrepreneurs who haven't even had the opportunities that you have had to build things as well.\nLatin American Entrepreneurship\nThe President. Well, tell us what's happening in Peru in terms of connectivity, and how does that connect with creating the supply for all these wonderful young women that you're training? Obviously, things are growing.\nMs. Costa Checa. Yes, yes, yes.\nThe President. But speak to Mark's point about how you see things unfolding both in Peru and Latin America over the next several years.\nMs. Costa Checa. Yes. We'll, first of all, it—Facebook is such an amazing tool for us because we often target women who have had limited access to the digital world as a whole, but no matter where you go, Facebook is there. [Laughter] I think young people today initiate their digital lives through Facebook. So every single girl in our program, even though they don't have e-mail and they have a limited use of the Internet, they have a Facebook account. And——\nThe President. Well, Mark is very happy to hear this. [Laughter]\nMr. Zuckerberg. I am. I am.\nMs. Costa Checa. Yes. And this is a great connection because it's a starting point, you know. And we usually start on our events where we do awareness raising about our program and encourage young women to apply, we talk a lot about Facebook, because this is a web app and do you know what's behind it. And that's actually a very important thread in our communication. So thank you. It helps a lot.\nAnd in terms of connectivity, I think Latin America is—I mean, it's moving forward, but there are still many important challenges. And as we were discussing before, the service is not often the best because there is very few companies in the market, and this brings some challenges, no? And we also have—I mean, many, many of the Latin American countries are very centralized in the capital city or in the major cities where usually connectivity is not a problem. But as you get further away, it becomes a challenge, no? So I think it should definitely be a priority for our governments.\nIn the case of Peru, I think the Government is realizing that this is important. And I have to say, we've been really lucky, both in Peru and in Chile; we've had support from the government because they realize that they not only need to expand access to digital services, but they also need to start bringing in more people to create digital products. We have a talent gap, and if we want to evolve and have more digital services, who's going to build them? So that's been really lucky on our side.\nAnd just one final point, I think it's crucial for entrepreneurs to work hand in hand with big companies and with government. I think that we entrepreneurs have the amazing advantage of being able to take huge, sometimes irresponsible, risks. We can just go out and try new things all the time. And this is something that, as you become larger and if you're a government, it's way harder, no?\nSo I think we have a role to play there, in building new things, in creating new things. And I think when it comes to scaling up those things, these partnerships are essential to enable us to take what we've built and created and tested and tried to a larger scale.\nJob Training Programs/Technology Industry/Public-Private Partnerships\nThe President. I think that's a great point. So, for example, the kind of training you're doing, even with our entire education infrastructure here, we still have that same gap.\nMs. Costa Checa. Yes.\nThe President. We initiated something through our administration called TechHire, where we're going into communities and cities that—where people can't imagine that they could somehow be part of the tech industry. And what we're finding is, is that through months of training—in some cases through a community college, in some cases companies who are joining with us—it turns out that you can train people very effectively. And as we prove concept, now we have the opportunity to scale up throughout the job training programs that already exist in the U.S. Government.\nSo I think you're making a terrific point, that in the same way that your individual companies are taking risks, proving concept, and then trying to scale up in the private sector, part of what governments need to be doing is when they see something that is working—a tool, an app, a mechanism that saves time, makes something more convenient, makes a product more accessible to people, then we have to be prepared to change how we do business and potentially scale up as well.\nSo it's—you're right that it's hard sometimes for governments to take massive risks, but what governments can do is to partner with entrepreneurs, start small, work out the kinks, and then be able to back the process of scaling up in that way. Okay?\nSo, Jean Bosco, any additional thoughts in terms of how not only Mark, but all these VCs out here can help you out? [Laughter] Make your pitch, man. Tell them how they can pull out their checkbook and——\nMr. Nzeyimana. Yes. I think Facebook is doing a great job in terms of improving connectivities. And when you look at the situation in my country, we are really trying, but we still have a lot of—a long way to go because connectivity is only available in cities. And although you can find it in the villages, but it's not really fast so that you can't use it on some activities like watching videos or sending heavy files to other people.\nSo we are still having a challenge in terms of connectivity and a rapid Internet. But what we're trying to do as small businesses is looking at the tools that big companies like a Facebook offers so that we can benefit from them, like using messengers to exchange messages with our potential customers. And you know, we use, like, adverts to see how we can disseminate messages.\nBecause in my country, a lot of people don't know this kind of waste management things that we want to bring, and you see that in many places people don't sort waste at the source, they just throw waste everywhere. But we are using this kind of technology to teach people that they have to sort waste from organic to nonorganic, because this is beneficial in this way and this is harmful in this way.\nSo we are trying to use these kinds of tools to disseminate such image. And the challenge that we are still facing is the fact that when you are still small, of course, you are, like, having, like, 10 years in front of you, so that you can attract attention from many people to come and join you. But depending on this kind of spotlight exposure, support that you are getting from different people, we are trying to benefit from these kinds of initiatives to disseminate the messages and bring attention of many people to what we're doing.\nInternet Connectivity\nThe President. Good. Mai.\nMs. Medhat. Yes, I don't know where to start exactly. In Egypt, Facebook—we started a revolution out of Facebook. So—[applause]. Facebook was the only way we communicated during the revolution. And after that—and I believe you have the numbers, but the Facebook penetration has grown tremendously since then. And it's a basic tool now. Like, now everyone in Egypt, they have Facebook. And we were just talking about the Facebook Basics. And now it's—it was blocked in Egypt, so I think there is a lot to do.\nAnd also back to the connectivity thing, I think—I'm praying now if—I'm not sure if my team and my family are watching this or not because they can't livestream. [Laughter] I hope they are not saying—seeing the——\nThe President. The buffering.\nMs. Medhat. ——the loading. [Laughter]\nThe President. That's so irritating. I know. [Laughter]\nMs Medhat. Yes, it's very basic.\nThe President. I hear you. If it makes you feel any better, it happens to me too. [Laughter] I thought I'd have the best gear, but I'm just sitting there waiting, waiting. [Laughter]\nMs. Medhat. Yes, it affects the business as well. Now I moved to Dubai, and I have to manage the team in Cairo. And it's very hard to communicate; it's very hard to do, like, a Skype call with the team or something like that. So we have to work around it. We have to pay a lot of money. Actually, I have been trying to get another line in the office for, like, 4 months now, and we still didn't get another line. So the network access——\nThe President. That's in Dubai? Ms. Medhat. That's in Egypt, in Cairo. No, Dubai is——\nThe President. Is better?\nMs. Medhat. It's even—yes, it's much more better. [Laughter] Yes, they're doing a decent job in Dubai, yes.\nInternet Connectivity/Open Government/Entrepreneurship/2008 Presidential Election\nThe President. I mean some of this is—you raise a couple important points. First of all, the huge opportunity here is for countries to leapfrog existing infrastructure. And we're—obviously, we see this in Africa, in India, places where mobile banking and payment systems have accelerated even more rapidly than they have here: farmers using information to access prices to markets so that they're selling their goods at a decent price.\nSo there is an infrastructure and connectivity function that governments can play. You're raising another question—an issue, though, which is a sensitive topic in some countries, which is openness. Okay, it is hard to foster and encourage an entrepreneurial culture if it's closed and if information flows are blocked. And what we are seeing around the world oftentimes is governments wanting the benefits of entrepreneurship and connectivity, but thinking that top-down control is also compatible with that. And it's not.\nPeople remark on my 2008 campaign and how we were really early adapters of so much technology. It wasn't because I knew what I was doing. [Laughter] It's because a bunch of 20-year-olds came to me and said, hey, there's this new thing called Myspace or—[laughter].\nMr. Zuckerberg. Ouch. [Laughter]\nThe President. And—[laughter]. That was just a little dig there. [Laughter]\nBut the point is that they had all this stuff that I had never heard of. And if I had tried to maintain control and said, no, no, no, they—we're going with pamphlets—[laughter]—because I'm used to pamphlets, and I can control what's in the pamphlet, then I might not be sitting here.\nSo—well, the same is true for governments as a whole. There is a cultural shift that is sometimes difficult that says we are empowering individuals. And we are open to ideas. We are willing to admit new information that maybe contradicts our old preconceptions. We're willing to test those new ideas. And if they don't work, we're going to try something else.\nI—that's the connection between connectivity and the Internet and science. I mean, part of what has created all this, part of what Stanford is all about is our capacity to say, we don't know, to say that all the received wisdom might not be right. And we're willing to test it. And that is threatening sometimes. It's threatening to governments. It's threatening to cultures. But that is the essence of discovery and innovation.\nAnd so one of the things that we've been trying to do and just encourage through the State Department is to gently—and sometimes, bluntly—talk to governments about their need to maintain an openness and a confidence in their own people.\nNow, it—what makes it harder, admittedly, is the fact that the openness and the power of connectivity also can empower some bad people. And so us wrestling with how do we counter the sort of violent extremism that can end up poisoning the mind and resulting in what we saw happening in Orlando, that's a constant balance that we're trying to weigh. But what I worry about is people using that as an excuse then to try to block things off and control the flow of information. And that's a question that I think young people are attuned to, and they're going to have to pay attention to and all of us are going to have to fight for in the years to come.\nWell, this has been an extraordinary conversation. How are we doing on time? It's—we're all done? But I'm having so much fun. [Laughter] Give the—give our panelists a big round of applause. Congratulations for the great work you're doing.\nThank you, everybody.", "timestamp": "2016-06-24", "title": "Remarks and a Panel Discussion at the Global Entrepreneurship Summit at Stanford University in Stanford, California"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "This proclamation and its attached annex were published in the  Federal Register  on June 29.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117918", "text": "By the President of the United States of America\nA Proclamation\nChristopher Park, a historic community park located immediately across the street from the Stonewall Inn in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of New York City (City), is a place for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community to assemble for marches and parades, expressions of grief and anger, and celebrations of victory and joy. It played a key role in the events often referred to as the Stonewall Uprising or Rebellion, and has served as an important site for the LGBT community both before and after those events.\nAs one of the only public open spaces serving Greenwich Village west of 6th Avenue, Christopher Park has long been central to the life of the neighborhood and to its identity as an LGBT-friendly community. The park was created after a large fire in 1835 devastated an overcrowded tenement on the site. Neighborhood residents persuaded the City to condemn the approximately 0.12-acre triangle for public open space in 1837. By the 1960s, Christopher Park had become a popular destination for LGBT youth, many of whom had run away from or been kicked out of their homes. These youth and others who had been similarly oppressed felt they had little to lose when the community clashed with the police during the Stonewall Uprising.\nIn the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, a riot broke out in response to a police raid on the Stonewall Inn, at the time one of the City's best known LGBT bars. Over the course of the next several days, more demonstrations and riots occurred in the surrounding neighborhood including Christopher Park. During these days, because of its strategic location across from the bar, Christopher Park served as a gathering place, refuge, and platform for the community to voice its demand for LGBT civil rights. The Stonewall Uprising is considered by many to be the catalyst that launched the modern LGBT civil rights movement. From this place and time, building on the work of many before, the Nation started the march—not yet finished—toward securing equality and respect for LGBT people.\nChristopher Park and its environs have remained a key gathering place for the LGBT community. For example, on June 26, 2015, within moments of the issuance of the Supreme Court's historic ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, LGBT people headed to Christopher Park to celebrate the Court's recognition of a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. A few days later, Governor Cuomo continued that celebration by officiating at the marriage of two gay men directly outside the Stonewall Inn. Within minutes of the recent news of the murders of 49 people in a nightclub in Orlando, Florida—one of the most deadly shootings in American history—LGBT people and their supporters in New York headed again to Christopher Park to mourn, heal, and stand together in unity for the fundamental values of equality and dignity that define us as a country.\nToday, Christopher Park is surrounded by brick sidewalks and a nineteenth century wrought-iron fence with gated openings. Educational signs about the Stonewall Uprising are found near the large arched main entryway. Divided into two halves, the western side of the park is open to the public on a daily basis and contains a small plaza lined with brick pavers and benches. George Segal's sculpture, \"Gay Liberation,\" stands as a focal point of the plaza. The sculpture was commissioned in 1979 on the tenth anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising, and its installation in 1992 cemented Christopher Park's role as a destination for those wishing to understand the significance of the Stonewall Uprising. The eastern half of the park contains two structures erected in 1936: a statue of Civil War General Philip Sheridan, and a memorial flagstaff and plaque honoring Colonel Ephraim Elmer Ellsworth, an officer with the New York Fire Zouaves during the Civil War.\nAcross the street from Christopher Park is the target of the June 28, 1969, police raid, the Stonewall Inn (51-53 Christopher Street), originally built in 1843 and 1846 as two separate two-story horse stables. In 1930, the two buildings were combined into one commercial space with a new single exterior facade. In 1934, the first-floor space opened as a restaurant called Bonnie's Stonewall Inn, which served the neighborhood for over 30 years. The restaurant closed in 1966, but was reopened in 1967 as an LGBT bar called the Stonewall Inn.\nThe streets and sidewalks in the neighborhood surrounding Christopher Park and the Stonewall Inn are an integral part of the neighborhood's historic character and played a significant role in the Stonewall Uprising. The narrow streets bend, wrap back on themselves, and otherwise create directional havoc. In the early 1800s, the residents rejected the City's attempts to enlarge the neighborhood streets and align them with the City's grid plan, and the extension of Seventh Avenue South through the area in the early 1900s only added confusion. During the Stonewall Uprising, this labyrinthine street pattern helped the LGBT demonstrators, who knew the neighborhood, to evade riot-control police, who were not from the local precinct.\nViewed from Christopher Park's central location, this historic landscape—the park itself, the Stonewall Inn, the streets and sidewalks of the surrounding neighborhood—reveals the story of the Stonewall Uprising, a watershed moment for LGBT civil rights and a transformative event in the Nation's civil rights movement on par with the 1848 Women's Rights Convention at Seneca Falls and the 1965 Selma-to-Montgomery March for voting rights in its role in energizing a broader community to demand equal rights.\nAlthough the 1960s were a time of social and political change that brought greater freedom to many segments of society, these new-found freedoms did not extend to members of the LGBT community. They faced increased oppression and criminal prosecution even for being physically intimate with consensual partners. In New York City, LGBT people were frequently arrested for acts such as same-sex dancing and kissing and wearing clothes of the perceived opposite gender. In some States, adults of the same sex caught having consensual sex in their own home could receive sentences of up to life in prison or be confined to a mental institution, where they faced horrific procedures, such as shock therapy, castration, and lobotomies. LGBT Americans lived their lives in secrecy for fear of losing their jobs, being evicted from their homes, or being arrested. For LGBT people of color or living in poverty, life was especially challenging.\nFor over a century, Greenwich Village has attracted Americans of all kinds with an interest in political activism and nonconformity. By the 1930s, Greenwich Village was home to a significant LGBT community. Despite the aggressive anti-LGBT policies and practices that emerged in the City in the 1950s and 60s, a variety of bars, nightclubs, restaurants, hotels, and private clubs catered to an LGBT clientele. Many establishments lasted only a few months before police raided them and shut them down, a practice that intensified during mayoral election years such as 1969. The police frequently raided LGBT bars for illegally selling alcoholic drinks to \"homosexuals.\" LGBT bars operated by organized crime syndicates often paid off members of the police force and in return received tips about when raids were planned. As part of a crackdown on LGBT bars in June 1969, the Public Morals squad of Manhattan's First Police Division raided the Stonewall Inn on June 24, 1969, confiscated its liquor, and arrested its employees. The Stonewall Inn reopened the next day. Having made only minimal impact with this raid, the police decided to plan a surprise raid for the following Friday night or Saturday morning, when the bar would be crowded.\nOn June 28, 1969, undercover police officers raided the Stonewall Inn around 1:15 a.m., after one of them witnessed the illegal sale of alcohol. Customers resisted the police by refusing to show identification or go into a bathroom so that a police officer could verify their sex. As police officers began making arrests, the remaining customers gathered outside instead of dispersing as they had in the past. They cheered when friends emerged from the bar under police escort, and they shouted \"Gay Power!\" and \"We Want Freedom!\". As word spread, the gathering grew in size and a riot ultimately ensued. Around 3:00 a.m., the City's riot-control force appeared, and started to push the crowd away from the Stonewall Inn. But the crowd refused to disperse. Groups of demonstrators retreated to nearby streets, only to cut back and regroup near the Stonewall Inn and Christopher Park. The riot finally abated about 4:30 a.m., but during the next week several more protests formed, and in some cases, led to new riots and confrontations with the police.\nThe Stonewall Uprising changed the Nation's history. After the Stonewall incident, the LGBT community across the Nation realized its power to join together and demand equality and respect. Within days of the events, Stonewall seemed to galvanize LGBT communities across the country, bringing new supporters and inspiring LGBT activists to organize demonstrations to show support for LGBT rights in several cities. One year later, the number of LGBT organizations in the country had grown from around 50 to at least 1,500, and Pride Marches were held in a number of large cities to commemorate the Stonewall Uprising.\nThe quest for LGBT equality after Stonewall evolved from protests and small gatherings into a nationwide movement. Lesbian women, gay men, bisexual and transgender people united to ensure equal rights for all people regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Hard-fought civil rights victories in courtrooms and statehouses across the country set the stage for victories in the Supreme Court that would have seemed unthinkable to those who rose up in Greenwich Village in June 1969. Today, communities, cities, and nations celebrate LGBT Pride Days and Months, and the number of Pride events approaches 1,000. The New York City Police Department now has an LGBT Liaison Unit to build positive relations with the LGBT community, and provides the community with expert protection when threats are identified. Most importantly, the Nation's laws and jurisprudence increasingly reflect the equal treatment that the LGBT community deserves. There is important distance yet to travel, but through political engagement and litigation, as well as individual acts of courage and acceptance, this movement has made tremendous progress toward securing equal rights and equal dignity.\nWhereas, section 320301 of title 54, United States Code (known as the \"Antiquities Act\"), authorizes the President, in the President's discretion, to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be national monuments, and to reserve as a part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which in all cases shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected;\nWhereas, in 2000, the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) designated the Stonewall Inn, Christopher Park, and portions of the surrounding neighborhood as a National Historic Landmark for its association with the Stonewall Uprising, a momentous event that inspired a national LGBT civil rights movement;\nWhereas, for the purpose of establishing a national monument to be administered by the National Park Service, the City of New York has donated to the Federal Government fee title to the approximately 0.12-acre Christopher Park;\nWhereas, the designation of a national monument at the site of the Stonewall Uprising would elevate its message and story to the national stage and ensure that future generations would learn about this turning point that sparked changes in cultural attitudes and national policy towards LGBT people over the ensuing decades;\nWhereas, it is in the public interest to preserve and protect Christopher Park and the historic objects associated with it in the Stonewall National Historic Landmark;\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by section 320301 of title 54, United States Code, hereby proclaim the objects identified above that are situated upon lands and interests in lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be the Stonewall National Monument (monument) and, for the purpose of protecting those objects, reserve as a part thereof all lands and interests in lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government within the boundaries described on the accompanying map, which is attached to and forms a part of this proclamation. The reserved Federal lands and interests in lands encompass approximately 0.12 acres. The boundaries described on the accompanying map are confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected.\nAll Federal lands and interests in lands within the boundaries described on the accompanying map are hereby appropriated and withdrawn from all forms of entry, location, selection, sale, or other disposition under the public land laws, from location, entry, and patent under the mining laws, and from disposition under all laws relating to mineral and geothermal leasing.\nThe establishment of the monument is subject to valid existing rights. If the Federal Government acquires any lands or interests in lands not owned or controlled by the Federal Government within the boundaries described on the accompanying map, such lands and interests in lands shall be reserved as a part of the monument, and objects identified above that are situated upon those lands and interests in lands shall be part of the monument, upon acquisition of ownership or control by the Federal Government.\nThe Secretary shall manage the monument through the National Park Service, pursuant to applicable legal authorities, consistent with the purposes and provisions of this proclamation. The Secretary shall prepare a management plan, with full public involvement and in coordination with the City, within 3 years of the date of this proclamation. The management plan shall ensure that the monument fulfills the following purposes for the benefit of present and future generations: (1) to preserve and protect the objects of historic interest associated with the monument, and (2) to interpret the monument's objects, resources, and values related to the LGBT civil rights movement. The management plan shall, among other things, set forth\nthe desired relationship of the monument to other related resources, programs, and organizations, both within and outside the National Park System.\nThe National Park Service is directed to use applicable authorities to seek to enter into agreements with others, and the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation in particular, to enhance public services and promote management efficiencies.\nNothing in this proclamation shall be deemed to revoke any existing withdrawal, reservation, or appropriation; however, the monument shall be the dominant reservation.\nWarning is hereby given to all unauthorized persons not to appropriate, injure, destroy, or remove any feature of this monument and not to locate or settle upon any of the lands thereof.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-06-24", "title": "Proclamation 9465—Establishment of the Stonewall National Monument"}

[Laughter] And it's true, as Jay said, I do sometimes feel the spirit of my mother here, because she went to high school here. And there's a real sense of roots when I come here.\nAnd it's wonderful to see some great friends. I want to just mention a few of them. First of all, one of my favorite people, somebody who I believe is one of the most effective public servants that we have in this country, give it up for your Senator, Patty Murray, who is in the house. [Applause] I love Patty Murray! Now, Patty is one of these folks who is tough and has these deep, abiding convictions about the people she's working for and the community she's trying to help, and yet as tough as she is, she can still bring both parties together when other people can't.\nWhen Congress couldn't get a compromise on a budget, she brought Republicans and Democrats together around a way to prevent a foolish Government shutdown; worked with parents and teachers to lead bipartisan reform of No Child Left Behind; fought to open new VA clinics across this State. When Republicans were holding up the Violence Against Women Act, she didn't stop fighting until she broke through the gridlock and passed a law protecting every woman in Washington State. She is one of our best, and I'm glad you sent her to Washington.\nFollowing in her footsteps, you've got some outstanding Members of Congress, including Suzan DelBene. Love her. Doing great work. Derek Kilmer, who wanted to be here today, but they're both working hard back in DC. And you're lucky to have them, because they're working hard on your behalf. One of the best mayors in America, your Mayor, Ed Murray, is in the house. An outstanding attorney general, Bob Ferguson, is in the house. Your County Executive, doing great work for the region, Dow Constantine, is in the house. Give him a big round of applause.\nAnd I am here today to support a great friend of mine, one of America's outstanding Governors: your Governor, Jay Inslee. [Applause] Jay Inslee. Now, let me say this. When I first got to know Jay, I could tell that he was a passionate public servant, that he cared about people. But on the basketball court—[laughter]—he was kind of a hack. [Laughter] He fouled a lot. There wasn't a lot foot speed, but the elbows kind of came flying your way. [Laughter] And yet I'm here anyway——\nGovernor Inslee. All right!\nThe President. ——despite the bumps and bruises. Secret Service asked me, do you want, sir, for us to take him out of here? [Laughter] I said, no, no, it's okay, as I limped off the court. [Laughter]\nBut I know Jay well, and I've seen his leadership up close. I've seen it in Washington. But, I think, more powerfully, I've seen it here in Washington. Jay was mentioning when I visited Oso after the mudslide a couple years back, and I watched him console victims and bring people together and help the community rebuild. And one of the reasons that I love Jay so much is because he doesn't just have what it takes to lead Washington State on a day-to-day basis, he's willing to make the tough decisions that position this State to succeed in the long run. And that means sometimes taking decisions that aren't immediately popular. It means sometimes taking risks. But that's the kind of public servant you want. You want somebody who's got a conscience and who's not just playing to the polls all the time.\nAnd I've worked with a lot of Governors over the past 7½ years, and I can honestly say that there are very few who love every inch of their State and every person in this State as much as Jay Inslee loves Washington State.\nAnd without his leadership, America would not have made all the progress we've made together. And we've made progress. We've made progress because of Jay. We've made progress because of Patty. We made progress because of some of the outstanding Members of Congress that you've sent. We made progress because of you: because you worked hard and you voted and you knocked on doors; because you believed we could do better.\nTogether, over the past 6 years, America's businesses have created more than 14 million new jobs. That's not an accident. Over the past 4 years, nearly a quarter of a million new jobs have come to Washington State. That did not just happen on its own. It's because Jay is making the right decisions that give businesses the confidence to be right here in Washington State.\nHe helped pass the largest infrastructure package in Washington State's history, lining up new investments in all forms of transportation that will create jobs faster and help small businesses and ship goods faster and help, most importantly, parents get home to their kids faster from a long day's work.\nTogether, over the past 8 years, we've cut the oil we buy from foreign countries in half, doubled the clean energy we generate, worked to put in place new rules on the amount of carbon pollution our power plants can dump into the air that our kids breathe. And while Republicans and big polluters have teamed up to block those rules, Jay Inslee is using the authority under Washington's State's Clean Air Act to put a first-ever cap on carbon emissions. One of the strongest advocates on this issue in the country, and when you reelect him, America will continue to lead in the fight against climate change.\nTogether, we made sure that for the first time ever, more than 90 percent of Americans know the financial security of health insurance. That was thanks to some amazing work from your congressional delegation, but it was also thanks in part to Governor Inslee's decision to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, covering hundreds of thousands of Washington residents. And I know we've got a couple hundred nurses here in the house. I love nurses! And they know how much of a difference it's made in the lives of the people that they're helping every single day. We appreciate you.\nI mean, I like doctors. But I love me some nurses. [Laughter] I'm just saying. I'm just speaking the truth. When Malia was born, our first child—she just graduated from high school and the—[applause]. I suppose that's worthy of applause. I'm still kind of—[laughter]—wondering how that happened so fast. [Laughter] But those of you who have gone through this experience should know that you start having these flashbacks. And I remember Malia being born. And what I remember was being in the hospital, and I'd done all the breathing exercise things—[laughter]—and all this stuff. And I forgot all of it—[laughter]—because I was sort of panicked. And Michelle was just sitting there handling her business. [Laughter] But what I remember is, the entire time, there were nurses there. And the ob-gyn who delivered is one of our best friends, so I can say this about her. I think she came in for the last 5 minutes—[laughter]—and then she left to see another patient. But those nurses were with us the whole time. That's why I love nurses. Anyway, I had to go on a tangent there about nurses because I really like nurses.\nWhere was I? Together, we've increased early childhood education and lifted high school graduation rates to new highs and boosted graduations in fields like engineering. And we could not have done it without the record investment Jay Inslee made in early learning and all-day kindergarten and smaller class sizes and reducing the cost of college tuition for more young people and respecting teachers for being the outstanding professionals that they are. I love teachers too.\nTogether, we made sure our LGBT brothers and sisters have more of the rights guaranteed to them by the founding documents, including the right to marry who they love in all 50 States. And when folks tried to weaken Washington State's landmark civil rights law to discriminate against transgender members of the community, Jay Inslee stood up and said no, that's not right. That's the kind of Governor you've got.\nAnd that's why you've got to give Jay another 4 years. Because this election matters.\n[At this point, an audience member began singing.]\nThe President. This election matters. Is somebody singing back there? [Laughter]\nAudience member. I love you!\nThe President. I love you too.\nBut listen, we can come together to tackle the challenges that we face, or we can—I'm sorry, what's going on there?\nAudience member. Mr. President, use your authority to ban oil trains now!\nThe President. To ban what?\nAudience members. Oil trains.\nThe President. Huh?\nAudience members. Oil trains.\nThe President. Oil trains. I see, okay. All right, I've got you. I heard you.\nAudience member. Yes? The President. I said I heard you. I think now let's—I'm making a note of it. You've made your point. Can I go on now? Okay, all right. Thank you. Thank you. It's all right. No, this is what I love about the Democratic Party. [Laughter] It doesn't matter what I—how much I do, I've always got a bigger to-do list. [Laughter] Well, it's like, I'm sorry, what, you organized the world around climate change? Got a Paris agreement signed? Nope, you didn't deal with this yet. [Laughter] So I've still got 6 months. Give me a little time. Glory! Thank you.\nGovernor Inslee. You're going to use them too.\nThe President. That's true.\nGovernor Inslee. You're going to use them.\nThe President. Absolutely. All right. We're going to use those 6 months. Where was I again? [Laughter]\nAudience member. I love you! [Laughter]\nThe President. So this election matters. We can come together to tackle in a serious way the challenges that we face. Or we can let ourselves be torn apart with divisive rhetoric and an economic agenda that is rooted in the same kinds of theories that got us into a crisis in 2008 and that we spent all these years digging ourselves out of.\nAnd look, I've said this before. I genuinely want to see a healthy, well-functioning two-party system. I do not believe that anybody is born Democrat or Republican. I don't think any single party has a monopoly on wisdom. I come from the State of Illinois, where the first Republican President, a guy named Abraham Lincoln, did some pretty good stuff. But the Republican rhetoric and the Republican agenda right now is not going to move this country forward.\nAnd I know they're saying all kinds of stuff about Jay and Patty and Suzan and Derek. Lord knows, they're saying stuff about me. [Laughter] But I do think it is useful for us to look at what they've said before in order to determine the veracity of what they're saying now. I think it's useful to look at the evidence, to play back the tape. In sports, you've got an instant replay, and you can say, all right, here's what happened. So let's check out the Republicans' track record.\nThey warned that our clean energy policies would push gas prices over 6 bucks a gallon. That's—no, run back the tape. That's what they said. Right now they're about $2.70 here in Seattle. They warned that our policies would make our deficits skyrocket. We've cut our deficits by almost three-quarters.\nJust in 2012, they said, elect us, get rid of Obama, we'll get the unemployment rate to 6 percent by the end of 2016. It's at 4.7 percent right now. Run back the tape! Run back the tape! Sometimes, I think, do you remember what you said? [Laughter]\nThey warned, Obamacare would kill jobs. Well, I mean, they warned apocalypse, including killing jobs. [Laughter] And toads were going to rain down from the sky, and the Earth would crack open. [Laughter] And it would kill jobs. We ended up covering another 20 million Americans, helped keep health care inflation to a 50-year low, protected folks who have insurance from always being able to get it even if you've got a preexisting condition, covered millions of young people all across the country—could stay on their parent's plan. And since I signed the Affordable Care Act into law, our businesses have created jobs every single month for 75 straight months, an alltime record streak of private sector job growth in America. Look at the tape! Look at the record!\nThem's the facts. [Laughter] It's the facts. I know that sometimes they don't traffic in facts. [Laughter] That's not, sort of, something they put a premium on. But facts are important. [Laughter] They really are, even in politics. [Laughter]\nAnd the reason it's important for us to look at what was said before and what has actually happened is because we're not finished. We've still got more work to do to help folks get ahead in today's economy. And we've got to have smart and forward-thinking leadership like Jay's to help us do it.\nBut folks have reason to feel anxious about some of the longer term trends in the economy that are making working families feel less secure. These are trends that predated me coming into office, or Jay coming into office. And they're not—they haven't all gone away. We've made enormous progress recovering from crisis, but despite the drop in unemployment, wages are still growing too slowly, which is making it harder for families to pay for college or save for retirement. Global competition and the race of technology has left too many workers feeling like they can't catch up, that they're being left behind. It's causing greater inequality, and we're seeing folks at the very top—and this is true not just here, but all around the world—amassing more and more extraordinary wealth and influence while a lot of people feel as if they're just treading water.\nThese are real challenges. The anxieties they cause are real. And unfortunately, when people are anxious and scared, there are going to be politicians out there who try to prey on that frustration to get themselves headlines and to get themselves votes. And that's what the Republicans have been doing for a while now. That's the story they've been telling. Not just their guy at the top of the ticket, but up and down the ticket and in States like Washington.\nTheir story is that working folks have been victimized by freeloaders and minorities and unions and the \"47 percent.\" And immigrants and foreigners are stealing whatever jobs Obamacare hasn't already killed. [Laughter] They don't tell you what they're for. They define their economic agenda by what they're against or, more often, who they're against.\nAnd all too often, it divides Americans, who are—actually have common economic interests and who should be working together for a better deal from the people who are supposed to be serving them. And when things don't change it makes folks cynical about our government, and it keeps us from pushing our political system in a steady, thoughtful, creative way to solve our actual economic challenges.\nThe fact is, working families of all races, of all backgrounds deserve higher wages. Families of all ethnicities and all religious faiths deserve quality health care and decent retirement savings. Every child in this country deserves an education that lets them dream bigger than their immediate circumstances. And if we're going to transform our politics to make them responsive to working families, we've got to reject a politics that pits working Americans against one another. We are stronger together, and we've got to fight together to give everybody a fair shot at opportunity and security. That's what we believe. That's what we stand for.\nAnd the good news is, we can do it. There—you know, there's some stuff that's really complicated, but then there's some things that actually we know work. We've seen them work. We can get wages rising faster. They're up about 3 percent so far this year, but we could do even more by raising the minimum wage high enough to keep working families from living in poverty. Jay tried to do that here. Republicans blocked it. We've got to keep on pushing to make it happen.\nWe've got to make sure every worker can get paid sick leave. Jay tried to do that here. Republicans blocked it. We've got to keep on pushing. We've got to make sure women get equal pay for equal work. What do you think Republicans want to do?\nSo if you care about making sure working families get bigger paychecks, there's a clear choice in this election.\nTogether, we've got to better prepare our children and our workers for the high-tech, high-wage jobs of tomorrow. We know that early childhood education works. And when childcare costs take a huge share of the family's budget, we should be investing in smart ways to do it across the country. We know how to make college more affordable. Democratic Governors like Jay Inslee are doing good work on these issues right now. But he's got to have 4 more years to get the job done. That's the choice in this election.\nThere are things we know work. We should be investing in our youngest children, putting people back to work building highways, researching new discoveries and innovations, making college more affordable, promoting clean energy of the future. That's what Jay Inslee is trying to do. And every time, Republicans try to block these investments for no other reason than this cult that they're praying to of small government. [Laughter] And it just hurts all of us. We've got to make smart investments that help all of us succeed. That's the choice in this election.\nThink about what just happened in Orlando a few days ago. We can protect more of our kids, our people from the horrors of gun violence. Just a couple of weeks after the worst mass shooting in modern history, Republicans in the U.S. Senate blocked any new gun safety reforms. Republicans in the House wouldn't even allow a vote on them. If you think we can take smart steps to protect our rights and our young people when they go to movies or to worship or to a nightclub or to school, then you've got to vote in this election.\nWe can reform our immigration system in a way that boosts our economy and lives up to our tradition as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. We've got a Congress that refuses to fix a broken immigration system. Just yesterday the Supreme Court couldn't reach a decision on a critical immigration initiative because most Republicans have failed to do their job and even meet with my nominee for the Supreme Court, who everybody, including Republicans, say is eminently qualified for the job.\nSo now it's up to you, the voters. This November, you get to decide whether or not this country gets an immigration policy that is as good and as decent and as sensible as the American people are. It's going to be up to you. You've got to vote!\nTogether, we can make sure the economy works for everybody by strengthening, and not weakening, the rules that keep Wall Street in check; that make sure that folks can't avoid paying their fair share of taxes. Big banks and Republicans have teamed up to try to roll back these rules. Have they really forgotten what happened just 8 years ago? They've opposed our efforts to make sure that financial advisers put your best interests ahead of corporate interests. Why? Wall Street doesn't need more of your retirement savings. You worked for that money.\nThey've even opposed our efforts to close loopholes that let corporations shift their address abroad just to avoid paying their fair share of taxes here in America. You don't get to avoid paying your taxes. Why should they? We should not stack the decks for Wall Street or folks at the very top. We should have closed those loopholes a long time ago and used some of the savings for tax breaks that help working families pay for childcare or send their kids to college or save for retirement or give a break to some young person who is willing to go into teaching or into nursing or some helping profession. That's what we should be doing.\nSo look, on issue after issue, you've got a choice to make this November.\nAudience member. Democrat!\nThe President. We've got to—that's a good choice. [Laughter]\nYou can roll back the progress that we've made on climate, or you can come together to protect our planet. You can roll back our fundamental right to vote, or you can protect it for everybody. You can roll back women's rights to protect every woman's right to earn fair pay and make her own health care choices about her own body. You can choose more or less inequality. You can choose to stack the decks for banks and big polluters and insurance lobbies and the gun lobby, or you can make sure that in America, everybody has got a chance to succeed.\nThat's the choice you face this November: between dividing ourselves up, looking for scapegoats, ignoring the evidence, or realizing that we are all stronger together.\nIf we turn against each other, whether it's divisions of race or religion, we're not going to build on the progress we've started. If we get cynical and just vote our fears, or we don't vote at all, we won't build on the progress we've started.\nAmerica has been a story of progress, but has not gone in a straight line. There have been times where we've gone forward; there have been times where we've gone backwards. And what's made the difference each and every time is citizens voting and caring and committing to our better selves. Coming together around our common values and our faith in hard work and our faith in each other and the belief in opportunity for everybody and assuming the best in each other and not the worst.\nBecause whatever our differences, we all love this country, and we all care fiercely about our children's futures. And we don't have time for charlatans. And we don't have time for hatred. And we don't have time for bigotry. And we don't have time for flimflam. And we don't have the luxury of just popping off and saying whatever comes to the top of our heads. [Laughter] Don't have time for that.\nThere may be setbacks along the way, and our progress will always be unfinished, and every one of you will always have another list of things for me to do. [Laughter] But what I know is that with steady, persistent, collective effort, things get better. With steady, persistent, collective effort and thought and cooperation, we ultimately deliver brighter days for our children and our children's children.\nThat's what I believe. That's what Jay Inslee believes. That's what Patty Murray believes and Suzan DelBene and Derek Kilmer and Ed Murray. That's what we believe. That's why we went into this work. And that's why we need you. That's why you've got to stay involved in this election. It is too important for any of us to stay home. We cannot let anybody else decide our future for us. It's going to be built by us, together, as one Nation, as one people.\nThat's what you're going to do. Because I believe in you. And I've never been more optimistic about the future of the country that we love. I'm going to be right there with you every step of the way. Washington State, let's go get the job done! Let's finish what we started!\nGod bless you. God bless that United States of America.", "timestamp": "2016-06-24", "title": "Remarks at a Reception for Governor Jay R.

Let me begin my thanking Steve and Heather for their extraordinary hospitality and opening up their home. And I'm told that people will put everything back to where it was. [Laughter]\nAudience member. That's what I've been told.\nThe President. That's what you've been told. And I've been told the same. So if it doesn't happen and you need me to come over to help move the chairs around, I'll be happy to help. [Laughter] But thank you to you and your family. We so appreciate your hospitality. That's right, give a big round of applause.\nA couple of people I want to acknowledge. First of all, the reason we do this is because we have some outstanding public servants who are fighting every day the good fight on behalf of a whole bunch of issues. Washington State is lucky to have one of the outstanding delegations of just about any State, and so I just wanted to make sure that everybody has a chance to give him a big round of applause. First of all, Representative Denny Heck. Representative Derek Kilmer. And your neighbor, who I know worked tirelessly to make sure that this was a successful event and is also working tirelessly in Washington and just doing a great job, Suzan DelBene.\nWe also have former Secretary of Commerce Gary Locke. I guess he was also a Governor. [Laughter] And the chair of the DCCC, Ben Ray Luján is here. And finally, somebody who has been my ally, friend, confidante, occasionally has whipped me into shape—I think I've gotten to know a lot of people in politics, and I don't know a lot of people who combine smarts, toughness, passion, savvy, and a big heart more than Nancy Pelosi.\nSo my tradition in relatively intimate settings like this is not to give a long speech. I just spoke to 3,000 folks. I'm sure it's on YouTube. You can take a look at it. [Laughter] I just want to make a couple of brief remarks to set the stage, and then this is really a conversation.\nWe are going through extraordinary times. The speed of transformation that the world is going through is probably unmatched than any time in history. I just came from San Francisco, where we had the seventh of our Global Entrepreneurship Summits. And it is as inspiring an event as we do. We've done them in various parts of the world. And we bring together extraordinary, young, talented entrepreneurs from, in this case, 170 countries.\nI did a panel with Mark Zuckerberg and three of them. One was a woman from Egypt that had started a platform for event organizing in Egypt and now has opened an office in Dubai. Another was a young man from Rwanda who had developed a technology to take refuse and use it as biofuels so you wouldn't see as much chopping down of trees, and would be more environmentally sound. The third was this extraordinary young woman from Peru who was training young women, working class women, into digital skills. And they were now getting jobs in a burgeoning digital economy, not just in Peru, but now in other parts of Latin America. And you listened to them, and it made you so optimistic about the prospects of the world. And it represented all the promise and excitement and opportunity presented by the fact that the world is shrinking and becoming more connected.\nNow, this of course was against the backdrop of Brexit and the nominee of the Presidency for the other party at a golf course—[laughter]—and a reaction to the world shrinking and interconnectedness. And it speaks to how we are at this moment in time in which the opportunities have never been greater, where young people are more educated and more sophisticated and more engaged and more involved than ever before; where by almost every measure, the world is actually healthier, wealthier, less violent, more tolerant than it's ever been before, but where there are also communities that are being left behind, people who feel that their lives have been disrupted by this great change, trend lines that show growing inequality, even after we've recovered from a crisis. And the choices we make now really matter. They really count.\nAnd I would like to say that what we've had over the last 8 years and what we're having now is a serious conversation between two parties, where we've agreed on the facts that there is climate change or that there are problems with inequality or that we have to take seriously the importance of reaching out to young, disaffected people and giving them a chance and investing in education. I'd like to think that we were having a serious conversation of that sort.\nBut that's not what's happened. Because we have a party right on the other side that ignores the science and facts of climate change, that presents budgets whose numbers don't even come close to adding up, that are promoting ideas of cutting taxes for those of us who don't need tax cuts and cutting vital services to the most vulnerable of our populations and threatening to run up deficits. A party that increasingly relies on rhetoric that divides the country as opposed to brings it together. That refuses to even hold a hearing on a Supreme Court nominee that everybody, including Republican themselves have said may be one of the most qualified people ever to be nominated to the bench. The list goes on.\nAnd it's interesting, at the end of my Presidency, I reflect back, and I am not somebody who believes that inherently one party has a monopoly on wisdom. I come from the State of Illinois where the first Republican President was a guy named Abraham Lincoln, and where I believe that our democracy works best when we have a vigorous, serious debate between parties that are trying to genuinely solve the big problems that our country and the world confront.\nBut I cannot say in good conscience that that's what's happening on the other side. And if you didn't think the stakes were high before, you should think the stakes are pretty high right now. And the good news is that, on issue after issue, whether it's commonsense gun laws that might not prevent every death in an Orlando nightclub, but might prevent 100 people being shot and half of those folks being killed in the span of minutes; if you're concerned about making sure that we continue to make progress on climate change—on all these issues, the majority agrees with us. But that has to translate into votes, and that has to translate into seats in Congress, and that has to translate into legislation, and it has to translate into actual policies that impact people's lives.\nA lot of times, we make politics more complicated than it is. If you've got the votes, you get stuff done. And if you don't, the place doesn't work. When Nancy Pelosi was the Speaker of the House, we had a 2-year run that was probably more productive legislatively than any time since the 1960s. When Nancy Pelosi was no longer Speaker, we've got Government shutdowns and dysfunction. And unfortunately, sometimes, this gets reported as Washington not working. No, it's not Washington not working. It is a party that has decided that their approach to maintaining power is to make sure that Washington does not work and to breed to cynicism and to discourage voting in pursuit of either protecting the status quo and the special interests that they represent or in pursuit of an ideological fixation on small government for the sake of small government.\nAnd if we don't do the work that we have to do in order to change that, shame on us. I've got a daughter that just graduated from high school. I just had a chance to meet—Steven had his kid who seemed extraordinary and doing great work. I've had a chance to meet some of your kids in the past, who, some of you brought them here today. If you talk to them, you meet them, you can't help but think our best days are ahead of us. But we've got to do our jobs so that they can actually realize that extraordinary potential. We can't screw up so bad that they can't fix it. And that requires us to have a level of commitment and devotion right now that meets the moment. Your presence here today is a good start, but it's not the end of it. We've got more work to do.\nThanks.", "timestamp": "2016-06-24", "title": "Remarks at a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Fundraiser in Medina, Washington"}

As our Chairman, Congressman Elijah Cummings, directed us at the outset, our platform does not merely reflect common ground—it seeks higher ground.\n\"For the first time ever, our platform calls for ending mass incarceration, shutting down the school-to-prison pipeline, and taking on the challenges of systemic racism. This year's platform contains the most ambitious jobs plan on record, including historic investments in infrastructure, pledges to increase American manufacturing and stop companies from shipping jobs overseas, and a robust, stand-alone plank on youth jobs. It contains ambitious, progressive principles on wages, stating that working people should earn at least $15 an hour, citing New York's minimum wage law and calling for raising and indexing the federal minimum wage. It also calls for the elimination of the 'tipped' wage and for the right of workers to form or join a union. And for the first time, the Democratic Party platform explicitly calls for repealing the Hyde Amendment, which restricts access to women's reproductive rights, particularly low-income women and women of color.\n\"Four years ago, the Democratic platform called for an 'all-of-the-above' energy strategy. This platform moves far beyond that framework, with a robust commitment to combating climate change and ambitious goals, like generating 50 percent of our electricity from clean sources within a decade. This vision was further strengthened through an amendment offered by representatives of both campaigns to see America running entirely on clean energy by mid-century.\n\"We are also pleased that there were many issues where committee members worked collaboratively to articulate a bold vision, including making sure Wall Street greed and recklessness never again threatens American families and businesses on Main Street; proposing a surtax on multi-millionaires to ensure the richest among us are paying their fair share to build an economy that works for everyone; and expanding Social Security benefits by raising more revenue above the $250,000 threshold.\n\"Members also worked together on framing Democrats' shared commitment to comprehensive immigration reform, with an eloquent unity amendment stating, 'Immigration is not a problem to be solved, it is a defining aspect of the American character and history to be supported and defended against those who would exclude or eliminate legal immigration avenues and denigrate immigrants.'\n\"And we are proud the draft 2016 Democratic platform sets forward progressive principles and high standards on trade, including calling for trade agreements to be more protective of workers' rights, labor rights, the environment, and public health. The draft reviewed by committee members yesterday included a call to review past trade agreements and update them to reflect these principles. An amendment adopted yesterday further emphasized the fact that many Democrats oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership because 'the agreement does not meet the standards set out in this platform.' Hillary Clinton is one of those Democrats, and has been strongly and unequivocally on the record opposing TPP. Just this week, she said, 'We will defend American jobs and American workers by saying 'no' to bad trade deals and unfair trade practices, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership.'\n\"Make no mistake about it: The 2016 Democratic platform represents an ambitious, progressive agenda that all Democrats can and should be proud of.\"", "timestamp": "2016-06-25", "title": "Statement from Senior Policy Advisor Maya Harris on Democratic Platform"}

The story of America is a story of progress. It's written by ordinary people who put their shoulders to the wheel of history to make sure that the promise of our founding applies not just to some of us, but to all of us: farmers and blacksmiths who chose revolution over tyranny; immigrants who crossed oceans and the Rio Grande; women who reached for the ballot and scientists who shot for the Moon; the preachers and porters and seamstresses who guided us towards the mountaintop of freedom.\nSometimes, we can mark that progress in special places, hallowed ground where our history was written, places like Independence Hall, Gettysburg, Seneca Falls, Kitty Hawk, and Cape Canaveral. Well, one of these special places is the Stonewall Inn. Back in 1969, as a turbulent decade was winding down, the Stonewall Inn was a popular gathering place for New York City's LGBT community. At the time, being gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender was considered obscene, illegal, even a mental illness.\nOne night, police raided the bar and started arresting folks. Raids like these were nothing new, but this time, the patrons had had enough. So they stood up and spoke out. The riots became protests; the protests became a movement; the movement ultimately became an integral part of America.\nOver the past 7 years, we've seen achievements that would have been unimaginable to the folks who, knowingly or not, started the modern LGBT movement at Stonewall. Today, all Americans are protected by a hate crimes law that includes sexual orientation and gender identity. \"Don't ask, don't tell\" is history. Insurance companies can no longer turn you away because of who you are. Transgender Americans are more visible than ever, helping to make our Nation more inclusive and welcoming for all. And 1 year ago this weekend, we lit the White House in every color, because in every State in America, you're now free to marry the person you love.\nThere's still work to do. As we saw 2 weeks ago in Orlando, the LGBT community still faces real discrimination, real violence, real hate. So we can't rest. We've got to keep pushing for equality and acceptance and tolerance.\nBut the arc of our history is clear: It's an arc of progress. And a lot of that progress can be traced back to Stonewall. So this week, I'm designating the Stonewall National Monument as the newest addition to America's national parks system. Stonewall will be our first national monument to tell the story of the struggle for LGBT rights. I believe our national parks should reflect the full story of our country, the richness and diversity and uniquely American spirit that has always defined us: that we are stronger together; that out of many, we are one. That's what makes us the greatest nation on Earth. And it's what we celebrate at Stonewall, for our generation and for all those who come after us.", "timestamp": "2016-06-25", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}

Just this month, President Obama designated Stonewall as the first national monument commemorating LGBT history in America.\n\"We've also seen how much work is still unfinished.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117673", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:45 P.M. EDT\nMR. SCHULTZ: A full house. I'm sorry to keep you waiting. That's the last thing I'd like to do on this Monday afternoon. But I actually don't have any announcements at the top, so I'm happy to start with your questions.\nKevin.\nQ: Thank you, Eric. So with all the economic turmoil following the decision to exit the EU, is it important for Great Britain to begin making its transition now out of the EU quickly?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Kevin, what we have said is that this will be a process for the EU to work out with the UK. I understand that the UK will need to file its Article 50 before that process can commence. But what we expect is for there to be an orderly process. And I understand that the UK will need to trigger that Article 50 as the sort of first starting point for that process to commence.\nQ: At this stage, it looks like it may not happen until the fall. With all that's going on in the markets, is that too late?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, what we have said is that that's going to have to be a process and a decision -- timeline for the UK to work out with the EU. We're going to remain engaged and we're going to watch it closely, but those are decisions that are going to be principally made by those two governments. And again, our expectation and our priority is on making sure it's an orderly process, it's organized, it's transparent, and as the leadership of both the EU and the UK work out that process, our expectation is that they share those goals as well.\nQ: So with the Supreme Court granting a reprieve today of the former Virginia Governor Robert McDonnell, did the Court make it easier for officials to I guess sell access to their office?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Kevin, it is going to be difficult for me to weigh in on that case because even though it's been heard in front of the United States Supreme Court it's an ongoing criminal matter. So I'm going to have to reserve comment on that particular case and refer you to the Department of Justice.\nRoberta.\nQ: So are U.S. officials at all suggesting or weighing in with their counterparts in the UK or EU on whether the Article 50 should be invoked right away in order to have the orderly process that you all keep talking about?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Roberta, our view is that that's going to be a decision made by the government of the United Kingdom. They obviously have to work through this process. They should do so closely coordinated with their counterparts in the EU. But that's going to be a procedure that's put in place by the two governments. I understand that Prime Minister Cameron has suggested that they will invoke Article 50 into the fall. And again, our expectation is that when this process happens it will be done in an orderly way, organized and transparent.\nQ: So how concerned is the White House about the political chaos that we're seeing in the United Kingdom right now, given that the Prime Minister is only staying until October and the opposition seems to be having some difficulties?\nMR. SCHULTZ: It's going to be hard for me to comment about American domestic politics let alone British domestic politics. I would tell you that it's my understanding that it's not even clear if there's going to have to be elections to succeed Prime Minister Cameron. That might happen in a conference or caucus session later in the fall. So I understand that the experts there are working through that process and that's going to take some time to figure out.\nI can tell you, broadly speaking, that the President has said that our relationship with the United Kingdom is not only special and unique it's enduring. And so we expect that the close ties between not only the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States but the people of the United States and the United Kingdom will continue. We believe the links and ties between our two countries transcends any particular politicians, and so we expect the close ties between our two countries to endure.\nQ: You told us last week about the calls between the President and two of his counterparts right after the Brexit vote, but I'm wondering whether he's spoken with additional leaders over the weekend, if you can tell us about any of those calls.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Roberta, I don't have any additional presidential calls to read out to you at this time. I can tell you that all appropriate facets of our administration have been engaged on this. I'm happy to give you a few of the highlights.\nI know Secretary Kerry spoke Friday with his counterparts in the United Kingdom and in the EU. Yesterday, Secretary Kerry met with his Italian counterpart, and today Secretary Kerry is in Brussels, where he met with the EU President, the EU High Representative, and the NATO Secretary General. Secretary Kerry I believe is either on his way or is in London right now, where he'll be meeting with Prime Minister Cameron and his counterpart, the UK Foreign Secretary.\nI know Secretary Lew has been in touch with all of his counterparts in the G7. He has spoken several times with his counterparts -- in addition to Chancellor Merkel, United Kingdom Chancellor Osborne, Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang. He's also spoken with a number of financial market participants. This is on top of a conference call that Secretary Lew participated in with all of the G7 finance ministers. And it's also on top of an engagement Secretary Carter had with his counterpart with the United Kingdom.\nI will also tell you that our Deputy National Security Advisor for International Economics, Wally Adeyemo, has been attending the G20 sherpa meeting in China, and I'm confident in telling you that this has been a part of his conversations. So he's part of the administration outreach that's going on.\nQ: You keep on talking about this being orderly or the expectation that this is going to be orderly. But S&P just stripped the UK of its top credit rating. And I'm just wondering what evidence you're seeing that this is happening in an orderly fashion.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, Roberta, there's no question that this has prompted volatility in the immediate term in the financial markets. But as we move forward, it's important to stress that the United Kingdom, European and global policymakers have the tools necessary to not just support financial stability but also to promote economic growth. And the good news is our experts, including Secretary Lew, are confident that the United Kingdom policymakers have the tools necessary to promote economic financial stability. They've actually taken a look recently and believe that these banks and financial systems are in much better shape compared to recent years. So I think that's why you're seeing our experts speak confidently about the orderly process moving forward.\nMichelle.\nQ: Thanks, Eric. Given that this is going to be a lengthy process, what do you think is the earliest -- or what are you looking at as the time frame for when the U.S. is going to have to negotiate a trade deal -- with Britain? Are we talking two years? Or is there a chance, in your view, that that's going to happen sooner?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, Michelle, the economic rationale for the T-TIP agreement remains strong. And we intend to continue working with the EU to conclude negotiations as soon as feasible. I know that our United States Trade Representative has set a goal for the end of the year. I know that that work continues in earnest. And quite frankly, the United States Trade Representative's team is evaluating what the impact of the UK's decision is on T-TIP. And obviously we'll be engaging the European Union on this.\nI will also say that heretofore our negotiations have been with the European Commission, obviously the governing structure for the European Union. So if we have to start again with the UK, that's going to just be at a different starting point. That's a matter of sort of sequence and factual underpinnings of the negotiations.\nSo I don't have a new time frame to work out with you right now. But I can say that concluding these negotiations remains a priority for this President. Obviously it's a process that's been underway for years, so we're obviously very -- we've made a lot of progress. We're quite far along in that process with the EU. And if we have to start that with the UK, it's just going to be from a different starting point.\nQ: Okay. But given the volatility and the shakeup that this has caused, doesn't this set T-TIP -- and maybe you could extrapolate that out to the TPP as well -- does this kind of slow everything in terms of big trade deals that were already facing obstacles?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Let's take each of those in turn. The President's commitment to getting a T-TIP agreement has not waned in light of the decision by the British people over the weekend. So that work is going to continue. That work is principally headed out of our United States Trade Representative's office. He's in constant negotiations, principally with the European Commission. So that work is going to continue. In terms of how the Brexit decision affects those negotiations, they're working through that right now. Again, if we have to start negotiating separately with the United Kingdom, that's going to start from a different vantage point, especially because we've had years of progress and work completed with the European Commission.\nIn terms of TPP, this was obviously a deal that was negotiated because of the President's determination to make sure that the United States of America sets the rules of the road when it comes to trade with our partners in the Asia Pacific region. That deal was consummated earlier this year, and now heads to the United States Congress.\nSo I don't have an updated timeline. As you point out, this is an issue that carries with it political complications. The President is acutely aware of that. He understands this has been a difficult issue in the past. He also understand that previous trade agreements have not lived up to the hype. That's actually why he insisted on the toughest human rights, labor, and environmental standards ever to exist in a trade agreement, and that's why he's confident this will pass congressional approval.\nQ: Okay. And when we heard from both the President and the Vice President last week, after the vote, they both talked about the nationalistic sentiment that led up to leaving the EU. And, in fact, the Vice President used the words \"nationalism,\" \"isolationism\" and \"xenophobia.\" So seeing that vote turn out the way it did, does this raise the possibility that those same sentiments will win out in the U.S. in November?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Michelle, I think it's a fair question and I think a lot of people have been speculating about this. It's hard for me to see whether a referendum in the United Kingdom can project a lot about a domestic political race in the United States five months from now. So I'm going to leave it to pundits and my highly paid colleagues on television to offer their views on that.\nI will say that, as you point out, the President and the Vice President have remarked recently and even before this decision that every country has had to cope with globalization and with international trends. So this isn't something new that we're dealing with this past weekend. Generally speaking, I think it's important to know that the President has remarked repeatedly that in moments of uncertainty there are some who have impulses to pull back and to cower and react out of fear. We've seen some of these moments in our history. There are episodes that are generally dark and that we generally regret.\nThe President has a different approach. The President believes we succeed when we are as inclusive as possible and when we embrace not only America's strengths but also America's role in the world.\nLet me just tell you why. We live in a smaller world than ever before. Our national security is more closely linked than at any other time in history. And the interconnectiveness of our global economy is evident nearly every day and sometimes even hourly. Given these facts, it just doesn't make much sense to retreat or to build barricades with other countries. It's also not in our interest.\nLet's look at what we've been able to accomplish with America leading the world. As you know, just under 200 countries signed the first-ever agreement to combat climate change. Nearly 200 countries are taking concrete steps to make sure our planet is preserved for generations to come. Six of the world's most prominent powers -- who don't often see eye-to-eye -- came together to impose the most -- strictest, heaviest sanctions on Iran, which leveraged them to come to the negotiating table and ultimately found a solution to cut off Iran's path to a nuclear weapon.\nAs you pointed out, we were able to secure a trade agreement with 12 other countries, which advanced America's interests, so that America is writing the rules of the road on trade and not China. We assembled a coalition of *68 66 partners to combat the threat against ISIL. The Arab world is heavily represented in that coalition. That just didn't appear overnight. That didn't appear by itself. It was because of the President's determination to lead the international community against this threat that that coalition was formed and continues to have success to this day.\nTwo more examples: The President's leadership on the international stage has isolated Russia more than ever before in recent history. They violated international norms. They violated another country's sovereignty. And the sanctions imposed on that country have led it to shrink its economy by one-sixth. Those weren't just bilateral sanctions, those were sanctions that had the effect they did because of the United States working with our partners around the world.\nLastly, Cuba. Obviously, reopening relations there have not only changed the way we interact with the Cuban people and offers that country a much brighter future, it's also in our economic interest, it's in our security interest, but it's also rewriting all of the relationships in the Western Hemisphere.\nSo the President is proud of his record leading the United States in the international community. And it's one that's not going to stop for the next six months.\nJustin.\nQ: I first wanted to go back to Roberta's question about the political turmoil in the UK. I know you've described some of the outstanding questions, but I think what I wanted to get at a little bit is whether the UK needs to do a better job of laying out the answers to those questions, how the election process -- or lack of election process -- is going to work. So if you could comment on that. And if you don't want to weigh into it, is it implicitly saying that you're not worried that that political turmoil could continue to roil markets in a way that would threaten the U.S. economy?\nMR. SCHULTZ: You're right, I'm not going to weigh into the domestic political situation in Britain. All I would say is the President spoke with Prime Cameron over the weekend. They had a very good conversation. Obviously, Prime Minister Cameron is a good friend of the President. They've worked together on a host issues, ranging from the fight against Ebola to fight against ISIL. The UK remains a valued member of NATO. They're actually one of the few countries that not only committed to making 2 percent of their GDP defense-related, but have lived up that commitment.\nSo the President deeply values his relation with Prime Minister Cameron, but he also knows that the bonds between the United Kingdom and the United States are going to endure. So I don't have any political prognostication for you to do on the British domestic process.\nQ: Well, it's not prognostication as much as do you think the UK needs to say, this is the sort of time frame, this is the timeline, this is how things are going to work?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I think that will happen. I think the British people and the British government will lay out a time frame for that to happen. So I'm not going to second-guess that from here in advance of them doing so.\nQ: Is it fair to say that you guys were caught by surprise by Brexit?\nMR. SCHULTZ: It's not. National Security Advisor Susan Rice spoke over the weekend, and she made clear that we have contingency plans for both outcomes. Obviously we had hoped for a different outcome, but it would have been irresponsible to not plan for both outcomes.\nQ: You mentioned Secretary Lew spoke with Chancellor Merkel. That's in addition to President Obama doing so. Can you just kind of describe what you see is her role in addressing the sort of crisis that has resulted in Brexit?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I can. Yes, so Secretary Lew spoke with Chancellor Merkel in the past day or so, and the President spoke with Chancellor Merkel over the weekend -- or early Friday, I guess. And in that conversation, the President and the Chancellor expressed regret for the decision, but they also expressed respect for the decision and the acknowledgement that the British people have spoken. And in light of that, there needs to be an orderly process for which the UK can depart the European Union.\nSo, again, there's some sequencing there that still needs to be worked out. But I think that obviously the President has deep respect for Chancellor Merkel and her leadership not only in Germany, but also as one of our NATO allies. And so I expect the President to continue to be in close touch with Chancellor Merkel, but I also expect members of the administration and White House staff to be in close touch with their counterparts and the German government.\nQ: Last one. There were reports over the weekend that millions of dollars' worth of CIA weapons were sold by Jordanian intelligence officials -- they were intended for the rebels in Syria. I'm wondering if you could talk about that situation, but also whether it sort of undercuts your guys' claims that the people that these weapons were going to were carefully vetted and what the impact on the relationship with Jordan might be.\nMR. SCHULTZ: In terms of the relationship with Jordan, obviously we remain committed to Jordan's security and stability. We're proud to stand side by side with Jordan in the global coalition to counter ISIL. Jordan has been a valuable partner in that effort, and we appreciate all of their contributions.\nFor questions regarding this particular episode, I would say a couple of things. One is, there's an ongoing investigation into that particular shooting, so I would have to refer you to the FBI on the latest on that. In terms of the International Police Training Center, that is a center that has been stood up to promote training for the Jordanians and international security forces. That's a center that's supported by our State Department, so if you have questions about that center, that State Department would be point for you on that.\nRon.\nQ: You just said that National Security Advisor Rice was planning contingencies. What were some of the concerns that had to be planned for?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, Ron, I think that we had made our views clear on this, that our belief was that a strong European Union includes the United Kingdom. So obviously that's a view that the President had. But we also believe that this was a decision for the British people. So given the vote -- we had wanted this to come out in the direction, but in the weeks and months ahead of that, there's meetings and contingency plans built. Those are principally an interagency process that's mostly at our Department of Treasury and our Department of State, but coordinated by the White House.\nQ: How much of a national security concern to America is this? We've talked a lot about the trade deals and economics involved, but how much of this -- how much does this affect America's national security that Britain is no longer going to be in the EU?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, the good news is -- Ambassador Rice addressed this yesterday as well, and she made clear that the UK will remain a key leader with the NATO Alliance, and we look forward to the UK's participation in the July 8th NATO Summit in Warsaw. Obviously, the President will be there, and obviously this will be an item on the agenda. But we're going to continue to work bilaterally and through NATO to ensure our collective security cooperation. Secretary Carter has spoken to his British counterpart, Secretary Fallon, to affirm that the special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom will remain a bedrock of U.S. security and defense policy.\nAs we mentioned before, the U.S. and the UK have close ties. A lot of those ties are in the security arena. So you look at intelligence-sharing, you look at our efforts to combat ISIL, you look at defense spending. So those are ties that are not going to change in light of the UK's decision.\nQ: I feel like the special relationship changes because of this missing economic component of it, which is significant.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, in our view, the special relationship endures. Like I mentioned to Michelle and Roberta, the actual negotiations over the T-TIP need to be looked at. But in terms of our economic ties with Britain, they remain strong and vibrant as they ever have been. And so if you look at our commercial ties, our trade, if you look at cultural exchanges -- people-to-people -- those remain strong and robust, and I don't anticipate that to wane in light of the decision by the British people from the weekend.\nQ: But in terms of the economics and trade, the President famously said \"back of the queue,\" and you have to take him at his word.\nMR. SCHULTZ: We do. And that's what I meant when I said that the negotiations for T-TIP have been going on for years and we are so far along that our United States Trade Representative, Michael Froman, has said he wants to close them out by the end of the year. So if we have to start from the beginning with the British people, it's just going to, as a matter of fact, be at a different queue.\nQ: But it will substantively as important a relationship between the United States and a smaller Britain. They're not analogous. It's a huge trading bloc of 20-plus nations versus one nation that you're now negotiating. Some of this is theoretical, obviously, because it hasn't happened yet.\nMR. SCHULTZ: You're right, the departure hasn't happened. But I guess I'd dispute the suggestion that our relationship with Britain is going to be altered from the sort of closeness that we have now. If you take a look at a lot of the areas where we have intense cooperation -- that's the counter-ISIL campaign; that's, again, our cooperation within NATO; again, Britain is one of the few countries to live up to its commitment to assign 2 percent of its GDP for defense spending. That's robust intelligence-sharing. That's bilateral trade -- existing bilateral trade. And again, that's also cultural exchanges. All of these links will continue even in the wake of what the British people decided on Thursday.\nQ: And lastly, on Brexit. Scotland and Northern Ireland -- is the President going to weigh in on that? As he said, friends should tell friends what friends think. (Laughter.) And he stepped into London and he said --\nMR. SCHULTZ: Sounds like a PSA, Ron. (Laughter.)\nQ: The point is, does he have a position on whether Scotland and Northern Ireland should remain part of the UK?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, when this came up for a referendum back in the fall of 2014, the President did weigh in. At the time, he said that this was a decision for the Scottish people to make. But he also made clear that he believes a United Kingdom is a strong United Kingdom. And so I don't have any new positions to read out right now.\nQ: And just lastly, is there any new word on the Hillary Clinton -- you anticipated it obviously -- the delayed Wisconsin event.\nMR. SCHULTZ: As you know, the President and Secretary Clinton were scheduled to campaign together in Green Bay a few weeks ago. In light of the terrorist attack in Orlando, that even was pulled down. So I don't yet have an update for the schedule. I can affirm for you that the President is eager to get out there on the campaign trail. I think some of you got a taste of that over the weekend. He had a few political events where he articulated the case that he'll be making. But we don't yet have that nailed down in the schedule yet.\nApril.\nQ: I have two, following up on what Ron said. Why is he so eager? Is the eagerness about trying to secure or help secure votes for Hillary Clinton that are still kind of out there, weighing their options between the two presumptive nominees? Or is it because he's back on the trail for one last time, even though it's not for himself?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I think it's neither. There's a lot at stake in this election. If you look at a range of national security and domestic issues, the views of the two candidates could not be further apart.\nObviously the President has made his views known about who he wants to see succeed him in office. I think that is based on not only a personal relationship with Secretary Clinton, but also the President's experience working in the Oval Office, sitting behind that desk, leading this country and facing down the challenges that he's faced on a daily basis.\nIf you just take a couple of examples, one is the President's economic record -- that we have a choice in this country whether to continue the progress we've made over the past seven years. That progress includes the longest stretch of private sector job growth our country has ever seen. That's probably a statistic that a lot of people in this room would have laughed at me -- I didn't work here in 2009, but if the person who was here made that argument in 2009, I think you guys would have been rightfully suspicious of that.\nAs you know, April, the unemployment rate has been cut by more than half and now stands at 4.7 percent, again, reaching that level far sooner than expected. Manufacturing has added 832 [thousand] jobs over the past 75 months. This is the fastest streak of manufacturing jobs since the 1990s. Rising home prices have brought millions of homeowners back above water. Health care prices have risen at the lowest rate in 50 years. The budget deficit has been cut by nearly three-quarters.\nSo the President has made a lot of progress over the past seven years. That's not to mention what we've done in climate change. That's not to mention what we've done in housing, on reducing the deficit, on a whole host of other areas. But there's a lot of work to be done. And I think that's why the President is so focused on this upcoming race.\nQ: So with all of that, all of these successes, we're about a month out or so from the Democratic convention. And has the President begun to write or tell his staff what the key components that you already know -- the key components of his speech, what it will be? And is it going to be an easy speech since you are able to tout so easily what he has accomplished, his successes, when he goes into Philadelphia?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I don't have an update on our speechwriting process for the convention. I can tell you that generally this is a responsibility the President takes seriously; that he's not only President of the United States, he's the leader of the Democratic Party, so he wants to make sure this convention is as successful as possible.\nI do think that those of you who accompanied the President on this past trip got a preview of the argument that he's going to be making. I don't know how similar the text of the remarks will be to what we gave earlier this past weekend to what he'll speak to in Philadelphia, but I do think thematically, the President has a strong record. It's one he's proud of and one he wants to continue.\nI would also note I saw that Leader McConnell was on the TV this weekend and could not articulate any comfortability with his party's nominee. He could not state that his party's nominee was qualified to be President of the United States. Yet Leader McConnell is the Senate architect of their strategy to hold open a seat on the highest court in the land for him to fill. So you'll have to ask them how they square those two positions. But we often talk about cynicism in Washington, and I can't think of anything more cynical than what they're trying to do there.\nQ: So you're saying that right now, today, June 27th, the outline for the speech for next month is pretty much somewhat laid already -- because he kind of gave it this weekend -- kind of started this weekend?\nMR. SCHULTZ: What I was trying to say, April, is that the argument that the President will make on the campaign trail are some of the arguments you've already heard.\nQ: I mean the main --\nMR. SCHULTZ: I understand -- are arguments you've already heard. The convention speech is obviously a cut above in terms of importance and in terms of prominence, mostly because of the attention that will be paid to that speech. So I don't have an update on where we are in the speechwriting process. Obviously when speeches are of this importance, the President spends a lot of time on them. So I wouldn't be surprised if he's already engaged in the process. But I don't have an update in terms of where the drafts are.\nPam.\nQ: Eric, do you have any reaction to the Supreme Court decision on the gun rights case today, and does that figure at all into the debate that's going on on gun rights?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I saw that decision. Obviously we're pleased with it, that it's consistent with the Solicitor General's arguments in that case. I don't know of any sort of discernable impact it would have on the debate in Congress. Again, I, unfortunately, saw Leader McConnell's appearance on John's network this weekend where he said when asked about this issue that it's time to move on. It's time to move on from doing something on gun safety. I don't think the families of the 49 killed in Orlando think it's time to move on. I don't think that the families of the children in Newtown think it's time to move on.\nI'm not sure why Leader McConnell said that, but it seems to me that when you can't even take common-sense steps to prevent gun violence -- like making sure that those who our homeland security officials have deemed too dangerous to board a flight, making sure those people can't also -- can't buy a firearm -- if you are not even able to tackle an issues that is so sensical sensible as that, then I don't know why you're here. I don't know why you were sent to Washington. This is an issue that enjoys bipartisan support amongst Democrats and Republicans. It's also an issue that makes common sense, and it's also an issues supported by our national security experts -- our homeland security experts.\nSo I know that Leader McConnell said he wants to move on. But we hope he revisits that decision.\nQ: I'm sorry if this has already been asked, but do you have any reaction to TransCanada suing over the rejection of the Keystone pipeline?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Pam, I did see that. We don't comment on pending litigation or arbitration. But I do know that Secretary Kerry has -- well, the State Department spoke to this over the weekend and basically what they reiterated is that last November, Secretary Kerry determined that the Keystone XL pipeline did not serve the national interest. And we're confident that this determination is entirely consistent with all of our domestic and international obligations, including the obligations under NAFTA. And we're confident that will be upheld.\nNadia.\nQ: Thank you, Eric. Change of topic. The leader of Hezbollah made a rather drastic statement during the weekend that they receive funds and weapons from Iran. While it is not new, does this shock you that actually he's coming straightforward and confessing that they're taking all their money from the Iranian government?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, Nadia, I can't get into intelligence matters, but we have called on all those who fund Hezbollah to stop doing so. We know that Iran supports terrorism, and we know that Iran supports Hezbollah. And that is why we've issued the most serious and most severe sanctions ever on Iran for doing so. So it's important for them to recognize their own behavior in enabling this.\nAnd we've had a conversation recently about Iran's concerns about access to international markets. Well, those financial actors are looking at Iran's behavior. And if Iran is going to continue to fund terrorism and continue to supply resources to Hezbollah, that is going to have impact. Those financial actors don't want to do business with a country that's doing that.\nSo we call on Iran to not only stop doing this because it's not good for national security and they're supporting terrorism, but we call on Iran to stop doing it because it's not in their interest either.\nQ: -- he also said that they don't need the banking system, that the money that they're getting from the Iranians are already going to them, whether it's cash or other methods, et cetera. So in this case, you have little leverage in terms of what money has reached them through the banking system.\nMR. SCHULTZ: I'm not sure that's true, Nadia. We are going to continue to use all the tools at our disposal, including sanctions, to target this group that we have, of course, designated as a foreign terrorist organization. We believe our designations over the past year designating Hezbollah procurement networks, financial and commercial front companies and other entities have been highly effective. The sanctions regime passed earlier this year further builds on that and has created a climate throughout the world where financial institutions are rejecting Hezbollah from their institutions.\nBut your point is well taken that if Iran is going to continue to support Hezbollah, Hezbollah is going to continue to have a funding stream and resources. That's why it's all the more important that if Iran wants access to international markets they're going to need to curb their own behavior.\nJulianna.\nQ: The President put out a paper statement on the Texas abortion case this morning, but I'm wondering if you could just address the significance of the ruling.\nMR. SCHULTZ: As the President said, he was pleased that the Supreme Court issued a ruling protecting women's rights and their ability to make decisions on their health. This is an opinion that was consistent with not only what the Solicitor General argued in front of the Court, but it's also consistent with the President's values on a position that he's been articulating since day one.\nOur bottom line is that a decision on women's health should be made by that particular woman. And this is an individual, private matter and one that shouldn't be subject to government intrusion.\nQ: How significant would you say --\nMR. SCHULTZ: Sure. Well, I would say that obviously the President believes that a woman's right to choose and a woman's right to make this decision free from interference from the government is a important principle for this President, but also one that's been upheld by the Court in the past. So we are pleased by today's decision. We think it's an important one in that it underscores the reproductive freedom of women across the country. We believe that government should not intrude on these most private family matters, and that women should be able to make their own choices about their body and health care.\nAlexis.\nQ: Can I just follow up on the question about the rescheduling of the President's -- is it possible because of the President's travel schedule that the President might not actually reschedule the event with Hillary Clinton and would appear at the convention with her instead?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I haven't heard that contemplated. I think they will be hitting the campaign trail together. I'm just unable to offer you a new date for when that's going to happen. But as I said, the President is eager to get out there and campaign for Secretary Clinton. He thinks he has a forceful case to make and he's looking forward to making that.\nQ: As you might know, today former Senator Brown, as a surrogate for Donald Trump, today was suggesting that Senator Warren could clear up questions about her Indian heritage if she took a DNA test. Do you have any reaction to that suggestion?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I do not.\nCheryl.\nQ: Thanks, Eric. On Zika funding, I know that the Senate is going to try to defeat that bill the White House -- you said that the President would veto it. How do we get to a bill that the President can sign quickly? What is your best-case scenario for moving forward?\nMR. SCHULTZ: It's a very good question, and I think the answer is that House Republicans stop playing games; that they unfortunately have turned a public health emergency into a political football, and that's unfortunate. Again, we talk a lot about the cynicism in Washington, and to walk away from the negotiating table so that Democrats can't even sign off on a bill isn't leadership. It's a weakness.\nAnd again, like we've talked about, it doesn't even look like the Senate could pass the bill. So if presented with the bill, the President would veto it. I'm happy to outline why. But it's not even clear that this could pass muster in the United States Senate.\nAgain, our principal concerns about the bill come in four baskets. One, it's woefully inadequate. The President's request was for $1.9 billion, but it's even misleading to call it the President's request. This was a document and calculations put together by our public health professionals who determined that this would be the adequate funding needed to take on this situation.\nSecondly, it steals money from other critically important public health priorities, like funding the Affordable Care Act and funding the effort against Ebola. We have personnel I think from the CDC on the ground right now in West Africa working on prevention, working on making sure another outbreak doesn't occur. I think it would be grossly irresponsible to take them off the job. I don't know if House Republicans have figured that out, but maybe they should spend some time thinking about it.\nThird, the bill includes an ideological rider blocking access to contraception for women in the United States, including women in Puerto Rico, even though this is a sexually transmitted disease. That, again, makes zero sense, especially since we're already seeing transmission in Puerto Rico.\nAnd then, lastly, this is a bill that contains an ideological rider to gut the provisions in clean water regulations. Again, makes no sense. Also doesn't belong intelligence bill.\nSo we call on Republicans to get serious about this, and we hope they get to work soon.\nQ: So you're willing to wait then. I mean, I guess --\nMR. SCHULTZ: We absolutely don't want to wait. And let me be clear. We submitted a proposal in February. It was put together and drafted by our public health professionals that outlined in detail what resources the federal government needed. So nobody in the White House is waiting. In fact, we have deployed as many resources as possible that we can do on our own. We have reprogrammed some of the money that was allocated for Ebola in order to combat this threat. But the President has been clear that we can't do this alone. This is going to require congressional action. That's why we requested the $1.9 billion, and that's why we think Congress should get to work in passing it.\nA few things that are not being funded right now because of Republican intransigence -- if you just look at the state of Florida, money is needed right now in the state of Florida because mosquito control, which is a central element of the efforts to combat the virus, are spotty and underfunded. The battle to squash the virus began months ago in Florida, but over two dozen local governments in Florida are collectively seeking millions of dollars to stop the threat. The state of Florida alone needs to hire more inspectors, buy more insecticide, lay more mosquito traps, and conduct a more effective public information campaign on this. But they're unable to do so because they don't have the funding.\nSo I don't know how the House delegation in Florida -- how hard they're working on this, but it seems to me that if their junior senator has stepped up to the plate to say that Florida and the United States deserves this funding, it seems to me like those House Republicans maybe shouldn't have acquiesced to the Speaker who passed a bill that does almost nothing.\nOlivier.\nQ: Thanks, Eric. There are some U.S. firms that put down roots in the UK, hoping to gain and keep access to EU markets. They are understandably concerned now. Do you have a plan to help them? Or do they assume a certain amount of risk and they have to live with it now?\nMR. SCHULTZ: My understanding, Olivier -- and I don't know if you're talking about specific contracts --\nQ: For example, there's some PhRMA, there's some financial services that put down pretty considerable -- they invested a fair amount.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Yes. So my understanding is that existing contracts will remain legally binding. But if you have specific questions about specific contracts, I'd obviously refer you to the company that's in question. But my understanding is, generally speaking, most of these will be legally binding.\nQ: And there's some talk that the UK's eventual withdrawal from the EU, if that happens, will weaken the consensus on sanctions against Russia. How concerned are you about that? And overall, do you think the Brexit vote was a victory for Vladimir Putin?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I understand there's been some public speculation on this, but our view is we don't expect the UK's referendum to have any impact on the rollover of sanctions against Russia. As you know, this was talked about recently at the G7 in Japan, where some of you accompanied the President to. Since the start of the crisis in Ukraine, the United States, the EU and the G7 have worked in close cooperation to develop a set of sanctions that have had a deep impact on the Russian economy.\nSo our understanding is those will roll over. But obviously, United States officials will be working on that in the coming weeks and months. But again, all of the G7 partners in Japan issued a commitment that the sanctions will stay in place unless Russia decides to start to abide by the Minsk agreements. If they start to abide by those agreements, those sanctions can start to be rolled back.\nSo President Putin has a choice to make. He can either continue down this path, which has been harmful for the Russian economy -- as I mentioned, the Russian economy has contracted about one-sixth. It's smaller than the Spanish economy right now. That's a direct result of a number of factors, but it's hard to ignore the impact of the sanctions. Again, these weren't just bilateral sanctions put in place with the United States, they were sanctions that, thanks to the American leadership around the world, a whole host of international partners did so as well. That's why the sanctions have had such impact.\nChris.\nQ: Eric, on Friday, Defense Department reported in media reports as saying the Pentagon would lift the ban on open transgender service in coming weeks after -- agreement on the issue. Was the White House involved in getting agreement to go forward? Do you have any reaction to it?\nMR. SCULTZ: Chris, I saw those reports. I don't have official reaction from the White House on that. Obviously, that's a decision made by our Defense Department officials. So I don't have any updates for you on that process.\nQ: But like aren't you pleased that there's greater -- a move towards greater inclusion in the military?\nMR. SCULTZ: Well, the President has actually spoken to this. He was at -- he spoke recently at the Air Force commencement. And he was deeply moved by not only the caliber of the cadets, but also the diversity of the class. He saw openly gay students. He saw Muslim Americans, Hispanic Americans. He saw women graduate who would soon serve in combat. So he's spoken quite frequently about the inclusivity of our military and how that is a strength and helps make our military the greatest in the world.\nQ: And that would apply to transgender troops, as well?\nMR. SCULTZ: Again, you're asking about a specific policy decision made by our Defense Department officials. So I don't want to get ahead of them.\nQ: One more thing. Secretary Clinton marched yesterday in New York City's Pride, despite having complications with a Secretary Service detail. Did the President miss an opportunity by not participating in a Pride parade during his administration, especially to make -- at the same time to coincide with designating the national monument in honor of the Stonewall riots?\nMR. SCULTZ: Well, Chris, I'm glad you brought up the national monument that was announced over the weekend. I think the President's record on this issue is well known.\nAs you know, under his administration, don't ask, don't tell was repealed; the Defense of Marriage Act was rejected; insurance companies now can't discriminate based on who you love, and gay marriage is the law of the land. So I think the President's record on this strong. It's one he's enormously proud of.\nObviously, the history at Stonewall is well known. In 1969, a few bar patrons resisted arrest. That resistance led to protest; that protest led to a movement. And that movement led to enormous progress towards equality.\nBut like you're suggesting, the fight isn't over. And the President is acutely aware of that. That's why he's worked hard on this, and that's why it's going to be an issue that's always important to him.\nQ: Well, concerning the President's record and his views, why didn't he make an appearance to -- at the Pride celebration -- to announce the designation of the national monument?\nMR. SCULTZ: I think the President was enormously proud to announce that designation earlier this week. Obviously, we were coming back from Seattle on Saturday morning. So I don't have any second-guessing to do on the President's schedule. But again, I think the President's record speaks for itself. And he was enormously proud to designate this monument over the weekend.\nKevin.\nQ: Thank you. I want to follow up on Brexit for just a second. We're sort of awash in the minutia of what's been happening. But for the average American, should they be concerned? If so, why? And if not, why not?\nMR. SCULTZ: Well, I think what's important for the average American to realize that this was a decision for the British people, and the British people have spoken. And it's a decision in the United States that we respect.\nIt's also important for average people to understand that the special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom remains, and it's going to be a bedrock of U.S. security and foreign policy. Likewise, the European Union remains an indispensable partner of the United States in stimulating economic growth and addressing regional and global challenges.\nAs the UK and the EU begin the process of negotiating the UK's departure, we're going to continue our robust work both in London and in Brussels and in other EU capitals to ensure continued stability, security, and prosperity both in Europe and all over the world.\nQ: So based on that, the average American has nothing to be concerned about or to fear based on the UK's independent decision to leave the EU?\nMR. SCULTZ: I think that as Secretary Lew said earlier today, and as other financial experts have attested, that there are now safeguards in place in a lot of these systems -- international systems and European banks -- that buttress their resilience to be able to deal with market fluctuations or headwinds.\nBut if you're worried about what comes next, I think you are absolutely right to raise the question because we are going to continue to work closely with London and with Brussels and our international partners. So I'm not going to get ahead of this process between the UK and the EU to figure out. But we're going to remain engaged. We're going to make sure that this is an orderly process. That's our expectation. But it also seems to be a goal that's shared by both the UK and the EU.\nQ: And the reason I ask the question is because you have Secretaries Kerry and Lew out there, and Advisor Rice out there. You have a cadre of heavy hitters out there responding to this. And so I think people wonder if that's the viewpoint, if that's the way the White House is handling this, should we all be a little bit more concerned about it -- as opposed to, oh, that's just a vote over there. Do you understand my meaning?\nMR. SCULTZ: I do. I hesitate to bring up the\ncounterfactual, but I have a feeling that if our administration weren't out there responding, you could imagine the questions we'd be getting for why aren't we responding to this. I think that Secretary Kerry's travel and comments on this, Secretary Lew's comments on this, our National Security Advisor, Susan Rice were making important comments. And I do think it's important to communicate with the American people what our view is, what we think the consequences are of this decision. And so we're going to continue to do that.\nQ: I want to ask you about what seems to be a bit of a standoff between the White House and the House Select Committee on Benghazi over whether the President should answer questions, a series of questions about the 2012 terrorist attack that left four Americans dead. We understand that Counsel to the President Neil Eggleston feels like the questions were inappropriate. I'm just wondering, as an American, why wouldn't the President want to explain not just what was happening that night, where he was, what was happening directly as it relates to his evening, but also why not answer more specific questions about it in the interest of transparency?\nMR. SCULTZ: Sure, Kevin. Today -- I looked this up -- it is the 781st day of this committee. This a committee that has gone on longer than the 9/11 Commission, than the committee designated to look at Pearl Harbor, the assassination of President Kennedy, the Iran-Contra Affair, and Watergate.\nQ: But not longer than the studying of the pipeline through Canada.\nMR. SCULTZ: Kevin. (Laughter.)\nQ: That was lasted about 2,000 days or something, right? I'm just saying.\nMR. SCULTZ: Look, the problem is this is not the first committee to look into this, right? This has gone on for a couple years now. But the investigations into this attack started moments after the attack. This is actually not the second or third committee to look into this, this is the eighth. This is the eighth. Republicans have been investigating this exhaustively. And with each turn of the crank, they're unable to prove some of the wild conspiracy theories they've been proffering for years. So it's not surprising to me that Republicans want to look at every possible crevice for a new conspiracy. Unfortunately, when they do so, they come up with nothing.\nSo if you're wondering where the President was that night, there's an easy place to find out. On the White House Flickr feed we actually released a photo image of what the President was doing, and he was getting briefed by his White House team on the attack.\nSo I know Republicans don't want to believe that photo. Maybe they think it was Photoshopped. Maybe they think it was fake. But it's 100 percent authentic. And it's a question we answered years ago.\nIf you're asking about our cooperation with this committee, it is far-ranging. We at the White House -- just the White House produced nearly 1,500 pages of documents. The State Department produced 100,000 pages. State Department officials sat down for 53 transcribed interviews. The Defense Department sat down for 24 transcribed interviews, sent over a thousand pages of documents. The Department of Justice sent over 84 intelligence products. The CIA produced 10,000 pages of documents. The Director of National Intelligence has produced 429 documents. And none of that includes the previous seven committees.\nSo I don't know why Republicans are obsessed with this. But given the other priorities that we've been talking about -- Zika funding. We haven't even mentioned Puerto Rico, cybersecurity, criminal justice reform -- given all of the other priorities pending right now before Congress, common-sense measures to combat gun violence, maybe they should get to work on something they can have actual impact on.\nQ: Last question. The President, in comments to a DCCC fundraiser on Friday, didn't really mention the sit-in over at the House. That was a bit of a surprise, to be honest, because the Democrats seemed to be making a big deal. Is it because the White House sort of wants to distance itself from that sort of sit-in, that protest? Or does the White House simply feel like it's not something that should be used to proffer in political ads and that sort of thing?\nMR. SCULTZ: I see. The answer is not at all, Kevin. Everyone at the White House, including the President, was hugely supportive of Congressman Lewis's leadership on this. The President sent out a tweet as a small gesture of support. But the President's record on this and views on this are well known. My colleague, Josh Earnest, spoke of the Senate vote as a \"shameful display of cowardice\". House Republicans have found an even new low. They wouldn't even call for a vote. It was a humiliating moment for Republican House leadership.\nIf the Speaker believes that, again, someone who is too dangerous to board a plane ought to be able to purchase a firearm, he should go ahead and make a floor speech and call the yeas and nays. He should have the vote. He should make the case. If he believes that not everyone should be subject to background checks before purchasing a firearm, make the case. Have a speech. Call the vote.\nI looked up that 85 percent of the people of Wisconsin believe in universal background checks. He should have to answer for that. His caucus should be accountable for what they believe.\nJohn.\nQ: I have one more question about the Brexit. You told --\nMR. SCULTZ: I doubt it. (Laughter.)\nQ: You said that the Treasury Secretary was confident the UK has the tools to promote stability there. Just looking at the global markets, it looks like about $2 trillion has been wiped out just since the vote. I guess I'm wondering if there's any concern by the administration that this action in the UK could either undo some of the progress that the administration feels it's made since the 2008 financial crisis, or what they think the long-term impact will be?\nMR. SCULTZ: Well, you're right, we have seen volatility in the markets. There's no question. And I don't mean to dismiss that. What I'm talking about is Secretary Lew and his team determining that the UK and other policymakers around Europe are well prepared and have the tools necessary to support economic and financial stability over the long term. The European financial system's resilience has significantly improved in recent years.\nWe are in close contact with our G7 and other international counterparts, and we're going to continue to consult and cooperate as appropriate. I think you saw a joint statement from G7 released in the wake of the vote. I'd refer you to that statement, which also expressed confidence in the resilience of the systems in place. And I do think that we've seen progress, and we've seen more safeguards built into the system since that crisis. So I think that speaks to why Secretary Lew made those comments.\nQ: You've also talked about the respect that the President and the administration has for the British people's vote on this referendum. Some people, though, have been calling for maybe a second round of voting. Does the administration believe that that would be a mistake to do that?\nMR. SCULTZ: John, like you said, we respect the vote that happened on Thursday. The British people have spoken. I know that the British ambassador to the U.S. was on TV over the weekend, and he talked about this being irrevocable. So, clearly, that's their position. I know that Chancellor Merkel earlier today said she deals with facts, and the facts are this is what the British people voted for. So I'm going to stick in that camp, too.\nQ: Just one final question, following up on Kevin's line on Benghazi. Some of the questions that have kind of been, I guess, a signal that the committee had in their questionnaire, a written questionnaire, seem pretty straightforward. I know that -- I see what the counselor's advice was. But just as far as the question, the administration said that the President got briefed around 5:00 p.m. The attacks started at 3:42 p.m. Was that briefing, would you say, was that the first that he had learned about the attack? Somebody must have said, hey, this attack happened, we're going to do a briefing in 20 minutes or whatever, right? So how did he first learn of the attack?\nMR. SCHULTZ: John, I don't have a tick-tock of the President's schedule from September 11th, 2012. All I can tell you that Republicans continue to try and muster and fabricate and manufacture fake conspiracies about this. But the President's views on this were not only articulated in the wake of the attack, but the President -- we released details -- we released photo imagery of the President from that evening. And we've also seen Republicans investigate this exhaustively. It was the former House Speaker-in-waiting who admitted that this was all a political exercise. He said -- what everyone knew in private, he said in public -- which is the Benghazi Select Committee was a committee designated to bring down Hillary Clinton's poll numbers. So let's not pretend this is on the level.\nYou've got Republicans who previously investigated this, who found, based on their own investigations -- this isn't Democrats, this is House Chairman Mike Rogers, a renowned and respected Republican who no longer serves in the House, but was renowned and respected when he was there -- he said, \"After reviewing hundreds of pages of raw intelligence, as well an open-source information, it was clear that between the time when the attacks occurred and when the administration, through Ambassador Susan Rice, appeared on the Sunday talk shows, intelligence analysts and policymakers received a stream piecemeal intelligence regarding the identities and affiliations and motivations of the attackers, as well as the level of planning and coordination. Much of the intelligence was conflicting. And two years later, intelligence gaps remain.\"\nIn the aftermath of its own intensive investigation, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, a majority reported that the interagency coordination on the talking points followed the normal but rushed coordination procedure, and that there were no efforts by the White House or executive branch entities to cover up facts or make alterations for political purposes. So this is a Republican conspiracy theory in search of a conspiracy.\nJuliet.\nQ: The CBC is reporting that President Obama is preparing, as part of the North American Leaders Summit, to pledge that the U.S. would obtain half of its electricity from clean energy sources by 2025, which would be an extremely ambitious pledge. It would be more ambitious than not only what we're on track to do, but what even Hillary Clinton has sought to do. Can you comment on whether that's accurate and what the President's plans are regarding that?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Sure. I can't preview any announcements that will be made in Ottawa on Wednesday. I can say that we do ambitious well, here at the White House. So I know that my colleagues will be having a call later this afternoon to talk about the contours of the summit and what the President hopes to achieve there. But in terms of any announcements that are associated with the North American Leaders Summit, I'm going to let the leaders announce those up there.\nObviously, on the agenda is a host of issues. That includes trade, obviously between the three nations -- 500 million people and billions of dollars -- sorry, 500 million people are the consumer base between the three countries. And billions of dollars exchange hands every day because of trade between our three countries.\nSo the North American region is and will continue to be an economic powerhouse. I also expect the President and his counterparts to discuss border crossings, border security. I think you can expect the conversation to include -- to extend beyond economic interests, but also cooperating on efforts to tackle transnational organized crime, battle infectious disease outbreaks like Ebola and Zika, alleviate poverty and inequality, expand refugee protection and assistance, and combat the effects of climate change.\nSo I'm going to stop there and let my colleagues handle the rest. Thanks.\nMark.\nQ: Eric, the Turks and the Israelis announced they were normalizing relations today. I just had a small question. I was curious why, when the Prime Minister of Israel called, he spoke with Vice President Biden instead of the President, who has obviously been involved in encouraging this rapprochement also.\nMR. SCHULTZ: I don't have any new calls from the President to read out to you. But if that changes, we'll let you know. I am happy to respond to the news and say that the President is pleased that Israel and Turkey have agreed to restore diplomatic relations. The United States welcomes this important step in improving relations between two key partners in the region. And we believe this will open up new opportunities for cooperation in the eastern Mediterranean. Obviously, the governments of Israel and Turkey will have more to say, considering this was an agreement reached between the two of them.\nBut, yes, I know that Prime Minister Netanyahu spoke with the Vice President, and Prime Minister Netanyahu also met with Secretary Kerry on this. And we believe it's an important milestone. We believe there's important security and economic benefits for both countries and the world.\nQ: Was the Vice President particularly involved? I mean, I know he's spoken to the Prime Minister about this, too. I mean, is that something he's taken on that would explain the phone call?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Sure. You should check in with the Vice President's office if there is specific engagement they're able to read out to you. But obviously this is something that the President and the Vice President and the entire administration welcome.\nLauren.\nQ: Back to this Supreme Court decision on abortion. The pro-life folks say that the reason that the law was put -- and the restrictions were put into play was to force clinics to meet hospital-like standards, saying that the ruling would open the door to more Kermit Gosnells, who is the jailed Pennsylvania abortion provider who killed women and injured women. What does the White House say to that argument?\nMR. SCHULTZ: So I guess for the specific legal arguments, I would refer you to our Solicitor General's brief and oral arguments. Generally speaking, in this case, though, we believe that a woman's right to make decisions about her reproductive health is sacrosanct. And those decisions should not be subject to government intrusion, and that any obstacle in the path of a woman's reproductive freedom is unconstitutional. We remain strongly committed to the protection of women's health, including protecting women's access to safe, affordable health care, and her right to determine her own future.\nI do think it's important to note that, broadly speaking, if you'll just look at data, it's a good thing that teen pregnancies and abortions are nearing all-time lows in this country. This administration has, in fact, worked to ensure that every woman has access to the health care she needs. This includes signing the Affordable Care Act into law and ensuring that women can't be charged more just because they are women for health insurance. The Affordable Care Act has also led 20 million more people getting covered, putting the uninsured rate in single digits for the first time on record. Obviously, the protections in place for women and women's health in the Affordable Care Act were important to this President, and that's why he's spoken out so often on this.\nQ: On Zika, why not compromise? Everybody talks about Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill, and the old era where people got things done. And here you have the President saying $1 billion is just not enough.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Because a compromise between Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan suggests that this is a partisan issue. This is a public health emergency. And so I don't know -- it shouldn't be a Democratic cause to help protect women and unborn children from birth defects. This should be something that actually enjoys bipartisan support in Congress. This one shouldn't be complicated. This one shouldn't be partisan. This one shouldn't ideological. That's why we're so profoundly disappointed that House Republicans just threw up their arms, walked away from the negotiating table, and now we're on vacation.\nJohn.\nQ: Thank you, Eric. Turning back to Europe and the aftermath of Brexit, you've seen a lot of movements spawn in the wake of the Brexit vote. There's Brexit, Grexit, Swexit, and Chexit -- (laughter) -- all of these countries who have movements --\nMR. SCHULTZ: Can you say that five times fast? (Laughter.)\nQ: You really don't want to hear that. Does the President have an opinion on this mounting movement of exits from the European Union from countries other than Britain? And I might add, recent polls show, for example, in France, more than 60 percent of voters want an exit, and in Greece it's over 70 percent.\nMR. SCHULTZ: John, I haven't heard the President offer comment about these other countries contemplating that. I think I would refer you to those nations if they have views or how they're working through that, or even to the EU. Like I said, earlier, every nation is working through globalization trends, and every nation needs to tackle that -- because, again, our world is smaller than ever before. We are a more interconnected global economy. Our security is more linked than ever before. And that's why it's important to not ignore these trends, but actually work through them.\nI think the President's record -- some of the data I spoke of before -- is really strong on this. We brought back the U.S. manufacturing industry. We brought back the U.S. auto manufacturing industry. We have put in place policies that have enabled a steep decline in the unemployment rate. That's something we feel proud of. Wages are starting to go up, not at the pace that we'd like; we want to do more around that. But these are all issues that every country has to work out itself.\nWe also believe, as I mentioned, there are going to be impulses to retreat and to cower. The President believes that, for the United States, that's not only not in our interest, it's a betrayal of our values. We are a nation founded on basic freedoms. We are a nation of immigrants. Our diversity doesn't make us weaker, it makes us stronger. It's fundamental to the fabric of who were are. It's a defining characteristic for the United States. And I spoke earlier of how deeply moved the President was of the class at the United States Air Force Academy. That's not just a snapshot of the U.S. military, it's a picture of the United States of America. And again, it doesn't make us weaker, it actually makes us the strongest nation on Earth.\nQ: Great. Now, one other thing, though. It would seem from you say, then, that he would not look kindly on movements like this that would break up the union that is the European Union. Can I assume that from your remarks?\nMR. SCHULTZ: You can assume that in the month leading up to the vote that occurred last Thursday, the President had the opportunity to weigh in on that decision. Obviously, he also made clear at every instance he spoke of that this was a decision by the British people. Ultimately, he wanted it to go the other way. But the British people have spoken. I have not heard him articulate views about other countries.\nQ: And the other thing was, there were polls showing that many Britons -- more Britons than not said they would vote \"leave\" because of the President's remarks that \"remain\" -- that there was a backlash to it. Have you seen any of the polls?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I have not. And it's my understanding that Prime Minister Cameron at the time expressed great gratitude for the President making his views known. Prime Minister Cameron and his team expressed those comments privately to us, but also, I think, they said so in public. The other thing I'll add is that the President decided to weigh in not only because he thought this was in the best interest of the United Kingdom, but it was in the United States' best interest; that there's a number of reasons why the United States' interests are advanced when a strong United Kingdom is in a strong EU. And that's why the President made the case.\nJared, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thank you, Eric. I just wanted to take another stab at John's question about a reversal on Brexit. You said that you were dealing with facts, but you also said --\nMR. SCHULTZ: We try to.\nQ: Well, sure. And you've also said that you hoped for a different outcome. This is a reflection of the will of the people, but there are many parts that come up in the next two years that aren't referendum-controlled -- a new government formed after Prime Minister Cameron steps down; the Article 50 process writ large the negotiation with the EU -- the potential avenues for something different to happen. Is the administration at all hopeful that one of those paths will lead to some kind of reversal of the will of the people that was expressed that last week?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I haven't heard that contemplated. Our view is that the British people have spoken. This was a decision for the British people. Their ambassador said over the weekend that this was irrevocable. And so I haven't heard anything to the contrary.\nQ: Last year, after the shooting at the Oregon Community College, the President used language that was perhaps the most political he's gotten about gun violence. He talked about the need to politicize these issues. And most specifically, he talked about that voters should use this as a single-issue lens, a litmus test for who they decide to support, and that he would be using it for candidates that he would support on the campaign trail himself. Of all the things that the President has said, the many instances he's spoken out since Orlando, he hasn't said that. Josh has said it from the podium, but the President hasn't said it. And I wonder why.\nMR. SCHULTZ: He absolutely stands by that pledge, and let me tell you why. He believes that Congress should take the common-sense steps to prevent gun violence. We've listed a couple already today. That includes universal background checks. That includes making sure the people who are deemed too dangerous to board a flight not be able to purchase a firearm. That includes making sure our ATF has the resources they need to enforce the current laws on the books. That's a current talking point. That's an ever-growing talking point by the Republicans on this, yet they've done nothing to make sure that ATF has those 200 additional staffers. That's something that we've asked for that Republicans have declined to move on.\nSo the President wants Congress to move on all those things. But to your point, he's acutely aware of the politics. He's acutely aware of the realities of Congress right now, and none of those are likely to move with this particular Congress. That's why he has called for a national debate on this, and that's why he's leading by example. He has said he will not campaign for, he will not fundraise for, and he will not support candidates who don't support these common-sense measures to reduce gun violence.\nQ: -- the President is acutely aware of the politics, and that's why he hasn't said that this should be a litmus test issue since Orlando?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Oh, Jared, I think the President has spoken up quite frequently in light of Orlando.\nQ: -- in the last two weeks.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Again, the President has spoken up quite unequivocally about the need for our politics to change on this.\nQ: Should we expect the President more or less as we get nearer to the election to say that this should be a litmus test issue for voters?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I think the President spoke of this at some of the political events over the weekend, so I do think he'll be making the case on this --\nQ: In public?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Yes. In public and in private.\nThank you, all.\nEND 3:02 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2016-06-27", "title": "Press Briefing by Principal Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz"}

To all of the volunteers and staff here at the -- from Liberia.\nBut I want to start where Carrie ended -- with the girls who are here. I am just so thrilled to be here with you. I have heard so much about each of you. I have read about you. I've heard about the challenges that you face, but, more importantly, I've heard about how hard you're working to be, as Carrie said, role models and leaders in your community. And that's one of the reasons I wanted to be here -- to shine a big, bright light on you. And it doesn't get much bigger and brighter than this. (Applause.)\nSo I want to hear from you, so we're going to spend a lot of time with me being very quiet and you telling me all about the work you're doing, your stories, things you want me to know. This is the first of a three-country tour that I'm doing. We left Washington, D.C. yesterday; I'm traveling with my mother and my two daughters, Malia and Sasha. (Applause.) This is the special girl-power unit of the Obama household. (Laughter.) We left the President behind because he's a boy. (Laughter.)\nIn all seriousness, it's always a privilege to travel with my mom and my daughters, because I want them to see the world. I want them to get to know your stories and understand what you go through and just how hard you're working to get your education. And I want girls around the world to hear that story.\nSo after we leave Liberia, we're traveling today to Marrakech, where we're going to see a whole other set of girls in Marrakech. We're going to learn about their challenges and their triumphs as well. And then a few days later, I'm going to travel to Madrid to speak to some young women there. Because, as you may or may not know, while you guys are working hard here and doing your best to get your education, there are 62 million girls around the world that don't have these opportunities. And, as Carrie said, when women aren't educated, when girls don't get the chance to go to school and fulfill that potential, that hurts all of us -- not just here in this country, but all of us around the world.\nAnd when I learned about these 62 million girls, I was angry. I thought, how on Earth can we sit by -- particularly in places like the U.S. where we have so many resources and we have some girls that don't go to school not because they can't, they can't afford it, but because they don't know the importance of it -- how can we sit by when there are so many girls who would give anything to go to school? And you are among those girls who are doing everything in their power -- that's why I'm so proud of you.\nOne of the reasons we're working with the Peace Corps is that we know to really resolve these issues, we have to change culture. We have to change the norms that say that girls aren't worthy of an education. And that's why this GLOW program is so important. You are important. You are worthy of an education. You're going to be mothers, and it's so important for you to have the confidence and the intelligence and the knowledge to raise beautiful, healthy kids yourself. That's how we change generations. That's how we grow as nations and as a world.\nYou have an important mission as women. And to do that well, you've got to have your education. So no matter what anybody tells you, I want you to keep fighting. Stay in school. Go to secondary school. Go to university if you can. And then, when you do all that, I want you to continue to be the leaders that you are and come back to your communities, and find other girls just like you who are working and striving -- and they need your support.\nWe are going to change the way the world thinks about women and girls, aren't we? (Applause.) So to the volunteers, welcome home. Because I know that we are back in Liberia. And we are so happy to have the Peace Corps back in this wonderful country. I am proud of you all as well. Malia is going to be taking a gap year, so we in our family believe in taking time away from the rush of your lives to give back in a meaningful way -- whether it's on the South Side of Chicago, or here in Liberia.\nSo I am so proud of you all, because we can't do what we do without you all doing the work on the ground here over a long period of time -- many of you, I know, are going to be here for two years or more; some of you are on your way back. But this work is vitally important.\nAnd I want to shine a light on you all for all the young people, or the not-so-young people, as far as the Peace Corps is concerned --\nMS. HESSLER-RADELET: That's right.\nMRS. OBAMA: The Peace Corps takes them at all ages. (Laughter.) If you want to have some meaning in your life, do this. This is a valuable, worthwhile experience. And, as Carrie said, you will get way more than you'll ever give.\nSo you all continue to do the great work. Know you have a First Lady who is thinking about you and cares about you and is proud of you. And just so the other Peace Corps volunteers understand, you don't always get a visit from the First Lady in your first few days.

OBAMA: First of all, let me just say how impressed I am with all of you, not just the types of stories you've told, but the way you did it -- with confidence and with pride. And that's the beginning of becoming a leader -- just starting to do things that you don't feel comfortable doing, but you push yourself to do it anyway.\nWhen I was your age, if anyone had told me that I would be the First Lady of the United States of America, I would have laughed at them. Because growing up, in that space, there had never been an African American President, let alone an African American First Lady. So to be where I am today is basically doing what many people thought was impossible. And many people thought it was impossible up until my husband was elected. There were people in -- who didn't think the country was ready for a black President. They wanted it. They wanted to believe, but they were afraid to believe because they didn't want to be hurt and let down. But because we worked together in communities -- because, as people were growing -- that we were not being divided by race, he was elected, because he had a lot of support.\nSo my goal as First Lady was to make sure that I was the best First Lady I could be. I wanted to make my husband proud, my parents proud, and I wanted to make my community proud, and my daughters proud. So I made sure that every day, I came to my job, to the work that did -- that I brought a passion and confidence and trust. I wanted people to know that if I said I was going to do something, they could believe I would do that. If I made a commitment, I stood by that commitment -- and try to make it real.\nBecause when you become leaders, the most important thing you have is your word, your trust. That's where respect comes from. Because people know when you say you're going to do something, you do it, and you do it with love and you do it with what we call authenticity, that people know that your heart is real. And I try to operate from that place every single day.\nMaybe those are some of my strengths, is the ability to just be me no matter where I am. And I encourage all of you to do that. You don't have to be somebody different to be important. You're important in your own right. Nobody wants you to act like a boy. People want and need to value you because of who you are, because of your story, because of your challenges. That's what makes you unique. You want to be different. You want to be special. The fact that you've been able to overcome challenges -- and this is what I always talk -- that makes you smarter. That made me better, right? Because I had to overcome things that a lot of people who were in the same position never had to overcome.\nSo if I have weaknesses -- and I think we all have weaknesses, right? (Laughter.) Let me think -- my mother is laughing. (Laughter.) See, part of -- it's like, I'm pretty confident. (Laughter.) But I think this is just -- having limited resources to do as much as you want to do. This is why leadership is important. Because you can't do everything alone. Most things you can't do by yourself, no matter how smart you are, no matter how much you care. You have to have people with you who are going to help you along the way.\nAnd you never want to get to the point where you're so strong that you don't have anybody helping you. You can't do this alone. And that's something that I had to learn -- that it was okay to ask for help. It was okay to do things that were a little embarrassing. To not understand math, but to still keep trying. To ask questions even when I didn't know the answer. Not being afraid to be wrong -- I had to learn how to do that. Because as a woman, we all think -- we all hide ourselves. We all worry -- when you see -- in the class, boys always raise their hand even if they don't know what they're talking about. They'll talk and talk and talk, and we'll wait and make sure that we're absolutely right before we say anything.\nWe as women, we have to understand that we know more, just even instinctively, than we think we do. So we have to be brave enough to take that risk, and maybe fail at it, and be okay with failure. And I've had to learn how to be okay with failure. Because you don't do anything great unless you're willing to fail, and then overcome the things that happen when you fail.", "timestamp": "2016-06-27", "title": "Remarks by the First Lady After a Conversation with Girl Students at R.S.

In his remarks, he referred to Maya Moore, forward, Lindsay Whalen and Seimone Augustus, guards, and Sylvia Fowles, center, Women's National Basketball Association's Minnesota Lynx; Lisa Leslie, former center, WNBA's Los Angeles Sparks; Sheryl Swoopes, former head coach, Loyola University women's basketball team; and Sue Bird, guard, WNBA's Seattle Storm.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117863", "text": "The President. Hello, everybody, hello! Hello! Everybody—everybody, have a seat. Everybody, have a seat. Oliver is upset—[laughter]—that Mom is up here and he's not. Now, if you want to bring Oliver up here, you—that's fine. Coach, what do you think? Come on.\nAudience members. Aww!\nThe President. Yes, come on. There you go. Look, he's got his little suit on and everything. [Laughter] Look at him—got the bowtie.\nHead Coach Cheryl Reeve. Can you say say hi to Mr. President?\nThe President. Hey, man. High five?\nCoach Reeve. Say high hive. High five?\nThe President. There you go. All right, now that we've got that settled. [Laughter]\nGood afternoon, everybody. Give it up for the 2015 WNBA champion the Minnesota Lynx! Yes. So this is this team's third visit to the White House in the past 5 years. So I guess I should ask: \"Whose house?\" [Laughter]\nPlayer. Our house!\nCoach Reeve. Our house!\nThe President. Our house!\nWe have some Lynx fans in the house, including your outstanding Senator, Amy Klobuchar. WNBA President Lisa Borders is here. Welcome back to Coach Cheryl Reeve—third title with the Lynx. You get a sense she's feeling greedy though. [Laughter] She wants more. [Laughter] When the Lynx won it all, with champion—you know, banners going up, champagne popping, she looked around and said, \"This never gets old.\" [Laughter] This never gets old. And you can see how the way—by the way they're playing this year that it has not gotten old for any of the players either.\nNow, I want to take a moment to recognize somebody who I know would have loved to have been in this moment: Flip Saunders, who was a huge part of Minnesota basketball at all levels and a supporter of this team. Obviously, he experienced a tragic illness. And so on behalf of all basketball fans, this day, too, is \"For Flip.\" And we want to give him a big round of applause.\nSo I think it's fair to say this team is a powerhouse. [Laughter] You've got Maya Moore, Lindsay Whalen, Seimone Augustus, recently named among the top 20 players in WNBA history. So you've got—seems like you all should have more than three—[laughter]—when you've got that much talent. Uh-oh, I've got you. [Laughter] All right, well, you just wanted this moment in the sun. [Laughter]\nNow, this isn't to say it's always easy. Last year, these women faced down midseason roster shakeups and multiple injuries—— [At this point, a baby cried.]\nThe President. I know, it was frustrating—[laughter]—and a championship game that started a little bleak. Lindsay sprained her ankle. Maya was trying to find her rhythm. But in the second half, the Lynx started to gain some steam. Seimone finished with 16 points. Sylvia Fowles had 20. They pulled away and won the championship by 17 points. It was their first championship at home, in front of their loyal Minnesota fans. And as Maya put it, \"It wasn't a perfect year, a perfect series, or a perfect game . . . but we are the champions.\" And that's what matters.\nThey did manage to have a pretty-close-to-perfect victory party though. After the game, the Lynx drove out to Paisley Park for a private concert by one of their biggest fans, Prince, which was pretty cool and reminds us of how much we miss him. In fact, the last time I saw him, he was on this stage at a really good party. [Laughter]\nNow, these women are not just all-star basketball players, they're also leaders in the Minnesota community. They host an annual Breast Health Awareness game in partnership with the Mayo Clinic. They made holiday cards for children of military members, teamed up with the Twin Cities Boys and Girls Club to help prepare meals for kids who would otherwise go hungry. And the team signed honorary contracts with young boys and girls who are facing big challenges, but dream of playing basketball. For a day, those young people were Lynx teammates, and that, as much as any trophy, is what makes these women champions.\nSo on the 20th anniversary of the WNBA, this is a good moment to celebrate all that these players and the many others who came before have accomplished. Twenty years ago, Maya, Seimone, and Lindsay were playing H-O-R-S-E in their driveway. And suddenly, they saw players like Lisa Leslie and Sheryl Swoopes and Sue Bird to look up to as role models. And there's no discounting how important that is. Today, these women—and women across the WNBA—are setting their own outstanding example for girls who are growing up today.\nAnd they're aware of the responsibilities that come with that. As Maya says, \"We're not super rich like the guys . . . but money's not everything when you're talking about dynasties and legacies and inspiring young women and men and opening people's minds.\" Although, money is useful too. [Laughter] And I am for equal pay for equal work.\nBut, with that, I know Lindsay would like to say a few more words. Let's give a big White House congratulations once again to the Minnesota Lynx, 2015 WNBA Champions.", "timestamp": "2016-06-27", "title": "Remarks Honoring the 2015 Women's National Basketball Association Champion Minnesota Lynx"}

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117671", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n**Please see below for a correction, marked with an asterisk.\n1:32 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Nice to see you all. I do not have any announcements to make at the top, so we can go straight to your questions.\nDarlene, do you want to start?\nQ: Thank you. What response do you have for the House Benghazi Committee's report? I'm sure you have something.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I don't have much. It seems at this point that, after eight different congressional inquiries have now been conducted into this matter, it seems that there's only one remaining question, and it's simply this: Is the RNC going to disclose the in-kind contribution that they've received from House Republicans today? This is a $7-million effort funded by taxpayers to do what the would-be Speaker of the House says was their goal, which is to tear down Secretary Clinton's poll numbers.\nSo that was their goal. It remains to be seen if that's what they accomplish.\nQ: What about the specific claim that the military was slow to respond to these assaults -- eight hours after they had begun, no military assets had been directed towards the --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, this has been thoroughly debunked by previous Republican-led investigations in the Congress. So I'm not going to get into the back-and-forth because, frankly, Republicans have already done that. Republicans in the House Intelligence Committee have concluded that those charges are not true. Questions have been raised about that assertion by the Benghazi Committee's lead investigator. So this is -- there is plenty of churn just to review what Republicans have concluded about this incident. And the fact is those congressional committees that have been committed to trying to understand the facts of a tragedy that led to the death of four Americans have concluded that what happened was a tragedy. But they've also concluded that the variety of conspiracy theories that have been flowering on the Republican side of the aisle are politically motivated fantasies. And it's unfortunate that the death of four Americans would be subject to that kind of political fantasizing, but that is the state of the Republican Party these days.\nQ: One more. On another issue brewing up on the Hill, Democrats up there say that it's time to take another look at agency policies regarding displays of the Confederate flag at federal cemeteries. Would President Obama agree to that? And would he direct the Veterans Administration and also the National Park Service to remove any flags?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not aware of how this question has been raised administratively, so we can take a look at that. I do know that House Republicans, in a partisan attempt to extend displays of the Confederate flag, did include that in the Zika bill that they passed in the dark of night last week. I think that underscores the partisan nature of the legislation that they put forward. But I'm not aware of any executive action that's being contemplated on this question.\nAyesha.\nQ: Thank you. I wanted to talk about some more fallout from the Brexit vote. Scotland is looking at ways of possibly staying with the EU -- stay in the EU or stay in the market -- also possibly looking at independence from the UK in the wake of the vote. Is that a concern for the White House, especially from a national security standpoint? Scotland houses the UK nuclear program, so there are issues in that way, too, if there was to be a split within the UK. So does the U.S. have any position on that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there are a couple of things that we've said before that I think are relevant to the question that you raised. The first is that the United States values the critically important security relationship that we have with the United Kingdom. Obviously the UK is a critically important partner in the NATO alliance. That is the bedrock of our national security in this country. So we obviously believe that that relationship is critically important and, frankly, there's no reason that that should at all be affected by the decision that British voters made last week.\nThere was a referendum on Scottish independence a year or two ago. We made clear at the time that, again, that was a decision for voters in Scotland to make. But the United States' view has been and continues to be that a united UK is in the best interest of the United States. It makes them a stronger partner. It makes them more effective in contributing to the NATO alliance that's the bedrock of our national security.\nQ: And following up on that, has the President made any more calls to world leaders in the wake of that vote? I know he made a call to Cameron and to Germany's Merkel, but has there been any more calls? And also, the President made the trip to London earlier this year in support of the UK remaining in the EU. Does the President -- now that it hasn't gone that way, the markets are kind of flailing, there's a lot of uncertainty now. Does the President feel the need to maybe do more to try to calm the markets, do more to maybe push the U.S. -- what the U.S. would like to happen, to stable -- I guess to stable the move of the UK from the EU -- but is there more that the President needs to do to get the U.S. message out on this issue? Because it is having such a large impact on the markets and on the global economy.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I'm not going to talk about individual market movements. Obviously senior administration officials had been in close touch with their counterparts in Europe and in the UK to discuss the consequences of the decision from the British people. So we can get you a rundown of all of the conversations that Secretary Kerry has had with his counterparts. He's even traveled in Europe and had conversations in person to discuss this matter.\nOther senior officials here in the White House that also work closely with the President have been in touch with their counterparts, including the President's Deputy National Security Advisor for International Economics, Wally Adeyemo, has been engaged with his G20 counterparts to discuss both this vote but also the consequences for increased volatility that we've seen in the global financial markets.\nSo this is something that the Treasury Department continues to monitor closely. Obviously the President is monitoring it closely as well. He's getting regularly briefed on it. I would expect that the next opportunity that the President will have to discuss these issues with his counterparts will be at the NATO meeting in Poland -- it's coming up next week.\nYou've heard us previously announce that the President intends to meet with the leaders of the EU in advance of his NATO Summit meeting, but I would anticipate that a lot of the conversations that he'll have with world leaders at that meeting, both formally and informally, will be to discuss the impact of this vote. And obviously there has been some, as I mentioned, renewed volatility in the global financial markets, but the fact is, the special relationship between the United States and the UK will endure. The close financial, economic, commercial and trade ties between the United States and the UK will remain. That's good news because that's critically important to both our economies. And I mentioned, of course, that the U.S.-UK defense relationship will remain strong.\nThe United States also has a number of very close partners who are part of the EU, and we're going to continue to closely coordinate with the EU on a variety of financial and national security measures. And that cooperation and that collaboration continues unabated as well.\nMichelle.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. While we're still on that subject, just very quickly, would the President support a second referendum that's been floated as at least a possibility once a new prime minister comes in?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I think the British ambassador to the United States was pretty definitive about the finality of this decision. But, ultimately, how all of this moves forward is up to the British people and their elected leaders.\nQ: The President obviously had a strong opinion when the first referendum was coming around, so would he have just as strong an opinion on a second referendum if that does happen?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, the question about whether or not it's going to happen I think is something that British leaders and the British people will have to determine. British leaders I think have made pretty clear their view that the decision that was made by the voters was final. But, again, it will be up to them to render a judgment about the path forward here.\nOur expectation, our hope is that the process, as it moves forward, will be orderly, will be as transparent as possible. And we have been pleased to see a commitment to those principles, both by leaders in the UK but also leaders in the EU.\nQ: And on the Benghazi report, you've made your feelings abundantly clear what you think of it.\nMR. EARNEST: Not particularly surprising, I assume.\nQ: But now that it's over, the fact that --\nMR. EARNEST: I thought it was over after the first five investigations. This is the eighth.\nQ: Well, let's start with that, then. Do you feel that the breadth of this and the amount of time spent and, as you mentioned, the amount of money spent -- I mean, this was the broadest investigation we've seen. So at the very least does this, in your view, end things and sort of put a definitive stamp on it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, it's hard to say. I think there were a lot of people who thought that after the first or second, or the third, or the fourth, or the fifth, or the sixth, or the seventh investigation, that that might be the end of it. Republicans have clearly discerned a political motive. And, to their credit, at least they were pretty blunt about it -- the would-be Speaker of the House indicated that the reason this committee was created was to drive down Secretary Clinton's poll numbers. Congressman Richard Hanna from New York indicated that -- basically the same thing. He said that the goal of this committee was to go after Secretary Clinton.\nSo it's pretty clear what their motives are. That's why, I guess, the only question that remains is whether or not this $7 million in-kind contribution will be correctly reported on next month's FEC campaign finance disclosure by the RNC. Maybe we should have a congressional committee form to take a look at that.\nQ: If the goal on both sides was to -- or, okay, your goal, at least, was to put this to rest. The fact that this investigation, unlike the others before it, did look at substantially more documentation that wasn't viewed by previous investigations -- don't you see some value in that? That at least it might have answered questions in people's minds about the kind of information that was not viewed prior?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, this is a select committee that spent more time looking at this matter than Congress spent looking at things like Pearl Harbor, the 9/11 attacks, the response to Hurricane Katrina, the Iran-Contra affair, the assassination of President Kennedy. So it is clear that a lot of time and money and resources has been devoted to this effort. But even Senator Rubio tweeted today that the committee found something that we already knew.\nSo I think even Republicans are struggling to articulate exactly what value has been derived from this -- other than what they acknowledge is their primary goal, which is to take more shots at Secretary Clinton. I think the unfortunate thing is that they had to spend $7 million in taxpayer money to do it. And the unfortunate thing is that they are cynically trying to capitalize on the death of four innocent Americans who were serving their country overseas and were killed in this tragic accident. And the degree to which Republicans are willing to play politics with their death and this tragedy is appalling.\nQ: You view this as purely political. How worried are you then about the political effects of this on Democrats? And how do Democrats need to counter the message that comes out of this report?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think individual Democrats will have to figure out for themselves. Secretary Clinton and her campaign have obviously issued their own statements. You can talk to them about the strategy that they hope to pursue. But, look, I think when it comes down to the political questions here, I think we should just sort of start by acknowledging what Leader McCarthy and Congressman Hanna have indicated, which is that this is a political exercise. I think once we start from that conversation, then we can have an honest debate about what the political consequences of this particular decision should be. And I think Secretary Clinton is more than capable of making her own case about her judgment, her successful tenure as Secretary of State, and what that says about her presidential campaign. But, ultimately, that's the responsibility of her advisors.\nQ: But do you view this as damaging to Clinton in the eyes, potentially, of voters?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I think voters will have to decide for themselves. But, again, I think Secretary Clinton and her team obviously have a strong case to make about her successful tenure as Secretary of State. But that's a case I'll let them make.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, to what extent is the British exit vote going to be discussed at the North American Summit tomorrow? There seem to be some pretty serious security and economic considerations that even North American leaders will want to talk over.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, the Brexit vote has had an impact on global financial markets, including financial markets here in North America. So I would anticipate it's something that the leaders will discuss. I don't anticipate that it will be the focus of their conversations, but I'm confident that it will come up.\nQ: Are there any lessons to be drawn about the willingness of one part of the trading bloc to want to go it alone in terms of North America, NAFTA has proven tremendously controversial. It's a big issue on the campaign trail. Does the vote have any implications on that subject here in this continent as well?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, I think it's always dangerous to oversimplify these kinds of questions that voters are considering, but there's something unique about the efforts to integrate Europe that I think makes it quite a bit different than just a trade agreement. Obviously the trade ties and our relationship with both Mexico and Canada are strong, and our economies are well-integrated. Obviously the security of all of our countries is enhanced by maintaining strong and high-functioning relationship with our neighbors.\nWhat Europe was trying -- was attempting to do was materially different in terms of trying to establish a common currency. Obviously the UK wasn't a part of that, but it's an indication of the ambition that they had for integrating the continent and binding their countries together.\nThe countries in North America have pursued a different strategy, and one that has worked well for us. It is a strategy that has enhanced the economies of all of our countries. It's enhanced the national security of all of our countries, and it certainly has made North America the most successful continent in the world.\nAnd the goal of the leaders in their discussions tomorrow will be to further intensify our efforts to cooperate, even as we see some added volatility in the global financial markets and even as we face down some other threats to our own security.\nQ: One more question on trade. You said in the wake of the Brexit vote that you still want to press ahead with a trade agreement with Europe. That's not going to happen on the President's watch, is it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the goal that we have set, Mark, is to try to complete those negotiations by the end of this year.\nQ: But you've got a continent that now is in turmoil. How can you possibly complete an agreement with a Europe that is so distracted by this?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, that certainly is one argument. I think the other argument you could make is that given the new challenges that the EU is facing, they would place an even higher priority in strengthening their ties economically to the United States. So there is no denying that even if the UK had voted to remain in the EU, that completing a T-TIP by the end of this year would be an ambitious goal. I think it continues to be an ambitious goal, but one that we believe is possible by the end of the year. We'll just have to see where things go from here.\nToluse.\nQ: Thanks. Following up on Brexit and trade, Speaker Paul Ryan said in a couple of interviews that the U.S. should start immediately sort of negotiating a new trade agreement with the UK. Is he wrong to say that that is a good strategy?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what's important, first, to recognize is that there already is an important financial and economic relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom. Those ties are valuable. Those ties have a positive impact on both of our countries.\nWhat the President said when he was in London earlier this year continues to be true, however, which is that if the United States were to begin bilateral trade talks with the UK, those talks would be starting a different place because we've already made years of progress through negotiations with the broader EU. And the President discussed in some detail the value and the efficiency gains of the United States negotiating with a whole block of countries, as opposed to just one country.\nNow, the one country that we're talking about is the United Kingdom, a country with whom we have a special relationship, a country with whom we already have critically important economic ties. But the fact remains that we've already made lots of progress in negotiating a trade agreement with a bloc of countries. So that's just where things stand right now.\nI think in terms of sort of what additional steps could be taken to enhance the economic relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom is something that policymakers in both countries will have to consider in years ahead -- and presumably that picture for that path forward will be clearer -- once it's clearer exactly how the UK will pursue the process of extricating itself from the EU.\nQ: The President also sort of made a statement that it could be years before -- sort of several years down the line, and that Britain would be at \"the back of the queue\" when it comes to trade. It seems like you're saying that the U.S. and the UK could not even start something while other negotiations are going on on a parallel track.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think it's too early to say. We're four or five days out of this decision being made by the British voters, so I wouldn't handicap a date about when those kinds of conversations would occur. I think what is true is that the UK would not benefit from the years of progress we have made in negotiating a trade agreement with the EU.\nThe UK does benefit from the special relationship they have with the United States. They benefit from the important economic relationship what already exists between our two countries. But they start -- if and when those negotiations were to start, they would start in a different place because of the progress that we've already made in trying to complete an agreement with the EU.\nJerome.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. I was wondering how does the President feel about the role he played in the Brexit debate? Does he believe he shouldn't have gone so far, given the end result? Or to the contrary, does he believe he did too little, too late, and as some argue, he didn't pay enough attention to Europe during his presidency?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, let me try to unpack this. I think what I would start with is that the President traveled to London at the invitation of Prime Minister Cameron. And while in London, they had conversations on a range of issues that are critically important to our two countries -- issues both related to national security and the economy. And while he was there, the President did make an unequivocal statement about the U.S. view of the question facing British voters, and the President I think gave a rather lengthy but direct analysis of how the United States would be impacted by the decision made by the British people.\nAnd this was an important analysis for the President to offer for a couple of reasons. The first is, given the special relationship between our two countries, it seemed appropriate for the British people to factor in the impact of this vote on their relationship with the United States. It also was an important statement for the President to make because many proponents of Brexit were ascribing to the United States some views of the matter that, frankly, didn't reflect the views of the leader of the United States. So the President had an opportunity to set the record straight.\nWhat eventual impact that had on the outcome I think is something that I'll leave to the analysts to decide. I think what is clear is that in the days after those comments from the President in London, there was what I would describe as positive movement in the polls, but things didn't end up where we would have liked.\nBut, again, the President, all along, from before the trip to during the trip, to after the trip, made clear that this was a decision for the British people to make based on their own analysis of their country's interests. And that's what they did.\nAs it relates to our broader relationship with Europe, I think it is hard for the President's harshest critics to suggest that somehow he has given short shrift to our relationship with our European allies when some of the President's most prominent critics have suggested that, for example, the United States should leave NATO. I think that would be undermining our important relationship with our allies in Europe in a way that would have devastating consequences for our national security. So I think the President's record of strengthening those relationships is well documented.\nRon.\nQ: On Benghazi, after all these investigations and so forth, what is the simple answer to the question of why there was no rescue?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think that there was a -- there have been committee hearings that have looked at this --\nQ: I honestly don't know the answer to the question. And I think a lot of people at home who are trying to sort this out and it's out there, and they hear all the back-and-forth between -- it's a simple question. Why didn't that happen? Why wasn't there -- why wasn't the U.S. military able to rescue these --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think where we should start, Ron, is we should start talking about what the Department of Defense did do. And they did, as Secretary Panetta has acknowledged, react to the President's orders to make sure that all available DOD assets in the region were available and could be used to respond to the attack in Libya and protect U.S. interests and personnel in the region.\nWhat that meant is that the U.S. military did succeed in executing the safe evacuation of all U.S. government personnel from Benghazi 12 hours after the initial attack. And they moved a number of personnel to the Ramstein Air Force Base and took steps to protect U.S. personnel.\nAnd that is consistent with the conclusions of the Accountability Review Board that basically found that the result was exceptional U.S. government coordination military response and saved the lives of two severely wounded Americans.\nQ: You said -- the DOD statement emphasized that they were involved in stabilizing the evacuation of Tripoli, the embassy in Tripoli. You're focusing on the military role there --\nMR. EARNEST: My point is they did both. There were a number of personnel in Benghazi that were safely extracted by DOD assets hours after the attack. There were some U.S. citizens who were killed. That's the reason we're having this conversation. But, yes, this was a successful DOD operation to respond to the President's orders to save as many Americans as possible.\nIt is tragic that four Americans died. But according to the Accountability Review Board that was chaired by the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mullen, and Thomas Pickering, a U.S. diplomat that served both Presidents, they took a close look at this and had praise for the military response.\nQ: And while a lot has been said about whether this was an attack on Secretary Clinton, there were some allegations or charges at the White House, specifically -- not the Secretary. And some focused on this 7:30 meeting that was chaired by Denis McDonough. Again, I realize you don't want to litigate point by point, but in the interest of clarity, what was accomplished at that time? And I know you're going to debunk the allegation that somehow there was an order to stand down or something --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it's not just me that's going to debunk it. The lead investigator of the committee is going to debunk that.\nQ: I get that. And I don't want to -- that's not the issue.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay.\nQ: The issue is, what happened in that meeting? What evidence is there that that moved the operation forward? The other charge that this was all about the video and not about what was really going on on the ground. I know, I hear you. But tell me whatever you can -- just to clear the air once and for all about what happened when in that session.\nMR. EARNEST: I don't think there's any air to clear, Ron. I think the fact is that the White House and the National Security Council that functions here at the White House fulfilled its responsibility to make sure that the number of government agencies that were involved in this effort were assembled to discuss an ongoing emergency. And there were steps that were taken to safeguard diplomats in other places around the globe, and a variety of other steps were taken. That's what you would expect.\nI think this is the best evidence yet that this is a Republican conspiracy seeking political advantage out of the terrible tragedy. There's just no \"there\" there. There hasn't been. But yet we have seen repeated attempts by Republicans to try to score political points off the deaths of four innocent Americans.\nQ: But the \"there\" there was, in fact, once this happened, after this happened, there had to be some changes made. Correct? There had to be some changes made in terms of how the military could respond to something like this. So clearly, the military wasn't organized in the way effectively to do this. I'm sure the White House reassessed how it might have better responded to this sort of situation -- correct?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Ron, again, years ago -- years ago, the Accountability Review Board -- this is a body that was chaired by the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and a renowned U.S. diplomat who served under both Presidents -- examined this situation. They put forward 29 different recommendations for reforms that should be implemented by the State Department. The State Department has implemented or is in the process of implementing every single one of those things.\nAgain, that is a set of conclusions that were reached more than three years ago, now. I think the real question is, again, why are we considering the eighth congressional investigation into this matter? If the Accountability Review Board that was led by men with impeccable, bipartisan national security credentials has reviewed this matter, suggested that there are 29 different reforms that could be implemented, those reforms are implemented, what possible goal could Republicans have by taking a look at this matter in 2016 other than trying to influence the outcome of the elections that are held in 2016?\nQ: All right.\nMR. EARNEST: Jordan.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I want to ask you a question about Zika. The Surgeon General said earlier this month that we're coming to the point where the funding of the Zika response is going to run out. Now that Congress -- the Senate failed to advance this latest funding package, and it doesn't look like there's going to be a deal at least before July 4th, can you say exactly when the money for the Zika response is going to run out?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, Jordan, I think the issue that we have is that there's insufficient funding that's being dedicated to the effort to fight Zika and to protect pregnant women and their children in this country. That is the issue. And what the Department of Health and Human Services has already done is taken funding that has been deployed for a range of public health questions, challenges, and devoted it specifically to this effort.\nBut even that is not enough. And we've made clear that that's not enough. That's why the President put forward a package four months ago -- this is a package that was recommended to him by the foremost public health officials in the country. And for the last four months, we have seen Republicans do very little other than play political games with that request.\nSo you would think that at some point the safety and well-being of pregnant women in the United States would be more important than politics to Republicans. But unfortunately, it's not. Because as I mentioned to Darlene earlier, Republicans now apparently see the Zika funding as the vehicle to allow the display of Confederate flags in cemeteries across the country. I don't really understand what that has to do with the Zika virus and protecting pregnant women, but that's the vehicle that Republicans have apparently chosen to use in order to ram through a partisan measure.\nIt's apparent that Republicans don't take this particularly seriously, but I can tell you that public health professionals across the country take this seriously. In fact, just today we have a letter from a couple dozen nonprofits urging Congress to dispense with the kind of partisanship that House Republicans have displayed and to act on what they describe as a public health emergency. These are organizations like the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Easter Seals, the March of Dimes. These are organizations that don't have any interest in partisan politics; they do have a keen interest in protecting the American people and protecting pregnant women, and preventing birth defects. And what they're urging Republicans to do is to dispense with the partisanship and actually focus on this public health emergency. We'll see if Republicans are persuaded.\nQ: I guess in the absence, though, of that funding for now, can you tell us when is the next time that public health agencies are going to have to move around money to fund the Zika response through the summer --\nMR. EARNEST: Jordan, I think the point is that right now they don't have as much money as they would like to have in order to do everything possible to protect the American people from the Zika virus. If you're asking me when are those agencies going to need more money to fight the Zika virus, they need that money right now. They needed that money four months ago. They needed to send -- for a variety of reasons. They needed to send a clear message to the private sector that we were going to be invested in their efforts to develop a vaccine and to develop enhanced diagnostics, and to expand lab capacity so that people would get tested quickly, get their results and know what precautions they should take to protect their partner or other people in their community from the Zika virus.\nFor weeks, if not months, we've seen local officials, particularly in the South, ask for additional assistance from the federal government so they could do a better job of fighting mosquito populations in their states. That request, even from those Republican officials, has fallen on deaf ears. Governor Rick Scott from Florida -- no friend of the Obama administration -- is making the same case that the Obama administration is, that Congress needs to step up to the plate and provide additional resources that can be used to try to fight the mosquitoes that are carrying the Zika virus.\nIt's only Republicans in Congress who are treating this as a partisan issue. Governors in both parties all across the country have called on Congress to act on this. Public health professionals, including charitable organizations, like the Easter Seals and the March of Dimes, are calling on Republicans in the Congress to act. But the only thing we've seen Republicans in Congress do thus far is to try to make this issue partisan, for reasons that are difficult to explain.\nApril.\nQ: Josh, on another subject. July 4th is next week. Federal lawmakers come back to town after that. What is the White House -- what kind of conversations have White House officials been in with the lawmakers, particularly those who staged the sit-in when it came to guns last week?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President's commitment to seeing common-sense gun safety legislation pass continues to be a priority. There have been ongoing conversations between some members of the Senate and the Justice Department to put together a bipartisan, common-sense amendment that would effectively prevent individuals who are suspected of having ties with terrorism from being able to walk into a store and buy a gun.\nBut we've seen very little appetite from Republicans in Congress and most Republicans in the Senate to moving forward on that common-sense bill. In fact, they don't want to move forward -- Leader McConnell said over the weekend that he believes that we should just move on. That is a dereliction of duty. That is a failure of their fundamental responsibility to take common-sense steps to protect the country. And ultimately, voters are going to have to decide whether and how to hold their elected representatives in Congress responsible for that dereliction.\nQ: So last week, the spotlight was on the sit-in and the effort and the bill. Next week there are calls to possibly do it again if there's not movement. President Obama, the First Lady, Valerie Jarrett and many from the White House supported publicly on Twitter and all social media the efforts of the sit-in. Are you in support of another sit-in if there were some type of action like that, that would maybe last even longer to bring more attention to possibly get this measure passed?\nMR. EARNEST: What the White House is strongly in support of is congressional action. And House Democrats are going to see -- are going to need to figure out what they can do to try to prompt that action. Obviously the White House is going to stand with them as they undertake those efforts.\nBut we've seen far too much congressional dysfunction under Republican congressional leadership. And whether that is failing to pass -- to approve the needed resources to fight Zika, or to pass common-sense gun safety legislation, or to play politics with the terrible tragedy in Libya, I think the record of Republicans in Congress is one that is checkered with partisanship and not filled with a lot of results.\nOlivier.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Why is it so hard to reschedule the joint campaign event with Hillary Clinton?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, you won't be surprised to hear that both President Obama and Secretary Clinton have rather busy schedules. But hopefully we'll have some news on that rescheduled event quite soon.\nQ: She's on the trail -- that's her busy schedule. And he surely anticipated that he would be out campaigning for Democrats. I mean, it's not -- it wasn't a surprise that we're in an election year, so why -- do you guys have requirements for this? Does it have to be a particular state? Does it have to be on a particular day? I don't understand why this isn't coming together.\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I'm not sure it's quite that complicated. I think -- you have to talk the Secretary Clinton and her team about exactly what's on their schedule. Obviously we can't do it tomorrow because the President is meeting with the leaders of Canada and Mexico. The President had the Global Entrepreneurship Summit on the West Coast last week. So there are constraints given their schedule. But I would anticipate that we'll have some news on this relatively soon.\nQ: The Washington Post had a really captivating story about the apparent campaign of harassment of American diplomats by Russia. Has this ever been brought to the President's attention? Has he discussed it? His former ambassador Michael McFaul apparently was one of the targets. Has this ever risen to his attention? And if so, has he ever brought it up with Vladimir Putin?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have any additional details of conversations to relay. I can tell you that the United States continues to be concerned about U.S. diplomats who are being harassed at not just the embassy in Moscow, but in other diplomatic facilities around the world. We've raised those concerns with senior Russian officials and reminded them of their responsibility, particularly when it pertains to diplomats in Russia, of their responsibility to protect those diplomats, not to harass them. But I can't speak to any specific presidential involvement other than to confirm for you that he certainly is aware of it.\nByron.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. When David Plouffe was at the White House, was it common for him to be involved in preparing employees with a national security portfolio for TV appearances?\nMR. EARNEST: Byron, it was common for senior communications officials in the White House to be involved in preparing senior administration officials for television appearances. That was true in the first term. It's been true in the second term, as well.\nQ: In her interview, Susan Rice seemed to imply that that was unusual. David Plouffe's presence in helping her prepare for that Sunday talk show had nothing to do with the fact there was a hard-fought presidential campaign underway?\nMR. EARNEST: No. I think the fact that a senior communication official at the White House was involved in a call to ensure that a senior administration official was prepared for a television appearance shouldn't be particularly surprising to someone like you, who has closely covered the White House.\nQ: Can you understand, at least, why there is some controversy about what the administration was telling the public at the time?\nMR. EARNEST: No. (Laughter.) I can't.\nQ: Your predecessor --\nMR. EARNEST: I can't.\nQ: Your predecessor stood up there three days after the attack and said, \"There is no information that suggests Benghazi was preplanned attack,\" when three days earlier your Secretary of State had emailed her daughter that it clearly seemed to be a terrorist attack. And then a few days later, you have State Department employees emailing each other that Susan Rice was \"off the reservation.\" In hindsight, were the things the administration was saying in the days after the attack incorrect? Should you have been more judicious?\nMR. EARNEST: Byron, I think I'm going to leave it to the Republicans on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, who in their report that was issued almost two years ago -- I'll just quote from them to make this process a little easier. They said, \"The process used to develop the talking points was flawed, but that the talking points reflected the conflicting intelligence assessments in the days immediately following the crisis.\" They continued, \"There was absolutely no evidence in documents or testimony that the intelligence community's assessments were politically motivated in any way.\"\nIt's not my statement. That is the statement of House Republicans.\nI don't understand why the current crop of House Republicans who are looking at this matter didn't pay any attention to the previous assessment of House Republicans. The previous assessment was from House Republicans who serve on the Intelligence Committee in the House. So I'll let you draw your own conclusions on why a politically motivated Benghazi committee may have reached a different conclusion than Republicans who serve on the House Intelligence Committee.\nQ: But by saying there's no information suggesting Benghazi was a preplanned attack, that's different than saying there's conflicting -- if he had come out and said, there's a lot of conflicting information about this, that's one thing. But you chose the interpretation that's sort of most favorable politically to the White House.\nMR. EARNEST: House Republicans say there's no evidence in documents or testimony that the intelligence community's assessments were politically motivated in any way.\nSo again, I think it is really hard to argue with the conclusion of House Republicans who serve on the intelligence committee who concluded that there is no evidence of any political motivation or interference.\nQ: Being politically motivated, though, is different from whether the White House was sloppy in providing information after -- in the days after the attack.\nMR. EARNEST: And again, there's no evidence of that. The process used to develop talking points was flawed. But the talking points reflected the conflicting intelligence assessments in the days immediately following the crisis. That's not my defense. That is actually the conclusion of House Republicans who serve on the Intelligence Committee in the House.\nQ: Can I ask a question on North America?\nMR. EARNEST: Sure, go ahead.\nQ: Yesterday, during the press call with the White House official on the meeting, the bilateral that President Obama is going to have with the President of Mexico tomorrow, information, trade, energy, and other issues, but it was an absence of human rights in Mexico. That's always been a very important topic for the U.S. to discuss with Mexico. And the last few weeks has been a very high crisis with human rights in Mexico. Is President Obama going to ask the President of Mexico about the situation of human rights?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, the President is looking forward to the opportunity that he'll have to sit down with President Peсa Nieto tomorrow. Mexico, obviously, is a country with whom the United States has a critically important relationship. That relationship has an impact on a variety of aspects of American life. That includes our economy. That also includes our culture. And the President is looking forward to the opportunity to have that meeting.\nI don't have much of a preview to share at this point, other than to tell you that you'll have an opportunity to hear from the two leaders tomorrow -- both at the beginning of their bilateral meeting, but also in a trilateral news conference that all three leaders will be convening together.\nObviously, human rights is something that the President raises in his conversations with leaders of countries around the world. And human rights is a priority for this President, and advancing the cause of human rights around the world is a priority for this President. But I don't have more of a preview of that meeting to share at this point.\nQ: It was also mentioned that President Obama is going to ask the government of Mexico to reduce the production of heroin. And today the DEA released the new heroin threat assessment, saying that the number of Americans who die of an overdose of heroin tripled in the last four years. My question is, since to the Mexicans, that it's also the failure of the U.S. government to attack the problem of consumption and the amount of heroin, it's not just Mexico to blame of production of heroin. It's also the consumption and the demand of the drug in the U.S. How do you respond to that question of the Mexicans?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess I would respond to it in a couple of ways. The first is, the United States is obviously taking quite seriously our efforts to combat the drug trade. We've been able to work effectively with the Mexican government to fight the flow of drugs coming over the border from Mexico. But we obviously believe that there is more that Mexico can and should do to assist in that effort.\nWe also believe that there is more that the United States can and should do to treat heroin addiction in this country as more than just a law enforcement problem. And the President has put forward a very specific set of ideas about how to expand access to health care so that people who are addicted to opioids and heroin can get treatment.\nAnd, unfortunately, we have not seen additional resources committed by Republicans in Congress, despite repeated requests to do so. And, in fact, the President put forward in his budget proposal a very specific, funded, paid-for plan to expand access to drug treatment programs in this country. And as you will recall, House Republicans and Senate Republicans, for the first time in 40 years, *[didn't] agree to even have a hearing on the President's budget. So it's not just that Republicans have blocked that funding, they won't even talk about it.\nAnd that's unfortunate because we know that the heroin and opioids addiction problems in this country are significant and are having an impact on not just lives, but communities across the country. And there certainly is more that we can do expand access to health care, to expand access to treatment programs, and reduce the demand for heroin in the United States. That would absolutely have a positive impact on our law enforcement efforts. It also would have a positive impact on the lives of the people who are -- have been so deeply affected in a negative way by this kind of addiction.\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, I do have a question about the summit tomorrow, but first I want to ask about Benghazi. There does seem to be at least one thing that both the Democrats and Republicans agree on when it comes to this probe.\nMR. EARNEST: That it's politically motivated.\nQ: Well, the Democrats in their probe, as well, I'm talking about, and the report they released yesterday --\nMR. EARNEST: Okay.\nQ: -- pointing out that security was \"woefully inadequate\" in Benghazi. That was the language used by Democrats. They also pointed to intelligence failures in the Republican report. So my question is whether the White House is satisfied that those failures have been adequately addressed by the State Department and other agencies. I mean, are American diplomats abroad any safer now?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think what I would go back to is the Accountability Review Board. This was an independent group of professionals, of experts, that was created by Secretary Clinton, was chaired by Admiral Mullen --\nQ: Congressionally mandated, though -- they're required to. But I take your point, people were on it.\nMR. EARNEST: But they're basically our experts who took an independent look at the situation. These are individuals like Admiral Mike Mullen, Ambassador Thomas Pickering, a diplomat who served under both Presidents, and they took a careful look at this. They put forward 29 specific recommendations that should be implemented by the State Department to improve security at facilities around the globe and to address other concerns that were raised by this particular incident. The State Department has implemented all of them.\nSo, again, this is something that happened years ago. That's why it's hard to take very seriously the charges that are being leveled by Republicans in Congress.\nQ: State said they implemented 26 of the 29 recommendations. But that aside, I mean, bigger picture, is the White House satisfied?\nMR. EARNEST: Twenty-six have been completed, the other three are in the process of being implemented.\nQ: Are American diplomats abroad safer now?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, absolutely, because these recommendations have been or are being implemented by the State Department.\nQ: And when it comes to the intelligence failures, you think those have also been adequately addressed in terms of those laid out by Secretary Panetta and other agency leaders?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, I have full confidence that the kinds of reforms that we would like to see after an incident like this have been implemented in a way that has enhanced our national security, that has enhanced the safety of diplomats around the globe. That's the kind of response that you would expect if there was a genuine interest in trying to address the tragedy to make the country safer -- to learn lessons and make sure that something like that didn't happen again, or at least take as many steps as possible to prevent something like that from happening again.\nIf you're interested in politics, what you do is you spend basically the three or four years after the incident basically trying to drum up conspiracy theories that never really pan out, and releasing high-profile reports that even Republicans themselves acknowledged are motivated at attacking a prominent Democratic politician. That's unfortunate. And that certainly is a disrespectful way to recognize and memorialize the death of four innocent Americans who were serving their country overseas.\nQ: Last on Benghazi. Your feelings are very clear, but bigger picture, do you think there is any public interest that was served to have gone through what was supposed to be this select committee bipartisan probe? I mean, some would argue that this was how evidence was revealed in regard to Secretary Clinton using a private email server for government business -- it all sort of -- the scandals melded together there in some way. But some would say, hey, at least that was something that perhaps is in the public interest, given that there's still an FBI investigation underway in regard to that particular point.\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I think what I would simply have to say about this is that it is clear that Republicans had to work really hard to make the eighth installment of this series interesting. I think Hollywood producers would be happy to tell you how difficult it is to sell sequels. And by the time you're around to the eighth one, you have to find ways to add high-speed car chases and more explosions, but that doesn't make them any more useful to the public. It may make them more entertaining to the audience that you're trying to appeal to, and we know there's a very clear partisan audience that Republicans are trying to appeal to, but I think it's pretty hard for any Republican or a Democrat, for that matter, to make the case that useful, additional information has been yielded in the context of the Benghazi committee's years' long probe of this particular situation.\nQ: On the summit tomorrow, Canada today lifted visa requirements on Mexicans traveling there, making it easier for Mexicans to visit Canada. Is President Obama looking at a similar or any kind of sort of confidence-building gesture, given the talk right now about building walls, rather than making it easier for Mexicans to come to the United States?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any announcements to make in terms of our immigration policies. Obviously the ability of the United States and Mexico to do business, to give Americans and Mexicans the opportunity to visit our respective countries for tourism or for other purposes is something that makes a substantial and positive contribution to our economy and economic growth. So maintaining those ties is important.\nBut what the President has also said is that securing the border is important, and that's why, under President Obama's leadership, we have made an historic investment in resources and personnel to secure the border between the United States and Mexico. But we certainly want to do that in a way that doesn't unnecessarily inhibit lawful travel between our two countries because we know that kind of travel and those kinds of exchanges have positive economic benefits for both countries.\nQ: The Mexican President has obviously watched television. -- made public comments in his own country, expressing a lot of concern about some of the rhetoric being used by Donald Trump. Will President Obama directly address some of that in his conversation with the Mexican President tomorrow? I mean, is he in any way, broadly speaking, trying to strengthen the relationship with Mexico ahead of this election?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President has spoken before about how world leaders have certainly made note of the debate on the campaign trail. The President has made clear that the impact of that debate has not been entirely positive when it comes to the international perception of the United States. But the President, as he has done many times publicly, has privately assured other world leaders of the wisdom of the American people.\nQ: So Donald Trump, in short, will come up in terms of trying to reassure him?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, that's not on the President's agenda tomorrow, but --\nQ: But immigration, refugees, all of those issues are on the table. The Mexican President has compared Trump to Mussolini and Hitler. I mean, his views are pretty clear.\nMR. EARNEST: I think that's why I'm not denying that it's going to come up. I'm just saying that the President's agenda will be different. But we'll see. You'll have an opportunity to hear from the leaders tomorrow, and they can tell you whether or not they discussed it.\nKaren.\nQ: Josh, back to Zika. You say that there already isn't enough funding there for public health officials and public health agencies. All indications are now that nothing will get done, as you just went through to the earlier question, but is there a backup plan right now to find funds somewhere else as there was done the Ebola funding -- take money from somewhere and apply it to this, given how urgent you keep saying this?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, our backup plan has already been deployed. And you'll recall that it was four months ago that the administration put forward a very specific legislative proposal, written by public health experts, detailing for Congress exactly what was necessary to do everything possible to protect the American people from the Zika virus. And Congress hasn't acted. Democrats have been eager to act on that proposal, but Republicans have blocked it.\nRepublicans have turned yet another critical matter into a partisan tool, and that's unfortunate. But, look, I don't have any additional information about other potential steps that could be used to find additional funding for this. That's why Congress needs to act. That's why this is Congress's responsibility to ensure that the necessary resources are provided to develop vaccines, to develop diagnostics, to expand lab capacity, to educate the public about steps they can take to protect themselves.\nThere are certainly additional resources that can be deployed to fight mosquito populations in local communities across the country. We've got state and local officials who are practically begging for additional resources to do a better job of fighting the mosquito population. But those calls from Democratic and Republican officials alike are falling on deaf ears when it comes to Republicans in Congress.\nQ: You've been ringing the alarms now for weeks, if not months, when the initial request for funding went out. But is there more that the White House could be doing? Could the President be doing more hands-on talking to members of Congress on this? Is the Vice President making calls up on the Hill and pushing for this? I mean, you keep saying how urgent it is, but besides us asking questions and you talking about it, what else is being done that we don't know about?\nMR. EARNEST: I guess the question I would have is, why should the President be in the position of twisting Republican arms in Congress to do something that our public health professionals say is necessary to address a public health emergency?\nSo the President has had a number of conversations, and I'm confident that he will moving forward, but it's pretty obvious what's happening here. The Republicans are refusing to embrace their basic responsibility to ensure that our public health professionals have the funding that they need to do everything possible to protect the American people. And I don't know why Republicans won't act. But they'll have to explain that to their constituents I suppose.\nRich.\nQ: Josh, in the first part of the Republican comment that you read in response to Byron's question, you cited the Republicans said the talking-point development was flawed. Was it? Do you sign on to that part of their statement?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think there's a -- it has long been acknowledged that there were conflicting assessments from the intelligence community in the days after this particular incident. I think that's something that the intelligence community has testified to.\nQ: The posture, the answer from the administration wasn't necessarily conflicting -- it was largely focused on this video. That didn't come across publicly, at least in what we had heard in the interviews following the event on September 11th.\nMR. EARNEST: But I think the difference here, Rich, is that Republicans have suggested that there is a political motive. Republicans in the context of this committee have suggested that there is a political motive when writing the talking points. But House Republicans who serve on the intelligence community -- on the Intelligence Committee in the House say that there was no evidence to substantiate that claim.\nQ: So taking your point that it's not -- that you say that it's not political, was it flawed, though? Was the process flawed and were the points flawed?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think the Intelligence Committee -- the intelligence community, even in testifying here, has acknowledged that there was conflicting intelligence information that they were sifting through in the immediate aftermath of the attack. I don't think that's new. I also think given the chaotic situation that was unfolding, I don't think it's particularly surprising to hear that that might have been the case.\nQ: And in discussing the briefing and you talking about it with Byron, Republicans point out who wasn't in the briefing. They say the administration did not have DOD, FBI, CIA -- not on that private call with Ben Rhodes and David Plouffe the night before the Sunday show appearances. Would it be -- why not? And how and when did Ambassador Rice get an intelligence assessment before appearing to essentially be the face of the description for what had happened from the administration's point of view?\nMR. EARNEST: Rich, I think what is pretty clear is -- and, again, this is something that is backed up by conclusions reached by Republicans in one of the seven previous investigations that they have done -- is that there was no political effort to manipulate the information that was presented. There is no evidence to substantiate that claim. I recognize it has not prevented Republicans from continuing to make that claim, but they do so without any shred of evidence.\nQ: And discussing the politicization of it in your remarks at the top of the briefing, you talked about the RNC reimbursing taxpayers.\nMR. EARNEST: Just disclosing the in-kind contribution I think would be enough.\nQ: In the Democrats' version of the report, they mentioned the presumptive Republican nominee 23 times. Isn't that political?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I think you'd have to ask the House Democrats about their report. I think what is clear is that the would-be Speaker of the House acknowledged that the reason that this committee was formed was to drive down Secretary Clinton's poll numbers. Congressman Richard Hanna from upstate New York indicated that the whole purpose of this committee was to go after Secretary Clinton.\nSo, again, you're certainly welcome to quote me in talking about the political motivations of the Republicans in Congress when looking at this issue. But if you're skeptical and you think that I have a partisan bias, then I would encourage you to look at leading Republicans who serve in the House of Representatives, who say that the activities of their fellow Republicans in the House of Representatives are politically motivated and merely an attempt to drive down Secretary Clinton's poll numbers.\nQ: And does the administration regret any decisions made up to, during, or after? Anything it thinks it could have done differently?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think, Rich, the fact that the Accountability Review Board found 25 -- or 29 reforms that needed to be implemented I think is an indication that, yes, there are some reforms that were necessary. And the President certainly has prioritized the safety and security of Americans who are serving our country around the globe, whether that is in uniform or in our diplomatic corps.\nSo the administration is taking quite seriously the need to implement these reforms, and as Margaret pointed out, almost all of them have been implemented and the three that haven't been yet are in the process of being implemented. So I think that is a pretty clear indication that this administration has set aside politics and actually focused on what can make the country and our diplomats safer. And we've taken concrete steps to follow that advice.\nBut here's the thing. That is advice that we received almost three years ago, and that is advice that we are implementing to protect the safety and well-being of the American people and American diplomats. Republicans, three years later, are still trying to play politics. And that's rather unfortunate, to say the least.\nLauren.\nQ: Back to Zika. Why isn't $1 billion better than nothing? You keep saying that this is political, that the Republicans are making this a political issue. But Speaker Ryan is the one who said there needs to be checks and balances on this money. So why don't we give X amount of money and then another piece of money?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I haven't heard him say exactly that. I think the first question I would ask for Speaker Ryan is, if our public health professionals say they need $1.9 billion to do everything possible to protect pregnant women and their newborn babies, then why wouldn't we just use those resources to do exactly that?\nI think that is a very difficult question for Speaker Ryan and other House Republicans to answer. They would rather, Lauren, because there is nothing that apparently escapes their partisan motivations, they'd rather play politics. So what Republicans have done is basically found what they apparently think is a convenient vehicle for ramming through controversial policy that relates to Confederate flags. What does that have to do with the Zika virus? Nothing. Other than it presents an opportunity for Republicans to ram through the Congress something controversial.\nI think the other thing that's included in here is that there are certain prohibitions on using these resources for contraception efforts. This is a sexually transmitted disease. I think that's an indication that Republicans don't take this particularly seriously.\nThere are also measures in here that would suspend some rules and regulations that apply for the Clean Water Act. What does that have to do with fighting Zika? Why do we need to suspend environmental regulations for six months in order to more effectively fight mosquito populations?\nAgain, I think these are questions that are hard for Republicans to answer. The only explanation is they're willing to play politics with the health and safety of pregnant women and newborn babies. Shame on them. But, apparently, they have no shame. That's the only explanation I can think of.\nQ: The President did a video yesterday about getting people to register to vote. Is this the first time he has ever made a friendship bracelet? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: As far as I know, yes. (Laughter.) I think the President made the crafting of that bracelet look rather difficult, so I suspect it was probably the first time that he had done it.\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, he did.\nIn the back, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: On Puerto Rico, there is no guarantee that the Senate will pass a bill tomorrow. The administration has said that it's this or nothing. As the time gets closer to that July 1st deadline, are there any other options? Are you guys considering anything else other than the bill?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, this is yet another example -- and I'm glad you raised it here before we wrapped up -- of Congress needing to act to protect the safety and well-being of millions of Americans. In this case, we're talking about the 3.5 million Americans that live in Puerto Rico.\nSecretary Lew, who has done yeoman's work to try to move this legislation across the finish line, has made clear that if Congress doesn't act, what is certainly possible is we'll find ourselves in a situation in which the Puerto Rico government has to take rash measures like emergency furloughs, and laying off police officers, or teachers, and health care workers. They could potentially be faced with the need to shut down public buses and trains.\nAnd the reason for all of this is that because of the upcoming deadline, the government could face a responsibility to pay their bondholders and not provide these essential services.\nSo, hopefully, we will avoid a situation in which Puerto Rican officials have to face this basic choice. But there are grave consequences for congressional inaction. And the ray of good news here is in an almost unprecedented step, we did see a majority of Democrats and majority of Republicans in the House of Representatives come together to pass a bill to address the situation in Puerto Rico.\nThe bill is imperfect. But it is something that would prevent these kinds of consequences. It's not a bailout. But a bailout only becomes more likely if Congress doesn't act. That is a scenario that Democrats and Republicans in the Congress should avoid. And we're hopeful that Democrats and Republicans in the Senate will come together in the same way that Democrats and Republicans in the House did to support an imperfect but critically important piece of legislation that would have an impact on the lives of 3.5 million Americans living in Puerto Rico.\nQ: So that's the only option at this point?\nMR. EARNEST: That is the only option that can avert the potential consequences of this deadline. And again, hopefully we'll see the kind of bipartisan action in the Senate that we surprisingly saw in the House.\nThanks, everybody.\nEND 2:44 P.M.

{"author": "Michelle Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=120910", "text": "MS. SESAY: Mrs. Obama, it's such an honor to be here with you today, and to be here with these amazing trailblazers, brought together by your Let Girls Learn initiative. Thank you for the invitation.\nMRS. OBAMA: Thank you, Isha. And thank you all. I am beyond excited to be here with all of you. I have read so much about you. I know your stories, I know your challenges, but, more importantly, I know your triumphs. And I'm so excited to be able to bring a piece of the world here to hear your stories.\nAs you may know, this is the second leg of a three-country tour that I'm on. I just flew in last night from Liberia, and we had an amazing day there with a tremendous group of young women. And Freida did a phenomenal job in moderating a conversation that we had there. So I'm looking forward to adding your voices to this conversation. And we're doing it in a way where we want to share this conversation with young girls around the world, particularly in the United States. They're following this tour because, like me, they are outraged at the notion that there are 62 million girls worldwide who are not in school.\nAnd the truth is, is that the reasons why girls aren't being educated are many and varied. There's no one reason. It varies from community, from society. There are cultural norms that play a role. There are resources that play a role.\nBut we are all coming together, and we will come together as a group of women, to tackle this issue. And in many ways, it's going to start with your generation. So I am proud of you all. I'm excited to hear from you. And I look forward to answering your questions and hearing more from you.\nSo don't be shy. The cameras can be daunting, even for the best of us. But we're among friends, so block them out and pretend like it's just us, just us girls talking. (Laughter.) So thank you all so much. (Applause.)\nMS. SESAY: So you heard Mrs. Obama say it's just us girls,\nright? This is like a hang-out session. This is a really cool hang-out session with Mrs. Obama and Meryl and Freida. And for me personally, I'm here -- and Karima told you I'm here because Mrs. Obama asked me, and also because I've covered these issues not just as a journalist, but as someone who comes from a country like Sierra Leone. I don't know whether many of you know it, it's in West Africa. It's one of the poorest countries in the world. Girls there face tremendous hardships to get into school. My parents came from very humble beginnings. My mother comes from a Muslim family, there were many wives and that caused problems for her to get an education. But she was educated, and so was I.\nSo I'm an example of transformative power of education. I'm an example of what education can do, and that's why I'm here. And I also just want Meryl and Freida to also talk a little bit about why they joined us. Because this conversation today is about the challenges you're facing -- the challenges to get an education, some of those barriers, how you're overcoming them, and what your hopes and dreams are for the future. Really want to get a sense of your hopes, your dreams, who your role models are, and just what gives you the strength to keep going. Because you are all trailblazers.\nSo you now know why I'm here. I want to hand it over to Freida so she can say a little bit about why she's here and what she's going to bring to this conversation as we talk about some of those things.\nFreida.\nMS. PINTO: Thank you, Isha. Marhaba. Am I saying it right? (Laughter.) Kefalek. (Laughter.) So I do remember a little bit of my Arabic. (Laughter.)\nGirls, literally the only reason why I'm here is to learn more from you. I have a passion, and my passion goes beyond what I do for my day job, which is acting and producing and being part of the film world. I love what I do. I absolutely love what I do. And that start that I got in 2008 put my on a platform, where I realized that the education that my parents gave me -- I also come from a very simple, middle-class family, and my parents worked really, really hard to put me in the best possible school, the best possible college, get the best education they could afford.\nAnd given all that they've put into me, and the investment in this girl child and my older sister -- when I realized that my first film put me on this platform that gave me this voice -- and I was already doing, with the help of my mom, who was also a teacher -- I was already doing a lot of work with her at the school level, especially with girls in India -- that's where I come from -- who couldn't get a basic education. And I realized this voice that I got suddenly started becoming really powerful. I was setting somewhat of a trend.\nAnd of course I learned that on a thing like the red carpet, you wear the color blue and then everybody is like \"Blue is the new in color.\" (Laughter.) And then I realized, what if I said education for girls is the new best thing? What would happen with that?\nSo with the help of my team, I told them, I want to find the right organizations, the right kind of people -- I have a lot to learn. I have a lot to learn from people like Meryl Streep, Isha, and Mrs. Obama. So what a privilege for me to even be sitting with them and learning firsthand, but I also have a lot to learn from girls like you. I want to be the storyteller, a storyteller who's responsible, who is enthusiastic, and who the people back there will listen and then take the story to the rest of the world, to the United States, to back home in India.\nSo, yeah, really I'm here to learn from you and hopefully take in whatever I can and imbibe in the projects that we do from now on. So thank you very much for giving this opportunity. And thank you so much, Mrs. Obama. (Applause.)\nMS. SESAY: Thank you, Freida. And, Meryl, the same question to you: Why did you drop everything to be here for this?\nMS. STREEP: I think that if Mrs. Obama asked me to road trip anywhere in the world -- (laughter) -- I would say, \"I'm there in five minutes.\" But it was especially interesting to me to come to Morocco, because I'm aware that here in this country, there is a special push in order to enable girls beyond primary level education to go on to secondary school, to university. And I want to help that happen all over the world.\nI work with a lot of different organizations to that end. But I haven't really traveled and gone into homes and spoken to individuals. Every single person's story is different. And it's been exhilarating, and moving, and funny, and fun to be here on the ground. I am the Moroccan team here. (Laughter.) This is the Liberia team. (Laughter.) But I've been holding down the fort, couldn't wait for you to come and experience it.\nMRS. OBAMA: You've been doing a phenomenal job. I've heard all about it. I've gotten reports in from the ground. (Laughter.) You're doing a great job.\nMS. STREEP: But I'm also someone who -- I'm older than everybody else. I'm not a grandmother yet --\nMRS. OBAMA: Darn. (Laughter.)\nMS. SESAY: In time, in time.\nMS. STREEP: But I'm hoping, in time. But I grew up at a time in the United States when -- neither of my parents graduated from university. My father was in college but had to drop out because of the Depression, they lost all their money. And then in -- my mother also was never able to go to university because it was too expensive, no one had any money. So I'm the first. And it was -- they were very, very proud of me. And I have two little brothers.\nBut after the war, after the great World War, an enormous push from the American government built thousands of schools. It was a priority. And my father used to complain that the taxes were too high, but he never complained that the schools weren't good enough because the schools were wonderful, and I'm a product of that event. And I want to help. I know there's so much work being done by the Moroccan government with the help of USAID, Let Girls Learn, so many NGOs, Peace Corps. And I just want to be here to encourage that, because I wouldn't sit in this chair without my free education and the help with loans that I got right through my graduate degree.\nSo I'm very happy to be -- and I'd like to say that -- to really let you start to speak. Because your stories are more interesting than a girl from New Jersey. So I'd like to turn it over to you, Karima. Karima has a particular story, and it's different from everybody else but I'd like you to talk a little bit about that.\nKARIMA: Thank you so much. So hello, everyone. I'm Karima Sisett (ph.) First of all, I'm so happy to be among such inspirational ladies. It's a great honor -- and to be with you girls.\nMy story starts -- I grew up in a very small town called Ouarzazate, four hours away from here. The support system in my family was really amazing. My parents always supported education. I grew up in a family where expectations were high. My brother graduated from high school with honors, and he went to university. So I thought that was it, that's the end of it; so my parents got their first born, he's a male, and he went to university so they achieved their dream, that's it.\nBut that wasn't the case. I was wrong. They encouraged me to do the same as he did, if not better. So it was really good. My father always said, as long as you're living just keep filling your brain with knowledge. And my mother wanted me to just have all the opportunity she never had the chance to have because she didn't have the right people around here or the tools to help her get the education she wanted.\nBut the struggle started when I went to high school. And I chose science and technology of electricity as a specialty, which is a domain where males are dominating. And you can imagine that in a classroom, we only have seven girls out of 30 students. So the struggle began there, the stereotypes -- \"you're a girl, what are you doing between machines and wires, you're not supposed to be here.\" Or when the teacher is talking about motorcycles or -- the system, we don't understand that but boys are very familiar with it.\nBut I watched a video of yours talking about the -- \"Best Story Ever,\" and how you got the audition for the movie, and you said that perseverance is the most important thing to achieve what you want. And that's something I really liked, because I insisted on going and on studying and making myself better, and having my voice heard between those males. And I did that. I broke the chain. Like previous years, boys always come on top, and this year I came on top. (Applause.)\nAnd throughout high school, I went to exchange program Tech-Girls, which is a program run by the U.S. Department of State. That program was a beautiful experience. It allowed me to meet women -- inspirational women like you working in the STEM field in technology. And I had the opportunity to do a week of coding, Java, and it was really fun and I met so many amazing people. And they opened my eyes on a lot of opportunities and careers in the STEM field.\nSo overall, if you have -- the people who are surrounding you are very positive and you have the tools and you have the perseverance, as you said, and the good supportive system, as we talked about yesterday, and you have the will, you will achieve what you want to do.\nAnd this is not the end. I'm not going to stop right here. I mean, I'm going to university after -- I just graduated from high school, by the way, and I'm going to university --\nMRS. OBAMA: Congratulations.\nKARIMA: Thank you. And when I get a good career, I'm going to help all of the girls in Morocco and all around the world to just let their dreams go and just to dream bigger, and to achieve what they want. And thank you all. (Applause.)\nMS. SESAY: Karima, thank you. Thank you so much for sharing that story of inspiration. It's so important. And you touched on something that I want us to talk about. You touched on the importance of having people around you to encourage you, to support you, to tell you to walk down that path, whatever that path may be. Some people don't have that. Some girls don't have those supportive people. In some cases, there are -- it's a barrier. It's effectively a barrier to getting an education or staying in school -- social attitudes, cultural attitudes where some people feel that girls shouldn't be educated in the first place, or that they should just do a little bit of learning and then drop out. It's a barrier that some of you here have faced. It's certainly a barrier that girls around the world encounter.\nSo you have those kinds of barriers. You also have physical barriers. You have the barriers such as schools being far away, so you can't get there. You want to go to school, but they're just too far away, and your families don't want you to make that kind of journey, right? There are also challenges like schools that don't have adequate bathroom facilities. That's also a barrier.\nSo there are different kinds of barriers that some of you here have faced and know personally, and I'd just like us to talk a little bit about that, where you have encountered those kinds of challenges. I know, Fusia (ph), you have a story that you'd like to share about overcoming challenges. And that's the key, though, that I want us to focus on -- there are challenges, but you're proof of overcoming them.\nQ: Yes. First of all, I'm glad to be here in front of your beautiful faces. It's like a dream come true. And I'm so happy to be here with you and with Mrs. Obama. And actually, okay -- my name is Fusia, Fusia Turkartoum (ph) -- a small village far away with -- 60 kilometers from Marrakech. So at the beginning, I had the first -- the primary school at my village. When I finished the primary school, I had to move to the other village to -- the secondary school. And the challenges began there.\nSo my family were against the idea, so they said you have to stay home, no more classes, no more school. So it was really hard for me. But with perseverance, as my friend said, with the -- I said, no, I have to study, why not, why should I stay home, I have to go and get -- study. Education is everything. And I don't know where the power comes from at that time, 12 years old, and I was saying so big words -- I want to study, I want to do this and this and this.\nSo they let me at the end. I joined the secondary school. I was the first female from that place to join this secondary school, and I was the only one. I have to go to the secondary school, seven kilometers going and seven kilometers going back home. When I get three years of secondary school, going and coming back to home with seven kilometers, then I have to join the high school. Then it was better. It was better than secondary, because I joined the Dar Taliba there in Touama. And it was really awesome. It was cool, even if it was a little bit hard from the very beginning. But I enjoyed it, and I was studying. And they get -- to study. So easily I get the first marks with honor in my first year, second year and third year. (Applause.)\nI graduated from baccalaureate with honors, and then I joined the university. When I get my baccalaureate, I was not planning for university. My plans were so big, but I couldn't achieve them. My family couldn't support to let me go to Rabat to apply for journalism or for something else. So I have to -- like it was the last chance to come back to Marrakech and to join university. At the beginning I was confused about French or English. Then just English -- something pushes me to learn English. Then I started study in -- at university. I'm now about to graduate. My defense is Thursday.\nMRS. OBAMA: Whoa.\nQ: Yeah. And I'm still young and I'm just\nMRS. OBAMA: Yes, she is.\nQ: Yeah. And I'm learning also some Japanese. I have a little -- in Japanese. And I would like to carry on studying more languages. I would like to be a polyglot and a linguist. (Applause.)\nMS. SESAY: You're such an inspiration. Congratulations on all you've achieved so far. And it's not the end, it's just the beginning for you. I know that. And I also know you have a question for Freida that you wanted to ask.\nQ: Oh, yeah. My question for you, Freida, is, you have advocated for girls' education, and do you face some challenges during your education? And so please I would like to know those challenges. And I would like you to give us advice so as to defend those people who are -- to defend this issue with people who are against girls' education. And thank you so much.\nMS. PINTO: Thank you. Thank you so much for your story. It's so inspirational. No, I had no challenges. So you might wonder what it is that I'm doing here, right? I had absolutely nothing. My parents gave me whatever I wanted, and in some ways, I think I kind of was a little spoiled, you know? I asked for -- I want a new keyboard, and they would get me a keyboard because they just wanted me to learn. And whatever I could imbibe and just take in, they just wanted me to have everything. And I know it was really difficult for them because my older sister would always tell me, you're so spoiled, you get -- whatever you ask for, Dad give it to you.\nBut I'll tell you what happened. I was in -- probably 12 years old -- 10 years old, actually. I was younger, I was in the fifth grade. And my mom is a teacher -- was a teacher, like I told you. And we were going in an auto-rickshaw, a tuk-tuk, as you call it, to her school. I think it was, like, science day -- I didn't go to her school, by the way. She did not want me to be in her school. I went to a different school.\nAnd while we were on our way, there was -- my mom always talked about \"education is very important,\" and my grandmother said the same thing, and \"it's every child's fundamental right.\" And she would use these big words with me and I would keep repeating them, and I understood them. And then there was this girl who came to one of the traffic lights begging for money. And she was younger than I was; she was probably 6 or 7 years old, and should have been in school. And I befriended here; her name was Pinky. And as Pinky left, I looked at my mom and I said, you lied to me, you said education is every child's basic right, I asked if she went to school and she said no. She took some chocolates and -- my parents never encouraged me to give money -- she took some chocolates from me and she ran away. I said, you lied to me. And my mom said, no, I didn't lie to you, I am sending you to school. I said, yes, I'm going to school, but what about her.\nAnd my mom was so dumbfounded by this \"you lied to me\" accusation. So she said to me, you know what, I think it's time to share the truth with you about this unequal world. And there are many girls in India -- many boys and girls in India, I must say, who don't go to school. And they can't -- either their parents can't afford it, or girls are married off very young. And she was simplifying this as much as she could for a 10 year old.\nAnd I told her at that point in time, I don't think it's fair and I want to do something, I want you to do something, Mom. And my mom said, I have to continue doing this job so I can make enough money to continue sending you to school, but why don't you complete your education and figure out what you want to do to help these girls?\nSo I think growing up in India and being exposed to the inequality of it all and seeing it day in and day out, and having a lot of friends -- I had a lot of friends who could not even afford their school fees, so a bunch of our families would get together and sponsor students as well. I think seeing that and knowing that their challenges were there, they existed, but seeing the passion in them -- and sometimes it would -- I would have to do my own little reality check. I'm complaining about every little thing -- about my heavy backpack, and the amount of homework I have. But these kids who have nothing, who burn their chimney oils not even having light and fans, or the luxury of just being -- having all the facilities that one has to have a great education. They really worked very hard. And more often than never, they were always on top of the class. I was not always there, but I tried my best.\nAnd I think that's what really pushed me to take this on quite seriously. And I think your second question was what was the --\nMS. SESAY: It was advice, what advice would you give?\nMS. PINTO: To girls.\nMS. SESAY: To girls who have to -- who are taking on these -- who are facing these kinds of barriers.\nMRS. OBAMA: And what kinds of things can we tell them to help them defend against those who think that girls' education isn't important? Because there are plenty of facts that back up the notion.\nMS. PINTO: You know, this is -- knowing how complex the situation is, and having been on the ground where -- we've actually witnessed this girl who did not actually want to get married, and she was really, really young. She was like, no, I want to finish my school but my parents want to get me married. And it's hard, because sometimes we're sitting on the periphery thinking we can just go in and interfere in their family matters and say, no, you can't do that.\nI think it's important -- and this is my practical advice -- is to find organizations and groups of people who work towards making sure that girls complete their education, work on the ground in those local communities. It's important for girls to be able to stand their ground. It's important for you to not be shy to raise your voices.\nFor me it came -- I was a very boisterous child. I had to be told to like, okay, now, calm down. (Laughter.) But there were many girls who did not have that, they were really shy. There's no time to be shy today. You have to speak up. Because if you don't speak up, there is someone else -- and more often than ever, it's a man -- who will speak up in place of you. And you don't want that to happen.\nSo I feel it's important to be able to let your voice from within just come out and say no. And one thing that actually works, which I noticed in Rajasthan, is girls supporting girls. There is nothing like unity. When girls come together knowing that a certain girl is -- by the way, the way this girl's marriage got averted was because a group of her girlfriends came together and went to her parents and protested, saying, she's really bright in school, you can't do that, we're going to go to the local community and we're going to tell them what you're doing, we're going to go to the police. And it was really -- it was fun listening to their stories how they felt like crusaders of sorts. They felt like superheroes.\nSo I think band together. Don't feel this competition in a way, which -- healthy competition is good, but this competition that -- where one girl pulls another girl down, it's no good. It goes nowhere. So just band together. And I feel that the unity is going to make your voices even stronger.\nMRS. OBAMA: And, Isha, I just want to make sure you all are equipped with the facts too. If there are people who come to you and say, why should we educate girls? Well, the health of any nation can be measured by the health of women in that society. Because women bear children. They raise the children. And if you look at women who are not educated in their countries, there are health outcomes that are negatively impacted: Higher infant mortality rates. Higher rates of HIV. They have obviously lower wages. And all of those conditions have an impact not just on that girl, but on her family, on that society, and eventually on the entire nation.\nSo what you want to say is that girls' education is important to all of us, which is why we're all here. Those 62 million girls who are not being educated around the world impact my life in Washington, D.C., in the United States of America. Because if we aren't empowering and providing the skills and the resources to half of our population, then we're not realizing our full potential as a society, as mankind. So we have to change those notions that girls are only valuable for their reproductive capacity, or their ability to do manual labor. We need every one of our citizens, boys and girls, to be educated and involved and empowered.\nSo those are facts that you can go to, to -- whether it's your parents or to people, leaders in your community to say that by helping me, I can help my entire society. And that's what -- a lot of times that makes people stand up and take notice. How can you be more valuable: Learning how to do laundry or washing dishes, or learning how to develop a business, and earning an income, and bringing those resources back home? And it's pushing those norms and traditions, getting parents and grandparents to think differently about what you can bring to the family.\nThere are real arguments to be made that the investment in an education now will reap benefits -- years to come. And that's what my family knew instinctively. My parents didn't go to university. We didn't have a lot of money. But one of the things that was a great fortune to me was that my parents understood the value of an education. And they fought for me, they sacrificed, they saved. I had an older brother who went ahead of me, but it wasn't enough that he went to one of the finest universities in the country. I saw him and I thought, well, if he can do it, I can do it, because I know I'm smarter than him. (Laughter.) And my parents believed in me too. And as a result, I went on to get my B.A., I went on to get my law degree. I've worked as a lawyer, as an associate dean. I've run a youth organization. I have brought more resources back to my family because of that investment.\nAnd I'm sitting here with you today as the First Lady of the United States because of my education, and because of that preparation. So that's the vision you want to impart to those who might doubt you and those who might say, well, why should we invest? It is critical to the health of our nations. (Applause.)\nMS. SESAY: Really beautifully said, Mrs. Obama. And, Meryl, before we move on I just wondered if you want to add anything to this. I know you've spent a couple of days here in Morocco, and just -- as you listened, and whether you have any advice when it comes to standing up to blaze your path to meet those challenges head on.\nMS. STREEP: I'm not sure I have advice for the girls here. I think within each one of them, the young women that I have met have such strength of purpose, have such -- it all exists within each of you. It is already there. And you just have to reach in and access it.\nI had a wonderful conversation yesterday with Fusia (ph.) And we were talking, and she -- I asked her -- because it was hard. She was speaking of Dar Taliba, which are these dorms and residence situations for young women who are obliged to leave home, even if they don't want to, but to get the education. And this system is pretty great -- crowded at the first; maybe you were in the room with four girls, and then just -- and crying -- she was the youngest one -- crying every night, wanting to go home. And I said, what was it that made you carry on, not give up? Because in my own life, I know that losing heart is the most dangerous thing. You can put any obstacle in front of me and I'll jump over it. But when you lose heart, you lose everything.\nAnd so you take your strength from your friends, from that one person in your life who has said, you are capable.\nMRS. OBAMA: And you only need on.\nMS. SESAY: Absolutely.\nMS. STREEP: You only need one.\nMRS. OBAMA: You only need one person.\nMS. SESAY: Let's talk about that.\nMS. STREEP: That's Fusia's mother. So I wanted to just -- anyway. So we were talking about that.\nMS. SESAY: And I think that's beautiful, because we've moved into what I want to talk about next, that source of inspiration -- role models. That person who speaks possibility into your life, who tells you there's absolutely nothing that stands in your way. I know all of you have someone, whether -- they may be in your family, they could be in the community. You might not even know them -- they're someone from afar, or a teacher.\nFor me, it was my mother. She always said, you can do anything. When I told her at 16 I wanted to leave home and be an actress, she said go for it. I didn't, thankfully for all of you. (Laughter.) You don't have to worry, I'll never turn up, Freida, at an audition. (Laughter.) But she's my role model. She's my source of inspiration.\nSo I would love for you to share with us who the people are that have helped you become the young women that you are who are pushing you forward. Would you share with us your source of inspiration?\nQ: Sure. Good morning, ladies. I'm very glad to be here with you. Well, my name is Rihab Fusadress (ph.) I'm 17 years old, and I just got my baccalaureate. I just graduated from high school. Well, I'm supposed to talk about inspiration, how do I get inspiration. Actually, I have, like, a long list where I write down people's names who are making my life -- who are spreading, like, positive vibes and who are motivating me and inspiring me. Actually, I follow them on social media, and even -- I try to contact them if I can. My mom is on the list. My sisters are on the list. The First Lady is on the list. (Laughter.) I've been stalking you on social media. (Laughter.)\nMRS. OBAMA: We're here. You don't have to look anymore. We're here. (Laughter.)\nQ: Thank you. And actually, I saw a video of yours where you said that if you cared who thought you were cute when you were our age, you would never be the President of the United States' wife today. (Laughter.) And it inspired me, it really does. And I shared the video with my friends, and they were just like, girls, look, focus on education and forget about your appearances. And they were all inspired to, and I loved it.\nAnd one of the best ways I got inspired from -- too is through exchange programs. I went to the Tech-Girls program too with Karima last summer. I think Karima said it all about Tech-Girls -- we met amazing women there in the United States. I met 26 amazing female leaders from all around the Middle East and North Africa who gave me positive vibes to help push me to empower girls around me. And I really, really appreciated the experience. And that's it with my story. Thank you so much for listening.", "timestamp": "2016-06-28", "title": "Remarks by the First Lady, Meryl Streep, and Freido Pinto in a Let Girls Learn Conversation with Girl Students in Marrakech, Morocco"}

For four decades, she outworked her rivals, made winning an attitude, loved her players like family, and became a role model to millions of Americans, including our two daughters. Her unparalleled success includes never recording a losing season in 38 years of coaching , but also, and more importantly, a 100 percent graduation rate among her players who completed their athletic eligibility. Her legacy, however, is measured much more by the generations of young women and men who admired Pat's intense competitiveness and character and, as a result, found in themselves the confidence to practice hard, play harder, and live with courage on and off the court. As Pat once said in recalling her achievements: \"What I see are not the numbers. I see their faces.\"\nPat learned early on that everyone should be treated the same. When she would play basketball against her older brothers in the family barn, they didn't treat her any differently and certainly didn't go easy on her. Later, her Hall of Fame career would tell the story of the historic progress toward equality in American athletics that she helped advance. Pat started playing college hoops before title IX and started coaching before the NCAA recognized women's basketball as a sport. When she took the helm at Tennessee as a 22-year-old, she had to wash her players' uniforms; by the time Pat stepped down as the Lady Vols' head coach, her teams wore eight championship rings and had cut down nets in sold-out stadiums.\nPat was a patriot who earned Olympic medals for America as a player and a coach, and I was honored to award her the Presidential Medal of Freedom. She was a proud Tennessean who, when she went into labor while on a recruiting visit, demanded the pilot return to Knoxville so her son could be born in her home State. And she was an inspiring fighter. Even after Alzheimer's started to soften her memory, and she began a public and brave fight against that terrible disease, Pat had the grace and perspective to remind us that \"God doesn't take things away to be cruel. . . . He takes things away to lighten us. He takes things away so we can fly.\"\nMichelle and I send our condolences to Pat Summitt's family, which includes her former players and fans on Rocky Top and across America.", "timestamp": "2016-06-28", "title": "Statement on the Death of Patricia S.

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117670", "text": "Aboard Air Force One\nEn Route Ottawa, Canada\n9:24 A.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good morning, everybody. Welcome aboard Air Force One. Obviously the President has a set of important meetings today in Ottawa, Canada, where he'll be meeting with Prime Minister Trudeau and President Peсa Nieto as part of the North American Leaders' Summit.\nA critical part of the announcements that are being made today relate to the intensive cooperation among the United States, Canada and Mexico on a range of energy and climate issues. So we're going to be joined this morning by Brian Deese, who's the President's senior advisor and is the official at the White House who's responsible for coordinating our efforts on these energy and climate issues.\nSo I'm going to give Brian the opportunity to speak at the beginning about the significance of the agreements that are announced -- or will be announced later today. And for any questions you have about those issues, Brian can take them at the top. I know there's other pressing news of the day, but we'll get to that after Brian is done.\nSo, Brian, you want to take it from there?\nMR. DEESE: Great. Thanks, Josh.\nI'll just go briefly through the top lines of what the three leaders will be announcing today, and then just a couple thoughts about their significance, and then I'm happy to take your questions on that.\nSo, today, the three leaders will be releasing a North American Climate, Clean Energy, and Environment Partnership. This is a first-of-a-kind effort to develop a continent-wide strategy to be more ambitious about harnessing the economic opportunities and the national security and economic imperative to address climate change.\nThere's basically three major components to this partnership. The first is working together to set ambitious goals. That is most notably by the new goal to have 50 percent of electricity generated through clean sources by 2025 continent-wide. And that's a significant increase from where we are today where about 37 percent of our energy is generated from clean sources. It requires all three countries to push and maintain high ambition around encouraging clean energy, but it's something that we believe we can achieve together.\nWe're also collectively committing to achieve significant reductions in methane emissions, principally from the oil and gas sector. All three countries today will affirm a commitment to reduce methane emissions 40 to 45 percent by 2025. That's a commitment that previously the United States and Canada have made. Today, Mexico is joining that, as well. Likewise, an ambitious commitment but one that would have significant economic and climate benefits.\nThe second big piece of this partnership is around better aligning our policies to encourage our countries to work more closely together. And you see that across a range of issues. We're committing to specific goals on aligning energy efficiency standards, which will allow our businesses to more effectively market low-energy-use goods -- everything from appliances to air conditioners. We are committing to greater grid integration and cooperation on extending transmission lines, and identify a potential for 5,000 megawatts of new cross-border transmission lines between the U.S. and Canada, and between Mexico and the United States that will make it easier for our countries to both develop renewable energy but then also transmit that energy across borders.\nAnd, importantly, we're announcing a harmonization of our efforts to set fuel economy standards, both for light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles. This is both important for climate reasons for reducing emissions from vehicles, but also for giving our businesses more certainty about the ability to market their goods with harmonized standards across the North American region.\nThe third big area of cooperation that's reflected in this partnership is in the international arena. The United States, Canada and Mexico all played an important role in getting to the Paris climate agreement last December. And in this partnership, we send a strong signal that our three countries will work to increase the ambition in the international climate space.\nAnd just a couple of very specific things: All three countries are committing to formally join the Paris agreement this year, in 2016. All three countries are committing to develop a long-term de-carbonization strategy that was called for in the Paris agreement this year. All three countries are committing to support an effort to phase out fossil-fuel subsidies by 2025 and to promote that in the G20. All three countries are supporting an ambitious HFC amendment this year to phase down the harmful HFC pollutants. And all three countries are committing to reach an agreement to constrain emissions from the aircraft industry later this year through the ICAO process.\nSo you see in the international space a harmonization, a commitment by our three countries to work together.\nSo I think the upshot of all of this is a very significant and historic partnership on climate and clean energy issues. And I'd just make two comments about the significance. The first is, at the end of the day, the most compelling rationale to promote this agenda is because it will deliver tangible economic benefits to all of our countries.\nWe are releasing -- the White House is releasing a new analysis today from the Council of Economic Advisers that shows in concrete terms the expansion in clean energy jobs that will come from hitting the ambitious 50 percent clean energy goal. They project an additional 400,000 jobs supported in the United States if we hit that goal. And those are jobs not just in directly supporting renewable energy deployment -- although those jobs are growing quite quickly in the United States -- but also from things like infrastructure to build transmission lines; in the oil and gas sector -- to repair the leaks in pipelines associated with reducing methane emissions. Jobs all across the country in different industries. And ultimately, that is an important and powerful argument for why we need to act, and one that will be focusing on what the President will highlight in his speech to Parliament.\nI think the second issue here is just this is another example of the President's approach to addressing climate change. As many of you know, he has made this a top priority of his foreign policy and his domestic policy for several years. And his approach over the course of the last several years leading into Paris has been one of deliberate but concerted effort to work with allies, to work with different countries to try to bring along and encourage greater ambition in this space.\nThis partnership that's announced today between Canada and Mexico is the result of several years of work and leadership by the President, working closely with the Mexican government over the last couple of years, including on Mexico's submission to the Paris agreement last year. And there's been an alignment between the President and President Peсa Nieto about the need to be more ambitious on climate issues. It also reflects the fact that when Prime Minister Trudeau was elected, the first substantive piece of business that he and the President focused on was the question of how our two countries could be more ambitious and more aligned on the issue of climate and clean energy.\nWe have worked hard over the last six months to try to make good on that alignment between the two leaders. And I think the announcement today reflects an important step forward and an important demonstration of the President's approach to elevating the urgency of the climate issue in the international space.\nSo with that, I would pause and see if you got any questions on this, or we can turn it back to Josh.\nQ: What amount of help will you need from Congress in order to reach the 50 percent target? Will you need their cooperation?\nMR. DEEESE: So if you look at what is happening in the U.S. in the electricity industry and electricity sector, what you see is an increasingly rapid move toward cleaner sources of energy. We are going to need a consistent and ambitious policy framework to try to send the long-term market signal that those types of moves are in companies' economic interest. The good news is that we already have in place very strong policy tools to that effect.\nSpeaking of Congress, the Congress passed -- and the President signed into the law at the end of last year -- a multiyear extension of tax credits for wind and solar generation. Those tax credits go into the early 2020s and will provide a very strong incentive to continue the expansion of those sources of energy over the next several years. Likewise, the President's Clean Power Plan will provide an incentive over the longer term, because the period of implementation for the Clean Power Plan is 2022 to 2030.\nSo with those two tools in place, we have a strong set of market signals for the domestic industry. And we're going to continue to look for ways to reinforce that. And some of the things that are part of this partnership, including harmonizing energy efficiency standards and working on aligning vehicle standards are ways to do that. We, in the next several weeks, will be finalizing our heavy-duty vehicle regulations, for example, which is another way where we can do our part to try to get toward that ambitious goal.\nSo Congress has a role to play. On the renewable tax credits, they played an important role and the President signed those into law. But we're confident that we have the tools that we need to get there if we keep a focus on this and keep putting a priority on achieving that goal.\nQ: Brian, how worried is the President that most of his climate legacy might be undone within a few months if Donald Trump succeeds him in the White House?\nMR. DEESE: Look, I think that one of the things that -- one of the messages that came out of Paris and one of the things that you're seeing in the market, in the market in the United States, is that this move to clean energy, the momentum is only increasing, and that momentum is momentum in the market. It's being driven by the cost of technology and the dramatic reduction in costs of everything from solar and wind power to battery storage.\nThose trends are going to continue, and in fact, they're only going to accelerate. And if you go back to what I was just talking about, the extension of those renewable tax credits, that's the law of the land and those are going to provide strong incentives through the 2020s. And so I think that if you look at what the private sector is doing, you look at what other countries are doing, you talk to people who are investing in energy in the United States, there is a significant move toward cleaner sources of energy. That momentum is going to continue.\nSo we're going to do whatever we can to try to reinforce that and provide the certainty that companies need to make those investments, create those jobs that will come from this. And work like this with our partners internationally is an important part of that effort, because, for example, aligning standards on things like appliances and air conditioners is good for our business. It creates more market opportunities and more certainty for them. And I think that the question of whether you want to undercut American business by pulling back those types of things is one that I don't think we're going to see backsliding on. And frankly, the fact that we have our international partners stepping forward and being more ambitious also reinforces the fact that when America leads on these issues other countries step up and mirror that leadership as well.\nSo I think that today's announcement reinforces that progress and I think that's momentum that's going to continue.\nQ: Specifically on the transmission projects, those are projects that are already, like, in the works, right? They're already in the process. So they're not really new? Am I understanding that correctly?\nMR. DEESE: Those projects are projects that take significant periods of time to go through the permitting process and otherwise. What you're seeing today is a commitment by all three countries to prioritize getting those projects done and to work more closely together going forward to harmonize both our process for permitting and approving specific projects, but also our process to work more closely together on grid integration more generally.\nOne of the things about expanding renewable energy is that it raises more -- as you have more renewable energy on the grid, it raises more questions about reliability issues. And so you see all three countries committing today to work together to get ahead of those issues. And being more harmonized and more aggressive about permitting transmission lines is one of the ways to get ahead of that.\nQ: Can you talk about the role of carbon capture technologies with potential for it as a way to meet the 50 percent goal?\nMR. DEESE: Well, as is articulated in the new partnership, effective carbon capture technologies could be one of the ways in which countries help meet this clean energy goal. In the United States, we're investing significant resources in research around improving technology and improving the commercialization of the technology around carbon capture and sequestration. That's true in Canada as well, and to some degree in Mexico. So I think that that work will continue.\nI think the question of what role CCS technology will play between now and 2025 is one that we don't yet know the answer to because some of it is going to be reflected in what comes out of the research programs and the degree to which it can be proved out commercially. But it's certainly an option that we think is worthy of consideration and worthy of investment in research.\nMR. EARNEST: Anyone else?\nThank you, Brian.\nQ: Thank you.\nMR. EARNEST: Before we go on to other topics I want to make you aware of one other development, which is that, as Brian and I were walking back here this morning, the President was on the phone with President Erdogan of Turkey. The President placed that phone call to express his deep condolences on behalf of the American people to the Turkish people for the lives that were lost in yesterday's terror attack at the Istanbul airport. In the context of that call, the President will -- in addition to expressing his condolences -- offer any support that the Turks can benefit from as they conduct this investigation and take steps to further strengthen the security situation in their country.\nWe'll have a more detailed readout of that call once that conversation has been completed, so you can look for that once we get on the ground.\nQ: Did the Turkish President indicate that he will need and want help from the U.S. in their investigation?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any updates at this point. There are obviously previous conversations between U.S. and Turkish officials that have taken place in which that support has also been offered. But I don't have any updates at this point on whether or how U.S. resources could be used to assist ongoing Turkish efforts.\nQ: What information does =the United States have about responsibility -- of who was responsible for this?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have an official assessment to share from here. Obviously we have a range of capabilities to try to learn for ourselves exactly what has happened, and any information that we obtain that could be useful to the Turkish investigation we certainly will share that information. But I don't have anything -- any information that we've obtained that I can discuss publicly at this point.\nQ: The President will be sort of in the neighborhood of Istanbul next week when he travels to Europe. Is he considering altering his schedule to pay a visit to Istanbul, as he did to Paris after the attacks there last year?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any changes to the President's schedule to share at this point. In the context of that travel to Warsaw, the President obviously will have an opportunity to meet with our NATO allies, including Turkey. And I would anticipate that the President will have an opportunity in some setting -- I don't know whether it will be a formal meeting or informally -- to visit with President Erdogan in person.\nI would expect that yesterday's violence will be something that will be discussed at today's summit, as well. Obviously it's not just the United States and Turkey that are NATO allies. Canada and Turkey are NATO allies, as well. So this is something that will certainly be on the minds of all three North American leaders as they cover a wide-ranging agenda today.\nQ: Does this attack say anything or reflect anything about ISIL's strength and their ability to continue to attack targets and wage war?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, what is true -- and you heard this from Brett McGurk in the White House Briefing Room a couple of weeks ago -- is that we have made important progress in Iraq and in Syria against ISIL. We have steadily made progress in applying additional pressure, particularly in those areas that have previously been essentially ISIL strongholds -- places like Mosul and Raqqa.\nParticularly in Iraq, there's been notable progress recently. Iraqi security forces that were backed by the support of coalition military might have retaken the city of Fallujah. This was a city just some 30, 40 miles west of Baghdad that was controlled by ISIL. So this was obviously a significant gain by Iraqi forces, and we obviously were pleased with that progress. But we continue to be concerned by the ability that ISIL has to carry out these kinds of terror attacks not just in Iraq and in Syria but in other places.\nThat is one of the reasons that we have prioritized our work with Turkey over the last year to shut off the porous border between Turkey and Syria. We've been concerned that ISIL has used that porous border to add foreign fighters to their ranks in Syria. We've been concerned that ISIL has been able to capitalize on a black market by essentially shipping oil across that border. That's something that we've been concerned about. And we have made great progress. And the Turks have made important progress over the last year in shutting off that border. There's still additional work to be done, but that situation has improved significantly just in the last year. And that is a testament to the successful efforts of the Turks and their willingness to cooperate with the United States and our other coalition partners to succeed in that effort.\nPart of the case that we made to the Turks was that it was in their own national security interest to address our concerns about the Turkey-Syria border. And unfortunately, there certainly is the potential that this terrorist attack is an illustration of why that's the case.\nLet me say one other thing about that. One other element of our efforts to close the border that is important is not just the work that the Turks are doing on the Turkish side of the border, but some of the work that is being done by Syrian-Arab forces on the Syrian side of the border. And there is an operation in the Manbij area, in northern and northwestern Syria, where we're seeing Syrian forces, backed by the United States and our coalition partners, also making some progress. As they continue to make some progress, that will also have a material impact on closing the border between Turkey and Syria.\nQ: Josh, I know the White House would rather this trip not be about Donald Trump, but yesterday he called for a withdrawal or renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement and just generally made the case for protectionism and high tariffs. What's the White House response? And can we expect to hear from the President on the benefits of trade?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Byron, I assure you that the President's trip to Canada to meet with North American leaders today does not directly involve the 2016 presidential race in the United States. I certainly understand why all of you may have an interest in understanding what impact the President's trip may have on the race, but the President is focused on the very important responsibilities and the very significant stakes for the United States and our economy in strengthening and deepening our relationship with our two neighbors. The broader continent of North America benefits significantly from the ability of our three nations to coordinate closely on a wide range of issues, particularly issues that have an important impact on our economy.\nIn the context of the President's own campaign in 2007 and 2008, when he was running for President, he talked about the need to improve the trade relationship that the United States maintains with Canada and Mexico. The President followed through on that promise. Both Canada and Mexico have signed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and the TPP does enable the United States to strengthen the basis of those trade relationships -- that TPP does include enforceable provisions related to raising environmental and labor standards.\nAnd this goes back to the fundamental challenge facing anybody that wants to assume the office of the President of the United States. Many people have made the observation that there are a number of U.S. workers and U.S. communities that have been negatively affected by the broader forces of globalization. There's no denying that. The President certainly doesn't deny that. But the challenge, I think, really is what are you going to do about it. Are you just going to bemoan the impact of globalization on the U.S. economy, on some U.S. workers, and on some U.S. communities? Or are you going to actually do something about it? The President has chosen the latter path. The President has chosen to more deeply engage in the international community, sign on to an agreement that would raise labor standards, raise environmental standards, raise standards to protect intellectual property, and make them enforceable. That will level the playing field.\nThe President has also made all of that contingent on these other countries doing a better job -- not just Mexico and Canada, but countries in Southeast Asia that have very dynamic economies, and giving U.S. workers and U.S. companies more access to those markets. So not only are we going to level the playing field for those kinds of trade relationships, we're also going to give U.S. companies and U.S. workers more access to those markets. So not only are we competing on a level playing field, we're actually competing for a bigger prize. That is a coherent strategy to address the legitimate concerns that have been raised about the forces of globalization.\nSo again, I think the President's basic question is, are we just going to bemoan the impact of globalization on the U.S. economy? Or are we actually going to fight to make the advantages of the U.S. economy play in our favor as we confront the forces of globalization? And when you consider the fundamentals of our economy and the vibrancy of our markets, the ambition and motivation of our workers, our ability to educate those workers in the finest education system in the world, the U.S. has so many built-in advantages. And that's why it's important for us to engage in the international community and make those advantages work for us, work for the broader economy, and work for as many American workers as possible. That's exactly what the President is fighting for, and that's exactly what the President promised he would do in 2007 and 2008 when he was running for this job.\nQ: But he's making a specific recommendation to renegotiate NAFTA. That's his suggestion. Is that feasible? And is that something that would help workers in America?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, when you're saying \"he,\" you're referring to presidential nominee, right?\nQ: Right.\nMR. EARNEST: The case that we have made is, we've already succeeded in renegotiating NAFTA. That's exactly what the TPP does, is it includes obviously countries in the Asia Pacific as well, but it includes Canada and Mexico. And it raises standards related to the environment and to labor conditions in all of the countries that have signed the agreement. It also makes those higher standards enforceable in a way that they weren't in NAFTA.\nSo the President promised in 2007 and 2008 -- this got a lot of attention -- that he would work -- he would engage with our partners to make changes to those agreements to make them more fair to U.S. workers and to the broader U.S. economy. That's exactly what we've succeeded in doing.\nSo again, this is the direct question. We can either bemoan the impact of globalization, we can vow to try to extract the U.S. economy from other countries around the world, or we can seek to use the advantages that the United States has worked generations to build up to work in our favor in the future. And the President believes that we can leverage all the benefits in this country of an education system, of a dynamic economy, of a modern infrastructure, of a business climate that is conducive to innovation and economic success. And failing to capitalize on those opportunities is doing a grave disservice to future generations of Americans.\nQ: Josh, does the President believe there is still a chance, even the slightest one, that Brexit will not happen?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think the leaders of the UK have spoken to this, and I think they have signaled quite strongly the finality of the decision that British voters have made. The process that the UK will undertake to leave the EU is something that will be negotiated directly between leaders in the UK and the European Union.\nWhat we have indicated, as it relates to U.S. interests, is that we intend to preserve the special relationship that exists between the United States and the United Kingdom. That applies to our security relationship; it also applies to our economic relationship. The United States also benefits from the kind of strong alliances and important economic ties that we have with members of the European Union. And the President is committed to ensuring that we not just maintain those strong ties, but actually look for ways to deepen them. And that's part of what negotiating the T-TIP agreement, a trade agreement with the EU, is all about. It's also what the President and other NATO leaders will discuss at the NATO Summit in Warsaw next week. There will be an opportunity for us to discuss how we can further intensify the engagement of all of our allies in our NATO Alliance. And that is critical to the national security not just of the United States, but all of our NATO partners, including Turkey. And the President looks forward to that discussion next week as well.\nQ: How much will Brexit be on the agenda today in discussions?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm confident that it will be discussed because of the impact that it has had on global financial markets. The kind of volatility that we've seen in global financial markets has an impact on the economy not just in the United States, but also Canada and Mexico. So to that extent, I do anticipate that the leader will discuss it, but I do not expect that it will be the focal point of their discussions today.\nQ: What's the latest with rescheduling with Secretary Clinton on the campaign trail?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I expect that we'll have some news on that relatively soon, so stay tuned.\nQ: Has the President made any more calls to European leaders, like President Hollande, for instance, or anyone like that since Brexit, other than the two calls that you read out already?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any calls to read out -- any additional calls to read out beyond the conversations that the President had with Prime Minister Cameron and Chancellor Merkel last week.\nWe'll see you guys on the ground.\nEND 9:53 A.M.

They announced initiatives to enhance North America's economic competiveness; expand our efforts on climate change, clean energy, and the environment; solidify our regional and global cooperation; and strengthen our security and defense.\nEconomic Competiveness\nThe economies of the United States, Canada, and Mexico are deeply integrated. Canada and Mexico are our second and third largest trading partners. Our trade with them exceeds $1.2 trillion dollars annually. This trade will grow even more with the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which will promote high-standards trade and open doors for U.S. companies in North America and dynamic economies in Latin America and Asia. Under the North American Competitiveness Work Plan, the United States, Canada, and Mexico aim to reduce costs for business and facilitate partnerships by improving supply chain efficiency, advancing innovation and economic development, and engaging the private sector.\nAddressing Global Excess Capacity\nRecognizing the negative impact that excess production of steel and aluminum has on companies, workers and trade in North America, we reached consensus on a broad range of trade policy instruments and actions to enforce our rights, consistent with World Trade Organization rules and disciplines. We reaffirmed our three governments' cooperation through the North American Steel Trade Committee (NASTC) to strengthen mechanisms at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and other fora to quickly address government policies that lead to distortions in the steel sector and contribute to excess capacity, including curtailing government subsidies and other supports that artificially maintain or increase steelmaking capacity, enhancing transparency and information sharing about capacity and production developments, and seeking robust policy commitments to address excess capacity and encourage adjustment.\nCanada, Mexico, and the United States further recognize the need for our Customs agencies to work together to ensure robust trade enforcement at our borders, including increased information sharing on high-risk shipments. We will initiate a trilateral customs dialogue at the North American Steel Trade Committee to discuss these efforts and additional collaboration in order to strengthen the North American position in the global economy.\nEducation, Inclusive Growth\nOur economic competiveness depends on our shared commitment to education, inclusive economic growth, and engagement with the private sector and civil society. The leaders announced the creation of the North American Center for Collaborative Development to pursue joint research and foster exchanges between academics and others on climate change, energy, manufacturing, economic integration, and indigenous peoples.\nLeaders underscored the need to develop the next generation of indigenous leaders. The United States, through the State Department's International Visitor Leadership Program and the Fulbright Specialist Program, will bring together indigenous youth and promote linkages between North American higher education institutions on projects that provide indigenous youth with opportunities to travel, engage with each other, and hone their professional skills. Mexico joins the United States and Canada in the Let Girls Learn initiative to increase educational opportunities for adolescent girls by increasing enrollment in their Escuelas Mexico Program, which provides opportunities for girls to attend school throughout the hemisphere.\nThe United States, Canada, and Mexico signed a memorandum of understanding to advance joint efforts to promote women-owned small and medium enterprises by fostering partnerships. The Leaders resolved to develop partnerships among small business service centers to connect women-owned businesses; advance the Women's Entrepreneurship in the Americas initiative, which increases women's economic participation and reduces barriers faces when starting and growing a business in North America; and provide business growth opportunities by connecting women entrepreneurs during the upcoming Americas Competiveness Exchange on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, which Canada will host in September.\nThe United States will host the first annual Stakeholder Dialogue on North American Competiveness this fall in Washington. The dialogue will provide private sector, local government, labor, and civil society representatives an opportunity to contribute ideas on increasing North American competitiveness.\nNorth American Cluster Map\nThe leaders announced their commitment to establish a North American Cluster Map. Mexico will publicly release its national map in July, and Canada has committed to develop a national map. The maps, which will show clusters of interconnected companies, suppliers, and institutions and be available for free on line, will allow individuals, businesses and local governments to identify investment and trade opportunities and plan economic development strategies to most strategically identify areas for investment and understand the strengths of their region.\nTrusted Traveler\nImproving our economic competiveness requires reducing the time and cost for individuals to cross our borders. Nearly 5 million people already participate in our individual countries' trusted traveler programs, facilitating entry into each country for low-risk, pre-screened travelers by allowing them to bypass lines and use automated kiosks to pass through customs and immigration checks more quickly. To considerably increase participation in the program, the United States, Canada, and Mexico will inaugurate a trilateral trusted traveler program by the end of 2016 and launch a single portal application for all three countries' programs by the end of 2017.\nInnovation and Technology in Border Processing\nWe are committed to ensuring we have in North America the most innovative and efficient borders in the world through the use of advanced technology, innovative processing, and automated systems. We will continue to leverage advanced tools to make processing at the border faster and more efficient, including in the areas of intelligent transportation systems, electronic kiosks for traveler purposes, and mobile phone applications. We will continue to develop innovative approaches to border management, such as remote traveler processing pilots using kiosks that incorporate live video feeds, a single web portal to apply for trusted traveler membership, and more aligned cargo information requirements to simplify reporting for traders. We will also bolster our use of data analytics to support economic impact and flow projections and to inform resource allocation requirements for cross border infrastructure.\nRegulatory Cooperation\nThe United States, Canada, and Mexico commit to pursue greater alignment of our respective energy sectors to promote greater trade and economic competiveness. Building upon existing bilateral cooperation, regulators from all three countries will meet this fall to determine how to reduce or eliminate existing differences in regulatory requirements and prevent future discrepancies.\nClimate Change, Clean Energy, and Environment\nThe United States, Canada, and Mexico share a strong track record of actions to tackle climate change, from supporting the Paris Agreement to ambitious domestic actions that support a clean and resilient economy at home. The three leaders declared their common vision in a historic North American Climate, Clean Energy, and Environment Partnership, described in a Leaders' Statement and Action Plan that details the actions our leaders will pursue. These actions include:\n• Setting a target to increase clean power to 50% of the electricity generated across North America by 2025.\n• Reducing methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40-45% by 2025.\n• Strengthening standards for energy efficiency and vehicle emissions, including aligning energy efficiency standards that will amount to over $4 billion per year in annual savings for US businesses and consumers by 2025.\n• Strengthening vehicle efficiency, improving fuel quality, and reducing tailpipe pollutants.\n• Affirming their support for joining and implementing the Paris Agreement this year and committing to work together to address climate issues through the Montreal Protocol, International Civil Aviation Organization, G-20, and other forums.\n• Celebrating our strong environmental cooperation, including expanding cooperation on early warning systems for natural disasters, supporting habitat for migratory species including Monarchs and birds, and developing action plans to combat wildlife trafficking.\nThese policies not only make sense for the environment, they support jobs in a clean growth economy. Renewable energy generation, power transmission, and energy efficiency projects and policies to achieve our clean power goal will support more than one million jobs on average by 2025 in the United States. Consistent with this goal, the U.S. General Services Administration, which manages 9,600 federally owned and leased buildings, is committing to 100% clean power procurement for the facilities it manages by 2025.\nRegional and Global Cooperation\nOur countries share a common set of values and vision for global cooperation. The Leaders agreed to establish a \"North American Caucus\" to more effectively work in concert on regional and global issues by holding semi-annual coordination meetings among our foreign ministries.\nRefugees\nCanada and Mexico, along with Ethiopia, Germany, Jordan, and Sweden, will co-host the President's Summit on Refugees in September. The goal of this Summit is to increase overall humanitarian funding by 30 percent, double the number of resettled refugees or refugees provided other legal forms of admission, enroll 1 million more refugee children in school, and allow an additional 1 million refugees access to employment. Consistent with ongoing efforts to advance the objectives of the Summit, Leaders announced a $10 million North American commitment to the UNHCR appeal for Central American refugees and asylum seekers. Leaders reaffirmed their commitment to encourage other UN Member States to make new and significant commitments to refugee protection and assistance.\nHemispheric Cooperation\nLeaders reaffirmed North America's commitment to address the economic, governance, and security challenges that contribute to irregular migration from Central America. The United States has committed in Fiscal Year 2016 $750 million to help Central America reverse endemic violence and poverty, crack down on criminal networks, corruption, and impunity, strengthen good governance and the rule of law, and promote economic prosperity. The Leaders reaffirmed North America's commitment to support efforts in the fight against corruption and impunity in Central America. Next year, the United States anticipates providing $5.2 million to the OAS' Mission to Support the Fight against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras and $7.5 million for the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala. The United States is contributing $4.5 million to support climate-smart agriculture in Central America and seeks to provide additional support. Canada will contribute C$13 million and Mexico is also seeking to provide funding to support climate smart agriculture projects, particularly in the Central American Dry Corridor, in 2017. In May, the United States hosted the U.S.-Caribbean-Central American Energy Summit - in which Canada and Mexico participated - to advance energy security, enhance regional energy cooperation, support clean energy integration, and promote donor coordination.\nThe United States, Canada, and Mexico support an inclusive and timely national dialogue between the Venezuelan government and opposition; encourage respect for the separation of powers, rule of law, democratic institutions and a fair and timely implementation of constitutional mechanisms; and call on the responsible authorities to guarantee due process, including the right of peaceful assembly and free expressions of ideas.\nLeaders reaffirmed North America's strong support for President Santos's efforts to finalize a peace accord with the FARC guerrillas. The United States, Canada and Mexico strongly support the United Nations Special Political Mission in Colombia to monitor and verify a definitive bilateral ceasefire, the cessation of hostilities, and the disarmament of the FARC. Leaders renewed North America's commitment to the Global Demining Initiative for Colombia to provide resources and technical assistance to help the country rid itself of landmines within five years. The United States is providing $33 million to this initiative.\nThe United States remains committed to helping Haiti build strong and accountable democratic institutions, attract foreign investment, and create economic opportunities for its citizens. The United States, Canada, and Mexico are disappointed with the Haitian Provisional Electoral Council's decision to re-run presidential elections. Recognizing the economic and humanitarian challenges that the Haitian people face, the Leaders call for a peaceful, transparent, and credible election to seat a democratically-elected president as soon as possible.\nDemocracy and Human Rights\nRecognizing the 15th anniversary of the Inter-American Democratic Charter, the leaders reaffirmed North America's commitment to strengthen, promote, and defend democracy and human rights throughout the hemisphere and committed to raise awareness of the valuable contributions that civil society makes to democracy and development. North America provides about three-quarters of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights' budget to protect and defend human rights throughout the hemisphere, including in our own countries. We pledge our continued political and financial support for the Commission, and call on OAS member and observer states to increase their support for it.\nThe United States, Canada, and Mexico call on all members of the international community to ensure full respect for the human rights of all persons, including lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex persons. Leaders reaffirmed their solidarity with LGBTI communities, and confirm their unequivocal support for the establishment of an independent expert at the United Nations Human Rights Council on preventing violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\nNorth America is committed to joint and coordinated actions to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. Together, we are forging innovative partnerships to mobilize human, technological, and financial resources to facilitate the availability and use of data to achieve and monitor progress towards the SDGs and promote evidence-based decision making and drive innovation to address sustainable development challenges. As part of this, we are collaborating to harness the data revolution to enhance climate resilience by providing local communities access to the best available information for climate risk management.\nOpen Government Partnership (OGP)\nLeaders committed to continue our work, as members of the OGP to promote the principles of openness, transparency, and accountability worldwide. Leaders call on all governments in the Americas to participate in the OGP to ensure accountability, especially in the justice sector.\nHealth Cooperation\nLeaders recommitted to continued implementation of the North American Plan for Animal and Pandemic Influenza (NAPAPI), announced at the 2012 NALS, and will build upon this collaboration by working together to address the emerging public health threat posed by vector-borne diseases, such as Zika, dengue, and chikungunya. Our collaboration will strengthen domestic and regional preparedness and response to Zika by advancing information sharing, risk communications, research and development, and vector-control.\nThe United States, Canada and Mexico are partnering to advance the Global Health Security Agenda and will support implementation of the International Health Regulations (IHR) in the Americas by providing expert and technical assistance to strengthen and maintain IHR core capacities and advance countries' ability to support, undergo, share, and achieve the targets of the Joint External Evaluation. Canada and the United States have also committed to support the Alliance for Country Assessments for Global Health Security and Implementation of the International Health Regulations. The United States recently completed an evaluation, and we intend to make the results public on GHSAgenda.org. Canada plans to undertake a JEE in 2018.\nThe United States, Canada, and Mexico share the goal of ending AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria epidemics by 2030, as reflected in the Sustainable Development Goals. Recognizing the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria's role in achieving this goal, the United States and Mexico commend Canada for hosting the 5th Replenishment Conference in Montreal in September. The United States looks forward to actively participating in the Conference.\nCyber Cooperation\nLeaders affirmed the importance of an open, interoperable, reliable, and secure Internet, underpinned by the multi-stakeholder model of Internet governance, to our collective prosperity and security and agreed to continue our foreign ministry-led Trilateral Cyber Experts Group to strengthen ongoing cooperation.\nLeaders committed to promote stability in cyberspace by affirming the applicability of international law to state conduct in cyberspace, promoting voluntary norms of responsible state behavior during peacetime, and supporting confidence building measures between states. Leaders affirm that no country should conduct or knowingly support online activity that intentionally damages critical infrastructure or otherwise impairs the use of critical infrastructure to provide services to the public; that no country should conduct or knowingly support activity intended to prevent national computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs) from responding to cyber incidents, or use CSIRTs to enable online activity that is intended to do harm; that every country should cooperate, consistent with its domestic law and international obligations, with requests for assistance from other states in mitigating malicious cyber activity emanating from its territory; and that no country should conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential business information, with the intent of providing competitive advantages to its companies or commercial sectors. The United States, Canada, and Mexico will work together in the 2016/2017 UN Group of Governmental Experts, the Group of 20, and the Organization of American States in support of these objectives.\nThe United States will host an Industry Summit on North American cyber security priorities in Washington in late September to facilitate public-private dialogue, and welcomes Mexico's commitment to host the 2016 Internet Governance Forum and the Meridian Process Conference. Together we are working to enhance the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure.\nThe United States, Canada, and Mexico will promote regional training for the Group of Seven 24/7 Network, which provides investigators dedicated points of contact for investigations involving electronic evidence. Leaders highlighted a North American commitment to promote greater public cybersecurity awareness through the \"Stop.Think.Connect.\" campaign, which increases awareness of cyber threats and empowers safe, secure online practices.\nSecurity and Defense\nThe United States shares many mutual security and defense interests with Canada and Mexico. Threats to the continent and the hemisphere are increasingly complex and require coordinated responses. The United States, Canada, and Mexico remain committed to enhancing our common understanding of those threats and developing effective, coordinated and efficient approaches to address them.\nNorth America Dialogue on Drug Policy\nAll three countries are grappling with a drug epidemic fueled by illicit opioids, including heroin and fentanyl, and citizens in each are dying as a result. The United States will hold the first annual \"North American Dialogue on Drug Policy\" in October to exchange information on drug trends, including illicit opioid use, in the hemisphere. The dialogue will be an opportunity to discuss each country's approach to addressing the heroin and fentanyl crisis plaguing our communities, including our respective approaches to public health interventions.\nPeacekeeping\nThe United States applauds Canada's and Mexico's renewed commitments to support international peacekeeping operations. Together, we support the UN Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). Recognizing our shared commitments to fostering global security, we intend to bolster and improve UN Peacekeeping by using the North American Caucus to advance trilateral peacekeeping collaboration. Later this year at the North American Defense Ministers Meeting, we will hold the first North American Peacekeeping Working Group to share information regarding each country's peacekeeping capabilities to identify complementarities and synergies and collaborate on training and capacity building initiatives.\nThe United States and Canada applaud Mexico for establishing a peacekeeping training center and commit to support curriculum development and provide English language training as well as guest instructors in support of the center.\nCombatting Violence against Indigenous Women and Girls\nAcross Canada, the United States, and Mexico, indigenous women and girls endure dangerously high levels of violence. In response, representatives from our three countries will meet in October in Washington to strengthen the capacity of justice, social service and health systems, increase access to justice and health services, reduce human trafficking of indigenous women and girls across our borders, and develop culturally-sensitive victim services.\nTrafficking in Persons\nLeaders committed to develop a North American approach to combat human trafficking, a form of modern-day slavery. By the end of the year, our three countries will implement public awareness campaigns with the private sector to educate the public to recognize human trafficking and report suspected instances. In addition, the United States commits to review our procurement laws to determine potential vulnerabilities to abuse by human traffickers.\nForeign Fugitives\nLeaders committed to launch a 90-day pilot program by the end of 2016 to identify and locate foreign fugitives within our countries. The United States, Canada, and Mexico will develop a joint fugitives list that reflects our goal of ensuring the most egregious fugitives in North America face justice.\nContinued Engagement\nLeaders announced the creation of a regular trilateral coordination process to ensure implementation of NALS commitments. The first meeting will be held in the fall.", "timestamp": "2016-06-29", "title": "Fact Sheet: United States Key Deliverables for the 2016 North American Leaders' Summit"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118138", "text": "June 2016 Update\nThroughout the Obama Administration, the promotion and protection of the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) persons has been a specific focus of our engagement around the world. U.S. diplomacy, foreign assistance and other activities abroad have all sought to advance this goal, ensuring that efforts to promote and protect LGBT human rights are fully integrated into our broader attempts to advance freedom and dignity for all people.\nMaking the Advancement of LGBT Rights a Foreign Policy Priority\n• On December 6, 2011, President Obama released the Presidential Memorandum on International Initiatives to Advance the Human Rights of LGBT Persons, which directs departments and agencies to combat criminalization of LGBT status or conduct abroad; protect vulnerable LGBT refugees or asylum seekers; enhance assistance to protect human rights and advance nondiscrimination for LGBT persons; advance LGBT issues in multilateral fora; and help ensure swift and meaningful responses to human rights abuses of LGBT persons abroad. The White House has since coordinated regular meetings among U.S. departments and agencies to ensure that the Presidential Memorandum is being fully implemented.\n• Also in 2011, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton gave a landmark speech in Geneva, stating that \"The Obama Administration defends the rights of LGBT people as part of our comprehensive human rights policy and as a foreign policy priority,\" and underscoring that LGBT rights are human rights, and human rights are LGBT rights.\n• During the course of this Administration, we have launched two global funding partnerships - the Global Equality Fund and the LGBT Global Development Partnership - which have provided millions of dollars in assistance, including emergency assistance, to LGBT civil society activists and organizations.\n• Our diplomats have opened U.S. embassies and consulates to LGBT communities around the world, marched in Pride parades, and raised the human rights of LGBT persons in countless bilateral and multilateral meetings. In forums ranging from the  UN General Assembly to The Human Rights Campaign to the Tonight Show, President Obama and senior administration officials have spoken publicly, engaged privately, and made clear our conviction that all persons deserve to live lives free from violence and discrimination.\nChanges to Department and Agency Staffing, Policies, and Practices\n• The State Department revised its Foreign Affairs Manual to allow same-sex couples to obtain passports under the names recognized by their state through their marriages or civil unions and in 2010, the State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs announced new procedures for changing the sex listed on a transgender American's passport, streamlining the process and simplifying requirements to ensure greater dignity and privacy for the applicant.\n• We have steadily expanded coverage of the conditions for LGBT persons in every country in the world in the State Department's annual Human Rights Reports. The State Department continues to provide information on discriminatory laws and societal practices for U.S. citizen travelers through the Bureau of Consular Affairs' Country Specific Information (CSI).\n• A number of Departments and Agencies, including State, USAID, Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, and the Peace Corps are providing new training for staff and implementing partners to better understand the issues of gender identity and sexual orientation and agency roles in advancing the human rights of LGBT persons.\n• In June 2014, USAID launched its LGBT Vision for Action, a landmark document that demonstrates USAID's commitment to LGBT inclusion both internally and externally. In February 2015, Secretary of State John Kerry announced the appointment of Randy Berry as the first-ever Special Envoy for the Human Rights of LGBT Persons. Since his appointment. Special Envoy Berry has traveled to more than 40 countries in every region of the world, engaging with government, civil society organizations, faith leaders and the private sector to build a stronger global coalition in support of the human rights of LGBT persons.\n• In February 2014, USAID appointed Senior LGBT Coordinator Todd Larson to ensure that the promotion and protection of LGBT rights is fully integrated into all aspects of USAID's vital work overseas.\n• Seven openly gay U.S. Ambassadors are serving at Embassies around the world. And, this year, the Peace Corps also created a position devoted to training staff to support LGBT Peace Corps Volunteers.\nWork in the Multilateral Arena\n• In 2010, the United States joined the UN LGBT Core Group, a cross-regional group of countries working together to promote and protect LGBT rights at the UN in New York, for the first time. That year, on Human Rights Day, Ambassador Susan Rice spoke alongside the UN Secretary General at a panel discussion on the Human Rights of LGBT individuals - marking the first time the United States had co-sponsored such an event.\n• In December 2010, the United States led efforts at the UN General Assembly to reinsert language on sexual orientation into a resolution on extrajudicial, summary, and arbitrary executions, after the language's removal in committee. The amendment was approved by a 93-55 margin. In 2012, that resolution included language on gender identity for the first time. The United States again defended that language in 2014.\n• At the UN Human Right's Council's June 2011 session, South Africa, the United States, and Latin American and EU countries led efforts to pass the first UN resolution on the human rights of LGBT persons. The resolution also called on the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to produce the first global report, published in November 2011, on discrimination and violence toward persons based on their gender identity or sexual orientation. In September 2014, the United States co-sponsored and lobbied on behalf of the second UN Human Rights Council resolution on the human rights of LGBT persons, led by four Latin American countries.\n• With the support of the United States, the World Health Organization has begun discussions on the negative repercussions of stigma, discrimination, and other barriers to care for LGBT persons in the health system as a whole. In 2013, the Pan-American Health Organization passed a ground-breaking resolution on LGBT health, which emphasized that equal access to care is a health issue and called on countries to collect data on access to health care and health facilities for their LGBT population.\n• At the 2013, 2014, and 2015 high-level meetings of the UN General Assembly (UNGA), the United States co-sponsored ministerial level events on the human rights of LGBT people, with Secretary Kerry speaking in 2013 and 2014. In 2014, USAID co-hosted an UNGA event on LGBT Inclusion, Extreme Poverty, and Religion. In collaboration with the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission and the Arcus Foundation, the event featured a conversation with religious leaders on the importance of religion as a positive force to advance the human rights and livelihoods LGBT persons around the world.\n• In March 2015, the United States worked with partners to defeat a proposal in the Fifth Committee of the UNGA that would have rescinded a UN Secretary General administrative bulletin allowing the same-sex spouses of all UN staff, regardless of their nationality, to receive spousal benefits.\n• The Doha Declaration, a consensus document adopted by Member States in April 2015 during the Thirteenth United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, includes groundbreaking language that the United States introduced on the need to provide \"specialized training to criminal justice professionals to enhance capacities for recognizing, understanding, suppressing and investigating hate crimes motivated by discrimination of any kind, to help engage effectively with victim communities and to build public confidence and cooperation with criminal justice agencies.\"\n• The Treasury Department encourages the multilateral development banks (MDBs) to strengthen attention to LGBT issues in their human resources policies, and to protect the human rights of LGBT persons and advance social inclusion and non-discrimination through MDBs' projects, including, for example, studies to measure the economic cost of discrimination against LGBT persons, and steps to ensure that LGBT persons can access projects' benefits without being exposed to harm.\n• In August 2015, the United States co-sponsored with Chile the first-ever UN Security Council meeting on LGBT issues in the context of ISIL crimes against LGBT persons in Iraq and Syria.

U.S. Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power wrote to the President of the UN General Assembly warning that the exclusion of certain groups would only impede global progress in combatting the HIV/AIDS pandemic.\n• After the terrorist attack in Orlando on an LGBT nightclub, the U.S. worked with other UN Security Council members to issue a strong condemnation that marked the first time the Security Council used the term \"sexual orientation\" in any of its products or otherwise acknowledged specific acts of violence targeting LGBT persons.\nSupporting LGBT Activists and Individuals around the world\n• Since its inception in 2011, the State Department's Global Equality Fund (GEF), a partnership of 13 governments as well as a number of corporations and private foundations, has allocated more than $30 million to frontline advocates in 80 countries. In 2015, the Global Equality Fund provided nearly $11 million - including $4.2 million in U.S. foreign assistance, and an additional $6.6 million provided by government, corporate, and private foundation funding partners - to support civil society organizations and activists around the globe working to advance and protect the human rights of LGBT persons.\n• USAID supports a wide array of field-based and Washington-based programs and funding mechanisms that are either LGBT-specific or LGBT-inclusive. For example, USAID's LGBTI Global Development Partnership - key activities to date include awarding over 100 grants to LGBTI civil society organizations and training over 1,700 LGBTI entrepreneurs and businesses.\n• PEPFAR and USAID have launched a $7 million public-private partnership with the Elton John Foundation. The project, called health4men, focuses on strengthening community capacity and expanding access to non-discriminatory HIV services for men who have sex with men and transgender persons in South Africa.\n• In June 2014, USAID awarded Linkages Across the Continuum of HIV Services for Key Populations Affected by HIV (LINKAGES), a $225 million project over five years. It is PEPFAR and USAID's first global project dedicated to serve key populations with HIV prevention, care, and treatment services. Key populations include men who have sex with men, sex workers, and transgender persons. LINKAGES is implemented by FHI 360 in close collaboration with Pact, University of North Carolina, and IntraHealth International.\n• The State Department and the Department of Justice provide training on LGBT issues to law enforcement officials and NGOs. For example, in 2014, the State Department sponsored counter hate crimes training for law enforcement officials from Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, and Mexico. In addition, State supports a Violent Crimes Task Force in Honduras that investigates and supports the prosecution of LGBT-related homicide cases.\n• The State Department is committed to ensuring that the global refugee protection system is responsive to the needs of LGBT refugees. The Bureau for Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM) works with partners to identify protection issues for the most vulnerable/at-risk, including LGBT refugees and asylum seekers and develops targeted interventions to address immediate gaps. PRM consistently engages governments and international organizations, including UNHCR, to promote protection of and assistance to this population.\n• In late February 2015, USAID's Being LGBT in Asia convened a landmark regional dialogue in Bangkok that was attended by 200+ delegates from 30+ Asia-Pacific countries and supported by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the Embassy of Sweden in Bangkok. USAID is studying the successes of this program and is establishing correlative programs in other regions.\nComing Together, Taking Action, and Speaking Out\n• U.S. diplomats and development professionals work with host countries around the world to address discriminatory laws, support affirmative steps, and to encourage more inclusive policies. We continue to work in partnership with like-minded governments, civil society organizations, religious leaders, and the private sector.\n• The U.S. Government has pushed back publicly and privately against discriminatory legislation, including in Uganda and The Gambia. And senior U.S. officials continue to speak in support of LGBT persons around the world, as President Obama has done in trips to Russia, Senegal and, most recently, Jamaica.\n• In June 2014 the White House hosted the first-ever Global LGBT Human Rights Forum, which brought together the faith community, private sector, philanthropy, HIV and other health advocates, LGBT activists from around the world, and the broader human rights community to discuss how to work together with the U.S. government and others to promote respect for the human rights of LGBT individuals around the world. National Security Advisory Susan Rice delivered keynote remarks.\n• In November 2014, the State Department and USAID hosted the third Annual Conference to Advance the Human Rights of and Promote Inclusive Development for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex Persons (LGBTI). The conference was the largest such gathering to date, bringing together senior leaders from government, civil society and the private sector to discuss and strategize on how to most effectively protect the human rights of LGBT persons and promote their inclusion in development programs.\n• In June 2015, the White House convened a dialogue to address bias-motivated violence against LGBT persons around the world. Representatives from civil society organizations, partner governments, and multilateral organizations, as well as law enforcement officers and U.S. government agencies participated in a series of panel discussions on community efforts to prevent and respond to bias-motivated violence; the role of law enforcement and the judiciary in addressing bias-motivated violence; and government action as a tool to help protect LGBT persons from violence. Following this dialogue, the Department of State is focusing its anti-violence efforts in specific countries of opportunity with the goal of reducing violence and using resources and expertise from across the U.S. government.\n• In June 2016, in partnership with the American Bar Association, the State Department launched \"Justice Works,\" a global mechanism that aims to provide technical support to local government and civil society organizations responding to, and eliminating impunity for, violence impacting LGBT persons. In addition to providing technical and financial support, Justice Works will establish and build a global network of hate crimes experts available to share expertise and best practices, with the ultimate objective of reducing and preventing anti-LGBT bias-motivated violence.\n• U.S. Embassies, Consulates, USAID Missions, and Department of Defense installations around the world host and participate in Pride events. In 2014, for the first time, the Department of Defense's Tri-Service Color Guard participated in the Washington, D.C.

President Peña Nieto spoke in Spanish, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117878", "text": "President Obama. Well, I just want to thank President Peña Nieto and the members of his delegation for an excellent discussion preceding our trilateral meeting.\nTerrorist Attack in Istanbul, Turkey\nBefore I discuss the importance of the U.S.-Mexican relationship, let me just publicly extend my deepest condolences to the people of Turkey for the terrible attack that took place in Istanbul. I had a chance to speak to President Erdogan earlier today to discuss with him not only how heartbroken we have been by the images of the injured and those killed, but also to reaffirm our strong commitment to partner with Turkey, with NATO, with the broad-based alliance that we have structured around the world to fight ISIL.\nIt's an indication of how little these vicious organizations have to offer; that beyond killing innocents, they are continually losing ground, unable to govern those areas that they have taken over; that they're going to be defeated in Syria, they're going to be defeated in Iraq, they are going to be on the run wherever they hide. And we will not rest until we have dismantled these networks of hate that have an impact on the entire civilized world.\nAnd I know that that view is shared by Mexico. It's shared by Canada. It's shared by all the people of this hemisphere. And it's shared in every region of the world. So we stand with the people of Turkey, and we intend to do what's necessary to make sure that these kinds of terrible events are not happening.\nMexico-U.S. Relations\nNow, on a happier note, the cooperation that's been taking place between the United States and Mexico across a whole range of issues has been outstanding. We had the opportunity to discuss the continuing strength of our business, commercial, trade, and people-to-people ties.\nThe United States is not just a friend and neighbor of Mexico's, but the very character of the United States is shaped by Mexican Americans who have shaped our culture, our politics, our business. And at a time in which we all too often are hearing rhetoric that ignores the enormous contributions that have been made by Mexican Americans and the enormous strengths that we draw from the relationship with our good neighbor to the south, it was—it's been useful for us to reaffirm all the different issues that we've been working on together.\nWe are strongly committed to making sure that we have high labor and environmental standards embedded in our trade between our two countries. And that's reflected in our commitment to the Trans-Pacific Partnership. We discussed the excellent cooperation that we've received from the Mexican Government on border issues that can facilitate the kinds of trade and commerce and tourism and travel that takes place between our two countries, but also ensures that we're able to enforce our immigration laws in a way that is orderly and sound.\nWe talked about the joint work that we're doing together around energy and the remarkable leadership that Mexico has shown with respect to climate change. And not only has Mexico been a leader in helping to shape the Paris Agreement that was forged last year, but they are now also a leader in helping to make sure that it is implemented.\nAnd I also want to thank Mexico for their leadership when it comes to refugee issues. And they will be one of the cohosts of a refugee summit that we are planning for September on the margins of the U.N. General Assembly.\nWe also discussed our joint cooperation when it comes to battling drug trafficking. And although this is something that both our governments have been fighting for a long time, there's even greater urgency in light of the increase in heroin trade. That is something that we're addressing in the United States, in the comprehensive program to combat opioids and heroin that I announced and the $1 billion that we are slating to improve treatment and prevention, as well as law enforcement and interdiction. And we are appreciative that Mexico is taking this issue seriously and going to be working alongside us developing their own strategy, but also one that is in coordination with ours.\nAnd in the meantime, we are developing a whole host of other measures that focus on the positive elements of the relationship between our peoples, whether it's educational, scientific, cultural.\nSo, as always, President Peña Nieto has been an outstanding partner. I've invited him to visit Washington one last time before I leave office. He's accepted. And so we look forward to seeing him and his delegation there. And I want to once again thank them for not only being good neighbors, but also being good friends.\nThank you so much.\nPresident Peña Nieto. First and foremost, I would like to say that Mexico stands in solidarity with Turkey and regrets the events that took place in Turkey, events that took the lives of dozens of people. And we would like to express our solidarity with the families. We would like to condemn violence. There is no cause—there is no fight—that could call itself valid if it uses violence as a means. We condemn this terror attacks that took place in Turkey.\nIn terms of the bilateral meeting that we just had, first and foremost, I expressed to President Obama how grateful we are, and we want to acknowledge the political will shown by his administration to work jointly with the Government of Mexico to address topics that are common to our countries, not only in the commercial and trade arena, but also in the area of security, in the area of cooperation. And I want to underscore the importance of regional integration.\nWe must acknowledge that isolationism cannot bring prosperity to a society. It is from a collective effort between the countries that are located in one same region. The relationship between the United States and Mexico is historic due to our geographical vicinity. Without a doubt, the Government of President Obama and the Government of Mexico, we have stressed and emphasized the importance and relevance that working as a team has and to stand together vis-à-vis different areas that could provide a solution on the issues that we face in the region.\nI expressed my recognition that we do not only have diplomatic exchanges—that is, not—we do not only have high-level agreements, we have here different officials and their counterparts from both of our countries, from the U.S. and Mexico. We have agreed to go through security cooperation issues. The security of both of our nations needs to be based on cooperation activities between the two governments by sharing information, by having day-to-day exchanges to ensure security on the U.S. side and the Mexican side. Therefore, we have made a commitment to keep on working on the basis of dialogue. President Obama has said it already: We have to work together, and we have to reinforce the efforts done so far to fight organized crime and specifically drug trafficking: specifically, those who produce and traffic heroin. We have identified that production is on the rise, and this narcotic is taken to the United States in great numbers. We have decided to work on this issue.\nWe have decided to support each other in order to, in the case of Mexico, have the approval at Congress of the TPP agreements. The world is teaching us lessons. Being a strategic partners as countries strengthens development for our nations. And one of the biggest challenges that we're facing—and of course, it was part of our conversation—is that we need to be very clear in terms of describing the benefits of being an integrated region. Jobs are created. Companies are incorporated. Trade is free. And more development can reach people due to regional integration.\nIsolationism is not a route towards progress. Integration is. The world is teaching us different lessons when you decide for being in isolation and what happens to those countries that decide not to be in an integrated region.\nWe have decided to work on the development of clean energies. Both of our countries are committed to work towards the advancement of the environment; to bolster the legal framework, in the case of Mexico, that we have managed to enact to reduce greenhouse effect gases and make—expedite progress in the generation of clean energy.\nWithout a doubt, the agenda between our countries is extensive. I would like to thank President Obama for his invitation to visit very soon the United States. And we are going to keep on working on specific areas of our relationship. And this is going to reaffirm that we are neighbors, we are friends. But this friendship is based on strong cooperation and teamwork for the benefit of development and security of our nations. This is what we have discussed. These are the commitments that we have made. And we are determined to keep on working on this pathway.\nThank you very much, President Obama, for your friendship and for working as a team.\nPresident Obama. Thank you, everybody.", "timestamp": "2016-06-29", "title": "Remarks Following a Meeting With President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico in Ottawa, Canada"}

Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. President Obama, President Peña Nieto and I have just wrapped up a very productive meeting. The tone of the meeting was friendly, as you might expect among friends, but also a little poignant. We're obviously thrilled to have President Peña Nieto here for his first visit to Canada as President of Mexico. Yet, at the same time, it's a little sad that this will be the last chance for all three of us to get together in this capacity, given President Obama's impending retirement—[laughter]—something he pointed out to us more than once, I should add, usually with a little smile.\nBut I do want to once again thank both leaders and their delegations for coming to Ottawa and for being truly open to the discussions that took place today. One of the first items we discussed was our common respect for diversity and our firm support for LGBTQ2 rights, especially in the wake of the shootings earlier this month in Orlando.\n[At this point, Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nThe United States and Mexico both lost citizens in Orlando. That tragedy has strengthened our determination to protect the rights of LGBTQ2 people, and on behalf of—and we urge all leaders throughout the world to do the same.\nWe also talked about the need to ensure a clean and prosperous future for all of our people and for all of people in the world.\n[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in English as follows.]\nPresident Peña Nieto, President Obama, and I are unanimous in our belief that on this issue, North America can—and indeed must—lead the way.\nToday we resolved—we turned that resolve into action with a negotiation of an ambitious and enduring North American Climate, Clean Energy, and Environment Partnership. This partnership will see our countries stand side by side as we work toward the common goal of a North America that is competitive, that encourages clean growth, and that protects our shared environment now and for generations to come. It's a partnership that lays out some very clear deliverables and that identifies realistic paths to achieving them.\nTogether, we will advance clean and secure energy with the goal of 50-percent clean power generation across the continent by 2025. We will drive down short-lived climate pollutants, things like methane, black carbon, and hydrofluorocarbons. We will promote clean and efficient transportation, creating clean jobs as we reduce energy consumption, air pollution, and greenhouse gases. We will work together to protect nature and to advance our scientific understanding of the environmental challenges we share. And finally, we will respond directly and decisively to the challenge of climate change, working to make our own countries more resilient as we encourage others to do the same. This is what can happen when countries come together in pursuit of a common goal, when we have a big idea and the political will to make it happen. Today's climate agreement stands as proof that cooperation pays off and that working together always beats going it alone.\nThere were, of course, other issues on the agenda as well.\n[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nWe also had the opportunity to talk about ways of advancing trade and competitiveness in North America. It's essential to each of our economies, and it is vital for the creation of good jobs for the middle class. Furthermore, we reasserted our common commitment to human rights, and we discussed the aspects on which we could be better partners to ensure the protection and defense of fundamental rights. We also discussed regional and worldwide issues that are urgent, and we talked about the way we will work together to meet these common challenges.\n[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in English as follows.]\nWe talked about how to better cooperate on defense, but it also meant forging a closer working relationship when it comes to providing development and humanitarian assistance, as well as finding ways to more effectively combat public health challenges, the illicit flow of funds and drugs, and human trafficking.\nAs I said, the conversations were friendly, but also frank. And I'm reassured and encouraged by the progress we were able to make today.\nRelationships between the citizens of our three nations have always been strong, even in the past when our governments haven't always seen eye to eye. It's gratifying that once again we are able to come together as leaders of three truly great nations to honor that enduring friendship and to once again deliver real results for the people of Canada, Mexico, the United States and, indeed, the entire global community.\nThank you, Barack and Enrique, for all your hard work today and every day.\nI'd now like to introduce the President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto.\nPresident Peña Nieto. Thank you very much, Prime Minister of Canada, Honorable Barack Obama. With this press conference, we come to an end of this day in Canada, today's state visit and today at the North American Leaders' Summit.\nPrime Minister Trudeau, allow me to say once again how grateful I am for your hospitality, for the warmth with which we were received, myself and my delegation. We were warmly welcomed in this country. We're going back to Mexico with memories of the warm welcome that the Canadian people showed in Quebec, in Toronto, and Ottawa.\nWe're going back to Mexico fully convinced that we have renewed our bilateral relationship with Canada: Canada and yourself. Canada has a leader that is going back to universal values that make Canada stand out in the world.\nPresident Barack Obama, I would like to say that we acknowledge your determination to have a more united, integrated, and competitive North America, a more prosperous and inclusive North America.\nI would like to highlight, specifically being the last North American Leaders' Summit that you will attend to as a President of the United States, I would like to acknowledge that Mexico recognizes the fact that you have promoted, along Mexico, a strategic partnership, and you have always been willing to work towards a bilateral agenda that covers different fronts, beyond security. In the process of generating clean energy, you have favored those efforts. You have always favored a more expedited trade, a safer border, more competitiveness in our trade. You have always been in favor of having cooperation in education and cultural matters, have always been willing to push technology and science forward.\nBut there is no doubt that your legacy also covers other regions of Latin America. You have reestablished a relationship with Cuba. You have supported the development of Central America. And in the Summit of the Americas, as well, you have contributed to its advancement.\nWe would like to acknowledge as well your tireless efforts made towards the investment of the environment and of addressing the challenges of global warming. There is no doubt that your Presidency has helped to build and reaffirm the candid relationship that the United States and Mexico have.\nDuring this trilateral summit, the governments of Canada, the United States, and Mexico, we have reaffirmed our decision to work together with a vision, with resolve to advance economic integration in North America. In order to fulfill this goal, Mexico values that in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, there is a great opportunity to reaffirm this level of integration between the three countries that are part of NAFTA. But besides that, we are taking this opportunity to other regions of the world, specifically towards Asia.\nI believe that the advantages, the benefits, and the beauties that this integration will carry and has carried along for the benefit of our societies can be extended when the Trans-Pacific Partnership is approved. Mexico supports this effort with enthusiasm. This partnership, this agreement is at the Senate, in the process of being approved. We are fully convinced that by working together and by taking stock of our complementarity, we can be the most competitive region in the world, as Prime Minister Trudeau has said during this summit.\nWe have worked on addressing four priorities: climate change, clean energies and environment, competitiveness at the borders, and trade security and defense, and regional and global issues. Specifically, Mexico addressed the area of competitiveness in trade and in our borders.\nI would like to highlight some of the most important agreements. We're going to create single trade windows to enable our border exchanges. Our goal is to have one foreign trade single window for North America.\nSecondly, we're going to map North American clusters. This will be a vital tool for decisionmaking and to bolster economic trade in the region. We have agreed to have a trilateral cluster map as soon as possible.\nAnd thirdly, I should mention that trilateral program for trusted travelers. Mexico has proposed that this program uses global entry platform that Canada and the United States already have. And this year, we will implement the electronic kiosks platform that is already present in different airports in the United States and Canada. This system, end result, will be used in North America as a whole. And this will be a system that will enable and expedite the flow and transit of individuals in North America.\nFinally, I would like to use an example to describe our level of integration: the preservation of the monarch butterfly conservation. This is a species that, in its pilgrimage, we can see how our countries are intertwined. And back in our last summit, we agreed that we would take care of this species and make sure that, in its journey, the monarch butterfly from Canada, flying through the United States all the way down to Mexico. And the figures speak for itself.\nIn the year 2014, in our country, the area where butterflies reached that—eventually reached only covered less than one hectare, 0.6 hectares. Due to the efforts made by our trilateral task force, created for that purpose last year, this year's—the surface in my country now extends to 4.1 hectares, and we are en route that by 2018, this figure would grow to 6 hectares, and eventually, that would be our goal for the monarch butterfly reserve in Mexico. And by that, we will be making sure the migration of this species is the symbol of the relationship that Canada, the United States, and Mexico have.\nThe North American Leaders' Summit bears witness that isolated national efforts are insufficient. If we want favorable results for the benefit of our societies, it is better to work together as a region. We all know that vis-a-vis global challenges, isolationism is not the solution. In contrast, with what happens in other corners in the world, the countries in North America, we have decided to be closer, to work as a team, and to complement each other and to make progress together as the most competitive region in the world.\nThank you very much.\nPrime Minister Trudeau. President Obama.\nPresident Obama. Well, good afternoon. Bonjour. Buenas tardes. I want to thank my friends and partners, Prime Minister Trudeau and President Peña Nieto. To Justin and the people of Ottawa and Canada, thank you for your wonderful hospitality.\nThis is my fourth North American Leaders' Summit and the first that Canada is hosting in nearly a decade. And this reflects the new commitment that Prime Minister Trudeau has brought to our shared vision of a strong and integrated North America. So thank you so much, Justin.\nTerrorist Attack in Istanbul, Turkey\nLet me start by once again commenting on the horrific terrorist attack that took place yesterday in Istanbul's main international airport, which is one of the busiest airports in the world. The prayers of the American people are with the people of Turkey, the people of Istanbul, and all those who were affected by this terrible crime. We have offered all assistance that we have available to our ally, Turkey, and we stand prepared to assist them during this difficult time.\nWe're still learning all the facts, but we know this is part of our broader, shared fight against terrorist networks, and we will continue to work closely with Turkey to root them out. And meanwhile, we're going to do what's necessary to protect our people. I'm confident that we can and we will defeat those who offer only death and destruction. And we will always remember, even as there are those who are trying to divide us, that we are stronger when we come together and work toward a better world together.\nCanada-Mexico-U.S. Relations\nWe're reminded of this basic fact at this summit. Combined, our three nations are home to nearly 480 million people. We are bound together by family, including millions of immigrants who trace their roots to each other's countries. We're not only among each other's top trade partners, we are a global hub of innovation, with integrated economies and supply chains and coproduction that span our borders. On every security and global challenge, we are partners. And we're united by common values of democracy and pluralism and a commitment to human dignity.\nOver the past 8 years, I've worked to strengthen our partnerships with our friends in the Americas, and that begins with strengthening our relationship with Canada and Mexico. During my administration, for example, we boosted U.S. exports to Canada and Mexico by about 50 percent. That supports about 2.8 million American jobs. And today, as Justin and Enrique described, we agreed to build on that progress in several key areas.\nFirst, we agreed to make it even easier to do business together so that our region is even more competitive. We're bringing more advanced technologies and automation to our border crossings, which will reduce wait times for travelers and make it more affordable to trade. By the end of this year, we'll have a Single Trusted Traveler Program for all three of our countries, which will make it easier to travel, while at the same time improving security. We'll continue to align our standards and regulations, which is especially important for small businesses who want to export more. We're going to do more together to promote women entrepreneurs and minority-owned businesses to succeed as well, and we're going to keep expanding our educational exchanges among our students.\nAs has been mentioned, we discussed the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The politics of trade are always difficult in every country. I don't know any country where there aren't going to be some folks who argue against trade, but we all believe that in a integrated global economy, the goal is not for us to try to shut ourselves off from the world, but rather to work together to raise standards around the world for workers and for the environment. And that's exactly what TPP does. It's the right thing to do. And we're going to keep working for it.\nGiven the flood of steel and aluminum on global markets, however, it points to the fact that free trade also has to be fair trade. And our three countries agreed to work together on a range of trade measures to enforce our rights and protect our workers and ensure a level playing field for the steel and aluminum industries here in North America. And given the vote of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, our economic teams are going to continue to work together so that we remain focused on keeping our economies growing and making sure that the global financial system is stable, something I'm confident that we can do.\nSecond, we're making sure that North America remains a leader in the fight against climate change. And I could not be prouder of the work that Justin and Enrique have done to help realize this important goal. All three of our nations are now committed to joining the Paris Agreement this year so we can bring it into force. We're announcing a new goal across our continents of generating 50 percent of our electricity with clean power by 2025, which is a bold goal, but is a eminently achievable goal. The United States Government is making a major commitment to purchase more clean energy for Federal facilities and more clean and efficient Government vehicles. And all three of our countries are committing to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40 to 45 percent by 2025.\nThird, we're going to do more to make sure that we're looking after the safety and health of our citizens from the danger of illicit drugs. And we're particularly focused right now on the epidemic of opioid abuse, including heroin, that is taking so many lives and devastating so many families. Our teams will meet this fall to make sure that we're coordinating our efforts, including more access to treatment. And as always, we will continue to be relentless against the criminals and narcotraffickers that are inflicting so much violence on communities. Fourth, we're deepening our cooperation on regional and global challenges: joint efforts against diseases like Zika; helping our Central American partners address poverty and violence that have led to so many families and children making an extraordinarily dangerous trip to flee difficult circumstances.\nI want to thank Justin and Enrique for their governments' strong support of our new approach to Cuba. And I'm also glad that our countries have agreed to do more around the world to address the refugee crisis and expand our peacekeeping efforts.\nIn our own hemisphere, with the historic agreement in Colombia, a major step toward peace, our three nations are going to help the Colombians remove landmines as just one example of efforts to fortify what has been a very difficult negotiation.\nAnd given the very serious situation in Venezuela and the worsening plight of the Venezuelan people, together we're calling on the Government and opposition to engage in meaningful dialogue and urge the Venezuelan Government to respect the rule of law and the authority of the National Assembly. Political prisoners should be released, the democratic process should be respected, and that includes legitimate efforts to pursue a recall referendum consistent with Venezuelan law.\nIn closing, we're determined to keep building on the progress that's been made at so many of the previous summits. And by the way, Enrique Enrique, I love the story about monarch butterflies. They're not just any species, they are spectacular. And we want to make sure that our children and our grandchildren can see them as well.\nWe're creating what we call the North American Caucus, which means our three governments will meet on a more regular basis. We're going to continue to deepen our trilateral cooperation in this hemisphere and around the world. And in short, we're going to do more to speak with one, united North American voice on the world stage. We couldn't have better partners than Justin and Enrique. I'm confident that we're going to continue to advance regional cooperation and integration, and that's not just going to be good for our own people, that will be good for the world as well.\nMerci beaucoup. Muchas gracias.\nPrime Minister Trudeau's Director of Communications Kate Purchase. Thank you.\n[Ms. Purchase continued in French, and her remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nSo we're now ready to start with the question period.\n[She continued in English as follows.]\nOur first question is from Canadian journalist Richard Madan from CTV News.\nTrade/United Kingdom's Referendum Vote To Leave the European Union/Economic Globalization\nQ. Hi. Good afternoon, gentlemen. One of the candidates who wants to replace President Obama has already said he wants to renegotiate NAFTA and walk away from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, all suggesting that perhaps there's a growing disconnect between the protrade message you're selling here and the protectionist voices we're hearing in the U.S. and possibly the Brexit in the U.K. So my question is to all three of you: What is your strategy to reverse this growing sentiment? And, Prime Minister Trudeau, en français aussi. If the rest of you speak French, that's great. [Laughter]\n[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nPrime Minister Trudeau. First of all, our strategy is to highlight how much trade and positive agreements among our nations are good not only for the economy of the world and the economy of our countries, but it's also good for our citizens. We know that industries that export more goods pay salaries that are 50 percent higher than sectors that don't export. We also know that trade gives rise to good jobs, innovation, and progress for individuals as well.\nIn our conversations today and yesterday with President Peña Nieto, we signed agreements and held conversations that allowed us to remove visas for Mexican visitors to Canada. This will have effects on all Canadians who live in communities that welcome Mexican tourists. It will also allow Canadian agriculture producers to have access to the Mexican beef market.\nThese are examples of the cooperation that we say is good for the North American market, but also good for the entire world. And it's with this in mind that it's important to come together, to talk together about the future of this world, where we are more and more connected. And we have to agree more and more in this world.\n[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in English as follows.]\nOur response to the kinds of protectionism that we're seeing around the world is indeed to highlight that when we come together like in events, like this North American Leaders' Summit, there's an opportunity to come together in ways that are beneficial for the global economy, that are beneficial for our countries' economies, but mostly, that are beneficial for individual citizens.\nWe know that export-intensive industries pay, on average, 50 percent higher wages than nonexporting industries. We know that trade leads to innovation and opportunities for communities, for individuals, for workers. Now, we need to make sure that we're dealing with challenges and problems as they come up, and that's where a constant, engaged dialogue comes with positive outcomes.\nJust yesterday, with President Peña Nieto, we were able to establish forward movement on two difficult issues between our—not just our countries, but our peoples, which will have a beneficial impact on both sides of the deal. We will be lifting visas for visitors to Mexico—to Canada from Mexico, which will have a positive impact on communities across country—the country as we welcome in tourists, but also, we've been able to secure access for Canadian farmers to sell their beef in Mexico.\nThese are good, concrete things that happen when we pull together and deal with important issues. And always, there will be people trying to get us all to turn inwards. But the fact is, our world is interconnected in so many ways, that it is much better that we engage, that we work through our challenges together because, really, that's how we end up with the kind of growth that benefits our countries and our citizens.\nPresident Peña Nieto. I'll be very brief in addressing your question. There is sometimes that what one has, has not been valued enough until you lose them. And what this integration has managed to achieve in North America is precisely to give two or three countries more opportunities and to give our societies more opportunities by growing trade, by having more investment in our three countries.\nIn our three countries, we see opportunities growing and reaching out to more people. Academic exchanges and the possibility of studying abroad in any of the three countries represented here by three heads of state are outcomes of our trilateral agreements. I believe that we are all aware of how the reactions are of what happened in the U.K., and there's still uncertainty. The outcome of the referendum is uncertain. But when someone values what you had, that is when we see such reactions.\nSo we are here trying to innovate, to be more competitive. Why? Because we are competitors, yes, but we have complementary economies. And that would give more development to our societies. I believe that this is the main goal of our efforts. The agreements made here are not only agreements made by three heads of state. We are building roads, we're building the foundation so that our societies can have strong foundations and get—go further. And that makes a great contrast. When some other countries choose isolationism, they choose protectionistic measures, and they are not letting their societies project themselves to other kinds of scenarios.\nPresident Obama. Well, let me make a couple of points. First of all, the integration of national economies into a global economy, that's here. That's done. And so the question is not whether or not there's going to be a international global economy. There is one: technology, travel, massive cargo containers that can ship goods back and forth; the fact that a company can move capital around the world in the blink of an eye; the fact that an engineer can send plans to the other side of the world in an instant to a colleague. Those are facts.\nSo we have an integrated economy already. The question is, under what terms are we going to shape that economy? And it is my firm belief that making sure that how we trade, how we exchange goods, it is my firm belief that shaping those in accordance with the values that our three countries care deeply about is going to be good for us and us trying to abandon the field and pull up the drawbridge around us is going to be bad for us.\nNow, with respect to Brexit, I think it's important to point out that those who argued about leaving the European Union are the same folks who the very next day are insisting, don't worry, we're still going to have access to the single market. So, apparently, their argument was not against trade generally. They just didn't want any obligations—[laughter]—to go with the access to the free market. And it's important for us not to draw easy analogies between what happened in the U.K. and the EU versus what's happening between our three countries in terms of trade, or what's happening in terms of us attempting to access Asian markets through TPP. That's point number one.\nPoint number two: Ordinary people who have concerns about trade have a legitimate gripe about globalization, because the fact is that as the global economy is integrated, what we've seen are trend lines across the advanced economies of growing inequality and stagnant wages and a smaller and smaller share of overall productivity and growth going to workers and a larger portion going to the top 1 percent. And that's a real problem. Because if that continues, the social cohesion and political consensus needed for liberal market economies starts breaking down.\nSo they're right to be concerned about that. I'm concerned about it, Justin is concerned about it, and Enrique is concerned about it. The question is, what do you do about it? And the prescription of withdrawing from trade deals and focusing solely on your local market, that's the wrong medicine: first of all, because it's not feasible, because our auto plants, for example, would shut down if we didn't have access to some parts in other parts of the world. So we'd lose jobs, and the amount of disruption that would be involved would be enormous. Secondly, we'd become less efficient. Costs of our goods in our own countries would become much more expensive.\nAnd this nostalgia about an era when everybody was working in manufacturing jobs and you didn't need a college degree and you could go in and as long as you worked hard you could support a family and live a middle class life, that has been undermined far more by automation than it has been by outsourcing or the shift of jobs to low-income—or low-wage countries. I mean, the steel industry is producing as much steel in the United States as it ever was. It's just it needs one-tenth of the workers that it used to.\nAnd this is why my pushback on both the left and the right when it comes to protectionism or antitrade arguments is, you are right to be concerned about the trends, but what you're prescribing will not work. And there's a better way of doing this. And the better way of doing it is, countries like ours that have high wage—high labor standards and high environmental standards and strong protection of intellectual property and rule of law, we've got to get out there and help to shape those rules so that they work for our workers and our businesses. Because if we don't, China will write the rules, and they may not have the same regard for the values that we care about. Other countries will write the rules in ways that disadvantage our workers and our businesses.\nIn Asia right now, there are a whole lot of tariffs that keep our products out, but because we happen to be some of the most open nations in the world, they're selling our stuff in. So we can't disengage; we ought to engage more. And if we combine that with investments in education and tax policies that are fair and making sure that college is affordable, and we're strengthening the safety net, and we're rebuilding our infrastructure—which are jobs that cannot be exported—and we're making investments in research and development, and we're building an inclusive society in which everybody has got a fair shot, that's how we're going to solve these problems.\nAnd what is absolutely true is, is that too many folks who have been in charge around the world have neglected that side of the equation. So we're going to keep on pushing hard to shape an international order that works for our people. But we're not going to be able to do that by cutting off trade, because that's going to make all of us poorer.\n[Ms. Purchase spoke in French, and her remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nMs. Purchase. Thank you. We can now take the second question. Daniel Venegas, Milenio.\nU.S. Presidential Election/Mexico-U.S. Relations/Immigration\nQ. Good afternoon. I would like to ask you, we have the election process going on in the United States. There is an anti-immigrant and anti-Mexican rhetoric by Donald Trump. I would like to ask you, did you address this issue during your meeting? And how can you ring fence the agreements that you have described and the positive outcomes of your trilateral relationship? What would happen if someone who is not in agreement—he has said it that NAFTA—they would step back from NAFTA. What did you address in your meetings? Thank you. President Peña Nieto. I would like to begin by saying that we did address the issue and we have discussed it during the state visit. Specifically, I would speak on behalf of Mexico. My Government will respect the election process, which is a domestic process for the United States. We are getting ready to work with whomever turns out to be President of the United States.\nAnd the best way to ring fence the progress and agreements that have been made so far is to explain clearly and let the people feel the beauties and the benefits of all the work we do. Most of what we have today, it's not random. It might be a gift from God, but it is actually the outcome of our work of the foundations and the work we have done so far. And I believe that in the end of the day, what we managed to achieve today would teach us a lesson. It would be for the Americans to define who would provide them better guarantees to move into the path towards growth and development based upon what we have managed to build in the past.\nPresident Obama. Well, I think Enrique is right. Whoever becomes the President of the United States is going to have a deep, strong interest in having a strong relationship with Mexico. It's our neighbor, our friend, and one of our biggest trading partners.\nI think I've made myself clear, setting aside whatever the candidates are saying, that America is a nation of immigrants. That's our strength. Unless you are one of the First Americans, unless you are a Native American, somebody somewhere in your past showed up from someplace else. And they didn't always have papers. And the genius of America has been to define ourselves not by what we look like or what our last name is or what faith we practice, but our adherence to a common creed: a belief that all people are created equal; a belief in free speech and freedom of assembly and democracy and pluralism and tolerance and rule of law. And we have observed those ideals imperfectly at times, but in each successive generation, we've gotten a little bit better at it. We've come closer to our ideals.\nAnd the notion that somehow we would stop now on what has been a tradition of attracting talent and strivers and dreamers from all around the world, that would rob us of the thing that is most special about America. And I don't think it will happen.\nNow, people are genuinely concerned about immigration that is not orderly, people pouring across borders without having gone through some sort of process. It adds to people's sense that things are out of control. And that's why we've invested in securing our borders, and we've made unprecedented investments. It's part of the reason why illegal immigration to the United States is actually at its lowest level since the 1970s. It's why we so value the cooperation that we've obtained from the Mexican Government in making sure that our borders work to facilitate legal trade and legal immigration and commerce, but discourages illegal immigration.\nIt's why I'm pushing very hard, and will continue to push until I leave this office—and expect the next President to push—for a comprehensive immigration reform plan that can fix those aspects of the system that are broken so that we remain a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants.\nAnd that's ultimately, I think, where people in the United States will land. We've had times throughout our history where anti-immigration sentiment is exploited by demagogues. It was directed at the Irish. It was directed at Poles and Italians. And you can go back and read what was said about those groups, and it's identical to what they're now saying about Mexicans or Guatemalans or Salvadorians or Muslims or Asians. Same stuff: \"They're different.\" \"They're not going to fit.\" \"They won't assimilate.\" \"They bring crime.\" Same arguments. You go back to the 1800s, the language is identical. But guess what? They kept coming. And they kept coming because America offered possibility for their children and their grandchildren. And even if they were initially discriminated against, they understood that our system will, over time, allow them to become part of this one American family.\nAnd so we should take some of this rhetoric seriously and answer it boldly and clearly. But you shouldn't think that that is representative of how the American people think.\nMs. Purchase. And now our third question from the United States, reporter Roberta Rampton from Reuters. Thank you.\nPresident Obama. I should point out that Roberta is also secretly from Canada. [Laughter]\nQ. Not so secretly. [Laughter]\nPresident Obama. So Canadians are now getting an extra question. [Laughter]\nU.S. Presidential Election/United Kingdom's Referendum Vote To Leave the European Union/Economic Globalization/United Kingdom-U.S. Relations\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President. Given how the Brexit vote shook the stability of the global economy, do you feel that you need to do more to calm the markets quickly and perhaps encourage a quick exit, rather than something that's long and drawn out? Do you still feel that the U.K. should be at the back of the queue for a trade deal with the United States? And are you going to make a full-throated pitch for the TPP, for your prescription, when you're out on the campaign trail this summer, stumping for Secretary Clinton?\nAnd, Prime Minister Trudeau, both—I mean, you seem to be quite careful when you talk about Mr. Trump. Renegotiating NAFTA or tearing it up would be such a disaster for Canada. Why not come out and say that forcefully?\nAnd, President Peña Nieto, in March you compared Mr. Trump to Hitler and Mussolini. I'm wondering if you still stand by that. And how worried are you that this time next year there will be a wall up on your border?\nPresident Obama. Okay. [Laughter] Excellent questions, Roberta.\nPrime Minister Trudeau. She doesn't sound Canadian. [Laughter] That was pretty mean. [Laughter]\nPresident Obama. Canadians are a little more subtle. [Laughter]\nI'm actually going to help out my friends a little bit on your last question, even though it wasn't directed at me, and just say, when I visit other countries, it's not my job to comment on candidates in the middle of a race, just because they may end up winning. And the relationship between governments tend to transcend whoever is in power at any given time. So it's a tough question. It's—I'm not saying they shouldn't answer it, I'm just—I'm helping them out a little bit. [Laughter] Because there's no doubt that when I visit countries, there are times where I've got preferences, but I'd rarely express them.\nWith respect to Brexit, first of all, I think you've seen the markets settle down a little bit over the last couple of days. I didn't follow the markets today. But we're monitoring very carefully whether there's any systemic strains on the system. And so far, what you've seen is reactions in the market, stock prices, currencies. But I think the preparations that were done by central banks and Finance Ministers, our Treasury Secretary, indicate the degree to which the global economy in the short run will hold steady. I think there are some genuine longer term concerns about global growth if in fact Brexit goes through and that freezes the possibilities of investment in Great Britain or in Europe as a whole. At a time when global growth rates were weak already, this doesn't help.\nAnd so when we attend the G-20 summit in China later this year, one of the major topics—which is something that I've continually advocated for during the 7½ years that I've been President—is we all have to look at what we can do to boost global demand: whether it's the United States adopting a more robust budget for infrastructure improvements and fixing water systems in Flint, Michigan, or repairing airports that are not as efficient as they should be or rebuilding our power grid so that it can take advantage of clean energy; whether it's Germany, a country with a surplus, doing more in terms of spending, or Europe as a whole lifting some of the austerity constraints that have been placed on them; whether it's China shifting to a more consumer-based, domestic-based growth strategy as opposed to trying to export its way out of problems. There are going to be a whole host of measures that all of us can take to fortify the global economy, and that should be a top priority of ours.\nWith respect to the actual Brexit negotiations, my main message to David Cameron, Angela Merkel and others is: Everybody should catch their breath, come up with a plan and a process that is orderly, that's transparent, that people understand, and then proceed, understanding that both sides have a stake in getting this right. And I think that that will be a difficult, challenging process, but it does not need to be a panicky process. I think it can be a steady, sensible process.\nObviously, leadership issues in Great Britain will need to be resolved for it to move as crisply and as effectively as it needs to, but that—I think that's recognized, and that should happen fairly quickly. And I know that, speaking with Chancellor Merkel, that her interest is not in retribution, her interest is in making sure that the process works. And I have a lot of confidence in people being able to do that. And we will help in any way that we can to facilitate that.\nAnd then, the last part of your question is with respect to the U.K. and any trade agreement with the United States. Frankly, we will be the least of their problems right now, because their first order of business is going to be to address the market where they sell half their goods, which is Europe. And these things are not easily negotiated, particularly because we've been spending our time trying to negotiate with the European Union. And so to suddenly go off on another track will be challenging. But I think their first and primary concern is going to be to try to figure out how they interact with the European Union and the European market if in fact—and when in fact—they leave.\nI have emphasized throughout, though, that the special relationship that we have with Great Britain does not change; that the ties of affection and family and language and institutions and culture and the business relationships that exist, those are so deep and so long lasting—the cooperation we have on security issues and on global challenges, those are so fundamental—that our relationship with the U.K. fundamentally doesn't change.\nWe are concerned that their absence from the European Union and the potential disruptions within Europe make it harder for us to solve some of the other challenges that have to be solved.\n[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in English as follows.]\nPrime Minister Trudeau. One of the things that's easy to forget amid the inflated rhetoric of an election campaign is that the relationship between our three countries goes far deeper than any individual leaders. And if the three of us get along, it's not just because we're aligned in many different values and priorities, it is very much because we serve citizens who are, they themselves, tremendously aligned in terms of priorities, in terms of hopes and dreams, in terms of desire for success and ways to reach it.\nSo when you look at the level of integration, of our supply chains, of our markets, of the flow back and forward across borders of goods, of people, and the tremendous benefits that have come from proximity and strong relationships to individual citizens across this continent, it's essential that we understand that regardless of electoral rhetoric, Canada, the United States, and Mexico will continue to have tremendously close relationships economically, culturally, socially, familialy, historically, and towards the future.\nSo as I've said many times, and I'll say again, I look forward to working with whomever the American people choose to elect as their President in November. I know that we will always be able to find shared priorities and challenges that we want to work together to overcome. And I know that our commitment to doing what's right and what's best for our citizens will lead us to much more alignment than differentiation.\nPresident Peña Nieto. Roberta, I'll go straight to the point to describe the stand of my administration and my own very personal point of view. I've said it, and I'll say it again: My Government will respect fully the domestic electoral process in the United States. I don't think I've said anything different from what I'm stating once again here. What I have said is that today—and I did not make reference to a specific place—my words reinforce what I believe.\nI believe that in this global scenario—and I'll use President Obama's words, and as he said, he gave us a hand to address this question—we are facing a global reality. We have a populist world, an interconnected world with its own challenges. What I have said is that, in the world we're living, in different places, we have political leaders, political stakeholders that use demagoguery and have the populistic slogans that want to eliminate and destroy what has been built, what has taken decades to build to go back to problems of the past. And yes, it is true, all the benefits have not reached society as we whole. That is true. But those leaderships, those political actors, by using populism and demagoguery, they choose the easiest way to solve the challenges of today's world. And things are not that simplistic. It's not as easy as that. To lead a country, to take on a responsibility to rule a country, it goes beyond giving the easiest answer. It is complex and it is difficult to lead a country.\nAnd I just said it: What we have reached so far—the level of development, the level of well-being that we have in the world—without a doubt makes contrast with what the situation that we lived 30 years back. Never before a global society—or the societies, at least, of our three countries—had lived the level of development and well-being that we enjoy today. Never before had our countries had a high life expectancy as we have today. Never before had we had the opportunity to have access to the knowledge of the world as fast and as easy as we do today. Never before were in such a level of connection between society and the possibility of having access to any product from any corner of the world as we do today. And that was built throughout the years by using the model based on openness, free trade, trade agreements.\nAnd the biggest challenge today is to make sure that those benefits reach out to every single citizen. But the solution proposed by some is not by destroying what we have been built, it is not taking a different route to choose the road towards isolationism and destruction. What we need to do is to keep up the pace towards development. And when I said that, I mentioned that most of what some people say, it is very similar that in the past—and President Obama already said it, even years back—but in the past, some leaders addressed their societies in those terms. Hitler and Mussolini did that. And the outcome, it's clear to everyone: It resulted in devastation, and it turned out to be a tragedy for mankind. And we saw it last century.\nThat was my message when I made reference to this event. My message was about to value what we have and also to be aware of the road that we need to walk still. But that's the benefit that we're looking forward to: take the benefits to our societies.\n[Ms. Purchase spoke in English as follows.]\nMs. Purchase. [Inaudible]—last question.\n[Ms. Purchase continued in French, and her remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nThe question will be from Mr. Philippe-Vincent Foisy of Cogeco News.\n[The reporter spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nCanada-Mexico-U.S. Energy Cooperation/Alternative and Renewable Energy Sources/Populism/U.S. Presidential Election\nQ. Mr. Trudeau, with the goals that you have said are ambitious for clean energy, does this mean the U.S. will import more hydroelectricity?\n[The reporter continued in English as follows.]\n[Inaudible]—to produce more clean energy, does it mean that the United States will have to import more hydroelectricity from Canada?\n[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in English as follows.]\nPrime Minister Trudeau. Certainly, the agreement that we've concluded today values our shift towards cleaner, renewable energy. Canada has a tremendous amount of energy that comes from clean sources right now. And we're always looking to create more.\nHow we work together as—not just as two countries, but as three countries—on energy solutions that give opportunities to our citizens while protecting future generations from the impacts of climate change is something that we are all entirely agreed on.\nOne of the things that we've learned—and this is through the Paris Agreement and through years of following different paths towards solutions—is, there is no one single solution to our energy challenges or to the challenges posed by climate change; that we need to be creative, we need to be innovative, and we need to work together. And that's why the conclusion of this ambitious continental energy strategy is so important in how we are going to do not just our share to combat the global challenge that is climate change, but to demonstrate leadership and show that clean energy and clean growth are exactly the solution and the opportunity that we face because of climate change.\n[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nIt's true that the agreement that we came to today is very important because it allows us to fight climate change, but it's also very important when it comes to investing in green energy, clean growth, and our country. I know that we will have to pursue multiple, different solutions when it comes to clean energy, but cooperation and the collaboration that we've highlighted today among our three countries will give rise to innovative solutions that are positive in the area of green energy.\nI can't wait to work with the United States and with Mexico in order that, together, we are able to face climate change challenges. It's not just a matter of doing our fair share, it's a matter of showing leadership in the world when it comes to climate change and clean energy. We have to do more than our share. We have to show that the future of the environment and the economy involves taking responsible decisions for the environment and green energy.\nThank you.\nPresident Peña Nieto. Even when this question was addressed to the U.S. and Canada, I would like to say that Mexico, in this trilateral relationship, and as it has been mentioned here, we also are committed to clean energy. Mexico has revamped its legal framework so that, by 2024, at least 35 percent of the generation of energy is clean too. This is an agreement made in this trilateral meeting to reduce other pollutants like methane.\nWhat I would like to say is that our three countries share the same agenda in environmental issues. We're—have agreed to protect our world and to find solutions that we're already working on.\nPresident Obama. Well, Justin, I think, got it right, which is that we've set a goal and we are coordinating and synchronizing best practices. And there's going to be an energy mix in each of our countries that's going to be different. And some of it is going to be determined by what natural resources we have; it's going to be determined by how well we can integrate the grid and transmission of power.\nSo there may be some wonderful hydroelectric power that we'd like to get to the United States. The question is, are there enough transmission facilities for us to be able to buy it at a competitive price. Just as we develop wind energy, we have to build an infrastructure to get wind produced in South Dakota down to Chicago. And each of us, I think, are going to have national plans. But the point is that by setting these goals, creating these coordinating mechanisms, we're in a better position to take advantage of the confluence of interests and economies and opportunities.\nAnd I view this clean energy sector as an enormous opportunity. Look, oil is cheap right now, but it's not going to be cheap. I've said this before: Those of you who are buying gas guzzlers, I'm telling you—[laughter]—because it is a finite resource and becomes more and more expensive to extract and people are taking climate change more and more seriously.\nAnd so we're in a transition phase, but in the meantime, technology is moving. And solar and wind and hydro and biomass and entire technologies we haven't even thought of yet—there is some 15-year-old kid somewhere who is figuring it out. I don't know whether he's in Mexico or Canada or the United States or China or Saudi Arabia, but somebody is out there going to figure this out. And I want that opportunity to accrue to our workers, our people, our communities. And whoever wins this race is going to—everybody else is going to follow. And I believe that we have the brainpower and the architecture to lead. And we have such a huge market between our three countries that we can test out a lot of these opportunities and figure out which work best.\nIf you'll allow me, I want to say one last thing, though, because it's been a running thread in a bunch of questions, and that's this whole issue of populism. Maybe somebody can pull up in a dictionary quickly the phrase \"populism,\" but I'm not prepared to concede the notion that some of the rhetoric that's been popping up is populist.\nWhen I ran in 2008, and the reason I ran again, and the reason even after I leave this office I will continue to work in some capacity in public service is because I care about people and I want to make sure every kid in America has the same opportunities that I had. And I care about poor people who are working really hard and don't have a chance to advance. And I care about workers being able to have a collective voice in the workplace and get their fair share of the pie. And I want to make sure that kids are getting a decent education and a working mom has childcare that she can trust. And I think we should have a tax system that's fair and that folks like me who have been—have benefited from the incredible opportunities in my society should pay a little bit more to make sure that somebody else's kids who weren't as lucky have those same opportunities.\nAnd I think there should be curbs on the excesses of our financial sector so that we don't repeat the debacles of 2007 and 2008. And I think there should be transparency in how our systems work so that we don't have people dodging taxes by setting up offshore accounts in other places and avoiding the responsibilities that their fellow citizens who don't have fancy lawyers and accountants, that they can't benefit from those same tricks.\nNow, I suppose that makes me a populist. Now, somebody else who has never shown any regard for workers, has never fought on behalf of social justice issues or making sure that poor kids are getting a decent shot at life or have health care—in fact, have worked against economic opportunity for workers and ordinary people—they don't suddenly become a populist because they say something controversial in order to win votes. That's not the measure of populism. That's nativism or xenophobia or worse. Or it's just cynicism.\nSo I would just advise everybody to be careful about suddenly attributing to whoever pops up at a time of economic anxiety the label that they're populist. Where have they been? Have they been on the frontlines working on behalf of working people? Have they been carrying the laboring oar to open up opportunity for more people?\nNow, there are people like Bernie Sanders who I think genuinely deserved the title, because he has been in the vineyards fighting on behalf of these issues. And there, the question is just going to be, all right, we share values, we share goals, how do we achieve them?\nAnd I do think Enrique's broader point is right, which is, sometimes, there are simple solutions out there, but, I don't know, I've been President for 7½ years, and it turns out, that's pretty rare. [Laughter] And the global economy is one of those areas where there aren't a lot of simple solutions. And there aren't a lot of shortcuts to making sure that more people have opportunity in our countries. We are going to have to educate our kids better, and that takes time. We've got to make sure our manufacturing sector is more dynamic and competitive, and that takes time. We've got to restructure our Tax Codes to incentivize the right things and make sure workers are getting higher pay. That takes time. We've got to raise minimum wages. We've got to make sure that college is affordable. We have to restructure and reform our financial sectors so they're not reckless, but we've got to do so in ways that don't destroy the entire system and throw millions of people suddenly out of work.\nAnd when we bailed out the auto industry, that wasn't popular. So maybe I wasn't populist. But I tell you what, all those automakers—all those UAW members, both here in the United States and in Canada are pretty happy I did, even though it was—had about 10 percent popularity at the time—even in states like Michigan. So, I don't know, maybe that was an elitist move on my part because it didn't poll well. Last time I visited an auto plant, though, they were pretty happy.\nSo let's just be clear that somebody who labels \"us\" versus \"them,\" or engages in rhetoric about how we're going to look after ourselves and take it to the other guy—that's not the definition of populism.\nSorry. [Laughter] This is one of the prerogatives of when you're at the end of your term, you just kind of—[laughter]—you go on these occasional rants. [Laughter]\n[Ms. Purchase spoke in French, and her remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nMs. Purchase.

The Paris Agreement was a turning point for our planet, representing unprecedented accord on the urgent need to take action to combat climate change through innovation and deployment of low-carbon solutions. North America has the capacity, resources and the moral imperative to show strong leadership building on the Paris Agreement and promoting its early entry into force. We recognize that our highly integrated economies and energy systems afford a tremendous opportunity to harness growth in our continuing transition to a clean energy economy. Our actions to align climate and energy policies will protect human health and help level the playing field for our businesses, households, and workers. In recognition of our close ties and shared vision, we commit today to an ambitious and enduring North American Climate, Clean Energy, and Environment Partnership that sets us firmly on the path to a more sustainable future.\nAdvancing Clean and Secure Power\nWe announce a historic goal for North America to strive to achieve 50 percent clean power generation by 2025. We will accomplish this goal through clean energy development and deployment, clean energy innovation and energy efficiency. Building from ongoing efforts by our respective energy ministers through the North American Energy Ministerial Memorandum Concerning Climate Change and Energy Collaboration, a range of initiatives will support this goal, including:\n• Scaling up clean energy through aggressive domestic initiatives and policies, including Mexico's Energy Transition Law and new Clean Energy Certificates, the U.S. Clean Power Plan and five-year extension of production and investment tax credits, and Canada's actions to further scale up renewables, including hydro. • Collaborating on cross-border transmission projects, including for renewable energy. At least six transmission lines currently proposed or in permitting review, such as the Great Northern Transmission Line, the New England Clean Power Link, and the Nogales Interconnection, would add approximately 5,000 megawatts (MW) of new cross-border transmission capacity. • Conducting a joint study on the opportunities and impacts of adding more renewables to the power grid on a North American basis. • Enhancing trilateral collaboration on greening of government initiatives including the purchase of more efficient products, cleaner power, and clean vehicles. • Strengthening and aligning efficiency standards across all three countries, facilitating the seamless movement of products, reducing pollution, and cutting costs for consumers. We commit to promote industrial and commercial efficiency through the voluntary ISO 50001 energy performance standard and to align a total of ten energy efficiency standards or test procedures for equipment by the end of 2019. • Building on North American leadership in international forums such as Mission Innovation to accelerate clean energy innovation, our energy researchers will identify joint research and demonstration initiatives to advance clean technologies in priority areas such as: electricity grids and energy storage; reducing methane emissions; carbon capture, utilization and storage; and advanced heating and cooling, including energy efficiency in buildings.\nTogether, we estimate that the development of current and future projects and policies to achieve this goal will create thousands of clean jobs and support of our vision for a clean growth economy.\nThe three countries will continue to strengthen the North American Cooperation on Energy Information platform, by including additional geospatial information relating to cross-border infrastructure and renewable energy resources. We also commit to deepened electric reliability cooperation to strengthen the security and resilience of an increasingly integrated North American electricity grid.\nDriving Down Short-Lived Climate Pollutants\nShort-lived climate pollutants such as methane, black carbon, and hydrofluorocarbons are up to thousands of times more potent than carbon dioxide. Common sense actions to reduce these pollutants will deliver significant climate and health benefits in the near term and into the future, supporting our goal to limit global warming this century.\nToday, Mexico will join Canada and the United States in committing to reduce their methane emissions from the oil and gas sector—the world's largest methane source—40% to 45% by 2025, towards achieving the greenhouse gas targets in our nationally determined contributions. To achieve this goal, the three countries commit to develop and implement federal regulations to reduce emissions from existing and new sources in the oil and gas sector as soon as possible. We also commit to develop and implement national methane reduction strategies for key sectors such as oil and gas, agriculture, and waste management, including food waste.\nFinally, we pledge to continue collaborating with one another and with international partners as we commit to significant national actions to reduce black carbon emissions in North America, and promote alternatives to highly polluting hydrofluorocarbons.\nPromoting Clean and Efficient Transportation\nWe recognize that fully realizing the promise of an integrated North American transportation network will require joint action that will create clean jobs while reducing energy consumption, greenhouse gases, and air pollution. Today, we commit to:\n• Accelerating deployment of clean vehicles in government fleets; • Working collaboratively with industry to encourage the adoption of clean vehicles by identifying initiatives to support consumer choice; • Encouraging public and private infrastructure investments to establish North American refuelling corridors for clean vehicles; • Working to align applicable regulations, codes and standards where appropriate; • Fostering research, development, and demonstration activities for new clean technologies; • Convening industry leaders and other stakeholders by spring 2017 as part of a shared vision for a competitive and clean North American automotive sector.\nCanada, the U.S., and Mexico commit to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from light- and heavy-duty vehicles by aligning fuel efficiency and/or GHG emission standards out to 2025 and 2027, respectively. We further commit to reduce air pollutant emissions by aligning air pollutant emission standards for light- and heavy-duty vehicles and corresponding ultra low-sulphur fuel standards by 2018. In addition, we will encourage greener freight transportation throughout North America by expanding the SmartWay program to Mexico.\nWe recognize the significant contributions of our respective automotive industries and urge them to continue playing a leadership role in the development and deployment of clean and connected vehicles, innovating toward a shared vision of a green transportation future.\nWe support the adoption by all countries in 2016 of the market-based measure proposed through the International Civil Aviation Organization to allow for carbon-neutral growth from international civil aviation from 2020 onwards and will join the first phase of the measure adopted.\nWe are committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from maritime shipping and will continue to work together and through the International Maritime Organization to support implementation of a North American Emission Control Area that includes Mexico.\nProtecting Nature and Advancing Science\nThe mainstreaming of conservation and sustainable biodiversity is a key component of sustainable development. Canada and the U.S. congratulate Mexico on its commitment to host the 13th Conference of Parties to the Convention on Biodiversity under this theme. We will also work together to better integrate ocean observation systems, enhance early warning systems for natural disasters, and cooperate on marine protected areas.\nWe reaffirm our commitment to work collaboratively to achieve our long term goal of conserving North America's Monarch migratory phenomena and to ensure that sufficient habitat is available to support the 2020 target for the eastern Monarch population. Trilateral efforts to date have achieved significant successes across the range, including the restoration and enhancement of hundreds of thousands of acres of habitat. We look forward to continued progress and action in the future, building on the population increase for eastern monarchs observed in 2015.\nWe commit to collaborating with Indigenous communities and leaders to incorporate traditional knowledge in decision-making, including in natural resource management, where appropriate, and in advancing our understanding of climate change and climate resilience. We also recognize the importance of a gender-responsive approach to climate action and sustainable development.\nShowing Global Leadership in Addressing Climate Change\nCanada, the U.S., and Mexico will work together to implement the historic Paris Agreement, supporting our goal to limit temperature rise this century to well below 2oC, and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5oC. We reaffirm our commitment to join the Agreement this year, and call on all nations to support its entry into force in 2016. As we implement our respective Nationally-Determined Contributions, we will cooperate on climate mitigation and adaptation, focusing in particular on highly integrated sectors, shared ecosystems, human health and disaster risk-reduction efforts. We will work together and with international partners to support developing country partners in their mitigation and adaptation efforts. We will also support robust implementation of the Paris Agreement's transparency and carbon markets-related provisions, and will develop mid-century, long-term low-greenhouse gas emissions development strategies this year.\nCanada, the U.S., and Mexico affirm our commitment to adopt an ambitious and comprehensive Montreal Protocol hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) phase-down amendment in 2016, and to reduce use of HFCs, including through domestic actions. We call on all nations to support this goal.\nWe commit to phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies by 2025 and call on the other members of the G-20 to do the same. We also urge the G-20 to make commitments to reduce methane emissions in the oil and gas sector and to improve the environmental performance of heavy-duty vehicles.\nCanada, the U.S., and Mexico will promote universal energy access and work together to address the challenges of energy security and integration, clean energy investment, and regional energy cooperation in the Caribbean and Central America.\nCanada, the U.S. and Mexico will align approaches to account for the social cost of carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions when assessing the benefits of emissions-reducing policy measures.\nThe Action Plan that supports this Joint Statement further elaborates the various activities that the three countries are undertaking to meet their commitments.", "timestamp": "2016-06-29", "title": "Joint Statement by President Obama, Prime Minister Justin P.J.

An original was not available for verification of the content of this joint statement.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118019", "text": "Given the great importance of the softwood lumber industry to the economies of the United States and Canada, on March 10, 2016, we instructed the United States Trade Representative and the Canadian Minister of International Trade to intensively explore all options and report back on the key features that would address the issue.\nIn response to these instructions, our Ministers and their teams have been meeting diligently on softwood lumber over the past three months. These discussions have been challenging but productive.\nA Vital Sector\nThe softwood lumber industry is a vital sector for both the United States and Canada, and bilateral trade and investment in softwood lumber is key to the competitiveness of our industries. The U.S. and Canadian federal governments have made significant advances in understanding our industries' sensitivities and priorities since March. The United States and Canada are working together to find a path forward that reflects our shared goals and that results in durable and equitable solutions for softwood lumber producers from both countries.\nCanada has long been the largest source of imports of softwood lumber to the U.S. market and the United States is by far Canada's most important customer. Extensive cross-border investment also exists, with U.S. firms operating lumber mills in Canada and Canadian firms making investments in the United States. Firms in both countries also have worked jointly and in parallel to develop markets for softwood lumber.\nCommon Goals for Pursuing a New and Durable Agreement\nA new softwood lumber agreement will need to reflect the realities of Canadian timber management policies and the U.S. domestic market. A new agreement must be equitable and provide a predictable business environment that gives producers on both sides of our border the ability to react confidently to changing market conditions. Any agreement must deliver a durable and equitable solution and benefit softwood lumber producers from Canada and the United States, related industries and consumers, and support the overall economic well-being of both countries. On the basis of discussions to date, our governments are committed to working to achieve such an agreement.\nKey Features\nEfforts to achieve such an outcome will be facilitated by focussing on the following key features:\n• an appropriate structure, designed to maintain Canadian exports at or below an agreed U.S. market share to be negotiated, with the stability, consistency and flexibility necessary to achieve the confidence of both industries; • provisions for region or company exclusions if justified; • provisions promoting regional policies that eliminate the underlying causes of trade frictions, including a regional exits process that is meaningful, effective and timely, recognizing that should an exit be granted, it would be reversible if the circumstances justifying the exit change; • provisions to ensure information collection and exchange to create meaningful transparency; • institutional arrangements to administer the agreement; • effective enforcement tools that are neutral, transparent, binding, expeditious, and well-timed to address concerns as they arise; • associated commitments regarding the use of trade remedies; • provisions for appropriate duration and flexibility to anticipate and adapt to a range of market situations, industry innovations, and shifting demand patterns; • provisions to address other issues, such as product scope, remanufacturers and joint market development.\nNext Steps\nThe United States and Canada have made important progress in our negotiations, but significant differences remain regarding the parameters of the key features. Our governments will explore approaches to ensure effective management of the agreed market share. We are encouraged that both industries remain committed to working toward an agreement and will continue to consider ideas for achieving that objective. Our dialogue will continue and, building on the progress achieved to date, our Ministers will maintain an intensive pace of engagement with a view to achieving a mutually-acceptable agreement this fall, bearing in mind the expiration of standstill after October 12, 2016.", "timestamp": "2016-06-29", "title": "Joint Statement by President Obama and Prime Minister Justin P.J.

Please, everyone, have a seat. Thank you. Thank you so much.\nGood evening. Bonjour. Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Speaker, Members of the House, Members of the Senate, distinguished guests, people of Canada: Thank you for this extraordinary welcome, which tempts me to just shut up and leave. [Laughter] Because it can't get any better than this. [Laughter] Obviously, I'm grateful for the warm welcome. I'm extraordinarily grateful for the close working relationship and friendship with your outstanding Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, and his extraordinary wife Sophie.\nBut I think it's fair to say that much of this greeting is simply a reflection of the extraordinary alliance and deep friendship between Canadians and Americans.\nJustin, thank you for your very kind words and for the new energy and hope that your leadership has brought to your nation as well as to the alliance. My time in office may be nearing an end, but I know that Canada—and the world—will benefit from your leadership for years to come. So—[applause].\nSo Canada was the very first country that I visited as President. It was in February. [Laughter] It was colder. [Laughter] I was younger. [Laughter] Michelle now refers to my hair as the Great White North. [Laughter] And on that visit, I strolled around the ByWard Market, tried a \"beaver tail\"—[laughter]—which is better than it sounds. [Laughter] And I was struck then, as I am again today, by the warmth of Canadians. I could not be more honored to be joining you in this historic hall, this cathedral of freedom. And we Americans can never say it enough: We could not ask for a better friend or ally than Canada. We could not. [Applause] It's true. It is true. And we do not take it for granted.\nThat does not mean we don't have our differences. As I understand it, one of the reasons the Queen chose this site for Parliament was that it was a safe distance from America's border. [Laughter] And I admit, in the War of 1812, American troops did some damage to Toronto. I suspect that there were some people up here who didn't mind when the British returned the favor and burned down the White House. [Laughter]\nIn more recent times, however, the only forces crossing our borders are the armies of tourists and businesspeople and families who are shopping and doing business and visiting loved ones. Our only battles take place inside the hockey rink. [Laughter] Even there, there's an uneasy peace that is maintained. As Americans, we, too, celebrate the life of Mr. Hockey himself, the late, great Gordie Howe. Just as Canadians can salute American teams for winning more Stanley Cups in the NHL. [Laughter]\nAudience members. Oooh! [Laughter]\nThe President. I told you I should have stopped after the applause. [Laughter]\nBut in a world where too many borders are a source of conflict, our two countries are joined by the longest border of peace on Earth. And what makes our relationship so unique is not just proximity. It's our enduring commitment to a set of values, a spirit, alluded to by Justin, that says no matter who we are, where we come from, what our last names are, what faith we practice, here we can make of our lives what we will. It was the grit of pioneers and prospectors who pushed west across a forbidding frontier, the dreams of generations—immigrants, refugees—that were welcomed to these shores, the hope of runaway slaves who went north on an underground railroad. \"Deep in our history of struggle,\" said Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., \"Canada was the north star. . . . The freedom road links us together.\"\nWe're bound as well by the service of those who have defended us: at Flanders Field, the beaches of Normandy, in the skies of the Balkans, and more recently, in the mountains of Afghanistan and training bases in Iraq. And their sacrifice is reflected in the silent rows of Arlington and in the Peace Tower above us. And today we honor those who gave their lives for all of us.\nWe're linked together, as well, by the institutions that we've built to keep the peace: a United Nations to advance our collective aspirations; a NATO alliance to ensure our security; NORAD, where Americans and Canadians stand watch side by side and track Santa on Christmas Eve. [Laughter]\nWe're linked by a vast web of commerce that carries goods from one end of this continent to another. And we're linked by the ties of friendship and family, in my case, an outstanding brother-in-law from Burlington. [Applause] I had to give Burlington a shout-out. [Laughter] Our relationship is so remarkable precisely because it seems so unremarkable, which is why Americans often are surprised when our favorite American actor or singer turns out to be Canadian! The point is, we see ourselves in each other, and our lives are richer for it.\nAs President, I've deepened the ties between our countries. And because of the progress we've made in recent years, I can stand before you and say that the enduring partnership between Canada and the United States is as strong as it has ever been, and we are more closely aligned than ever before.\nAnd yet we meet at a pivotal moment for our nations and for the globe. From this vibrant capital, we can look upon a world that has benefited enormously from the international order that we helped to build together, but we can see that same order increasingly strained by the accelerating forces of change. The world is, by most every measure, less violent than ever before, but it remains riven by old divisions and fresh hatreds. The world is more connected than ever before, but even as it spreads knowledge and the possibility of greater understanding between peoples, it also empowers terrorists who spread hatred and death, most recently in Orlando and Istanbul.\nThe world is more prosperous than ever before, but alongside globalization and technological wonders, we also see a rise in inequality and wage stagnation across the advanced economies, leaving too many workers and communities fearful of diminishing prospects, not just for themselves, but more importantly, for their children.\nAnd in the face of such rising uncertainty, it is not enough to look at aggregate growth rates or stock prices or the pace of digital innovation. If the benefits of globalization accrue only to those at the very top, if our democracies seem incapable of assuring broad-based growth and opportunity for everyone, then people will push back, out of anger or out of fear. And politicians—some sincere and some entirely cynical—will tap that anger and fear, harkening back to bygone days of order and predictability and national glory, arguing that we must rebuild walls and disengage from a chaotic world or rid ourselves of the supposed ills brought on by immigrants, all in order to regain control of our lives. We saw some of these currents at work this past week in the United Kingdom's referendum to leave the European Union. Despite some of the initial reactions, I am confident that the process can be managed in a prudent, orderly way. I expect that our friends on both sides of the Channel will develop a workable plan for how to move forward. And I'm equally confident that the transatlantic values that we all share as liberal, market-based democracies are deeper and stronger than any single event.\nBut while the circumstances of Brexit may be unique to the United Kingdom, the frustrations people felt are not. The short-term fallout of Brexit can be sensibly managed, but the long-term trends of inequality and dislocation and the resulting social division, those can't be ignored. How we respond to the forces of globalization and technological change will determine the durability of an international order that ensures security and prosperity for future generations.\nAnd fortunately, the partnership between the United States and Canada shows the path we need to travel. For our history and our work together speak to a common set of values to build on; proven values, values that your Prime Minister spoke of in his introduction: values of pluralism and tolerance, rule of law, openness; global engagement and commerce and cooperation, coupled with equal opportunity and an investment in our people at home. As Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau once said: \"A country, after all, is not something you build as the pharaohs build the pyramids, and then leave standing there to defy eternity. A country is something that is built every day out of certain basic shared values.\" What is true of countries is true of the world. And that's what I want to talk about today: how to strengthen our institutions to advance these commitments in a rapidly changing world.\nNow, let me start with our shared economic vision. In all we do, our commitment to opportunity for all of our people has to be at the centerpiece of our work. We are so fortunate because both of our countries are so well positioned to succeed in the 21st century. Our two nations know firsthand the awesome power of free markets and innovation. Canadians help run some of Silicon Valley's most innovative companies. Our students study at each other's world-class universities. We invest in research and development and make decisions based on science and evidence. And it works. It's what's created these extraordinary economies of ours.\nBut if the financial crisis and recent recession taught us anything, it's that economies do better when everyone has a chance to succeed. For a long time, it was thought that countries had to choose between economic growth or economic inclusion. But it turns out, that's a false choice. If a CEO makes more in a day than a typical employee makes in a year, that kind of inequality is not just bad for morale in the company. It turns out, it's bad for the economy: That worker is not a very good customer for business.\nIf a young man in Ohio can't pay his student loans or a young woman in Ontario can't pay her bills, that has ramifications for our economy. It tamps down the possibilities of growth. So we need growth that is broad and that lifts everybody up, including tax policies that do right by working families and robust safety nets for those who fall on hard times. As John Kenneth Galbraith once said, \"The common denominator of progress\" is our people. It's not numbers, it's not abstractions, it's how are people doing?\nOf course, many who share this progressive, inclusive vision can be heard now arguing that investments in our people, protections for our workers, fair tax policies, these things are not enough. For them, globalization is inherently rigged towards the top 1 percent, and therefore, what's needed is an end to trade agreements and various international institutions and arrangements that integrate national economies. And I understand that vision. I know why it's tempting. It seems as if, if we draw a line around our borders that it will give us more control, particularly when the benefits of trade and economic integration are sometimes hard to see or easy to take for granted and the very specific dislocations are obvious and real.\nThere's just one problem: Restricting trade or giving in to protectionism in this 21st-century economy will not work. [Applause] It will not work. We—even if we wanted to, we can't seal ourselves off from the rest of the world. The day after Brexit, people looked around and said, \"Oh!\" [Laughter] \"How is this going to work?\" The drag that economic weakness in Europe and China and other countries is having on our own economies right now speaks to the degree to which we depend—our economies depend, our jobs, our businesses depend—on selling goods and services around the world.\nVery few of our domestic industries can sever what is now truly a global supply chain. And so for those of us who truly believe that our economies have to work for everybody, the answer is not to try and pull back from our interconnected world; it is rather to engage with the rest of the world, to shape the rules so they're good for our workers and good for our businesses.\nAnd the experience between our two nations points the way. The United States and Canada have the largest bilateral trade and investment relationship in the world, and we are stronger for it. It means a company in Quebec can create jobs in North Carolina. And a start-up in Toronto can attract investment from Texas. Now, the problem is that some economies in many of the fastest growing regions of the world—particularly the Asia-Pacific region—don't always abide by the same rules. They impose unfair tariffs, or they suppress workers' rights, or they maintain low environmental standards that make it hard for our businesses to compete fairly.\nAnd with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, we have the ability to not only open up these markets to U.S. and Canadian products and eliminate thousands of these unfair tariffs, which, by the way, we need to do because they're already selling here under existing rules, but we're not selling as much as we should over there. But it also affords us the opportunity to increase protections for workers and the environment and promote human rights, including strong prohibitions against human trafficking and child labor. And that way, our workers are competing on a level playing field, and our businesses are less prone to pursue a race to the bottom. And when combined with increased investments in our own people's education and skills and training and infrastructure and research and development and connectivity, then we can spur the kind of sustained growth that makes all of us better off. [Applause] All of us.\nThe point is, we need to look forward, not look backward. And more trade and more people-to-people ties can also help break down old divides. I thank Canada for its indispensable role in hosting our negotiations with the Cuban Government and supporting our efforts to set aside half a century of failed policies to begin a new chapter with the Cuban people. I know a lot of Canadians like going to Cuba—[laughter]—maybe because they haven't had Americans crowding the streets and the beaches. But that's changing. [Laughter] And as more Americans engage with the Cuban people, it will mean more economic opportunity and more hope for ordinary Cubans.\nWe also agree, us Americans and Canadians, that wealthy countries like ours cannot reach our full potential while others remain mired in poverty. That, too, is not going to change in this interconnected world; that if there is poverty and disease and conflict in other parts of the world, it spills over, as much as we'd like to pretend that we can block it out.\nSo, with our commitment to new sustainable development goals, we have the chance to end the outrage of extreme poverty. We can bring more electricity to Africa so that students can study at night and businesses can stay open. We can banish the scourge of malaria and Zika. We can realize our goal of the first AIDS-free generation. We can do that. It's within our grasp. And we can help those who are working to replace corruption with transparent, accountable institutions that serve their people.\nAs leaders in global development, the United States and Canada understands that development is not charity, it's an investment in our future prosperity. Because not only do such investments and policies help poor countries, they're going to create billions of customers for U.S. and Canadian products, and they'll make less likely the spread of deadly epidemics to our shores, and they'll stabilize parts of the world that threaten the security of our people.\nIn fact, both the United States and Canada believe our own security, and not just prosperity, is enhanced when we stand up for the rights of all nations and peoples to live in security and peace. And even as there are times when unilateral action is necessary to defend our people, we believe that in a world where wars between great powers are far less likely, but transnational threats like terrorism know no boundaries, our security is best advanced when nations work together. We believe that disputes that do arise between nations should be, wherever possible, resolved peacefully, with diplomacy; that international organizations should be supported; that multilateralism is not a dirty word.\nAnd certainly, we're more secure when we stand united against terrorist networks and ideologies that have reached to the very doorstep of this hall. We honor all those taken from us by violent extremists, including Canadians John Ridsdel and Robert Hall. And with Canada's additional contributions, including training Iraqi forces, our coalition is on the offensive across Iraq, across Syria. And we will destroy the terrorist group ISIL. We will destroy them.\nWe'll continue helping local forces in sharing intelligence, from Afghanistan to the Philippines, so that we're pushing back comprehensively against terrorist networks. And in contrast to the hatred and the nihilism of terrorists, we'll work with partners around the world, including, particularly, Muslim communities, to offer a better vision and a path of development and opportunity and tolerance. Because they are—and must be—our partners in this effort.\nMeanwhile, when nations violate international rules and norms—such as Russia's aggression against Ukraine—the United States and Canada stand united, along with our allies, in defense of our collective security. And doing so requires a range of tools, like economic sanctions, but it also requires that we keep our forces ready for 21st-century missions and invest in new capabilities. And as your ally and as your friend, let me say that we'll be more secure when every NATO member, including Canada, contributes its full share to our common security. Because the Canadian Armed Forces are really good, and if I can borrow a phrase, the world needs more Canada. NATO needs more Canada. We need you. [Applause] We need you.\nNow just as we join together in our common defense, so must we work together diplomatically, particularly to avert war. In diplomacy, results are rarely quick, but it turns out even the most intractable conflicts can be resolved. Here in our own hemisphere, just in the last few weeks, after half a century of war, Colombia is poised to achieve a historic peace. And the nations of North America will be an important partner to Colombia going forward, including working to remove landmines. Around the world, Canadian and American diplomats working together can make a difference. Even in Syria, where the agony and the suffering of the Syrian people tears at our hearts, our two nations continue to be leaders in humanitarian aid to the Syrian people. And although a true resolution of this conflict so far has eluded us, we know that the only solution to this civil war is a political solution so that the Syrian people can reclaim their country and live in peace. And Canadians and Americans are going to work as hard as we can to make that happen. I should add that here in the nation of Lester Pearson, we reaffirm our commitment to keep strengthening the peacekeeping that saves lives around the world.\nThere is one threat, however, that we cannot solve militarily, nor can we solve alone, and that's the threat of climate change. Now, climate change is no longer an abstraction. It's not an issue we can put off for the future. It is happening now. It is happening here, in our own countries. The United States and Canada are both Arctic nations, and last year, when I became the first U.S. President to visit the Arctic, I could see the effects myself. Glaciers, like Canada's Athabasca Glacier, are melting at alarming rates. Tundra is burning. Permafrost is thawing. This is not a conspiracy. [Laughter] It's happening. Within a generation, Arctic sea ice may all but disappear in the summer.\nAnd so skeptics and cynics can insist on denying what's right in front of our eyes. But the Alaska Natives that I met, whose ancestral villages are sliding into the sea, they don't have that luxury. They know climate change is real. They know it is not a hoax. And from Bangladesh to the Pacific islands, rising seas are swallowing land and forcing people from their homes. Around the world, stronger storms and more intense droughts will create humanitarian crises and risk more conflict. This is not just a moral issue, not just a economic issue, it is also an urgent matter of our national security.\nAnd for too long, we've heard that confronting climate change means destroying our own economies. But let me just say, carbon emissions in the United States are back to where they were two decades ago, even as we've grown our economy dramatically over the same period. Alberta, the oil country of Canada, is working hard to reduce emissions while still promoting growth.\nSo if Canada can do it and the United States can do it, the whole world can unleash economic growth and protect our planet. We can do this. [Applause] We can do it. We can do this. We can help lead the world to meet this threat.\nAlready, together in Paris, we achieved the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change. Now let's bring it into force this year. With our agreement with Mexico that we announced today, let's generate half the electricity on this continent from clean energy sources within a decade. That's achievable. Let's partner in the Arctic to help give its people the opportunity they deserve, while conserving the only home they know. And building on the idea that began in Montreal three decades ago, let's finally phase down dangerous HFC greenhouse gases. This is the only planet we've got. And this may be the last shot we've got to save it. And America and Canada are going to need to lead the way. We're going to have to lead the way.\nJust as we're joined in our commitment to protecting the planet, we are also joined in our commitment to the dignity of every human being. We believe in the right of all people to participate in society. We believe in the right of all people to be treated equally, to have an equal shot at success. That is in our DNA, the basic premise of our democracies.\nI think we can all agree that our democracies are far from perfect. They can be messy, and they can be slow, and they can leave all sides of a debate unsatisfied. Justin is just getting started. [Laughter] So in case you hadn't figured that out, it's where this gray hair comes from. [Laughter] But more than any other system of government, democracy allows our most precious rights to find their fullest expression, enabling us, through the hard, painstaking work of citizenship, to continually make our countries better, to solve new challenges, to right past wrongs.\nAnd, Prime Minister, what a powerful message of reconciliation it was—here and around the world—when your government pledged a new relationship with Canada's First Nations.\nDemocracy is not easy. It's hard. Living up to our ideals can be difficult even in the best of times. And it can be harder when the future seems uncertain or when, in response to legitimate fears and frustrations, there are those who offer a politics of \"us\" versus \"them,\" a politics that scapegoats others: the immigrant, the refugee, someone who seems different than us. We have to call this mentality what it is: a threat to the values that we profess, the values we seek to defend.\nIt's because we respect all people that the world looks to us as an example. The colors of the rainbow flag have flown on Parliament Hill. They have lit up the White House. That is a testament to our progress, but also the work that remains to ensure true equality for our fellow citizens who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender.\nOur Muslim friends and neighbors who run businesses and serve in our governments and in our armed forces and are friends with our children and play on our sports teams, we've got to stand up against the slander and the hate leveled against those who look or worship differently. That's our obligation. That's who we are. That's what makes America special. That's what makes Canada special. Here. [Applause] Here in Canada.\nHere in Canada, a woman has already risen to the highest office in the land. In America, for the first time, a woman is the presumptive nominee of a major party and perhaps President. I have a bias on these issues—[laughter]—but our work won't be finished until all women in our country are truly equal: paid equally, treated equally, given the same opportunities as men, when our girls have the same opportunities as our boys. That's who we need to be.\nAnd let me say this, because I don't feel particularly politically correct on this issue—[laughter]—I don't believe that these are American values or Canadian values or Western values. I believe, and Justin believes, and I hope all of you believe, these are universal values. And we must be bold in their defense, at home and around the world. And not shy away from speaking up on behalf of these values of pluralism and tolerance and equality.\nI fear sometimes that we are timid in defense of these values. That's why I will continue to stand up for those inalienable rights, here in our own hemisphere—in places like Cuba and Venezuela—but also in more distant lands: for the rights of citizens in civil society to speak their mind and work for change, for the rights of journalists to report the truth, for the rights of people of all faiths to practice their religion freely. Those things are hard, but they're right. They're not always convenient, but they're true.\nIn the end, it is this respect for the dignity of all people, especially the most vulnerable among us, that perhaps more than anything else binds our two countries together. Being Canadian, being American, is not about what we look like or where our families came from. It is about our commitment to a common creed. And that's why, together, we must not waver in embracing our values, our best selves. And that includes our history as a nation of immigrants, and we must continue to welcome people from around the world. The vibrancy of our economies are enhanced by the addition of new, striving immigrants. But this is not just a matter of economics. When refugees escape barrel bombs and torture and migrants cross deserts and seas seeking a better life, we cannot simply look the other way. We certainly can't label as possible terrorists vulnerable people who are fleeing terrorism.\nWe can insist that the process is orderly. We can insist that our security is preserved. Borders mean something. But at moments like this, we are called upon to see ourselves in others, because we were all once strangers. If you weren't a stranger, your grandparents were strangers. Your great-grandparents were strangers. They didn't all have their papers ready. They fumbled with language, faced discrimination, had cultural norms that didn't fit. At some point, somewhere, your family was an outsider. And so the mothers, the fathers, the children we see today, they're us. And we can't forsake them.\nSo, as Americans and Canadians, we will continue to welcome refugees, and we can ensure that we're doing so in a way that maintains our security. We can and we will do both. [Applause] We can and we will do both.\nWe're increasing our support to Central America so that fewer families and children attempt the dangerous journey north. This fall at the United Nations, we'll host a global summit on refugees, because in the face of this crisis, more nations need to step up and meet our basic obligations to our fellow human beings. And it will be difficult, and budgets are tight, and there are legitimate issues, and not everybody is going to be helped. But we can try. People of good will and compassion show us the way.\nGreek islanders pulling families to shore. And Germans handing out sweets to migrants at railway stations. A synagogue in Virginia inviting Syrian refugees to dinner. And here, in Canada, the world has been inspired as Canadians across this country have opened up their hearts and their homes. And we've watched citizens knitting tuques to keep refugees warm in the winter. [Laughter] And we've seen your Prime Minister welcome new arrivals at the airport and extend the hand of friendship and say, \"You're safe at home now.\"\nAnd we see the refugees who feel that they have a special duty to give back and seize the opportunity of a new life. Like the girl who fled Afghanistan by donkey and camel and jet plane and who remembers being greeted in this country by helping hands and the sound of robins singing. And today, she serves in this Chamber and in the Cabinet, because Canada is her home.\nA country \"is not something you build as the pharaohs built the pyramids . . . a country is something that is built every day out of certain basic shared values.\" How true that is. How blessed we are to have had people before us, day by day, brick by brick, build these extraordinary countries of ours. How fortunate, how privileged we are to have the opportunity to now, ourselves, build this world anew. What a blessing. And as we go forward together on that freedom road, let's stay true to the values that make us who we are: Canadians and Americans, allies and friends, now and forever.\nThank you very much. Merci beaucoup. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2016-06-29", "title": "Remarks to the Parliament in Ottawa, Canada"}
{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117669", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:02 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Apologize for being a little more tardy than usual today. I do not have any announcements at the top, so we can go straight to questions.\nKathleen, do you want start?\nQ: I just wanted to follow up a little on the news out of Andrews. Do you have any more detail on exactly what happened there this morning?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any additional information about what happened there. I'd refer you to the Department of Defense. Obviously, the President is always quite concerned about the safety of our men and women in uniform, and it certainly is important that they undertake drills to prepare for a wide range of scenarios. But for exactly what transpired today at JBA, I'd refer you to the Department of Defense.\nQ: Do you think that this sort of false alarm will become the kind of thing that's more common as people get a little more anxious or worried about these kinds of attacks?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, the President certainly believes in vigilance, and he believes that we should be vigilant about protecting our men and women in uniform. So I think there's always a risk of that. And it's important for there to be procedures in place so that authorities can communicate clearly with the community and with the public about what's transpiring. But what's inherent in these kinds of situations is that they're always chaotic.\nBut again, it's hard for me to speak to this particular incident just because I don't know much about what exactly transpired.\nQ: Okay. And then I just want to follow up on something he said yesterday at the press conference when he was asked about Brexit, and he was talking -- the President was talking about that he has genuine concerns about global concerns \"if, in fact, Brexit goes through\" and that freezes the possibility of investment in the UK. Does he thinks there's the possibility that Brexit won't happen?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think others have asked about this because somebody else on our team flagged this for me. I think this may be an issue of sentence construction. I think the President was talking about the combined effects of Brexit and the negative impact it has on the possibility of investment from the UK into Europe, and then the potential impact that that could have on the global economy. I think that's the point that the President was trying to make. And this is why it is important for officials in the UK and officials in the EU to set up a transparent and orderly process for Brexit to prevent the unnecessary complications of companies that are trying to maintain their business relationships through Europe and the UK, even as the governments of these locations are negotiating a withdrawal.\nSo the point is, the President reiterated in the context of the news conference why he believes it's so important for officials in the UK and the EU to establish an orderly, transparent process for Brexit. And there obviously will continue to be an enduring economic relationship between the UK and the EU. And the President doesn't want to see that relationship be any more disrupted than it already will by the process of the Brexit, because doing so would have an even more substantial impact on the global economy. And that's what the President is hoping that UK and EU officials will takes steps to protect again.\nQ: Does the White House have any reaction to Boris Johnson's announcement this morning?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't. I had difficulty keeping up with the candidates for President of the United States. My ability to keep track of the candidates for prime minister in the UK is even more limited. So I'll let him speak for himself. He seems to have no trouble doing that.\nJeff.\nQ: Josh, I just want to follow up on Kathleen's question. The President did use the word \"if\" twice in his response to the Brexit question yesterday. Does that -- just to be very clear, does he think there's a possibility that Brexit will not go through?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think the President's expectation is that UK officials have the best sense of what's happening, and UK officials have been pretty definitive about the finality of this decision. We've heard people like the current prime minister. We've heard the ambassador from the UK to the United States indicates that this was a decision that was made by the British people. And look, there's a lot invested in this election. It's not as if people didn't know that this election was occurring. There was a lot of attention and there was a healthy debate around it.\nSo ultimately it will be the responsibility of officials in the UK and officials in the EU to work together to determine what kind of economic relationship will exist between those two entities in the future. But that will be part of the negotiation of the UK leaving the EU. It's not going to end their economic relationship. As the President pointed out yesterday, I think it's about half of all of UK exports go to EU countries. So there's going to be a robust economic relationship there. It's just going to be different because the UK won't have the same kind of access to the common market that they have previously enjoyed.\nBut establishing that transition period and determining what the post-Brexit economic relationship looks like between the UK and the EU is important. And answering those questions as quickly as possible, but in a way that is orderly and transparent and predictable, will be critical to minimizing the negative impact on the global economy over the long term. And I think that's the other sort of key part of the President's answer here, is that he acknowledged that there's been obviously this volatility in the short term. But how this plays out over the long term will have an impact on the long-term prospects for the global economy.\nQ: And the President doesn't believe that it's possible to roll back that vote?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, I think the President believes that it's UK officials who should speak to this, and that's exactly what UK officials have said.\nQ: Does the White House have a reaction to Attorney General Lynch meeting with Bill Clinton at a time when DOJ is overseeing the probe into Secretary Clinton's email usage?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Jeff, I've obviously seen the reports about this, and the reports are driven by the answer that Attorney General Lynch herself gave to this question. Look, I think the bottom line is simply that both the President and the Attorney General understand how important it is for the Department of Justice to conduct investigations that are free of political interference. And that's been a bedrock principle of our criminal justice system in this country since our founding. The rule of law is paramount. And every American citizen should be held accountable to that rule of regardless of their political affiliation, regardless of who supports them politically, regardless of what their poll numbers say. And that is a principle the President believes is one that's worth protecting.\nThe reason that that's so important is it prevents erosion in the public confidence in our justice system. And this is a principle that Attorney General Lynch has dedicated her three decades in law enforcement to. She served as the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of New York. She has her own firsthand experience in conducting public corruption cases. She did that -- she protected the public trust by prosecuting individuals in both parties where there was evidence to indicate that they may have violated the public trust. This was what earned her strong bipartisan support when she was nominated for the job. And she has continued that work in the Attorney General's office in a variety of ways, including a recent announcement about Medicaid fraud, and obviously her efforts to root out corruption in one of the most influential international athletic organizations in the world.\nSo she certainly understands that investigations should be conducted free of political interference and consistent with the facts. Investigators should be guided by the facts and by evidence. And that's ultimately what should support their conclusions.\nAnd she's made clear that that's the expectation that she has for the way that this investigation should be conducted. The President has made clear that that certainly is consistent with his expectation about how this should be handled. And so I also think that's consistent with the American public's expectation about how this should be handled.\nQ: But given that, Josh, is the White House concerned about even just the appearance of political influence because of that meeting?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I'm not going to second-guess the way that this investigation should move forward or should be handled. Again --\nQ: I'm not asking about the investigation. I'm asking about the meeting between Attorney General Lynch and Bill Clinton.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, well, I wasn't there for the meeting, but the Attorney General was. She was asked a direct question about it, and she answered it. So again, I think that's consistent with everybody's expectations.\nQ: My question is about the appearance that that meeting created.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess what I'm suggesting is that she was asked about it directly, and she answered the question directly about what exactly transpired. And so she's spoken to this. I don't have any insight into that meeting. I also don't have any insight into the investigation.\nBut the President's view is that this is an investigation that should be conducted free of any sort of political interference. And the Attorney General has indicated that that's exactly her expectation, as well.\nMichelle.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Are you saying that the White House feels that it's fine that she had this meeting with Clinton? There's no problem with it?\nMR. EARNEST: I think what I'm saying is that the President believes that this principle of protecting any investigation from any sort of political interference is critically important. The rule of law is paramount. And people should be judged by the rule of law without regard to their partisan affiliation or their political standing. And that is a principle that's worth protecting. It's a principle that both the President and the Attorney General are committed to.\nQ: So you said that she answered questions about it. I don't know -- if there's any question of impropriety, who would stop at just asking the person who was involved in that, or if a mistake was made? So does the President have a question for her about this meeting?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I haven't spoken to the President about this particular matter. But again, the President's expectation is that this is an investigation that will be guided by the facts, not by politics.\nAnd we've been gratified to see other senior officials at the Department of Justice, including the Attorney General and the FBI Director, indicate that that's a priority for them, as well.\nQ: You just talked about how important it is for people to see things being handled properly so that there is no erosion in public confidence. But Democrats today -- some -- are also saying that just the optics of this, that they should have known better. You're talking about that potential of erosion in confidence. Doesn't this have the potential to do that, as well?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think -- again, I think what should give people confidence is the 30-year career that Attorney General Lynch has in keeping the public's trust, and making sure that she continues to be an effective advocate for the rule of law and for the fair administration of justice. She's done that throughout her career. She's done that in the Office of the Attorney General. And again, when it comes to appearances, she was asked very directly about the meeting. And she answered the question very directly. So for what impact that may have on the investigation, I'm just not going to comment on that because I don't want to be in a position of second-guessing an investigation that, quite frankly, I haven't been briefed on.\nQ: But we're not talking about the investigation itself. We're talking about --\nMR. EARNEST: I think that's the question that you're raising, is what potential impact does this optic have on the investigation. And again, I'm just --\nQ: Well, you raised --\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not going to talk about it.\nQ: You raise the appearance which could lead to an erosion of public confidence in that process. That doesn't mean the process itself is tainted. But you spoke to the erosion of public confidence. So if you seem satisfied with what the Attorney General said about the meeting, why will you not say that you're okay that that meeting happened, that you don't have a problem with that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what I'm saying is simply -- when I was talking about the erosion of the public trust, what I said is public trust would be eroded if it were -- if people were not making an effort to make clear that these investigations should not be influenced by politics.\nAnd the Attorney General, the Director of the FBI, other senior officials at the Department of Justice and the President of the United States have all indicated that the rule of law is paramount, that people should be subject to the rule of law without regard to their political standing or their political party or their poll numbers. That is a principle that we should all subscribe to. And the President, and the Attorney General, and the Director of the FBI all do.\nQ: But just to be clear, you're not saying then that the President and the White House is fine with this meeting having happened the way it did.\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I did not attend the meeting. But Attorney General Lynch did, and she's spoken directly to how the meeting came about and what was discussed.\nQ: We are talking optics here, though, not the content of that meeting. Just the optics themselves. I hate that word, but that's what everybody is talking about.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes.\nQ: So the appearance, you're okay with the fact that this meeting has raised that question? Are you concerned that that appearance has --\nMR. EARNEST: I'll let the Attorney General speak to her meetings. But what is paramount in the mind of the President is a commitment to the rule of law and a commitment to ensuring that justice is administered without regard to political affiliation or political standing.\nJustin.\nQ: I'm wondering after some of the information that's come out in the last 24 hours if you guys are any closer to making a determination on who's responsible for the terror attack in Turkey yesterday -- or two days ago.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, listen, this is something that the CIA Director has talked about. I don't have any new information to share or an additional updated intelligence assessment to offer from here.\nBut when Director Brennan was talking about this yesterday, he indicated that this attack \"bears the hallmarks of ISIL's depravity.\" I think that's an indication of what the intelligence community has assessed thus far. But I don't think that is -- obviously, that is not a definitive analysis.\nU.S. officials are certainly using all of the information and all the tools at our disposal to learn as much as we can about this particular situation -- useful information we will readily share with our NATO allies, the Turks, as they conduct this investigation.\nSo I don't mean to leave you with the impression that we're not interested in it. We are quite keenly interested in understanding exactly what happened. But this is an investigation that's being led by the Turks. And we stand with them as they conduct this investigation and take the steps that are necessary to safeguard their country and their citizens.\nQ: Given that, and given that the Turks I think have leaned even harder into the possibility that ISIS is responsible for this, I'm wondering if in the conversation between Presidents Obama and Erdogan, if there was any signal from the Turks that they were going to intensify their efforts against ISIS. It's obviously been a point of some tension between the two Presidents. So I'm wondering if you're expecting sort of additional actions by Turkey.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have any additional actions to preview or additional details from the call to share. What I will just reiterate is how important a role the Turks have played in our counter-ISIL coalition. And that is everything from taking steps to more effectively close their border with Syria, to giving U.S. and coalition military pilots access to military installations inside of Turkey that makes our military operations against ISIL in Syria more efficient and more effective. So Turkey has played an important role. They're a valuable member of our counter-ISIL coalition.\nYou'll recall that it wasn't that long ago that all of you were asking me rather pointed questions about why Turkey wasn't more involved in our efforts against ISIL, and since that time we have seen the Turks become more active, more cooperative, and more effective in supporting our efforts to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\nQ: If I could turn to the campaign, obviously we heard the announcement yesterday that the President is going down to North Carolina. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the significance of North Carolina as the first stop, and specifically, I guess, if it's an indication that the President, Hillary Clinton, and Democrats are now kind of playing offense instead of defense. She's going to a state that he won once but is traditionally a Republican state, versus Wisconsin, which is kind of a Democratic stronghold.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, for the electoral strategy of the campaign, I'd refer you to the Clinton operation. They can obviously speak to this in much more detail than I can. I think there are some relevant facts that I'm happy to point out, which is that the President in 2008 did win the state of North Carolina. He was the first Democrat in some time to do so. Obviously, the President decided to hold the Democratic Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina in 2012 when he was running for reelection. And it was an indication of the kind of political support that the President retains in that state. So he obviously is proud of all that support. But how this factors into Secretary Clinton's campaign strategy, I'd refer you to her operation.\nQ: And I just wanted to parse one more bit of the President's remarks yesterday when he was talking about politicians, it was during this sort of sermon on populism.\nMR. EARNEST: The self-described rant.\nQ: Yes. And he said some of the policies or positions that have been forwarded, presumably by Donald Trump, or Republicans, weren't nativism or xenophobia. He said, it wasn't populism but nativism, xenophobia or worse. And I'm wondering what that worse is? I think pretty obviously it is racism. And so if the President believes that these policies are racist, why he won't just say that, or if he will say that he believes Donald Trump's policies are racist.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, I think the President's words speak pretty clearly for themselves. So I don't think I'll elaborate on them at great length. The President also noted that this kind of rhetoric was rather cynical.\nAnd the reason he used that word is that the President believes that the policies that are being pursued by this administration are the ones that are most effective in advancing the interests of middle-class families across the country. And the President spoke at this at some length, as well, in terms of our efforts to regulate Wall Street, to reform the health care system to ensure that more Americans would have access to quality, affordable health insurance.\nThese are all policy decisions that the President made with middle-class families and those families that are trying to get into the middle class in mind. He made these decisions and set these as priorities with the American people in mind, even though those kinds of steps have been regarded with some controversy by those at the top, by those with the most influence in Washington, D.C., by those with the most influence on Wall Street. You might even call them the elite.\nThat's why the President believes it's cynical to suggest that opposing those kinds of policies is somehow in the best interest of the American people. It's not. And so for somebody who ran on a campaign platform that was rooted in hope, labeling something cynical I think should be viewed as a pretty harsh criticism.\nQ: Sure. Is the implication here that they're cynical for forwarding policies that would help elites? Or is what you're really saying, the use of racist language, the President believes -- the President believes that Donald Trump is using racist language cynically for electoral gain, but is not perhaps actually racist? I'm trying to --\nMR. EARNEST: The cynicism -- what I'm trying to say is the cynicism is rooted in the idea that there are people who have opposed for political reasons policies that this administration has put forward that have obviously benefitted the American people. Twenty million Americans -- 20 million more Americans have gotten access to health insurance coverage after the Affordable Care Act went into effect. Our economy has grown significantly and become more stable after Wall Street reform went into effect. These are just two examples. There are many others. The President cited the auto industry yesterday as another example of this.\nAgain, these are all policies that were opposed for partisan reason by Republicans even though they've had significant and well-documented benefits for the American people. So for partisan reasons to oppose those policies and put forward alternatives -- Republicans haven't really put forward alternatives -- but to say that they're opposed to those policies because they're populist is cynical. It's also just not true.\nAnd I think that is the point that the President is making. There are plenty of other people who have raised concerns about what potentially -- what others have described as racially tinged remarks on the campaign trail. Those are other people's words. That's not a word that the President chose. So I think the President chose his words, as you noted, quite carefully.\nJordan.\nQ: One more on the President's rant yesterday. He named himself as a populist. He named Bernie Sanders as a populist. He did not name Secretary Clinton as a populist. Does he believe that Secretary Clinton is a populist? And I'm wondering why her name was left out of there.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the point is -- I think the reason -- the point that the President was trying to make is, again, when it comes to a fair evaluation of the policies championed by this administration and the impact they've had on the American people, I think the President is suggesting that people who are looking to apply the populism label could fairly apply it to the administration based on the fact these are policies that benefit the American people even though they were harshly criticized by the elite. That's a pretty fair analysis of what's been happening.\nAnd the point is, the reason that the President cited Senator Sanders is there are several instances or policy areas where Senator Sanders recommends going even farther. That is different than the arguments that are made by some Republicans to go in the opposite direction. That's why the President believes it's cynical for those who want to go in the opposite direction to describe themselves as populist, or to have impartial arbiters use a shorthand for their criticism of the President as populist criticism. It's just inaccurate. And I think that is the broader point.\nWhen it comes to Secretary Clinton, I'll let her speak for herself to describe her own philosophy. But again, my guess is, given the fact that she has been an outspoken advocate for building on the progress that our country has enjoyed under President Obama's leadership, that you could probably fairly apply that label to her, too. But that's something that her team should speak to.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, was that rant -- self-described rant -- totally spontaneous? Or has he been waiting for an opportunity to vent on the issue of populism?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Mark, I'll just tell you what I noticed when I was there yesterday, is I noticed at one point during the news conference, the President did take out his pen and start making some notes to himself while the other leaders were talking. And I assume that's where he was -- something had prompted him to think about this.\nAnd so, yes, this was something that the President delivered extemporaneously. I don't think this is the first time the President had thought about it, but something in the context of the discussion at the news conference had returned him to this thinking. And he clearly had jotted down some notes in his book and took advantage of the opportunity at the end of the news conference to share his thoughts.\nQ: Do you believe there might be more rants in the pipeline? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Considering we've got another six and a half months to go before the end of the presidency, I think it's likely we're all going to get to enjoy at least one more.\nQ: He indicated that he feels liberated at this point in his presidency to say things that he might not have been willing to say four years earlier. Is that right?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, I think there is a certain amount of freedom that politicians enjoy when they're not on the ballot. But look, I also think that what's true is the President has a well-earned reputation for being pretty blunt and candid and speaking his mind. And he's got his own style for doing so that's dismissed by some of his critics as professorial. But I think there are a lot of other people who actually find that kind of argument to be pretty compelling and persuasive.\nBut that's something the President has done throughout his presidency. And as somebody who chronicles the metrics of the presidency as carefully as you, my guess is there are probably a number of things -- a number of ticks in the spreadsheet under the rant column, if you decided to create one.\nQ: He'll have to start his new log. (Laughter.)\nWhat can you tell us about plans for signing the Puerto Rico bill? Will there be a signing ceremony when you get it?\nMR. EARNEST: As you saw from the statement that we put out last night, we're obviously pleased that the Senate has finally completed the bipartisan effort to give Puerto Rican officials the authority to deal with their significant financial problems.\nThis is important because this is going to have a direct impact on the livelihood of the more than 3 million Americans who live in Puerto Rico. There is a looming deadline tomorrow, so I would anticipate that the President will sign this piece of legislation into law shortly after we receive it. I don't know if that will allow us time to organize a signing ceremony. But we'll keep you posted, and we'll let you know as soon as the President has signed it.\nQ: What is he doing all day today?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President has got a number of internal meetings today. His schedule is a little lighter today because his schedule yesterday, frankly, was so jam-packed.\nQ: What do you think of the chants of \"four more years\" in a foreign parliament?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, I noticed that, too.\nQ: Did he notice?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, I'm sure that he did. From the floor, I was unable to see his reaction. I didn't talk to him about it last night on the way back. But I'm not aware of any plans the President has to run for Prime Minister of Canada.\nQ: Or retire there?\nMR. EARNEST: Or retire there. I think he probably would -- as lovely as Ottawa was yesterday, I think the President would prefer a warmer climate.\nAlex.\nQ: Yesterday, the President pushed back when reporters asked him to weigh in on politics, and asked President Nieto and Prime Minister Trudeau. And he said that it wasn't -- when he's abroad, it's not his job to weigh in on domestic politics. But the President himself gave what you said was that self-described rant, and then during his parliament -- speech to parliament, he talked about the need not to rebuild walls. Didn't the President himself bring American politics into the fore in Canada?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I think -- the context in which a lot of these questions were asked yesterday were about a broader question about the sentiment of the electorate -- not in just the United States, but around the world. And I think there are questions that have been raised about what does the electoral climate in the UK around the Brexit vote say about popular sentiment in the United States, and voter sentiment in the United States. That's an entirely legitimate question.\nYes, it has an impact on the 2016 election, but it also has a direct impact on American values and the kinds of things that the President has been fighting for, for the last seven and a half years that he's been in the White House.\nSo, again, I think it's impossible to separate the two, I guess is my point. So while there might be some who would say, well, geez, the President was taking on the arguments of the 2016 election, but what's also true is the President was taking on arguments that have been raised about the core American values that this President deeply believes in.\nQ: And I don't think that the President got a chance to answer Ms. Rampton's question yesterday about will the President next week, when he's campaigning, or along the cycle with Secretary Clinton -- will he offer a full-throated endorsement of TPP to her supporters. Is there any chance that he's willing to pitch the TPP directly to Secretary Clinton's supporters?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I don't have an update on the remarks at this point, and I certainly wouldn't rule out that the President will make a forceful case for the shared economic vision that's advocated not just by President Obama but by Democrats across the country, including Secretary Clinton. I don't think the President is going to make the case that Secretary Clinton and he agree on every single issue, but I do think he'll make a pretty persuasive case about how they have spent their careers fighting for the same values and the same priorities. The President has always put those American families that are in the middle class and fighting to get in the middle class at the center of his domestic policymaking agenda, and Secretary Clinton does the same thing.\nIt doesn't mean they agree on every issue. But when it comes to their values and priorities that are deeply held, they've got a lot in common. And I think that will be the focal point of the President's remarks next week.\nQ: The TPP is emerging as a pretty big division in the Democratic Party between President Obama, and a big brunt of especially Senator Sanders. And I'm wondering, will the President -- if the Democratic platform is passed with language explicitly opposing TPP, would that change the President's plans at all and his attendance at the convention or his plans to speak there?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, you're asking a hypothetical because the platform hasn't been finalized yet. But I don't anticipate at this point any changes to the President's plan to participate in the Democratic convention.\nRon.\nQ: On the attack in Istanbul, you said the U.S. isn't sure whether this was ISIS or not. Where is the ambiguity and the uncertainty about that at this point?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what I'm relaying, Ron, is just that there's an intelligence assessment that's still being conducted. We're trying to learn as much as we can about what exactly happened and the individuals who were responsible for this terrible terrorist incident. I just don't have a lot of insight to share about what we know so far.\nQ: And in the interim, where there's this uncertainty, is it safe to say that there's not been an American -- U.S. response to what's happened directed at ISIS? Nothing has changed on the battlefield, if you will, out there? Or has something changed on the battlefield out there?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess that does provide a pretty good opportunity to start talking about what is happening on the battlefield.\nQ: No, no, I mean, just in the last 48 hours or so since this attack happened. Again, if you're in this process of still trying to evaluate what happened, has there been something that has -- has there been a response or not?\nMR. EARNEST: I think we have seen tremendous progress that the United States and our coalition partners are making against ISIL in Iraq and in Syria. And there was the announcement earlier this week by the Iraqi central government that they had succeeded in driving ISIL fighters out of Fallujah. This was a large priority of the coalition, in part because of its proximity to Baghdad. And this is an operation that was more successful and went more swiftly than I think most experts had predicted.\nQ: But all that is pre-Istanbul.\nMR. EARNEST: Again, this has been a long -- is a long-planned effort, and the success was announced on Monday. And then there were -- the other thing that has happened as Iraqi security forces were working to clear Fallujah, the United States and our coalition partners identified a large convoy of ISIL vehicles in Anbar who appeared to have recently left Fallujah, and allowed the United States and our coalition partners to carry out strikes against those vehicles that resulted in -- we're talking about two different convoys, but a total of more than 150 vehicles being destroyed.\nSo that, I think, is a pretty substantial indication of the kind of pressure that ISIL is under, and the success that we're having in developing targets and acting against them in short order in a way that is having a material positive impact on the fight against ISIL on the battlefield.\nQ: What about the reports that the United States and the Russians are going to cooperate more deeply, militarily in Syria, specifically? Is that true?\nMR. EARNEST: I think what has been true for a long time, Ron -- and this was actually even true before the Russian military buildup in Syria last fall -- is that we talked a lot about how there was an opportunity for Russia to more effectively work with the United States and our 65 coalition partners to go after ISIL and to go after extremists in Syria. That's been true from the very beginning. The reason that that opportunity has not been capitalized on is that Russia has been far more focused on using their military might to prop up Assad than to actually go after extremists. And we've said all along that there is an internal contradiction in the Russian strategy. They say, they claim that they're quite concerned about extremists inside of Syria, but the steps that they're taking to prop up the Assad regime and make a political transition more difficult makes it harder for us to deal with the extremist threat inside of Syria.\nQ: So is there now -- is something different now? Is there an agreement between the United States and Russia to cooperate militarily in Syria?\nMR. EARNEST: We have not seen the Russians -- and again, I've been saying this for more than a year, too -- we have not seen the Russians demonstrate a commitment to using their military might against ISIL. Instead, they've been much more focused on propping up the Assad regime. And that is a problem for a variety of reasons mostly because continuing to prop up the Assad regime makes it more difficult for the world to address the root cause of this extremist problem.\nSo they've got this internal contradiction in their strategy that they have been unable to explain or resolve for almost a year now.\nQ: So nothing has changed. I understand the background. But you're familiar with these reports that there's some sort of agreement that's been reached. You're familiar with that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I've seen -- I saw one report in the Post this morning that alluded to all of this. And what I'm saying is that I don't have details about sort of the behind-the-scenes diplomacy that is part of our open line of communication with the Russians. But what hasn't changed is our basic approach to this situation, which is we would welcome a Russian commitment to working more closely with the coalition to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. I think the 65 members of our counter-ISIL coalition would welcome that kind of participation as well. The problem has been that Russia is much more interested in propping up Assad than they are in going after ISIL. And until that changes, we've said it's hard to imagine coordinating out military efforts.\nNow, what we have been doing thus far is we have been de-conflicting our efforts to provide for the safety of our military pilots primarily operating over Syria. But what has prevented us from being able to more effectively coordinate militarily is that what the Russians have been militarily doing is propping up Assad and not going after ISIL.\nQ: There was a Navy investigation released on the report involving the Iranian military and the Navy sailors. It seemed to be -- well, it was critical of the Americans, and some saying they weren't prepared, there were a litany of errors, there were a number of officers and others disciplined. What's the White House reaction to that? The narrative coming out of that at the time seemed much more positive and supportive of the actions of the U.S. military in that context.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the immediate aftermath of this incident was the relief that we expressed about the safe return of our sailors. But what the Navy has said since that day back in January is that they were going to conduct an investigation to determine what exactly had happened. They briefed the results of that investigation earlier today, and I think there were a number of Navy personnel who were reprimanded for the way that they -- for their role in the incident.\nBut for the details of all that, I'd refer you to the Navy. I haven't look carefully at the investigation myself.\nQ: I guess one of the concerns of it, it seemed -- the investigation -- as I read it quickly before we all gathered here -- was that it seemed to suggest that they were not prepared, that there was something systemic that wasn't as it should be for them to deal with the situation like that when they found themselves in it. It would suggest training, leadership, those sort of structural things, not necessarily what these individuals may or may not have done.\nMR. EARNEST: Look, for any recommendations that the Navy has, I'm sure that they will be carefully considered by policymakers at the Department of Defense to make sure that something like this doesn't happen again. But I'm just not aware of the substance of any recommendations they may have made.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Can you just give a little bit more information about the Iraqi -- the airstrikes that knocked out a number of foreign fighters? A big number. And I'm just curious what you know about it. Did the President order that particular strike? And how soon was he advised?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, this is what I was alluding to with Ron. My understanding about the way this worked is that ISIL -- I'm sorry, Iraqi security forces have been working over the last several days to definitively clear Fallujah. The Iraqis announced on Monday that they had retaken the city, and there was just an effort to complete the -- to essentially assure that all ISIL elements had been rooted out of that city.\nAnd what occurred last night is that coalition military pilots detected the movement of two unusually large convoys moving away from the general direction of Fallujah through the desert of Anbar Province. And we've talked before about how early on in this campaign we recognized that ISIL had changed tactics. ISIL had originally been showing -- we saw footage of ISIL moving in large convoys across Iraq as they were taking large territory there back in the summer of 2014. As soon as U.S. military pilots got involved, they were taking opportunistic strikes against those convoys. ISIL, in response, changed their tactics and started moving in much smaller numbers to present less of a target to coalition military pilots.\nWhat happened last night is that U.S. coalition pilots spotted two large convoys, and they took strikes against them. And those strikes resulted, in the case of one convoy, of the destruction of more than 100 vehicles. In the other convoy that was identified, more than 50 vehicles were destroyed. And I think what this underscores is the success that the United States and our coalition partners are having in integrating our intelligence and our military capabilities. Being able to quickly spot these targets, identify them, and take action against them is, frankly, harder than I just made it sound. But it's something that now is clearly happening quite effectively in a way that is having a significant impact on ISIL.\nI think the other thing that's true is that ISIL is certainly feeling under more pressure. And that has been an important part of our strategy, which is to apply pressure to ISIL elements in a variety of different places simultaneously. And that's making it harder for ISIL to defend themselves. And this is an example of why our efforts to expand the capacity of Iraqi security forces to make sure that they're well integrated with coalition military pilots, that we can apply -- we want to make sure we can apply maximum pressure against ISIL targets. And we saw the benefits to that approach last night in a way that has a tangible, negative impact on ISIL's ability to continue to fight this fight.\nQ: For the success against ISIL, the Taliban seems to be enjoying a bit of a resurgence. Can you tell me about the attack on the cadets in Afghanistan there, what you know about that?\nMR. EARNEST: I got a briefing on that earlier today. My understanding is that extremists in Afghanistan did target some cadets from the Afghan security forces. There were significant casualties associated with that -- dozens of casualties. I'd refer you to the Afghans for a more specific assessment.\nAnd, look, this is I think an indication of something that we have long acknowledged, which is that security situation in Afghanistan is quite difficult, particularly in the fighting season. But what is true, and what continues to be true, is that the Afghan forces are showing great determination and resilience, even in the face of some setbacks, like the one that you just described. And what is important is the continued commitment of the United States and NATO and other international contributors to the Afghan government and the Afghan security forces.\nThe United States and our coalition partners have good partners in the Afghan government. And it's important that we continue to support them both militarily and economically as they seek to both rebuild the institutions of that country but also strengthen the security forces in that country.\nQ: A bit of housekeeping. The DNI review of the 9/11 Commission's 28 pages, we were understanding that maybe by the end of June they would finally have something that the American people can take a look at. Have you gotten an update on what's happening with that? And has the President, as yet -- because the last time you and I spoke, you said you didn't believe he had had a chance to read those 28 pages. Has that changed at all? And can you give me an update?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, this is a timely reminder. It is June 30th, after all. And the Director of the DNI did indicate that he expected that they would have the results of this review concluded by the end of June. I haven't gotten an updated assessment about the timeline, so you might check with his office to see where things stand. And I don't know that the President has been briefed at this point on the final conclusions of the DNI. But the President, while not having read the 28 pages, is aware of their contents and he has been briefed on the contents of those pages. I don't know that he's necessarily been briefed about what the DNI has concluded is appropriate for release.\nQ: Last, I wanted to follow up on pretty much everybody's question about optics. Would you at least acknowledge that if you have on the one hand a candidate, a former colleague whom you've endorsed -- we're talking about Secretary Clinton; the President has endorsed her -- and his appointed Attorney General who is having social calls with her husband, the President, can you understand where people might feel like not only does it not look good, it makes them worried about the fact that this is going to be an open, transparent and impartial process as the investigations continue into her conduct regarding the server?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, let me try to answer your question this way. I think the question you're asking is entirely legitimate, and I think the question that was asked of Attorney General Lynch was entirely legitimate. That's why I think it was appropriate for her to give the direct answer that she did. And I think it was also important for her to continue to demonstrate her commitment to a principle that she has stood up for in her three decades in public service, and that is the primacy of the rule of law. The rule of law is most important.\nWe're all subject to it in the same way, without regard to our political affiliation or our partisan affiliation, without regard to who supports us politically or who opposes us politically. We're all subject to the rule of law in the same way. And it's important that investigations are conducted consistent with that principle in mind. These kinds of investigations should be conducted in a way that investigators simply follow the facts, they follow the evidence, and they use that to form conclusions.\nAnd I guess the one part of your question that I might quibble with a little bit is, I don't think anybody is making the case that this kind of investigation is transparent right now, but what investigators do have a responsibility to do is, once they have conducted an investigation and reached a conclusion, that there is some explanation required in terms of how they reached that conclusion. But it's important that that conclusion not be rooted in political preference, but just be rooted in the facts and the evidence and what the law requires.\nThat's the way to ensure the fair administration of justice. That's something that the Attorney General has been committed to as a career prosecutor throughout her career. That's something that she's been committed to as the Attorney General. I know it's something that the FBI Director and all those who report to Director Comey and Attorney General Lynch are committed to. That's certainly consistent with the President's expectations about how this would be handled. It's also consistent with the expectations of the American people in terms of how this should be handled.\nQ: So we shouldn't read into the sort of social hanging out, if you will, between the Attorney General and the former President that there's nothing there and that there's nothing to worry about? Should we read that much into this sort of gathering?\nMR. EARNEST: I think it is entirely appropriate for journalists like you to ask the Attorney General what she talked about. And she answered that question directly, on the record, as soon as it was asked.\nQ: Grandkids.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, and whatever else. So, look, I think that's an appropriate question to ask, and I think it was appropriate for the Attorney General to answer it. But what is clear is the President's view is that no one is above the law, and everybody should be subject to the law in the same way without regard to their political affiliation or who's happened to endorse them.\nQ: Library update, by chance? There was some reporting that there might be a library announcement on location specifics today.\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any of those details. The foundation that the President and First Lady have created will handle any announcements that they have to make on that matter.\nPam.\nQ: Thanks. Could I just ask something about Andrews again? You mentioned the importance of training and vigilance on military bases. But does it make any sense to hold an active shooter drill so soon after a major terrorist attack when people might be on edge anyway, and when the Vice President is scheduled to be on the base?\nMR. EARNEST: Pam, I just don't know the details of the way that these kinds of drills are scheduled, so I'd refer you to the Department of Defense for that. But, look, the President believes that it's important to conduct drills and to do training that ensures the safety of our men and women in uniform.\nQ: And on gun control, Speaker Ryan says that he's going to hold a vote on a bill to prevent suspected terrorists from buying guns. Does that give you hope that something like that might be able to pass?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the details here are rather important. We saw claims from people like Senator Cornyn that the legislation that he had put forward would address the questions that many Americans have raised about the wisdom of allowing people who are on the no-fly list to buy a gun. So I think I'd want to see the details before I commented on it. But, look, the President has made this a priority. We've certainly been pleased to see congressional Democrats make it a priority. The President's view is a simple one: If it's too dangerous for you to board a plane, it should be too dangerous for you to buy a gun. And that, I think, is a pretty common-sense notion and is something that we believe shouldn't just get a vote, it should pass and be sent to the President's desk so that he can sign it into law.\nQ: Do you think public pressure is now kind of moving in that direction on members of Congress?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I hope so. There's ample public evidence to indicate that a strong majority of Americans supports these kinds of common-sense steps. They support these common-sense steps because they believe that it's likely to make the country a little bit safer and it doesn't undermine the constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans.\nSo it's a pretty common-sense proposition. I'm not surprised to see that it's got strong public support across the country. Not just a majority of Democrats, but according to some polls, even a majority of Republicans and a majority of gun owners support that kind of common-sense approach to making our communities a little safer from gun violence.\nSo, again, we'll see the details of what the House of Representatives is willing to consider, but this is a pretty common-sense notion and it's something that Congress should act on soon.\nGregory.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Back in March, Lisa Monaco promised a report on civilian casualties by U.S. airstrikes in the coming weeks. That was more than 16 weeks ago. Can you give us any transparency on what's holding up that transparency? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously what the national security team and the intelligence community is attempting to do is to break some old habits, and bringing transparency to this element of our national security strategy and our counterterrorism strategy is difficult. But I can tell you that that work is ongoing and has been ever since -- frankly, even before -- Ms. Monaco gave the speech that you're referring to. That work is ongoing, and I would anticipate that we'll have some additional information about that pretty soon.\nQ: Will there be just a report on casualties, or do you expect the President to issue any executive orders, presidential policy directives, and sort of executive action clarifying the rules of engagement that limits civilian casualties?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any previews of the announcement at this point, but stay tuned.\nQ: Is it fair to say both on this report but also with any potential executive orders, that the President is in these last few months of his -- the President has been trying to lock in the default policy choices for his successor? For a Democrat, that means maybe making some tough choices and getting them off of her plate before she comes in. Or for a Republican, to sort of lock in a policy that a Republican President would have to very conspicuously and deliberately rescind.\nAnd I'm thinking specifically if there was an atrocities executive order, a Global Entrepreneurship executive order, all of which are things that this President has been doing all along. But issuing these kinds of things, executive actions, so late in his presidency -- are they an attempt to sort of set the plate for the next President?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, I think it's hard to paint with that broad of a brush. When it comes to our Cuba policy, for example, we've made no bones about the fact that we are seeking to lock in that change in approach toward Cuba. And so I think the description that you have applied would fit with what we're trying to do in Cuba. In other situations, though, the situations that you're describing are just the culmination of years of work and --\nQ: But going back to the atrocities executive order, the President already issued less formal guidance and has been operating under that system since the early days of his presidency. Why formalize that as an executive order unless it's to bind his successor?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, again, I also think it's possible to do both. And I haven't read up lately on the executive actions around the atrocities report. But obviously the President has made that kind of work a priority throughout his tenure as President. And if there is an opportunity for us to routinize that approach to dealing with these complicated issues, the President believes the country would benefit from that. After all, because that routinized approach didn't exist when President Obama took office, it required a lot of work to figure out how to most effectively deal with this policy challenge and be transparent about it.\nAnd so by establishing a procedure and a clearly delineated routine for implementing the strategy, yeah, I do think it makes it harder for somebody to undo, but it also means that kind of work continues to get the regular attention that the President believes that it deserves. But I think ultimately that's the goal that we have in mind in trying to complete this important work before the President leaves office.\nGeorge. Twelve wins in a row for your Indians, George. Don't think I haven't been paying attention. (Laughter.) Much to my dismay.\nQ: They haven't lost since the Cavaliers won.\nMR. EARNEST: That's what I keep hearing.\nQ: Did I notice that Cleveland had won -- anyway -- (laughter) -- I want to follow on your answer earlier about trade. The President gave a very vigorous defense of trade agreements in Ottawa. But with TPP and NAFTA and all trade agreements so under assault, are we going to be hearing a lot more of this from him in the coming weeks?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what you will continue to hear from the President is a commitment to a set of policies that embraces the opportunities that lie ahead for the United States. And the President believes that that future is enhanced when we more effectively engage with the international community. That certainly is true when it comes to trade agreements. And the President described that rather colorfully yesterday in terms of the impact that shutting off all trade would have on our country's economy.\nThe President talked about the decimating impact that would have on the auto industry, for example. That's essentially a global supply chain. And to shut off the United States from the global supply chain would have devastating economic consequences for the United States.\nBut I think, George, it doesn't just apply to trade policy. There's a lot of work that we can achieve when we're willing to coordinate with other countries. I think some of the climate announcements that were made in the context of yesterday's summit are a very good example of that. The United States cannot solve the problem of climate change alone. And in fact, this was actually the principal line of criticism from those who were most skeptical of our approach to climate change. Right? Remember there was this sense that why would the United States take all these steps to pursue a low-carbon economy if a country like China that's the largest emitter is not going to make the same kind of commitments?\nSo it's only by engaging China and seeking common ground with them, and reaching those kinds of commitments in concert with them can we collectively address a challenge that has significant consequences for the planet.\nI think the same is true -- let me just give you one example, and I'll keep it quick -- which is just the effort to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. That effort would not have been successful had the United States not been able to effectively work not just with our P5+1 partners, but with countries around the world -- like Japan and South Korea and India -- to help us implement those sanctions. By implementing those sanctions against Iran we applied substantial pressure to their economy in a way that compelled them to come to the negotiating table and make specific commitments about not pursuing nuclear weapons that we can now verify, and essentially the United States and the rest of the world is safer because we now know that Iran will not be able to acquire nuclear weapons.\nThat was work that was only successful because of our ability to work effectively with the rest of the international community. And if we were trying to shut ourselves off from the international community we would not have enjoyed that success.\nQ: If I could stick with trade for a second.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay.\nQ: On trade agreements -- does he feel lonely out there arguing for trade agreements? There aren't many voices being raised domestically on his side.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think some of that is a consequence of the current political climate. But I don't think the President has shied away at all from any opportunity that he has to make the case about how important it is for the United States, both in terms of our economy but also in terms of our national security team, when it comes to pursuing an agreement like the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\nSo I'm not going to stand up here and make any character judgments. I'm just saying that the President has the courage of his convictions when it comes to articulating a coherent strategy for making sure the United States can leverage our advantages in a way that benefits not just this generation of middle-class Americans, but future generations of working Americans.\nWe've got a lot of built-in advantages in this country. We've got the best colleges and universities. We've got the most -- we've got a climate that rewards innovation and new ideas. We've got a society where good ideas can rise to the top. And that gives us a competitive advantage over just about the rest of the world. We've also got a healthy, well-developed market for those products here in the United States.\nAll of that combines to the give the United States a significant competitive advantage. Why wouldn't we try to press that advantage by entering into agreements with other countries to get them to raise their environmental standards, raise their labor standards, protect intellectual property, and give the United States better access to the markets in other countries so that we can actually have a chance to compete on a more level playing field.\nRight now you hear people who are opponents of the TPP say that globalization has had a terrible impact on workers across America. The President is willing to acknowledge, and has on many occasions, that there are Americans -- even American communities -- that have been negatively affected by globalization. That's not the question.\nThe question is: What are you going to do about it? The President is the one who has put forward a coherent strategy that makes sense, that leverages our advantages, maximizes our benefits, and creates additional opportunities for American businesses and American workers to succeed.\nOpponents of these trade deals haven't. They haven't put forward a coherent strategy. And to the extent that they have, that coherent strategy is one that would only promise economic ruin in the United States by attempting to sever the global supply chain.\nQ: Last question. Is it fair to say that the President has evolved or grown on this issue since the 2007 debate where he called for reopening NAFTA?\nMR. EARNEST: Actually, George, I would say that the President is making good on that promise. That's exactly what the TPP does -- that Canada and Mexico are part of the TPP. And what the TPP does is that it raises labor and environmental standards and makes them enforceable in a way that they were not enforceable in NAFTA.\nSo I don't think the President has evolved on this promise; the President has made good on this promise, and in some ways has succeeded even more than he thought he would be able to.\nChristi.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. The Pentagon is lifting its ban on allowing transgender men and women to serve openly in the military. Did the President weigh in on that decision? Can you enlighten us a little bit about how he participates in conversations like that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Christi, this is something that the Department of Defense is supposed to announce this afternoon. So I don't know if they've done that while I'm up here. Presumably they have if you're discussing it.\nWhat I can say about this is that what Secretary Carter announced today was the result of a review that was conducted at the Department of Defense. In announcing that review, Secretary Carter indicated his belief that every American who is appropriately qualified to do so should be able to serve their country in the military, and that by having that kind of approach, our country is safer and our military is stronger. The President agrees with that general approach.\nAs it relates to the specific policy that was announced today, again, that's a policy that was formulated by the Department of Defense. So I haven't seen it yet. But I'll get a chance to take a look at it before the end of the day today. And we can either discuss at the end of today or in tomorrow's briefing.\nQ: Could you also update us on the President's deliberations about troop levels in Afghanistan?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have an update at this point. The Department of Defense, including the President's -- including our military commanders on the ground in Afghanistan have been conducting a review. And the last I heard, which is I guess a week or so ago, is that the conclusions of that review have not been presented to the President at this point.\nBut the President will carefully consider not just the judgement of his military commanders on the ground, but also the other members of his national security as he continues to evaluate our strategy in Afghanistan.\nQ: Do you think that's something that he might reach a conclusion on or make a public announcement about before he meets with NATO leaders?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any announcements to foreshadow at this point, but if there is a policy change to announce, we'll make sure that all of you are in the loop.\nJohn Bennett.\nQ: Senators Reid and Schumer mentioned a meeting today with Denis McDonough, Secretary Burwell and Donovan from OMB. Do you have anything on that meeting? And was Zika on the agenda today?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of the details of that meeting, but let me go ask about it and see if I can get you an answer.\nQ: Okay. Back to trade. Have you heard the President express any concerns that him talking about it as regularly as he has recently could be politically -- could politically hinder Secretary Clinton and other Democratic candidates?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I don't think the President is worried about that. Obviously, he's got a different position on this issue than the Democratic nominee. I think we've all been pretty blunt about that. But look, the reason the President was talking about it yesterday is two of our most important trading partners were attending the summit alongside the President of the United States. So that's why he was discussing it yesterday. And I think it served as a useful backdrop for illustrating how important it is to our country's economy and to our country's national security.\nFred, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. A separate matter regarding transgender issues. The National Park Service has said that restrooms on public lands will be open based on gender identity. And I wanted to see -- will that also be the policy for restrooms in all federal buildings? Will that be sort of consistent with the directive to the public schools that was issued in May?\nMR. EARNEST: Fred, I have to admit that I can't speak to the bathroom policy of the federal government. But I think you should check with individual agencies. I can confirm for you that that's the policy here at the White House.\nQ: It is the policy?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes.\nThanks, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 2:20 P.M.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118065", "text": "Today the White House is announcing a Call to Action for the U.S. private sector to stand with the Administration and make new, measurable and significant commitments that will have a durable impact on refugees residing in countries on the frontlines of the global refugee crisis and in countries of resettlement, like the United States. The fifteen founding companies, all of whom have taken significant action to-date to assist the refugee crisis, have committed to standing with refugees, including: Accenture, Airbnb, Chobani, Coursera, Goldman Sachs, Google, HP, IBM, JPMorgan Chase & Co., LinkedIn, Microsoft, Mastercard, UPS, TripAdvisor, and Western Union.\nThere are more than 65 million displaced people in the world today, the highest number on record since the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) began collecting statistics. More than 21 million of these people have crossed international borders in search of safety and are registered as refugees. The despair that drives these people to flee their homes is heartbreaking, but their resilience is awe-inspiring. Refugees are a valuable, untapped resource and, if given the opportunity, can thrive and contribute wherever they reside.\nIn addition to contributing billions of dollars to meet the immediate humanitarian need of displaced people and planning to welcome 85,000 refugees this year, the United States is rallying other countries to step up their efforts. On September 20, President Obama will host the Leaders' Summit on Refugees at the UN for countries that have made new and significant commitments to increase support for UN humanitarian appeals; create greater opportunities for legal resettlement; and enact policies that allow refugees to be self-reliant.\nA crisis of this scale, however, requires more than government action. For this reason, in the months leading up to the Leaders' Summit, President Obama is challenging the U.S. private sector to draw on its unique expertise, resources and entrepreneurial spirit to help refugees regain control over their lives and integrate into their new communities. The Administration will convene a cross-section of private sector leaders with new pledges in response to the Call to Action at a high-level meeting that will take place alongside the Leaders' Summit.\nCall to Action Impact Areas\nWhile there are innumerable ways in which the private sector can stand with refugees, the Call to Action is principally focused on generating new commitments in three \"impact areas\" that align with the Leaders' Summit's goals:\nØ Education - Facilitating refugee children and young adults' education by ensuring that refugee students can access schools of all levels and creating quality long-distance learning platforms and programs.\nØ Employment - Increasing employment opportunities for refugees, supporting refugee entrepreneurship, and assisting refugees' reentry into the workforce.\nØ Enablement - Increasing humanitarian financing, strengthening infrastructure and access to resources needed for refugees to become self-reliant, and supporting countries taking new steps to welcome refugees or allow them to work and attend school.\nPartnership for Refugees: Catalyzing Durable Solutions\nTo facilitate private sector commitments in response to the Call to Action, the White House is announcing the  Partnership for Refugees, an initiative established through collaboration between the State Department and USA for UNHCR, with significant support from Accenture Federal Services. The Partnership for Refugees will provide guidance to private sector organizations that wish to take action and help ensure that their pledges are sustainable and responsive to refugees' needs. Federal agencies supporting this initiative include the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Department of Homeland Security, the Small Business Administration, and the Department of Commerce.\nMore specifically, from now until September, the Partnership will:\nØ Produce resources containing data and best practices to guide private sector action.\nØ Draw on knowledge of refugees' needs to offer feedback on specific proposals.\nØ Connect interested private sector actors with non-governmental organizations (NGOs), UN agencies, and government officials working in the impact areas.\nØ Develop criteria for assessing and measuring the impact of pledges made in response to the Call to Action.\nBackground on the Leaders' Summit on Refugees\nOn September 20, President Obama will host the Leaders' Summit on Refugees in the wake of the UN General Assembly. The Summit will bring together leaders of member states who are prepared to make new and significant pledges in 2016 to help address refugees' most urgent needs. To participate in the Summit, major refugee-hosting member states will enact new policies to improve refugees' access to employment and education - so as to enable them to become more self-reliant. Other states will provide additional funding to UN humanitarian appeals and agencies, above and beyond what they gave in 2015; and welcome additional refugees to their countries, beyond what they had previously planned.\nBuilding on these individual pledges, the Summit is expected to achieve three overarching goals:\nØ Generate a 30 percent increase in financing for global humanitarian appeals, from $10 billion in 2015 to $13 billion this year.\nØ Double the number of resettlement slots and alternative legal pathways for admission that are available to refugees, and increase the number of countries accepting significant numbers of refugees.\nØ Increase the number of refugees worldwide in school by one million, and the number of refugees granted the legal right to work by one million.\n* * *\nFounding Private Sector Participants in the Call to Action\nWhile the  Call to Action aims to strengthen private sector support for refugees, especially in the three impact areas described above, it builds on a long track-record of U.S. private sector leadership in response to the global refugee crisis. Fifteen of these companies that are already leading examples in this space, are joining the President today.\nThese companies put forth summaries of their work to date to assist refugees as follows:\nACCENTURE\n• Accenture Federal Services will provide strategic consulting and digital services, as well as program management support to the Partnership for Refugees, working with the private sector and NGOs to help address the ongoing and enduring plight of refugees. Accenture will leverage the full expertise of its global experience, having worked closely with UNHCR to develop the Biometric Identification Management System, enrolling more than 230,000 refugees improving the protection and support for 33.9 million displaced persons; teaming with Upwardly Global to launch an online employment training program to help skilled refugees and immigrants launch professional careers in the United States; and leveraging digital innovation to create the Accenture Refugee Talent Hub—a digital platform and partnership between leading corporations, the Dutch government, NGOs and educational institutions to accelerate integration, education and employment of refugees in the Netherlands.\nAIRBNB\n• Airbnb is partnering with leading international relief organizations including UNHCR (The UN Refugee Agency), the International Rescue Committee, and Mercy Corps in responding to the global refugee crisis. Support includes the donation of travel credits to relief organizations, which allow their humanitarian workers to book accommodations on the front-lines where they are responding to some of the most urgent refugee needs.\n• Airbnb has encouraged its community to join in supporting this important cause by donating financial resources through a dedicated landing page on their website. This summer, we are working with UNHCR to develop a renewed global call to action during the Olympics in Rio.\n• Additionally, Airbnb has signed on as a pledge partner with The Tent Alliance to encourage and catalyze other private sector engagement as this humanitarian crisis evolves.\n• Airbnb is working with a range of partners domestically and around the world to continue to assess how to support this global response.\nCHOBANI\n• Chobani is a natural food company headquartered in Norwich, NY, with a mission to make better food for more people. Diversity and inclusiveness have been at the heart of the company since day one. In its early days in Upstate New York, Chobani worked with local refugee centers to support those who had come in search of safety and opportunity. It is a practice that has continued ever since, and today roughly 30 percent of its manufacturing workforce are resettled refugees. In addition to translating into more than 11 languages, the company works to provide English language training and other educational opportunities. Although most of Chobani's employees grew up in communities near its plants in Idaho and New York, the company is proud to welcome people from all over the world to join its mission to make delicious, nutritious and natural food that's accessible to all.\n• In 2015, Chobani's founder and CEO Hamdi Ulukaya signed the Giving Pledge, committing the majority of his personal wealth towards ending the global refugee crisis. That same year he founded Tent, an organization that seeks to improve the lives and livelihoods of the 65 million people who have been forcibly displaced around the globe. Tent does this by funding direct assistance, investing in innovation, promoting policies and partnerships to help the displaced realize their full potential, and organizing private sector leaders to make a meaningful difference in addressing the crisis.\nCOURSERA\n• Coursera, the largest open online education provider, and the U.S. Department of State have partnered to create Coursera for Refugees, enabling an unlimited number of non-profits that work with refugees to apply for at least one year of group financial aid. Partner non-profits will be able to support refugees in quickly building career skills and gaining recognizable certificates through access to the 1,000+ Coursera courses offered by schools like Stanford University, University of Pennsylvania, University of Edinburgh, and IE Business School. Coursera for Refugees also includes organizational support services for partner non-profits, such as learner engagement data, private communication forms, and dedicated Coursera technical support.\nGOLDMAN SACHS\n• Goldman Sachs Gives has contributed over $4.5 million, representing one of the earliest and largest corporate investments in response to the Middle East refugee crisis, through public-private partnerships between the firm and the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees (UNHCR), and other nonprofit organizations including Concern Worldwide, Relief International and German Red Cross.\n• The response by Goldman Sachs has focused on three core areas: the immediate humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean region; regional stabilization in camps; and resettlement for the 20,000 Syrian refugees in the United Kingdom.\n• The grant to UNHCR supported thousands of families with survivor packs, emergency food packs, secure accommodation for extremely vulnerable children and temporary medical facilities, as well as secondary support focused on ongoing needs in and around the refugee camps. Through Relief International and Concern Worldwide, Goldman Sachs Gives provided educational support (including 40 classrooms, 3 new interactive learning libraries and 3 new playgrounds) for 26,000 children in the two main refugee camps in Jordan and in Turkey, and provided 3,000 winterization kits to refugees in and around Kobani, Syria.\n• To address longer-term resettlement of refugees, Goldman Sachs will work to address English language and employability skills, two significant areas of need, with the intent to develop a mechanism to fill gaps across the current integration framework.\nGOOGLE\n• Starting last September, Google has been supporting refugees by funding innovative solutions to connectivity, access to information and education. In the past 9 months, Google.org has given more than $13M plus employee expertise to support nonprofits developing those solutions. Those efforts include helping to develop RefugeeInfo.eu to provide access to vital information, deploying low cost wifi and charging kits in refugee camps and transit routes, helping to build Translation Cards to facilitate translations between aid workers and refugees and launching Project Reconnect to equip non-profits with managed Chromebooks to facilitate access to educational resources and training. Google's combined efforts will help more than 1 million refugees get access to information and education this year.\nHP\n• HP believes everyone, everywhere should have access to a quality education. This includes refugees and displaced communities. Technology can be a key enabler to reaching this goal by providing unstandardized ways of learning. HP has funded and provided technology to 57 Community Technology Access (CTA) centers in refugee camps in 26 countries. UNHCR's CTA program provides access to computers, computer literacy, and connectivity, to UNHCR's persons of concern including refugees and internally displaced persons. The CTA program launched an online learning platform, UNHCR Exchange, which provides refugees with vocational, business and IT skills training to improve their livelihoods. HP LIFE, free online business and IT skills training in 7 languages, is on the UNHCR Exchange.\n• HP is working with the Global Alliance Institute and Girl Scouts of Nation's Capital to support the Girl's Truth Seekers Education Project which will connect Girl Scouts in the greater Washington area with young Syrian refugee girls currently living in the countries bordering Syria. Through this initiative, the Syrian girls will attend virtual, online classes to learn English, and the Girl Scouts will earn the Truth Seeker badge. As well as donating practical tools including HP Probook and Notebook laptops, HP LIFE will also be offered as part of the training at its refugee learning centers, enabling female refugees to continue their education - preparing them for the technology world and bringing them hope for a brighter future.\nIBM\n• IBM has been actively partnering with regional and international NGOs and launching IBM volunteer initiatives, in an integrated fashion, to provide a substantive and effective response to the critical and long-term needs of refugees and migrants arriving in Europe.\n• IBM Impact Grants of mobile and cloud capabilities are supporting European NGOs as they collect medical data, track refugee health, and analyze data for trends and insights. Mobile apps designed for Italian NGOs INTERSOS and Mйdecins Sans Frontiиres are enabling better health interventions based on data and analytics. In Turkey, IBM is helping two NGOs which are UNHCR implementing partners and which provide services to more than 60,000 refugees monthly. IBM provided consulting on data strategy to improve services, and design and implementation of a web-based custom data management solution. To Singa France, an NGO that supports cohesion between refugees and local communities, IBM delivered data management consulting and support toward a solution to match refugees with local hosts, accelerating access to accommodation, cultural and economic opportunities and wider social integration. For the Deutsche Rote Kreuz (German Red Cross), IBM developed a solution, based on Sahana and hosted in IBM Softlayer, to help them manage and improve numerous sources of conflicting refugee information at the reception centre in Mannheim, which has a capacity of 6,000 refugees and migrants. Leveraging IBM's capabilities in security, IBM granted to UK NGO Stop The Traffik five licenses of i2 analyst software and training, as well as Softlayer hosting for analysis of trafficking data. Refugees and migrants are uniquely susceptible to exploitation. Using the software, staff will be able to analyze data submitted by citizens around the world who suspect that human trafficking is taking place in their area.\n• IBMers also engage in skills-based volunteerism and mentoring programs for refugees, leading to better employability and social integration. In Austria, Belgium, Denmark, and Sweden, mentoring and skills training initiatives are supporting children with language and cultural learning, and helping to bring skilled refugees into the job market. In Belgium, more than twenty workshops in various topics are delivered per year. Volunteers in Sweden worked for three months with the Red Cross at the Swedish border in the height of winter, supporting refugees in various ways. Volunteers are innovating - in Denmark, by developing an app to match mentors with mentees; and in Austria, by joining a Social Hackathon on Migration organized for late June to work on apps and games related to education and refugees, using IBM Bluemix as the cloud development platform. Finally, IBM has launched internship opportunities for refugees in Finland, Germany, and Sweden - with some interns already having completed the program. IBM Sweden is a founding partner of an AmCham Sweden collaboration to integrate immigrant-owned enterprises into procurement processes of larger Swedish companies.\nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO.\n• JPMorgan Chase and its employees donated $1.7 million to non-governmental organizations serving refugee children and families across Europe and the Middle East, providing them with necessary medical treatment, food, clean water and other critical support services. Over 150 employees also created more than 500 hygiene kits that were distributed to refugees through the International Medical Corps. Finally, the Family Action Toy Appeal campaign, with support from JPMorgan Chase, provided over 5,000 children toys to refugees during the holidays.\n• Integration Efforts: JPMorgan Chase provided nearly $680,000 to help adult refugees integrate into the German labor market through career guidance services, internship placements and job training in key business sectors. J.P. Morgan has also developed a partnership with Bertelsmann Foundation to pilot and scale plans that help cities integrate refuges into their labor markets. As a result, about a dozen cities will develop strategies for integrating refugees into the labor market. J.P. Morgan will also partner with JobLinge in Germany to provide office space and volunteer support for refugee language classes.\nLINKEDIN\n• In February 2016, LinkedIn launched its first pilot initiative in Sweden, Welcome Talent, to help address the refugee crisis. Using the LinkedIn platform, the company created a microsite that is an entry point to connect newly settled refugees with employers who have committed to hiring them. The site has information, resources and case studies to help refugees create optimal profiles. To date, more than 1,000 jobs have been posted from potential employers. This is a multi-sector initiative working with the Swedish government, NGO community, universities and the private sector. LinkedIn is also one of the founding partners of the Tent Foundation private sector alliance that has formed to address the refugee crisis. LinkedIn is currently exploring other markets to expand this work.\nMASTERCARD\n• By leveraging technologies and products such as MasterCard Aid Network and Prepaid, MasterCard collaborates with partners to provide essential services to refugees at a critical time in their lives. To date, MasterCard Aid and Prepaid cards have been deployed in humanitarian responses across Africa, Asia and Europe - in countries such as Turkey, Kenya, Yemen, Nepal, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Niger, the Philippines, and Greece.\n• For example, MasterCard worked with Mercy Corps to distribute prepaid debit cards to eligible refugees traveling through Serbia. Approximately $75,000 was distributed to nearly 400 families and individuals, who spent the assistance on transportation, food, medications and lodging. Many recipients also used their prepaid MasterCard to withdraw cash at automated teller machines. Based on the success in Serbia, Mercy Corps has launched a complementary program in Greece. Run on the islands of Lesvos and Leros, and on the mainland, the program will provide nearly 3,000 refugees with cash support.\nMICROSOFT\n• Microsoft Philanthropies is leveraging the company's technology, cash donations, and employee volunteers to support nonprofits who are driving Syrian refugee crisis relief efforts. In the past six months, Microsoft has donated more than $20 million in cash, grants and software to over a dozen nonprofit organizations, including NetHope, Mercy Corps and the International Rescue Committee. This has ensured its nonprofit partners have the capacity to provide millions of refugees with vital access to food, water, shelter, medical aid and legal/trauma counseling, as well as services that will help them to rebuild their lives, including education, employment training, and connectivity.\n• Currently, through its nonprofit partnerships, Microsoft is supporting refugee education efforts in Turkey, Lebanon, Greece and Jordan. For instance, in Germany, Microsoft has made its YouthSpark Schlaumause (Arabic to German language training) program available to 3,000 elementary schools, serving approximately 30,000 refugee children. In the coming months, Microsoft will commit more resources to this initiative to double Schlaumause's impact. At the Zaatari Refugee Camp in Jordan, Microsoft has supported the establishment of The Norwegian Refugee Council's technology lab, which teaches adult refugees computer skills, improving their future employability. Through its support for NetHope, Microsoft has helped bring connectivity services to Syrian refugees in Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon. With connectivity, refugees have been able to access information and resources, and connect to family. Going forward, Microsoft aims to work across the industry to help provide much-needed infrastructure, as well as longer-term aid. In the coming months, Microsoft will deepen its commitment and expand its ability to prepare for and respond to humanitarian and natural disasters.\nTRIPADVISOR\n• TripAdvisor has a culture of giving and giving back, it's part of the brand ethos. TripAdvisor was moved to action with the tragic refugee crisis impacting so many millions who are on a journey trying to find safe haven. As a brand TripAdvisor helps travelers, and these refugees are travelers of a different kind that truly need help.\n• In the fall of last year, the refugee crisis reached a peak and TripAdvisor knew it needed to do what it could to support on-the-ground humanitarian relief. Within a matter of days, TripAdvisor took three steps:\no Launched partnerships with two leading global humanitarian organizations, The International Rescue Committee (IRC) and Mercy Corps, donating $250,000 between the two.\no Appealed to the community of millions of travelers around the world to donate to IRC and Mercy Corps with a goal to match, dollar for dollar, community donations up to $375,000 from its Charitable Foundation\no Launched an appeal on the TripAdvisor website in almost 30 languages to reach as many community members as possible.\no TripAdvisor engaged employees in two ways:\n§ Doubled employees' donations to a 2:1 match to IRC and Mercy Corps via an internal gift matching program through Dec 31, 2015. This means each employee's donation had triple the impact.\n§ Introduced a new Volunteer Time Off (VTO) policy to allow those TripAdvisor employees to use their time and skills and take up to five days of paid leave to volunteer at any nonprofit organization tackling the refugee crisis.\n• Within 48 hours, the community exceeded expectations andthe TripAdvisor Charitable Foundation was able to donate over $1 million. Through the campaign, the combined contributions to Mercy Corps and IRC's emergency humanitarian efforts have totaled over $1.4 million, which exceeded the match goal.\nUPS\n• The current national security and humanitarian crisis the world faces ranks among the most pressing global challenges of our time. In response, UPS has guided its actions by the principle: Those who can, when they can, should do what they can. To that end, UPS has strengthened cooperation with law enforcement and deployed advanced technology to provide greater safety and security for people, customers and countries from those who seek to harm us and our global economy.\n• UPS also believes everyone should help to address the humanitarian needs of the 60 million people - 1/3 of whom are children - fleeing war, disease, famine, oppression and religious intolerance. Despite the heavy toll of such unanticipated migration on social welfare systems and national economies, to stand idle and not provide aid in the face of such human suffering is unconscionable. UPS believes that we collectively need to do more.\n• UPS sees that the preservation of life and individual dignity is essential to modern democracy. We cannot ensure peace in our world, economic growth or a better future for all, unless we all try to offer a courageous and compassionate alternative to terror. That's why UPS has deployed its logistical resources and volunteers to address the ongoing migrant crisis in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.\n• UPS is providing financial, in-kind and volunteer support in partnership with UNHCR, the World Food Programme, Refugees International, ShelterBox USA and The Salvation Army. Company and employee-volunteers have brought dozens of ocean containers filled with supplies to critical relief points, like Erbil, Iraq, where UPS delivered 23,400 winter clothing kits for children, as well as food, tents, water sanitation devices, and health kits. Working closely with its partners, UPS brought mobile warehouses and sleeping mats to Gaziantep, Turkey, and 11,750 kilos of shelter supplies to Lebanon. UPS's expertise in disaster relief logistics has also been mobilized in southern Turkey, as part of the World Food Programme's Logistics Emergency Team. In Germany and Belgium, UPS volunteers have delivered vital supplies like blankets and toiletries, and distributed much needed food to refugees.\nWESTERN UNION\n• Western Union (WU) has a long history of supporting issues related to migration, refugees, and humanitarian crisis. In 2013, WU drew early attention to the needs of young Syrian refugees through a multi-year consumer fundraising campaign to benefit UNICEF. In 2015, the company expanded its efforts to support humanitarian relief for refugees throughout the Middle East & Europe, taking a 360 approach by engaging a variety of assets and audiences, including its core operations, corporate voice, marketing and customer engagement programs, employee volunteerism, business partnerships, corporate giving, and support from the WU Foundation. WU designed a three-pronged approach, designed to address short-, medium- and long-term needs that were identified through hands-on field research. Taking a 360° approach, WU has also engaged its business partners, employees and customers in the campaign.\no Products: WU products have enabled NGO staff from Oxfam, IRC and others to send humanitarian payments from their desktops directly to programs in the field - including to refugees and fieldworkers. WU has also offered zero-fee and reduced fee promotions to support the refugee community. WU is working to launch a new Western Union MasterCard prepaid card that will enable refugees and asylum seekers to receive funds from governments or NGOs on a reloadable prepaid card. The card will be piloted in Europe, where an estimated half of refugees live in urban areas.\no Giving: In 2015, Western Union and the Western Union Foundation provided more than $600,000 in philanthropic contributions to numerous charitable organizations serving refugee populations throughout the Middle East and Europe, including longtime partners Save the Children, Mercy Corps, and the Red Cross. The Western Union Company also contributed ten US cents per transaction for all consumer-to-consumer transactions originated within the European Union, giving more than USD$400,000. In 2016, the Western Union Foundation has committed to giving more than $500,000 in humanitarian assistance, raising additional funds from business partners and employees to deliver critical support.\no Employees: WU has matched employee contributions 2:1, and WU employees in Europe have participated in hands-on volunteer efforts, collecting donations, handing out supplies, even babysitting the children of refugees so the parents could attend classes. Employees are working with NGOs to teach a full year of Italian and German to roughly 1,000 new refugees - a camp-full. They have worked with Caritas to create two homes for unaccompanied refugee children, and to provide language skills and education.\no Customers: WU has made it easy for customers to make a difference through the MyWU customer loyalty program, which enabled WU customers to redeem their loyalty points to support the refugee crisis both in France and Germany, with WU matching their donations. WU actively promoted points donation via SMS and email, and used social media to provide transparent updates on progress and encourage others to join in. Earlier this year, WU donated more than Ђ10,000 thanks to the generosity of loyalty members.", "timestamp": "2016-06-30", "title": "Fact Sheet: White House Launches a Call to Action for Private Sector Engagement on the Global Refugee Crisis"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118122", "text": "In conjunction with President Obama signing the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, the Administration is taking new steps to build on a record of openness and transparency\nSince day one of his Administration, President Obama has  sent a clear message about the need for greater transparency and openness in government. On his first full day in office, the President issued a memorandum directing that, under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), agencies should adopt a presumption of openness. As the President said, \"In the face of doubt, openness prevails.\" Over the past seven and a half years, the Administration has made good on this promise, processing more than 4.6 million requests under FOIA, releasing unparalleled numbers of datasets to the public, and making it easier for citizens to access information from their government.\nIn conjunction with the President signing the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, today the Administration is announcing additional steps to build on this record of success.\nNEW ACTIONS TO MAKE FOIA WORK BETTER FOR CITIZENS\nThe Administration is taking a number of steps to further the progress made since 2009, ensuring that this Administration's track record of openness is institutionalized throughout government and carries forward for years to come.\nUtilizing the Chief FOIA Officers Council and FOIA Advisory Committee to address FOIA's greatest challenges. The FOIA Improvement Act formalizes DOJ's existing meetings of Federal Chief FOIA Officers to form a new Chief FOIA Officers Council. The President is tasking the Chief FOIA Officers Council to identify and address the biggest difficulties that exist in administering FOIA across government. In order to begin work immediately on this critical task, the Administration is announcing today that new Council will hold its first meeting on July 22, 2016. In addition, the high-level officials that comprise the Council are charged with working with stakeholders inside and outside of government, including the FOIA Advisory Committee that was created by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) in May 2014.\nToday, the Administration is also announcing  new members for the FOIA Advisory Committee's 2016-2018 term. The Administration is asking these members to look broadly at the challenges that agency FOIA programs will face in light of an ever-increasing volume of electronic records, and chart a course for how FOIA should operate in the future. NARA is announcing today that it will hold the first meeting of the Committee's new term on July 21, 2016.\nPromoting broader release of records through a \"release to one is a release to all\" presumption. In July 2015, the Department of Justice (DOJ) launched a 6-month pilot program with seven volunteer Federal agencies to assess the viability of a policy that would direct agencies to proactively post online their FOIA responses. This concept would ensure that all citizens—not just those making a request—have access to information released under FOIA. Over the course of the pilot, DOJ worked with participating agencies to capture metrics on the time and resources associated with implementing this policy, as well as any impacts on interested stakeholders. The President is directing the newly established Chief FOIA Officers Council to consider the lessons learned from the DOJ pilot program and work to develop a Federal Government policy establishing a \"release to one is a release to all\" presumptive standard for Federal agencies when releasing records under FOIA. The Chief FOIA Officers Council will examine issues critical to this policy's implementation, including assessing the impact on investigative journalism efforts, as well as how best to address technological and resource challenges. By January 1, 2017, the Chief FOIA Officers Council will work with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to provide further guidance as it relates to this presumption.\nLaunching a centralized FOIA request portal. In October 2012, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) launched FOIAonline as a shared-service FOIA case-management system and request portal, now used by 12 agencies. In December 2013, the Administration built on this initial effort by committing to launching a consolidated FOIA request portal in the second U.S. Open Government National Action Plan (NAP), and recommitted to that effort in the third NAP issued in October 2015 as part of a larger expansion of the services offered by DOJ on FOIA.gov. Today, the Administration is announcing that DOJ will work with OMB, EPA, and other agencies to launch a consolidated FOIA request portal in 2017. This portal will initially provide for centralized submission of requests and will continue to be enhanced to include other features to guide requesters through the FOIA process, improve the public's ability to locate already posted information, and track requests online, among other functions. The Administration will announce further details about the functionality of the portal and the timeline for launching its initial phases in the coming months.\nNew guidance on open government principles and actions. To reaffirm the President's commitment to transparency and open government, and its importance for the long-term operations of government, OMB, in coordination with DOJ, will issue new guidance later this year that will advance open government principles related to transparency and FOIA, including the implementation of the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016. This guidance will ensure the establishment and operation of a unified, citizen-centric FOIA request portal and promote standards for interoperability to facilitate agency adoption and participation. OMB is also announcing today the creation of a Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goal for FOIA, that will be co-led by OMB, DOJ, and NARA, to focus senior leadership attention and drive performance and accountability for improving the way in which FOIA requests are administered, and ensure that Federal departments and agencies are providing sufficient resources toward FOIA responsibilities. The new CAP goal will be publicly posted on Performance.gov, and will have a detailed action plan, including specific metrics and milestones that will be used to gauge progress. To maintain focus on implementation, each quarter, OMB will review progress on these goals and will update Performance.gov with the latest results.\nFOIA IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2016\nIn addition to taking the further actions described above, today the President signed into law the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016—nearly 50 years after the original FOIA was signed into law by President Johnson. This critical legislation reflects the progress made by the Administration, codifies a number of openness and transparency principles and actions that the President has promoted since his first full day in office, and ensures that progress over the past seven-and-a-half years will be institutionalized throughout government and carried forward for years to come.\nAmong the improvements to existing efforts, the new law:\n• Reinforces the foreseeable harm standard established by the Attorney General in 2009, which requires that agencies release information unless \"the agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption\" or \"disclosure is prohibited by law\";\n• Builds on the Administration's previously-announced efforts to create a consolidated online FOIA request portal, which today's announcement makes clear will launch in 2017;\n• Codifies longstanding DOJ guidance that agencies make records and documents available to requesters in an electronic format and post online records that are requested three or more times;\n• Formalizes DOJ's existing meetings of Federal Chief FOIA Officers that will form a Chief FOIA Officers Council to develop recommendations for increasing compliance and efficiency in responding to FOIA requests, and to identify, develop and coordinate initiatives for increasing transparency and compliance with FOIA's requirements;\n• Codifies best practices from DOJ and NARA for agencies to notify requesters who receive an adverse determination on a request that the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) is available to offer mediation services to resolve disputes between agencies and FOIA requesters;\n• Sets a minimum of 90 days for requesters to file FOIA appeals; and\n• Establishes that \"the deliberative process privilege shall not apply to records created 25 years or more before the date on which the records were requested.\"\nThe Administration appreciates the bipartisan effort in Congress to enact this legislation, and looks forward to implementing it without delay.\nA RECORD OF PROGRESS\nThe new legislative and administrative actions outlined above build on seven and a half years of work undertaken by this Administration to drive openness and transparency in government. Notable steps include:\nReleasing historic amounts of information\n• Processing more than 4 million FOIA requests. This Administration has released more information in response to FOIA requests than any prior Administration. To date, Federal agencies have processed more than 4,600,000 FOIA requests since the start of Fiscal Year 2009. In that time, agencies have received more than 4,580,000 requests. In processing these requests, the government has every year achieved a release rate of above 91 percent. And when exemptions were used to protect information, the reason cited most often by agencies was for protection of personal privacy.  Read more.\n• Making more than 180,000 Federal datasets and collections available to students, entrepreneurs, and the public. In May 2013, President Obama issued an Executive Order and policy guidance on making open and machine readable data the new default for government information. To date, more than 180,000 Federal datasets and collections have been made available on Data.gov. The release of these datasets and collections have been coupled with active outreach and thematic events such as Health and Energy \"Datapaloozas,\" so that data and tools are in hands of innovators, entrepreneurs, policymakers, and communities working together to develop new tools and solutions. The Administration has increased public access to the results of Federally funded scientific research, with more than 4 million full-text journal articles and growing volumes of scientific research data now free and accessible to the public via agency-designated repositories. Read more,  more, and  more.\n• Working to make more discretionary disclosures. To carry out the Attorney General's FOIA Guidelines, agencies have worked to identify opportunities to make discretionary releases of information where a FOIA exemption might otherwise apply. For example, the FBI continues to release information with historical value that could otherwise be protected by the FOIA's law enforcement exemptions, such as information about counterintelligence operations and records of discussion about whether to prosecute Alger Hiss for espionage and perjury. In response to several requests for information about American families' unsuccessful attempts to adopt children in Vietnam, the Department of State released deliberative material to bring greater transparency to the consular and Department officers' decision-making process. The Department of Defense also reported in 2015 that 62 percent of components made discretionary releases, which is more than any year since 2009.  Read more,  more, more, and  more.\n• Proactively releasing electronically filed nonprofit tax forms.In June 2016, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) began releasing publicly available data from more than one million electronically filed tax forms of nonprofits. Now the public can access these data directly from the IRS in a machine-readable format rather than filing a FOIA request and receiving a non-machine-readable image file.  Read more.\nBuilding new online tools to make FOIA easier to navigate\n• Creating FOIA.gov as a centralized FOIA resource. FOIA.gov allows the public to learn about how the FOIA works and search for already posted material across the government, making it easier and faster to find information without the need to make a request. FOIA.gov also sheds light on agency FOIA compliance by allowing the public to sort and compare Annual FOIA Report metrics such as the number of requests received and processed each year. The site includes contact information for agency FOIA offices and highlights significant FOIA releases. The Administration will continue to add functionality to FOIA.gov in the coming months as it launches a centralized FOIA request portal. Read more.\n• Launching FOIAonline as a shared-service FOIA case-management system and public-facing portal.FOIAonline also tracks the progress of FOIA requests, allows users to search for information previously made available by participating agencies, and generates reports on FOIA processing. Twelve agencies or components currently use FOIAonline. The Administration will build on this initial shared service as it works to develop a centralized FOIA request portal on FOIA.gov. Read more and more.\n• Creating the first FOIA mobile application. In July 2015, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) launched a new mobile FOIA application for requesters using smartphones and tablets to file requests with DHS. The app allows users to submit requests and check their status in addition to accessing all of the content on the DHS FOIA website. Read more.\nRevising government policies to promote openness\n• Elevating transparency and openness as guiding principles for Federal agencies. On the first day of his Administration, the President issued a memorandum calling on all agencies to work together to create \"an unprecedented level of openness\" in government and to \"establish a system of transparency, public participation, and collaboration.\" An Open Government Directive and a plan for implementing those goals were issued in December 2009. Read  more,  more, and more.\n• Establishing the presumption of openness. In addition to the Presidential Memorandum on openness and transparency, on his first full day in office the President also issued a Memorandum on the Freedom of Information Act that directed all agencies to administer FOIA with a clear presumption of openness, noting that, in the face of doubt, openness prevails. Read more.\n• Directing records to be released unless agencies can identify a foreseeable harm. On March 19, 2009, the Attorney General issued new FOIA Guidelines directing agencies to make discretionary disclosures of information and to only withhold information in response to a FOIA request if the agency can identify a foreseeable harm. These FOIA Guidelines also stressed the importance of using technology, improving efficiency, making records available proactively, and responding to requests promptly.  Read more.\n• Increasing agency accountability. DOJ has instituted two new FOIA reporting requirements that increased agency accountability for FOIA administration. Since 2010, agency Chief FOIA Officers have been required to annually report on their efforts to implement the presumption of openness, improve their FOIA operations and facilitate information disclosure. These reports have added a wealth of information about agencies' FOIA programs that was never available before. Additionally, since 2013, agencies have been required to report certain key FOIA statistics such as the numbers of requests received, processed, and backlogged on a quarterly basis.  Read more and  more.\n• Promoting good customer service and proactive disclosures. DOJ has issued several articles of guidance since 2009 that emphasize the importance of agencies improving communication with requesters and focusing on good customer service. Additionally, in 2015, DOJ issued guidance on making information available without the need to file a FOIA request, encouraging agencies to systematically post material of interest to the public even before receipt of one request.  Read more, more, more, and  more.\n• Professionalizing the FOIA career field. In March 2012, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) designated a new civil service personnel category for FOIA professionals, allowing individuals working in FOIA to join the specialized Government Information Series career track to recognize the professional nature of their work.  Read more and more.\n• Developing a FOIA Best Practices series. Since May 2014, DOJ has hosted FOIA Best Practices Workshops for agencies and requesters to identify areas where successful strategies in FOIA administration can be leveraged across the government. DOJ captures those practices and related resources in a central online place.  Read more and  more.\n• Generating comprehensive online FOIA training resources.In March 2015, DOJ released a suite of electronic FOIA training resources for all Federal Government employees to assist them in understanding their responsibilities under this important law. From a specialized briefing video for senior executives emphasizing the importance of leading and supporting this work, to a one-pager that covers all the basics for every Federal employee so they know how FOIA affects them, to in-depth modules for agency FOIA professionals, these training resources are being used and further adapted across agencies.  Read more and more.\nEngaging the public\n• Engaging in significant outreach with the FOIA requester community.Throughout this Administration, DOJ, NARA, and individual agencies have engaged in extensive outreach with the requester community through formal and informal mechanisms. For example, DOJ has hosted large events such as Requester Town Halls and FOIA Best Practices Series workshops, as well as smaller events co-sponsored with NARA such as Requester Roundtables. NARA's FOIA Advisory Committee meetings are open to the public and live-streamed, and OGIS regularly joins informal meetings with requesters. Both agencies meet with requester stakeholders through the development and implementation of FOIA commitments in the Open Government National Action Plans. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) hosted a Partner's Day that opened a dialogue with FOIA requesters, business submitters, and agency staff about the FOIA process. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) reached out to large document-retrieval companies that are frequent requesters to provide training and guidance on making requests.  Read more,  more,  more, and  more.\n• Establishing a FOIA Ombudsman.In September 2009, the OGIS opened its doors, offering mediation services to resolve FOIA disputes between requesters and agencies and to review agencies' FOIA policies, procedures, and compliance. Created by the FOIA amendments in 2007, this office within NARA did not exist prior to this Administration. To date, OGIS has assisted more than 5,000 customers from all 50 states and 22 countries, provided FOIA dispute resolution training to more than 700 FOIA professionals in nearly 60 agencies, and reviewed FOIA compliance in six FOIA offices.  Read more,  more, and  more.\n• Celebrating Sunshine Week. This Administration has embraced and recognized Sunshine Week, the annual celebration of government transparency. In 2015, the White House hosted its first Sunshine Week event with a workshop to generate ideas for the 2015 Open Government National Action Plan. DOJ and NARA have hosted and participated in Sunshine Week events, such as the annual DOJ Sunshine Week Celebration and NARA's Sunshine Week at the National Archives event. DOJ's celebrations of Sunshine Week, which began in 2010, have included keynote addresses from the Attorney General and Associate Attorney General that have emphasized the principles of open government.  Read more,  more, and  more.\n• Forming the first Federal Advisory Committee for FOIA. In May 2014, NARA created the FOIA Advisory Committee to foster dialog between the Administration and the requester community, solicit public comments, and develop consensus recommendations for improving FOIA administration and proactive disclosures. Committee membership is equally divided between representatives of the FOIA requester community and agency FOIA professionals, and meetings are open to the public. During its first term, the FOIA Advisory Committee examined important issues related to the administration of FOIA, including making recommendations regarding revising FOIA fees. Today the Administration announced that the Committee will begin its second term with a meeting on July 21, 2016. The Administration will ask the  new members for the 2016-2018 term to look more broadly at the challenges that agency FOIA programs are expected to face with an ever-increasing volume of electronic records, and chart a course for how FOIA should operate over the next 20 years.  Read more,  more, and  more.\n• Opening up problem solving and engaging citizen solvers through increased use of incentive prizes, citizen science, and crowdsourcing. Since 2010, more than 80 Federal agencies have engaged 250,000 Americans through more than 700 challenges on Challenge.gov to address tough problems ranging from fighting Ebola, to decreasing the cost of solar energy, to blocking illegal robocalls. These competitions have made more than $220 million available to entrepreneurs and innovators and have led to the formation of over 275 startup companies with over $70 million in follow-on funding, creating over 1,000 new jobs. The Administration has expanded opportunities, including those efforts listed on CitizenScience.gov, for research agencies to work with citizen scientists and use crowdsourcing approaches. For example, Federal agencies have used these approaches to improve predictive models for coastal change and vulnerability to extreme storms, and to tag millions of archival records for the National Archives. Read more,  more, and  more.\n• Advancing the Open Government Partnership. President Obama helped to launch the global Open Government Partnership with seven other countries in September 2011, with the aim of promoting transparency and innovation, empowering citizens, fighting corruption, and transforming the ways in which governments use technology and other tools to serve and engage with their citizens. The partnership has now expanded to nearly 70 governments and hundreds of civil society organizations, and participating governments have made more than 2,500 commitments to be more open and accountable to their citizens.

{"author": "Michelle Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=120907", "text": "MRS. OBAMA: Hello, everyone. Hola! And unfortunately, that's the extent of my Spanish. (Laughter.) It is truly a pleasure to be here, and thank you so much for having me.\nBefore we get started, though, I just want to express the heartbreak I know that we all are feeling after the horrific attack in Turkey earlier this week. Our thoughts and our prayers are very much with the loved ones of the victims and all of the people of Turkey.\nAnd with that, I want to start by thanking Claudia for that very wonderful introduction and for her passionate commitment to her own education and the education of young people around the world. So let's give Claudia a round of applause. (Applause.)\nAnd of course, I am so thrilled and honored to recognize Her Majesty, Queen Letizia. (Applause.) Like me, Queen Letizia is the mother of two beautiful daughters, and we've had the opportunity to bond over many issues, including the joys and the challenges of raising strong, smart, outspoken girls. And I think that our warm friendship very much reflects the close relationship between our two nations. And I am so happy that you're with us today.\nAnd finally, most of all, I want to thank all of you –- so many brilliant, ambitious, accomplished young women. I understand that you're working hard. You're working hard in your schools and your universities. You're distinguishing yourself in all kinds of academic subjects. And you all are so fortunate to live in a country that gives you so many opportunities to learn and to follow your dreams for your lives and for your careers.\nBut unfortunately, many young women today aren't so lucky. The fact is that right now, more than 62 million girls worldwide -– girls who are just as smart and talented as all of you -– can't develop their full potential because they don't have the chance to attend school. They're getting no formal education whatsoever -– no math, no reading, no writing, none of the basic schooling that we all take for granted here in Spain and the U.S. And that doesn't just affect their life's prospects, it affects the prospects of their families and their countries, and it affects all of you and your country as well.\nSee, what we know is that when girls don't go to school, they earn lower salaries. They get married earlier. They have higher infant and maternal mortality rates. And they're more likely to contract HIV, less likely to immunize their children. So when girls can't go to school that affects their families' health and the public health of their nations. It can even affect the strength of their economies and the security of their countries. And in today's interconnected world, all of that can affect the health, prosperity and security of our countries too.\nAnd that's part of the reason why I'm here today in Spain after my visit this week to two countries in Africa, Liberia and Morocco, where many girls struggle every day to get an education. It is my hope that sharing their stories of struggle and triumph will inspire you and young women like you around the world to advocate for change.\nSo let me first give you a sense of the challenges these girls face. In Liberia, the average family lives on less than two euros a day, and the country is still recovering from the recent Ebola crisis. So often, parents just can't afford to educate their daughters. Teen pregnancy is common, and pregnant girls are often shamed and pressured to drop out of school. And sometimes it's not even safe for girls to go to school in the first place. Some girls face dangerous commutes to and from school, and girls are sometimes even sexually harassed or assaulted at school. And these are just some of the challenges that girls in Liberia face to go to school.\nThe girls I met in Morocco face a whole different set of obstacles. Nearly all Moroccan girls attend school until they're about 12, but for girls in rural areas, that's often when their education ends since the nearest secondary schools are often hours away from their homes. In fact, just 14 percent of girls in rural Morocco attend high school. Instead, girls are often kept home to do household labor; many get married when they're just barely teenagers and start having children of their own.\nNow, these girls are doing everything they can, everything right. They are bright. They're passionate young people. They want so much more for themselves and their families, and they're willing to work hard. They get up before dawn. They spend hours harvesting crops, cooking for their families, tending to their younger siblings. They work as maids. They work in factories. Then on top of all of that, they study for hours late into the night.\nAnd so many of these girls, they have big plans for their lives. The girls I met this week dream of attending university, dream of becoming doctors and teachers, engineers, entrepreneurs. One of them even wants to open her own auto shop to teach women about cars so they can be more independent. But so often, all of their effort, all of their ambition just isn't enough simply because of their gender.\nNow, just imagine how that must feel. Imagine if, at the age of 10 or 11 or 12, someone came to you and said, \"Sorry, you're a girl, you're finished with your education. Forget about all your dreams. Instead you'll marry a man twice your age and start having babies.\" I mean, to most of us, that would be unbearable. It's hard to even imagine when we've grown up in countries like Spain and the U.S. where our material circumstances are so different from girls in other parts of the world.\nBut if we hope to effectively address this global girls' education crisis, it's important to understand that lack of resources or material wealth is not the sole cause. See, it's not just about whether parents can afford school fees or countries can build enough schools. It's also about whether families and communities think that girls are even worthy of an education in the first place. It's about whether girls are valued only for their bodies –- for their labor, for their reproductive capacities -– or are they valued for their minds as well. And it's about whether women are viewed as second-class citizens, or as full human beings entitled to the same rights and opportunities as men.\nBecause I believe that a society's willingness to truly value women and girls is directly connected to its willingness to invest in them as full people. And if we're being honest with ourselves, we must recognize that these kinds of gender inequalities aren't just limited to the developing world. In countries like the United States and Spain, men and women are often held to very different standards.\nNow, it's true that women have made remarkable progress in both of our countries. We've banned gender discrimination in our schools and workplaces, and women are now nearly half our countries' workforces and more than half the students at our universities. Today, nearly 40 percent of your Congress is women. That's more than double what we have in the U.S. Congress, though I'm proud to say that this year, for the first time in history, we just might elect a President -- a female President of the United States.\nBut despite all of this progress, we also know that changes in our laws haven't always translated to changes in our cultures. And many of us still struggle with outdated norms and assumptions about the proper role for women, especially when it comes to our families and our workplaces. Perhaps some of you are starting to think about these issues as you're completing your education, starting your careers. Maybe you're anxious about finding a job, or about getting a graduate degree that will allow you -- be more competitive in the job market. Maybe you're wondering how you'll be able to succeed at work and also one day have a family of your own –- issues that most men your age have probably never even thought about.\nThese are definitely the things that I was worried about back when I was your age. You see, my family didn't have a lot of money, so I worked my heart out to get my degrees. But the minute I graduated, suddenly everyone was asking me, well, when are you going to get married and start having kids? And the truth is I had no idea how I would balance the expected role of wife and mother with a challenging career.\nThroughout my 20s and early 30s, I had jobs that I loved. I worked in city government. I ran a youth organization. I served as an associate dean at a university. And I couldn't imagine how a baby would fit into all of that. Because while the laws prohibited discrimination against women, the cultural messages I was receiving seemed to hold men and women to very different standards.\nMaybe you know what I'm talking about –- how when a father gets home from a long day of work and changes a diaper, he's practically considered a hero. (Laughter.) But when a woman changes a diaper, no one really notices because that's what's expected of her as a mother, even if she works outside of the home. When a father puts in long hours at work, he's praised for being dedicated and ambitious. But when a mother stays late at the office, she's sometimes accused of being selfish, neglecting her kids. And often, when men are assertive or argumentative at work, they're viewed as strong and powerful. But women who act that way aren't always viewed so positively.\nAnd these inequalities aren't just bad for women, they're bad for men too. Because so many men want to be good fathers. They want to spend more time with their kids. They want their daughters to have the same opportunities as their son. But they often find themselves powerless to shift these expectations.\nAnd this is just one of the many ways that outdated norms and cultures can negatively impact the overall health of a society even in developed nations like ours. Because women can't -- when they can't succeed in their careers because of unfair expectations about how we're supposed to act, or when women are still paid less than men for the same work -- which happens in both of our countries -- that hurts their partners and their families too.\nSo the question is, how do we begin to change these inequalities in our cultures –- to not just change laws and policies, but to change hearts and minds? And that's where all of you can help. I think that some of that challenge falls on your generation. It's up to all of you to start making those small but meaningful changes in your daily lives that can slowly start to change our norms.\nOne small example: You can start with how you raise your own children if you choose to have them. Maybe it means telling your sons that it's okay to cry, and your daughters that it's okay to be bossy. Maybe it means encouraging your daughters, not just your son, to study math and science and sign up for the football team. And if there isn't a team for girls, maybe it means asking why not.\nThat's how all of you will begin to break down those old stereotypes and biases. That's how you'll change the way that women and girls are seen. And that's the kind of work that we need to be doing around the world –- the work of changing culture. The work of changing expectations and standards that we have for women and girls. That's how we'll begin to help those 62 million girls who aren't in school.\nAnd that's why, last year, my husband and I launched an initiative called Let Girls Learn, an effort that isn't just about investing more money in girls' education but also about changing how women and girls are viewed and valued around the world. And I am thrilled that as part of Let Girls Learn, this week, we announced a series of new U.S. government initiatives to help break down barriers for girls all across Liberia and Morocco.\nIn Liberia, we're running leadership camps and working to end gender violence in school, because we want girls to be seen as powerful and deserving of respect. And we're supporting new, second-chance schools for girls who were forced to drop out because of pregnancy or rape, because we don't want these girls to be viewed as shameful or as failures. We want them to be seen as proud scholars and achievers.\nAnd in Morocco, we're working closely with the government to invest the equivalent of nearly 100 million euros to transform the secondary education system, particularly for girls. We're supporting new school dormitories for girls from rural areas so they can attend schools far from their homes. We're doing this because we want girls from all backgrounds to be seen as worthy of an education.\nThese are major new commitments that will make a real difference for countless girls in Africa. But today, I also want to be clear that it's not just the responsibility of national governments to help these 62 million girls. Every single one of us has the power -- and the obligation -- to be a champion for girls around the world. Women in countries like the U.S. and here in Spain, we can't just sit back and shake our heads and say oh, those poor girls in Africa, what a shame.\nAnd we can't pretend that we don't have the capacity to make a difference. Because unlike those 62 million girls, we have a voice. Every single one of you has access to social media –- I know my daughters have it -- and I know that most of you have your smartphones with you here today, so you can reach hundreds, thousands, maybe even millions of people right now, right from where you're sitting today. You can get on Instagram and Snapchat and Twitter -- and I'm sure there's other stuff out there that I don't even know exists -- (laughter) -- and every one of you can start educating people about the challenges girls face as they try to go to school.\nAnd even more important, you can take action to help these girls. If you need help, go to 62MillionGirls.com, which is a site that's available in both English and Spanish, and you'll find all kinds of projects that you can support today -– things from building school bathrooms for girls to creating girls' leadership and mentorship programs. So many girls are counting on you. They need you to step up and create an international movement of young women and men who are telling their stories, who are finding ways to support their ambitions.\nAnd if you think this challenge seems too big or too difficult, I just want you to think about the challenges that these girls are facing and overcoming every single day. I want you to think about girls like Ralphina, who I met this week in Liberia. Ralphina has to wake up before dawn every morning. She spends hours cooking, caring for her siblings, and working in a local market to pay her school fees –- that's all before she even gets to school in the morning. But Ralphina, she still manages to attend her classes each day and study for hours each night, because she is determined to fulfill her dream of becoming a nurse.\nI also want you to think about girls like Rihab, who lives in a remote town near the Sahara Desert in Morocco. Girls in her community are expected to get married as teenagers and drop out of school. But Rihab proudly describes herself as a feminist. She's determined to become an entrepreneur and run a major company. And she recently appeared on Moroccan television urging girls to work hard and follow their dreams.\nAnd I can tell you, I have met so many girls like Ralphina and Rihab all across the globe –- girls who are working day and night to defy expectations and pursue their ambitions, but who somehow still find time to tutor their younger sister, to mentor girls in their communities, to even start their own organizations to give other young women a chance to succeed.\nSo what I tell myself is that if these girls can overcome the most overwhelming odds to get their education, and then reach back and help other girls get an education too, then I know that I -- I know that we all can find a few hours to get on social media and tell the world their stories. I know that we all can support efforts to help them go to school. And I know that we all can change our cultures here in Spain and around the world to honor and respect women and girls, to see them as leaders worthy of an education, capable of achieving their dreams. I know we can do this, because I believe in the power of young women like all of you to truly change the world.\nAnd I want to end today by letting you know just how impressed I am by all of you. I have heard about you and read your stories, and I know what you have to offer this world. And let me tell you, I can't wait to see everything you all will accomplish in the years ahead. So stay strong, work hard, and keep pushing forward. Is that a deal? (Applause.)\nThank you all so much. (Applause.) Thank you so much. Gracias.\nI now have the pleasure to introduce someone who very much shares my commitment to empowering our young people, someone who's been a passionate advocate for early child education and vocational training here in Spain. And she's a powerful voice to combat hunger and malnutrition all around the world. She's a role model for so many of you and someone I consider to be a friend, a dear friend. Ladies and the few gentlemen that are here -- (laughter) -- it is now my pleasure to introduce your Queen, Her Majesty Queen Letizia.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122645", "text": "\"[O]ur criminal justice system isn't as smart as it should be. It's not keeping us as safe as it should be. It is not as fair as it should be. Mass incarceration makes our country worse off, and we need to do something about it.\" – President Barack Obama, July 14, 2015\nEvery year, more than 11 million people move through America's 3,100 local jails, many on low-level, non-violent misdemeanors, costing local governments approximately $22 billion a year. In local jails, 64 percent of people suffer from mental illness, 68 percent have a substance abuse disorder, and 44 percent suffer from chronic health problems. Communities across the country have recognized that a relatively small number of these highly-vulnerable people cycle repeatedly not just through local jails, but also hospital emergency rooms, shelters, and other public systems, receiving fragmented and uncoordinated care at great cost to American taxpayers, with poor outcomes.\nFor example, Miami-Dade, Florida found that 97 people with serious mental illness accounted for $13.7 million in services over 4 years, spending more than 39,000 days in either jail, emergency rooms, state hospitals, or psychiatric facilities in their county. In response, the county provided key mental health de-escalation training to their police officers and 911 dispatchers. Over the past 5 years, Miami-Dade police have responded to nearly 50,000 calls for service for people in mental-health crises, but have made only 109 arrests, diverting more than 10,000 people to services or safely stabilizing situations without arrest. The jail population fell from over 7,000 to just over 4,700, and the county was able to close an entire jail facility, saving nearly $12 million a year.\nOn any given day, across the country more than 450,000 people are held in jail before trial, nearly 63 percent of the local jail population, even though they have not been convicted of a crime. A 2014 study of New York's Riker's Island jail found more than 86 percent of detained individuals were held on a bond of $500 or less. To tackle the challenges of bail, in 2014 Charlotte-Mecklenburg, North Carolina began using a data-based risk assessment tool to identify low-risk people in jail and find ways to release them safely. Since Charlotte-Mecklenburg began using the tool, significantly more low-risk individuals have been released from jail, the total county jail population has dropped by 40 percent, and there has been no increase in reported crime.\nTo break the cycle of incarceration, the Administration is launching the Data-Driven Justice Initiative (DDJ) with a bipartisan coalition of 67 city, county, and state governments who have committed to using data-driven strategies to divert low-level offenders with mental illness out of the criminal justice system and change approaches to pre-trial incarceration, so that low-risk offenders no longer stay in jail simply because they cannot afford a bond. These innovative strategies, which have measurably reduced jail populations in several communities, help stabilize individuals and families, better serve communities, and often save money in the process.\nThe DDJ communities will implement the following strategies that have proven to be effective in reducing unnecessary incarceration in jails:\n•      Use data to identify and proactively break the cycle of incarceration. DDJ communities will bring data together from across criminal justice and health systems to identify the individuals with the highest number of contacts with police, ambulance, emergency departments, and other services, and link them to health, behavioral health, and social services in the community, with a goal of reducing overreliance on emergency healthcare and encounters with the criminal justice system.\n•      Equip law enforcement and first responders with the tools they need to respond and divert. Recognizing that police officers, emergency medical technicians (EMTs), and firefighters are often front-line responders to people experiencing mental health crises, DDJ communities will create systems and protocols to help effectively de-escalate crisis situations and safely divert people to the appropriate service providers instead of arresting them.\n•      Use data-driven, validated, pre-trial risk assessment tools to inform pre-trial release decisions. DDJ communities will work towards using objective, data-driven, validated risk-assessment tools to identify low-risk defendants held in jail and identify opportunities for their safe release.\nAdministration Commitments to Support Data-Driven Justice Communities\n•      Leveraging a community resources toolkit. The Administration is developing a toolkit to provide concrete guidance for jurisdictions seeking to develop a strong pre-arrest diversion program. The brief, step-by-step toolkit will synthesize best practices, policies, and programs that have been effective in DDJ communities. The toolkit will provide links to Federal resources and a funding table to assist jurisdictions in identifying opportunities to support their diversion programs. The Office for Civil Rights within the Department of Health and Human Services is also developing guidance to help jurisdictions understand how they can share data within the framework of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).\n•      Improving outcomes for Veterans through mental health services. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) will work through its Veterans Justice Outreach Liaisons Specialists in DDJ communities to coordinate with local law-enforcement and other justice-system personnel as they develop mental-health diversion protocols to help ensure eligible Veterans are linked to VA benefits, including housing, healthcare, and access to mental health services. Approximately 7 percent of people in local jails are Veterans, and 55 percent of them have a mental illness. It is estimated that up to 80 percent of justice-involved Veterans may be eligible for VA healthcare services and benefits. The VA will work through its Veterans Justice Outreach Liaisons Specialists in DDJ communities to coordinate with local law-enforcement and other justice-system personnel as they develop mental-health diversion protocols to help ensure eligible Veterans are linked to VA benefits, including housing, healthcare, and access to mental health services. Additionally, as part of the MyVA Communities initiative, VA is working closely with local community Veterans engagement boards to identify collaboration with local, criminal justice-system stakeholders as an opportunity to improve Veteran outcomes.\n•      Addressing individual needs through evidence-based interventions. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) recently awarded $8.7 million to seven organizations, including three who will work with DDJ communities, to address the needs of individuals cycling between the criminal justice system and homeless services. The grants will fund Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH), an evidence-based intervention shown to lead to decreases in homelessness, arrests, hospitalization, and emergency room visits. HUD and DOJ's awards will help communities adopt a Pay for Success (PFS) funding strategy. Under PFS, Federal, state, or local governments pay only for positive outcomes achieved, such as decreased recidivism, often with private or philanthropic dollars financing the intervention upfront.\nStates, Cities, and Counties Joining the Data-Driven Justice Initiative\nToday, 67 states, cities, and counties are committing to join the DDJ Initiative.\nStates\n1.

Winona County, MN\nAnswering the Administration's Call to Action to Use Data to Safely Reduce Incarceration and Improve Outcomes\nThe Administration recently issued a call to action asking private-sector, philanthropic, and nonprofit organizations to take new steps to develop a smarter, more data-driven criminal justice system.\nMany organizations have responded to this call to action with commitments to address the specific needs of communities adopting DDJ solutions. These commitments of support will enable DDJ communities to act more quickly to implement these solutions, accelerating progress towards safely reducing unnecessary incarceration.\nOrganizations responding to the call to action are providing critical and targeted support in four key areas: data; diversion and coordinated services; research on what works; and ongoing support and collaboration.\nI. Data Use and Data Exchange\nDDJ communities are taking new steps to link data from across the criminal justice and health systems to: identify the highest-need, highest-cost individuals who have come into frequent contact with law enforcement or emergency services; proactively link these individuals to supportive services that provide stability; decrease encounters with law enforcement; and reduce the costly overreliance on emergency medical treatment. The following organizations responded to the Administration's call to action by committing to help DDJ communities access and link data while protecting privacy.\nNational Support\n•      Amazon Web Services (AWS)will convene a Technology and Research Consortium comprising a diverse range of technologists, data scientists, researchers, and private-sector collaborators to work with DDJ communities. The consortium will identify technology solutions to support the efforts of DDJ communities by reducing local jail populations and linking people to care. Appriss, the California Department of Justice, Code for America, Esri, the Laura and John Arnold Foundation, MasterCard, Motorola Solutions, New York University School of Law's Criminal Justice Innovation Lab, Palantir, RapidSOS, RTI International, Socrata, TriggrHealth, and the University of Chicago Center for Data Science and Public Policy have each committed to join the consortium. AWS will also provide the cloud infrastructure to facilitate individual-level data exchange among relevant criminal justice and health-care practitioners in DDJ jurisdictions and a data repository for anonymized health and criminal justice data. This will enable the Consortium's practitioners and researchers to access and analyze these data sets to better understand populations of people who are frequently incarcerated, identify opportunities for early intervention, and test which programs are most effective. The Consortium will invite jurisdictions that contribute data to join a policy and governance working group to help guide the research agenda.\n•      Appriss conducted and today is releasing a new analysis of data from over 3,000 local, criminal justice agencies to help DDJ communities identify indicators in jail data that appear to be most predictive of individuals at high risk of re-arrest, overdose, and housing instability or homelessness. DDJ jurisdictions can use these data fields to develop reports from their jail management systems to help identify individuals with frequent bookings for low-level offenses. Appriss is also releasing their national-level analysis of more than 9.8 million bookings from 2015 to identify arrest patterns and repeated bookings, finding more than 276,000 individuals across the country who had four or more bookings in 1 year. Using this analysis, Appriss is developing a data-driven product that will systematically identify individuals who meet data-validated criteria as high utilizers of multiple criminal justice and healthcare systems.\n•      Esri will donate enterprise licenses to the first 100 DDJ communities for the purposes of research, development, testing, and demonstration of a pilot application using spatial technology so that communities can highlight and hotspot their relevant criminal justice and related data to identify opportunities for intervention.\n•      MasterCardis leveraging its Center for Inclusive Growth, Advisors analytic processes, and APT \"Test & Learn\" technology to provide insights on the operational efficiencies and economic impact of DDJ programs in participating communities.\n•      RTI Internationalwill release its Call for Service (CFS) Analytics as an open-source tool available to all participating DDJ jurisdictions. CFS Analytics provides law-enforcement agencies with the ability to analyze and visualize their calls for service data in order to identify emerging problems, monitor specific types of calls within and across local communities, and evaluate how police resources are being allocated. In addition, RTI International will partner with one or two jurisdictions to explore, in depth, how CFS Analytics can be used to identify and analyze patterns in calls for service related to mental health.\nSupport to Data-Driven Justice Communities\n•      The Data Science for Social Good summer fellowship program, run by The University of Chicago's Center for Data Science and Public Policy will deploy a team to work with Johnson County, KS, and Salt Lake County, UT, utilizing data from the counties' criminal justice, health, behavioral health, and social services systems. This data will be used to identify individuals—often people with mental illness, substance abuse, and health problems—who repeatedly cycle through multiple systems, including jails, hospital emergency rooms, shelters, and other services, while protecting privacy. The results will help governments provide higher-quality, coordinated services.\n•      New York University's (NYU) Governance Lab (The GovLab) has launched a Coaching Program for Data-Driven Criminal Justice Projects to provide 12 DDJ communities with a 10-week online coaching and mentoring program. The program will address strategies for sharing data among agencies to: mitigate the impact of bail, reduce recidivism, develop better programs for individuals with mental health and substance-use disorders, identify individuals who have had frequent contact with law enforcement and emergency medical services, and engage in more effective planning and coordination. The program will be repeated again in fall 2016.\n•      RapidSOS is a mobile security platform that allows individuals to transmit precise location data, the type of emergency, relevant medical and demographic data, and even texts and videos to 911 with just one touch, enabling first responders to more quickly locate those in need. RapidSOS commits to providing their technology service to up to five cities or municipalities for free for 10 years, helping communities identify at-risk populations and geographies, and anticipate and preempt issues before they occur.\nII. Assistance with Diversion and Coordinating Community-Based Services\nDDJ communities have committed to help police and first responders divert those in a mental health crisis to a more appropriate alternative to jail or the emergency room. The following organizations answered the call to action, offering to help communities address these challenges by providing expert technical assistance on design and delivery of supportive services, developing new tools for police to facilitate diversion, and preventing reentry of those currently in jail. These offers include:\nA. Technical Assistance and Capacity\nNational Support\n•      Corporation for Supportive Housing (CSH) will support DDJ communities in developing and implementing coordinated community-based housing and support services. In addition, CSH will sponsor a DDJ learning collaborative to share information and best practices to all DDJ jurisdictions; provide training and solutions to key challenges to sharing data and providing services; offer its expertise in data analysis and integration; provide programmatic advice; and help jurisdictions develop integrated strategies to improve outcomes for the target populations.\n•      Association of Prosecuting Attorneyswill expand its efforts to educate the nation's prosecutors on alternatives to jail for low-level offenders and will boost assistance for prosecutors in all DDJ communities to make sure they are connected to their law enforcement and healthcare partners.\n•      Community Catalyst will provide support and technical assistance to DDJ jurisdictions by sharing best practices for engaging consumer organizations in criminal justice diversion initiatives. Community Catalyst will conduct a national webinar, post a publicly accessible recording on its website, encourage consumer advocates to participate in these initiatives, and share contacts and strategies to help hospitals engage in data-driven diversion initiatives.\n•      The National Law Center on Homelessness & Poverty (NLCHP) will create and facilitate a national Data-Driven Justice Initiative Working Group on Housing that will be open to all DDJ communities to provide training on legal and policy issues related to homelessness, criminal justice, and housing, and will share tools, best practices, and peer learning opportunities.\nSupport to Data-Driven Justice Communities:\n•      ODH, Inc. will work with up to three DDJ local government or not-for-profit entities to use ODH's newly-developed Mentrics technology, which relies on data analytics to predict those community members suffering from mental illness who are at most risk of incarceration and would benefit from services to prevent incarceration or recidivism.\n•      Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities (TASC)will work with seven DDJ jurisdictions to create plans to safely divert people with non-violent charges away from the justice system and into substance-use and mental healthcare services in the community. Plans will include: ensuring the engagement of appropriate high-level stakeholders; defining the problem and stating the challenge; forming the local-systems change team; ensuring agreement on shared outcomes; and clearly articulating the current status and immediate action steps at regular intervals.\n•      Social Solutions and IDEO are partnering for the Social Innovation Festival Design Challenge: a call to changemakers to use data and design to reimagine Washington, DC's criminal justice system. One of the focal points of the Design Challenge will be to help identify innovative ways to implement the DDJ strategies and effectively link people to community-based services.\nB. Supporting Police and First Responders with New Tools\n•      Code for America is working with the Seattle Police Department to develop an open-source, mobile app for patrol officers to use to effectively respond to individuals in crises related to mental health, who are also in frequent contact with the police. Focused on making individualized response plans more available to officers in the field, the tool will include specific action steps to help the person connect with prevention services and treatment. Once developed, the tool will be available to all DDJ communities. Code for America will also pilot a jail-population management dashboard in up to four DDJ communities to facilitate real-time use of jail data to help identify opportunities to safely reduce jail populations through pre-trial release or other alternatives to incarceration.\n•      New York University School of Law'snew initiative for criminal justice innovation, the Criminal Justice Innovation Lab, will develop a mental health assessment tool to identify people who suffer from mental illness before they have entered the criminal justice system. This tool will help law enforcement divert those in need of medical or mental health treatment.\nC. Reentry Prevention\n•      A Managed Care Organization under Washington AppleHealth Medicaidand the Jail Health Services division of Public Health Seattle & King County are developing a demonstration project to allow managed-care community health workers and care coordinators to enter the King County jails to conduct release planning and transitional-care services. Building from existing work centered on creating a system of integrated care for populations with complex health needs, this pilot will test innovative ways to share data for clients who receive treatment by both providers, while protecting privacy and seeking to ensure continuity of care and appropriate support for shared clients when they are leaving jail.\n•      Triggr Health will work with multiple DDJ communities to prevent re-incarceration for people with substance-use disorders. By using real-time phone data, Triggr Health aims to reach people at times of highest need and increase the odds of individuals reaching long-term substance-use recovery.\nIII. Conducting Research to Know What Works and Continually Improve Outcomes\nDDJ communities are adopting data-driven and innovative practices. Outside support through research and ongoing evaluation will help improve outcomes while helping to build a knowledge base from which other communities can learn. Commitments include:\nUsing Data to Identify Trends and Test Interventions\n•      The Laura and John Arnold Foundation (LJAF)will support the Corporation for Supportive Housing (CSH) to select two DDJ communities to pilot data-integration initiatives. Both pilot communities will integrate housing, homelessness, and criminal justice data to support strategic placement decisions concerning frequent utilizers of multiple systems. An independent evaluation will inform future supportive housing initiatives nationally. LJAF has also launched a funding initiative that supports randomized controlled trials to evaluate criminal justice programs or strategies. LJAF encourages applications from DDJ jurisdictions to build rigorous evidence about best practices to improve public safety, community-police relations, and other important criminal justice outcomes.\n•      BetaGov, a multi-disciplinary team of researchers, is partnering with the Albany Police Department to test crisis-intervention training strategies for officers in collaboration with local mental health resources. BetaGov will help the Albany Police Department rapidly test tools that assist responding officers in identifying mental health and substance abuse-related crises, identifying strategies that reduce incarceration without compromising public safety, and then adapt them for use in jurisdictions throughout the country.\nIV. Ongoing Support and Convenings\n•      National Association of Counties (NACo) will engage their Health, Human Services, Justice and Public Safety, and Telecommunications and Technology Committees to convene county officials, national stakeholders, and experts focused on identifying best practices, surfacing innovation, and helping to connect counties interested in joining the DDJ Initiative to resources, tools, and subject-matter experts. NACo will also create an online resource library for participating and interested jurisdictions to learn more about the DDJ strategies and how to join the Initiative. Leveraging its partnerships with private foundations, national associations and organizations, academics, and Federal government agencies, NACo will also provide educational opportunities through conference workshops, webinars, and virtual discussions for county officials to learn from experts and peers on strategies to identify and implement data-driven criminal justice policies, practices, and programs.\n•      The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation (MacArthur), through its $75 million Safety and Justice Challenge, is supporting several DDJ and other jurisdictions to reduce over-incarceration in jails. MacArthur will collaborate with communities and nonprofit partners in the DDJ Initiative to enable learning, facilitate adoption of best practices, and spark innovation. Today, MacArthur is announcing a new $1.8 million Innovation Fund at the Urban Institute to award grants and provide technical assistance to help DDJ and other communities create change on the ground and extend a national movement to promote reforms across the country.\n•      National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) represents individuals and families directly affected by mental illness. NAMI will provide expert support to DDJ jurisdictions on the most effective ways to create relationships between policymakers and community mental health advocates to help implement effective mental health and support services that meet the needs of individuals and families. At the local, state, and national level, NAMI will work to help educate and inform policymakers about the importance of collecting data to shape reforms to the criminal justice and mental health systems.\n•      Prysm,a technology company that provides cloud-based visual workspaces, will host a meeting of DDJ communities, technologists, startups, and subject-matter experts in Silicon Valley to help connect local governments to potential technology collaborators.\nState-Led Convenings\n•      California's Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission, along with other state and local partners, will host a convening for up to 20 California counties, including the five California counties that have already joined the DDJ initiative, focused on ways to most effectively leverage state and local data.\n•      Connecticut will convene a special joint meeting of its Criminal Justice Policy and Oversight Committee (CJPAC) and the Sentencing Commission, and local law enforcement and government leadership, which will focus on DDJ and options for developing strong pre-arrest diversion programs.\n•      Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority and the Illinois Health & Hospital Associationwill collaborate to host a convening of participating and interested Illinois counties to help identify opportunities for engagement with hospitals and relevant stakeholders at the local level, and surface and share best practices to reduce hospital readmissions and preventable emergency-room visits, and improve health.\n•      The Oregon Criminal Justice Commission and Multnomah County will join Oregon counties in their Regional Implementation Councils to co-host a workshop on DDJ strategies, identifying ways to leverage the state's Justice Reinvestment efforts to reduce recidivism.\n•      The Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency and the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania (CCAP) will co-host a Data-Driven Justice focused discussion for the Courts and Corrections and Human Services Committees at the CCAP annual conference in August, 2016.\n•      The Rhode Island Governor's Office will work with state public safety agencies, health agencies, and the Rhode Island Innovative Policy Lab to convene state and local partners to discuss the adoption and implementation of data-driven criminal justice reform strategies.\n•      Salt Lake County Mayor Ben McAdams, together with the Utah Commission on Criminal and Juvenile Justice and the Sorenson Impact Center, will co-host a DDJ workshop at their annual Innovation Summit to be held in January 2017, for counties from across the nation interested in participating in DDJ.\nIf you would like to respond to the Call to Action, please go to: www.WhiteHouse.gov/DataDrivenJustice", "timestamp": "2016-06-30", "title": "Fact Sheet: Launching the Data-Driven Justice Initiative: Disrupting the Cycle of Incarceration"}

And I want to make sure that the American public are aware of what I'm going to be signing here today.\nThe first piece of legislation relates to the Freedom of Information Act. As all of you know, the Freedom of Information Act is one of the key ways in which citizens are able to find out what exactly is going on in Government. And the good news is, is that over the course of my Presidency, we have processed more FOIA requests—Freedom of Information requests—than ever before. And we have worked to make it easier and more transparent, putting more and more stuff online.\nBut having said all that, we're actually getting many more requests for FOIA than ever before. And so we've had to figure out ways that we can reform this to make it easier, faster, cheaper for people to get the information that they want.\nFortunately, Congress—on a bipartisan basis—has provided the tools, through legislation, to codify some of the reforms we've already made and to expand more of these reforms so that Government is more responsive. And I am very proud of all the work we've done to try to make Government more open and responsive, but I know that people haven't always been satisfied with the speed with which they're getting responses and requests. Hopefully, this is going to help, and it will be an important initiative for us to continue on the reform path.\nSo I'm going to sign that right now.\n[At this point, the President signed the bill.]\nThe second piece of legislation relates to the crisis that we're seeing in Puerto Rico. We've got millions of our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico who have been suffering under one of the worst financial crises, fiscal crises in memory. And as a consequence of the inability for them to restructure their debt, you've seen hospitals unable to operate, ambulances shutting down, basic services shutting down, and government workers not being paid. It has brought enormous hardship to Puerto Rico.\nThrough some amazing work by our Treasury Department, our legislative staff, and a bipartisan effort in both the House and the Senate, we finally have legislation that at least is going to give Puerto Rico the capacity, the opportunity to get out from under this lingering uncertainty with respect to their debt and start stabilizing government services and to start growing again.\nIt's not, in and of itself, going to be sufficient to solve all the problems that Puerto Rico faces, but it is a important first step on the path of creating more stability, better services, and greater prosperity over the long term for the people of Puerto Rico.\nSo I want to thank all four leaders in Congress for the hard work in getting this to my desk. And I want to let the people of Puerto Rico know that although there's still some tough work that we're going to have to do to dig Puerto Rico out of the hole that it's in, this indicates how committed my administration is to making sure that they get the help they need. And it's not going to stop here; we've got to keep on working to figure out how we promote the long-term growth and sustainability that's so desperately needed down there. But the people of Puerto Rico need to know that they're not forgotten, that they're part of the American family. And Congress's responsiveness to this issue—even though this is not a perfect bill—at least moves us in the right direction.\n[The President signed the bill.]\nOkay, thank you very much, everybody.", "timestamp": "2016-06-30", "title": "Remarks on Signing the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 and the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "This proclamation was published in the  Federal Register  on July 6.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117919", "text": "By the President of the United States of America\nA Proclamation\n1. On July 28, 2015, the United States and other Members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) issued a Declaration on the Expansion of Trade in Information Technology Products (Declaration), which established a framework for eliminating duties on certain information and communication technology products. These products include advanced semiconductors, medical equipment, and a range of audio and video equipment. The Declaration sets forth commitments for immediate or staged elimination of duties on the covered products, expanding on duty-elimination commitments set forth in the 1996 Declaration on Trade in Information Technology Products, which the United States implemented in Proclamation 7011 of June 30, 1997.\n2. On December 16, 2015, the United States and other WTO Members issued a Ministerial Declaration in which ministers endorsed the Declaration of July 28, 2015, and acknowledged that the conditions for implementation had been met.\n3. Section 111(b) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA) (19 U.S.C. 3521(b)) authorizes the President to proclaim the modification of any duty or staged rate reduction of any duty set forth in Schedule XX for products in tariff categories that were the subject of reciprocal duty elimination or harmonization negotiations during the Uruguay Round, if the United States agrees to such action in a multilateral negotiation under the auspices of the WTO, and after compliance with the requirements of section 115 of the URAA (19 U.S.C. 3524). The products covered by the Declaration were the subject of reciprocal duty elimination negotiations during the Uruguay Round, and the requirements of section 115 of the URAA have been met.\n4. Accordingly, pursuant to section 111(b) of the URAA, I have determined to proclaim modifications to the tariff categories and rates of duty set forth in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS), as set forth in Annexes I and II to this proclamation.\n5. Section 103(a) of the Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015 (TPEA) (Public Law 114-27) amended section 506B of the Trade Act of 1974 (the \"1974 Act\") (19 U.S.C. 2466b) and section 103(b)(1) amended section 112(g) of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) (19 U.S.C. 3721(g)), to provide that in the case of a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country, duty-free treatment provided under title V of the 1974 Act shall remain in effect through September 30, 2025.\n6. Accordingly, pursuant to section 506B of the 1974 Act and section 112(g) of the AGOA, I have determined that general note 16(c) of the HTS is modified by striking \"September 30, 2015\" and by inserting in lieu thereof \"September 30, 2025\".\n7. Section 103(b)(2) of the TPEA amended section 112(b)(3)(A) of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3721(b)(3)(A)) to extend the regional apparel article program and section 103(b)(3) of the TPEA amended section 112(c)(1) of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3721(c)(1)) to extend the third-country fabric program through September 30, 2025.\n8. Accordingly, pursuant to sections 112(b)(3)(A) and 112(c)(1) of the AGOA, I have determined that chapter 98, subchapter XIX, U.S. note 2(b) of the HTS is modified by striking \"September 30, 2015\" where stated in \"through the period October 1, 2014 through September 30, 2015\" and in \"each 1-year period thereafter through September 30, 2015\" and by inserting in lieu thereof \"September 30, 2025\".\n9. Section 104(c) of the TPEA authorizes the President to proclaim modifications that may be necessary to add the special tariff treatment symbol \"D\" in the \"Special\" subcolumn of the HTS for each article classified under a heading or subheading with the special tariff treatment symbol \"A\" or \"A*\" in the \"Special\" subcolumn of the HTS.\n10. Accordingly, pursuant to section 104(c) of the TPEA, I have determined it is necessary to add the special tariff treatment symbol \"D\" in the HTS as set forth in Annex III to this proclamation.\n11. Pursuant to sections 501 and 503(a)(1)(B) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2461 and 2463(a)(1)(B)), the President may designate certain articles as eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) when imported from a least-developed beneficiary developing country if, after receiving the advice of the United States International Trade Commission (Commission), the President determines that such articles are not import-sensitive in the context of imports from least-developed beneficiary developing countries.\n12. Pursuant to sections 501, 503(a)(1)(B), and 503(b)(5) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2461, 2463(a)(1)(b), and 2463(b)(5)), and after receiving advice from the Commission in accordance with section 503(e) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(e)), I have determined to designate certain articles as eligible articles when imported from a least-developed beneficiary developing country.\n13. Pursuant to sections 503(b)(1)(E) and 506A(b)(1) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(b)(1)(E) and 2466A(b)(1)), the President may designate certain articles as eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the AGOA when the articles are the growth, product, or manufacture of a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country if, after receiving the advice of the Commission, the President determines that such articles are not import-sensitive in the context of imports from beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries.\n14. Pursuant to sections 503(b)(1)(E) and 506A(b)(1) of the 1974 Act, and after receiving advice from the Commission in accordance with section 503(e) of the 1974 Act, I have determined to designate certain articles as eligible articles when the articles are the growth, product, or manufacture of a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country.\n15. Pursuant to section 503(c)(1) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(1)), the President may withdraw, suspend, or limit application of the duty-free treatment accorded to specified articles under the GSP when imported from designated beneficiary developing countries.\n16. Pursuant to section 503(c)(1) of the 1974 Act, and having considered the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(c)), I have determined to limit the application of duty-free treatment accorded to certain articles from certain beneficiary developing countries. 17. Section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(A)) provides that beneficiary developing countries, except those designated as least-developed beneficiary developing countries or beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries as provided in section 503(c)(2)(D) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(D)), are subject to competitive need limitations on the preferential treatment afforded under the GSP to eligible articles.\n18. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act, I have determined that in 2015 certain beneficiary developing countries exported eligible articles in quantities exceeding the applicable competitive need limitations, and I therefore terminate the duty-free treatment for such articles from such beneficiary developing countries.\n19. Section 503(c)(2)(F)(i) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(F)(i)) provides that the President may disregard the competitive need limitation provided in section 503(c)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(A)(i)(II)) with respect to any eligible article from any beneficiary developing country if the aggregate appraised value of the imports of such article into the United States during the preceding calendar year does not exceed an amount set forth in section 503(c)(2)(F)(ii) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(F)(ii)).\n20. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(F)(i) of the 1974 Act, I have determined that the competitive need limitation provided in section 503(c)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the 1974 Act should be disregarded with respect to certain eligible articles from certain beneficiary developing countries.\n21. Section 503(d)(1) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(d)(1)) provides that the President may waive the application of the competitive need limitations in section 503(c)(2) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)) with respect to any eligible article from any beneficiary developing country if certain conditions are met.\n22. Pursuant to section 503(d)(1) of the 1974 Act, I have received the advice of the Commission on whether any industry in the United States is likely to be adversely affected by waivers of the competitive need limitations provided in section 503(c)(2) of the 1974 Act, and I have determined, based on that advice and on the considerations described in sections 501 and 502(c) of the 1974 Act and after giving great weight to the considerations in section 503(d)(2) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(d)(2)), that such waivers are in the national economic interest of the United States. Accordingly, I have determined that the competitive need limitations of section 503(c)(2) of the 1974 Act should be waived with respect to certain eligible articles from certain beneficiary developing countries.\n23. Section 604 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2483) authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and of other Acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to section 111(b) of the URAA, section 506B of the 1974 Act, sections 112(g), 112(b)(3)(A), and 112(c)(1) of the AGOA, section 104(c) of the TPEA, and title V and section 604 of the 1974 Act, do proclaim that:\n(1) In order to provide for the immediate or staged elimination of duties on the information technology products covered by the Declaration, the HTS is modified as set forth in Annexes I and II to this proclamation;\n(2) In order to provide that duty-free treatment provided under the AGOA shall remain in effect through September 30, 2025, general note 16(c) of the HTS is modified by striking \"September 30, 2015\" and by inserting in lieu thereof \"September 30, 2025\";\n(3) In order to provide that the regional apparel article program and the third-country fabric program are effective through September 30, 2025, chapter 98, subchapter XIX, U.S. note 2 of the HTS is modified by striking \"September 30, 2015\" where stated in \"through the period October 1, 2014 through September 30, 2015\" and in \"each 1-year period thereafter through September 30, 2015\" and by inserting in lieu thereof \"September 30, 2025\";\n(4) In order to provide for the addition of the special tariff treatment symbol \"D\" in the \"Special\" subcolumn where necessary in the HTS, the HTS is modified as set forth in Annex III to this proclamation;\n(5) In order to designate certain articles as eligible articles only when imported from a least-developed beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP, the Rates of Duty 1-Special subcolumn for the corresponding HTS subheadings is modified as set forth in Annex IV to this proclamation;\n(6) In order to designate certain articles as eligible articles only when imported from a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country for purposes of the AGOA, the Rates of Duty 1 Special subcolumn for the corresponding HTS subheadings is modified as set forth in Annex IV to this proclamation;\n(7) In order to provide that one or more countries should no longer be treated as beneficiary developing countries with respect to one or more eligible articles for purposes of the GSP, the Rates of Duty 1-Special subcolumn for the corresponding HTS subheadings and general note 4(d) to the HTS are modified as set forth in sections A and B of Annex V to this proclamation;\n(8) The modifications to the HTS set forth in Annex V to this proclamation shall be effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the dates set forth in the relevant sections of Annex V to this proclamation;\n(9) The competitive need limitation provided in section 503(c)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the 1974 Act is disregarded with respect to the eligible articles in the HTS subheadings and to the beneficiary developing countries listed in Annex VI to this proclamation, effective July 1, 2016;\n(10) A waiver of the application of section 503(c)(2) of the 1974 Act shall apply to the articles in the HTS subheadings and to the beneficiary developing countries set forth in Annex VII to this proclamation, effective July 1, 2016; and\n(11) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-06-30", "title": "Proclamation 9466—To Implement the World Trade Organization Declaration on the Expansion of Trade in Information Technology Products and for Other Purposes"}
